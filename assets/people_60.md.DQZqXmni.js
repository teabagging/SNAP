Unpolished, poor gongfu spoils the good parts. The ending is especially weak... the sudden appearance of \\"string\\" aided stunts makes it laughable in a bad way. The lack of a good villian is sure to kill any decent movie, and the bad guys are really subpar in Tai Chi II.Likewise, I am unimpressed with the storyline... it starts off as a \\"girl-meets-boy\\" who already has boyfriend plot and tries to become an old vs. new China (opium wars) flick. Additionally, the young kungfu master goes through no personal jouney (training/failure/rivalry) - I guess I just didnt find it too interesting.Pass and buy another one in the TAI CHI series."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you'll only read one book on Islam, let it be THIS ONE!","review":"An honest look at Islam, from a man who - as a Muslim - hungered for more.

The extras looked promising and I was looking forward to a much crisper version than my dvd could provide. The transfer is awful I want to say that my dvd copy looked better, it was very grainy at times and not crisp at all. I realize this is an older film but seriously this transfer was bad. I am not an expert on clarity or quality by any means but if it looks worse than the dvd something is wrong.The extras included a fun little making of feature with cast interviews from while it was being filmed. I love the movie and just expected more from this release. Wait for a better transfer before upgrading from dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon needs to work on their buffering.","review":"Let me begin by saying that there is nothing wrong with this movie. I had to watch it for a class, and my classmates and I rented it off of Amazon. The movie kept buffering every few minutes, so we would let it \\"sit and buffer.\\" Then it would just do it again and we had to wait... again. Finally one of the girls went on Google and searched to \\"watch Parenthood the movie for free.\\" We then watched it with no problems. No buffering. Better quality of picture too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Story of Life","review":"I'd forgotten how wonderfully fun this movie is.

It's a great story for the family. The all star cast adds to the enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Laughed a Lot...","review":"Parenthood in 1989 is one of the most enjoyable movies of all time and probably one of Steve Martin's best. The movie consists of multiple scenarios as seen in Cocoon series also done by Ron Howard. Particularly I like Rick Moranis part, a father who is trying to bring up a brainy kid. The movie has traditional style of twists and dramatic upturns convincing us that our life is as dramatic as Indie Jones series. But some ending parts are so full of overproductions so I sometimes get tired. Ron should have put focus on one or two not four or five. That being said, I love Ron Howard movies in general and look forward to see the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in \\"Widescreen?\\"","review":"This is one of my top twenty movies of all time.

I hope the distributer of this DVD gets copies of all these reviews and then thinks twice about the next movie he \\"butchers\\" by releasing it in a \\"Pan-Scan\\" format on a DVD because he just lost a lot of sales due to the lack of a widescreen version of this DVD and \\"I am sad to say I'm one of those lost sales\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opie Has Grown Up","review":"This Ron Howard celebration of family proves once and for all, that \\"Opie\\" has indeed grown up.

Mary Steenburgen, Jason Robards, Dianne Wiest and a lot of other names, familiar and otherwise, are all perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why screw up such a great movie with a pan/scan DVD?","review":"It is unacceptable, in 2004, to have any film released on DVD without a widescreen version at least on the other side of the disc. Shameful. This is such a great film. But remember, you're only seeing about 2/3rds of it since the studio chopped off the left and right sides for you.Totally unacceptable.

Delivered on time and as promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parenthood","review":"A wonderful family movie with laughs abound. The cast did an excellent job in imitating America's dysfunctional families.Reeves is funny, but then, I enjoy most of his movies. Steve Martin is once again a \\"top\\" form.

It also has a lot of comedy added in the mix of it, so it makes the film that much more enjoyable. I have loved this movie since I was a kid, and I still love it today! The only reasons I rated the 'product' 4 stars is because it has not been released in a WIDESCREEN version! I am not a fan of full screen! I actually like to watch the whole movie, so if this one is ever released as a wide screen, I will be buying it again! I always have family member I can give the other version to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cool","review":"I really like this movie, but buying it on DVD is misleading.

Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude","review":"It seems the only thing that kept this movie from being rated R is the lack of nudity. Full of off-color humor and situations that will have you reaching for the remote when kids are around.

Not the the family movie it appears to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum Idiocy","review":"If pointless humor is your thing then this is the movie for you! Probably the best place for this movie is in a dark box where box where young people could not entertain any wrong ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow manages to be both superificial and pretentious.","review":"Every moment of Parenthood rings false. Neither Lowell Ganz nor Babaloo Mandel is a very good screenwriter; together, they are usually appalling, and never more so than here. The movie pretends to \\"cover\\" a wealth of parenting difficulties and fails to treat any of them in any but the most superificial, predictable ways. Ron Howard's direction is consistently inept; time after time he fails to find the emotional heart of a scene. A fine movie could have been made with this much acting talent, but not in the hands of these writers and this director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, a better DVD for this wonderful movie","review":"I agree with other viewers that \\"Parenthood\\" deserves a better DVD version -- with letterbox presentation, special features, commentaries etc... And next time, in the \\"cast and crew\\" bonus material, please add Harley Jane Kozak who gave a very nice performance as Susan -- wife of Nathan, Rick Moranis' character. (If you want to see more of Harley Jane Kozak and how good of an actress she can be, watch \\"The Favor\\", another wonderful comedy). Some reviewer even mistook her for Martha Plimpton who played Julie (Dianne Wiest's daughter in this movie). Martha herself is a great actress too, don't miss her other films like \\"200 Cigarettes\\", \\"Samantha\\", and most of all, \\"Beautiful Girls\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This One!","review":"This is an episodic yarn of one family(and I mean all the relatives too! )and the trials and tribulations of raising children.I am single,31 and have no kids so maybe I cannot directly relate, but this is a heartwarming story that left me with lumps in my throat and tears in my eyes. Ensemble acting is wonderful with Jason Robards(who looks like he could be Martin's father in real-life!)as the patriarch commenting that \\"you never cross the goal line......\\" The film works on 2 levels. There is some on target comedy(especially in one fantasy sequence)and there are some genuine serious scenes that deal with real life problems. It is a perfect mix that results in one heckuva ride. I shall close by listing the cast because a good cast is worth repeating:Steve Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Diane Wiest, Rick Moranis, Harley Jane Kozak, Jason Robards, Thomas Hulce, Leaf Phoenix,Martha Plimpton,and Dennis Dugan(I probably forgot someone, and Oh yes that is Ronny's bro in little league scene!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Overlook This One!","review":"If you're a fan of Tamora Pierce's Tortall books or Sherwood Smiths Wren or Mel stories, you're likely to enjoy this book. I've read so many fantasy novels now that couldn't meet my standards, but this book wove it's way in to my favorites.A loyal and determined heroine, cool hunting cats, mysteries of who is friend and enemy, and a truelly engaging plot make this one of the most enjoyable stories I have read.The readers are shown the feelings and intentions of many characters without the story straying much from Rilsin's point of view. It's written beautifully with the perfect amount of action and detail. Do not pass this by!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sword but no sorcery","review":"Rilsin, the last remaining heir to the Saeditin throne, swears fealty to her cousin Sithli after her cousin's family seizes power in a bloody coup. The two girls grow up together, and Sithli becomes SaeKet(queen) while Rilsin becomes her first minister and commander of Saeditin's northern armies. Rilsin watches helplessly as her cousin misrules the country, bringing Saeditin to the brink of war within her borders and without. The burden of responsibility falls upon Rilsin when she is forced to make the choice between risking everything she loves in a rebellion against her cousin or keeping her vow to remain loyal. This book has politics, a love triangle, battles, sword fights, a wicked queen, a heroic hunting cat, and even an explosion or two. I wish that the relationship between Sola, an inventor and Rilsin's childhood friend, and Rilsin were developed more, but I recommend this book as a quick and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews that I had read. Overall it had reviewed well. After reading this book it was .... disappointing .... The writting style was annoying jumping here and there. Compeltly disjointed with no flow thru the story. The story itself was simplistic. Almost as if the author had followed a formula \\"How to write a book in 30-days\\". If you must have this book, save yourself the money and find it in a used bookstore. I am sure it will be there, as this is not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!

For the sake of all those disappointed souls who will actually buy this book, I just have to say that Amazon has at least 1000 books in this genre that are much, much better.I suggest that this book does not reach expectations of the publisher's comments. I just didn't get into this so called adventure story - ghost story - psychological thriller; perhaps that's the author's problem. Trying to make it too many things at once and only slightly succeeding. I cannot recommend it with so many other greater choices available. I'm always suspect when I see only maximum star ratings in a row?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great of a read","review":"I finally burned through this book seeing it to the end. Peter is a decent enough person who has led a difficult life. The tragic loss of his mother is obviously a heavy burden to bear and over rides a lot of this book, as is his father's giant presence and shadow. Essentially though the premise of the entire expedition was flawed by the bad judgement of not really knowing his companions - and going only with two others. In the world of expeditions - three is a bad number. I know from experience. Hillary seems to shrug off his responsibility here and puts it on the others. In general a mediocre book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Tale","review":"This tale set on an epic trip to the South Pole, Peter Hillary displays the wonderful story telling skills of the classic adventurer. This books enjoys not only a great adventure, but flash backs to a lifetime of adventure from the great mountains of the world.

I wasn't excited for long, because I looked down and she was SOAKED with formula! I really wish they didn't leak because I have been trying to get her to drink juice out of a bottle, but she won't.

I tried making sure that the hole was open, etc. but no matter what, they do not work. I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased these at a Wal-Mart store, but I did not keep the package, so I cannot return them. This was a big waste of money! I used a lot of Luv N Care products with my other two children.

My recent additions are a 40MB Compact Flash, and CalliGrapher handwriting recognizer-the built in JOT was good but this one is the Best. I plan to add the modem and other software soon. The only drawback is the screen view in low light conditions. Its excellent in moderate to bright light; in very very dim light, the back light with an optional reversibility in its LCD image can't be beat. However, lighting thats between these is hard to read. The best viewing overall is with 4 shades of gray mode for indoor lighting, outdoors in sunlight, 16 shades is good. Its best feature overall is its size, about as thin as the Palm V and weighs about the same too!

Songs like Flowers, This Time, Too many women and of course the electricly charged leadoff song Sugar Sweet swirled through my body with a combination of uplifting swings and smooth melodies. The cd and upcoming Building A Brand New World Tour were just the beginning of what SoulPhood and its artists were planning for the airwaves.

The Flintstones overflowed with goofy sentimentality to the point of being sickenly sweet. Halfway through the movie I was ready to vomit pure sugar. I did like the scenery. It reproduces the bright colors and fanciful stone age setting of the cartoon series. John Goodman and Rick Moranis did a good job trying hard to salvage the sappy script they were given. I would have liked to have seen anyone other than Rosie O'donnell in this film. Who told her she could act? One other thing I found strange was Halle Berry with her 1990's buzzcut hairstyle.

If this is the best Monk KIdd can do after \\"Bees\\" then she should spare us all and quit now. My big questions are 1. How many times does this plot line need to be written and unfortunately published? 2. Why is it authors can come up with no other way for a middleaged women to \\"find herself\\" than to have an affair with an unavailabe man? Dissapointing?

Well written, but more of a romance/pulp piece than a good read.

I normally do not buy hardcover, but I was so excited to read this that I splurged. Not only did I waste money on this book, I also wasted time. Reading it was like a punishment I had to endure. I kept waiting for the good part of the novel to come. I was sure it would and then all of a sudden I was done. The ending is ridiculously simplistic with no one having any repurcussions of their actions. It seems as though the novel was thrown together quickly. A few of the things are just so far fetched. Preserving a finger in rubbing alcohol??? I can't even call it a romance novel because I did not even feel the slighest tingling at the romantic descriptions in the book. This book is a dishonor to women who honor their vows and cherish their husbands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this book as I enjoyed the Secret Life of Bees so much. However, I ended up very disppointed. I finished the book, but wanted it to end quickly. I think what I disliked most was the main character, Jessie. For me, she is believable at first with regard to her history, her mother and issues with her husband. The whole whirlwind, selfish, infatuation with a monk, whom she met briefly 1 or 2 times and immediately fell IN LOVE with was too unbelievable to me. The fact that he's a monk doesn't come much into play for her, which is also somewhat bogus for me. Although I'm probably in the minority, I think that the book could have been written and made interesting w/o the whole affair w/the monk. The issues with her father's death and her mother were the real interesting part for me, the rest unbelievable. Disappointing ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately, a waste of time","review":"I had high hopes for this book, having loved The Secret Life of Bees.

The author seemed to gather what she thought would be interesting ideas (a monk, a mermaid chair, the Gullah culture), and then wrote about them unconvincingly. I was left with the impression of catchy ideas patchworked together, rather than insights upwelling from her experience. I suppose the self-absorption of her main characters was a disappointment as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved \\"Secret Life of Bees\\", but I could not get into this one.

I found I couldn't relate to any of the characters and I didn't like the protagonist, finding her self-indulgent, immature, and weak for most of the book.

A shiny golden cover illustrated with pink seashells was the first tip-off, followed shortly by reading in the newspaper that the story had turned into a Lifetime original movie. Pass the bon-bons!Throughout the novel, I kept wincing at Kidd's word choice (or lack thereof). Everything was slide, slid, sliding (especially the monks hands on Jessie's body.) I was surprised that the author of a book I really liked (Bees, of course) could write so poorly.The one redeeming feature of this book is Kidd's description of the natural beauty of the island. It is here, and only here, where she shows any talent at her craft. You can tell that Kidd is intimately acquainted with (and deeply fond of) the setting of her story. I felt like I was there. The rest, I'm sad to say, was sorely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"What a disappointing follow up to her wonderful novel Secret Life of Bees.

The occasional chapter written in third person is a cop out, the \\"climax\\" could not be any more anti-climactic, and the ending is another cop out. Kidd might as well had Jessie dream the whole thing.

Yes, in the old days, I am sure there were saints that did maim themselves in the name of God, but you need to look into the culture back then. Also a saint is a ordinary person, they are human with all faults. The reason they are a saint is their extraordinary love for God. Making the comparison to the story about a mermaid is disheartending.Second, we live in a culture of death. An idea of a assisted suicide in a church with the clergy present is tasteless.If one is going to write with a religious slant, why would one do it in a derogatory way?

I did wonder why Jessie's mother didn't ease the burden of guilt Jessie carried for her father's death, instead letting her grow up under a crippling weight of self blame.

Called back to care for her mother, Jessie is also running away from what she deems her mundane, repetitive and predictable married life.Egret Island is also the home of a Benedictine monastary where Jessie falls in love with Brother Thomas. Questions of her past, present and future bombard Jessie and difficult choices need to be made.I truly enjoyed this book and fell into the culture, so well written, of Egret Island. This is great story of the relationship between mother and dauther, the friendship of three women that transcends time, and a woman who is, in her fourties, still searching for her true self, only now realizing this self needs finding."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaids Chair","review":"I feel I wasted my time reading this book. I don't and haven't recommended it to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and predictable","review":"While I liked \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" I was not wowed by it like other readers. I felt that Sue Monk Kidd was a very good writer with a keen eye for description, but less successful at creating an emotional plot that rang true and poignant - not overly sentimental.I borrowed \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" from a friend, and am glad I did not buy it myself. This book is even more hopelessly sentimental than Sue Monk Kidd's first effort. Kidd's tendency to romanticize the confusion and heartache of a woman searching for her identity is tedious at best, maddening at worst. While the book is filled with beautiful, lush descriptions of island life and the stark beauty of faith and yearning, her \\"romance genre\\" conventions and predictable stock characters (such as the \\"colorful native\\" Hepzibah) bog down the plot and make \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" a superficial and unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"yucky love story","review":"Someone on here posted that this book should not be read right after reading \\"Bees\\"...and they were right. i think that is where I made my mistake in reading this book, but i dont think i would have liked it regardless. First off the characters are unbeivable and unlovable. the monk whit was really out there, i mean his wife dies and he becomes a monk??? what is up with that. I have known many people who have lost loved one and went through periods of total devastation, but not ONE considered becoming a monk or a nun...sooooooo lame. And Jessie is a not likable at all and comes across as a spoiled, bitchy women. The love story was not even that hot, i mean a married women sleeping with a monk and you would think the sex scenes would ahve been more passionate. None of the characters appealed to me and I watched 10 minuets of the liftime movie and was DONE with this story. P.S what was up with Kim Bassingers hair????"},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least the Cover is Pretty","review":"I am so sorry that I did not wait a little longer to buy this book. The early reviews were all 5 stars and I went for it. What a waste of $17.00. I am still trying to figure out why so many people have liked this book. I think the book sends a bad message - there seem to be no ramifications suffered for murder, an affair, nor a monk going against his vows of celibacy. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel diminished after reading this book","review":"Received the book for Christmas. Should have read these reviews and then regifted it. Instead I wasted hours of my life that I will never get back. As an insipid harlequin romance it's bad enough, but the shallow, ignorant, cavalier way the author presumes to depict matters of faith repelled me. And I'm an ATHEIST. I can only imagine what a CATHOLIC would feel about monks assisting in mercy killings and committing adultery with the winking \\"disapproval\\" of the other monks. WTF?!?! And as a 41yo woman in a committed marriage who is mature enough to realize that struggling with boredom and disillusionment is part of the growth process and should be embraced, I squirmed in embarrassment at Jessie's immature, impulsive, selfish, completely vacuous manner of dealing with those same issues. Come on! This book feels like it was written by a 20yo trying to imagine what life will be like at 40."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was tricked!","review":"Wow, I read Secret Life of Bees where the author's special knack shines through, every single inch of the way. Then I spy this pretty book with it's pretty title on the library shelf by the same author and my heart goes pitty-pat, because I KNOW I'm in for a spoon-fed treat. But alas, as I turn the pages I not-too-slowly wake up to the dreary reality: I am wasting the space in my brain with every word I take in. It is all hogwash and has already been very accurately described as such by many of these other reviewers here.

However, unlike her first work Ms. Kidd leaves readers shaking their heads. There is no good reason explained as to why this woman up and leaves her husband. The fact that she has an affair with a monk immediately after is that much more confusing and distasteful.

It had no soul, the writing was contrived (were these books really written by the same author?), no characters were fleshed out (thus one didn't care about any of them), and the world of mermaids and monks was downright silly.

Boy, was I disappointed. The story was boring, the main character shallow (come on, falling for the love of her life after seeing him once?) and there was no real reason for her \\"need\\" to leave a devoted, loving husband. The book seemed like a cheap romance novel. I would not recommend this book to ANYone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MY TIME","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers who are greatly disappointed in Sue Monk Kidd for giving us such a trashy read! Yes, it is a poor version of The Ya Ya Sisterhood. No depth of character (although the characters who were introduced could have had some depth), sleazy affair with a monk that is just totally stupid, main character is not likeable, introduction of unrelated images and ideas that lead nowhere, just thrown together.

Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Remarkable","review":"Throughout the course of this book, I felt I kept waiting for something to happen. If you read the summary, you pretty much have it there. I found the story to be predictable; a short story lengthened into a novel by adding superfluous descriptions.I also had a problem with the mermaid subtext. It would take A LOT more convincing for me to believe that there was actually a monastery that would process back and forth from the ocean with a \\"mermaid chair,\\" sprinkling it with seawater in some sort of mystical ceremony.I found Kidd's writing trite, as if she tried too hard to create a spirtual setting. Her descriptions are, frankly, not very creative, and her characters, stereotyped. I was disappointed, like most, who enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees.It's a quick read, but still time better spent reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring journey through one woman's self-indulgence","review":"I awaited this book with great anticipation, having loved The Secret Life of Bees. What a let down! To be fair, I am agnostic so the religious and spiritual angst was a yawner. But the entire book put me to sleep -- boring, colorless, self-absorbed characters; boring, pedantic, colorless dialogue (what there is of it; most of the book is navel-inspecting narrative); boring, colorless, done-to-death plot; a woman who, even after her \\"journey\\" appears to define herself through a man; a \\"surprise\\" ending that is figured out in the early pages -- surely there are better books with which to spend your time. A huge disappointment from a talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"Having loved the Secret Life of Bees, I bought this novel without hesitation, and was extremely disappointed. The story itself had promise, but the prose was overwritten, full of cliches, and totally devoid of the subtle, finely-wrought language and characters that made her previous novel such a joy to read. I can't help but think that this one was turned in half-baked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the Extreme","review":"How I would like my money and my time back. While Kidd's effort may be effective on some level, it pales in comparison to The Secret Life of Bees. This unfortunate second effort must surely be an attempt to cash in on the fame and reputation of Kidd's initial success. Read Mermaid's Chair only if you are entertained by shallow characters walking through a predictable and mundane story that insults women every where. A sad follow-up to the enchanting story of the calendar sisters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book - Not a Page Turner","review":"I loved the Secret Life of Bees. It was a real page turner.

I finally took it down and read it, and while I will agree that is was no Secret Life of Bees, I thought that it was pretty good. It is not an uncommon tale, although I am not that far from the main characters age, and I would not have conducted my life as she did, I know some women who would and who would handle the situation as she did. A quick and light read. Not so sure as to the reason for all the outrage. It's just fiction, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her first...","review":"I really enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees and was hoping to like this one as well. This book left me WAAAAY wishing I hadn't read it.Let's just start by saying the main character, Jessie, is a middle aged woman. I just can't bring myself to think of the name Jessie as that belonging to a middle aged woman. Perhaps that's just me? But Jessie has the perfect life... a gorgeous house, great daughter, handsome, caring husband. And yet she finds that she has lost \\"herself\\"? It just doesn't seem plausible to me.So she has a crazy mother, who is barely described and you just can't even come up with a mental picture of her. There's a slight backstory about Jessie's issues with her fathers death but only the surface is really touched upon and it doesn't give our heroine the backstory the book needs.This one just really fell short for me. I won't go into huge detail cause I don't want to spoil it if you are wanting this book. But for me it fell dramatically short of my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too much flowery metaphor and retrospection","review":"I couldn't finish this book. The subject of a middle-aged woman running from her completely normal life and having an affair with a monk is a ridiculous notion to support. The book is poorly written with one long, boring, flowery metaphor after another. The main character waxes philosophic over every minute of her past and is just wretched with wanting what she can't or shouldn't have.This book reminds me of the stories that my juvenile mind in 7th grade creative writing class came up with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding yourself","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I found the narrator's quest for herself and ultimately her independence sweet, enlightening and endearing. I don't necessarily agree with some of her actions...but who are we to judge? The book is not about her infidelity, but more about finding peace within one's self and spirituality outside of sitting in a church pew and receiving communion. I think Sue Monk Kidd is a beautiful writer whose views on where we find love and how family plays into who we are unique and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic, unsatisfying story","review":"This novel has a few redeeming themes, settings, and characters, but overall, it's choppy, forced, problematic. In order to be believable, there would have to be about 3 or 4 times the plot development and detail. Seems to be attempting to follow the same formula as \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" but is far less successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and slow","review":"I listened to this book on audio, and really didn't care for it.

The attraction between the two main characters is unexplained and flat, and who cares about them anyway? The mother with psychiatric problems isanalyzed in an amateurish way. The book was entirely predictable. The mermaid theme is strained and artificial feeling, a layer that adds no nuance except to fill pages. This might have made a good short story, that's the best I can say for it. This reminded me of The Time Traveler's Wife, a book similarly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"'The Secret Life of Bees' is my favourite book. As such, I was very excited to purchase and read 'The Mermaid Chair'. I just finished it, and I was very disappointed. Although the end does have some redeeming features, I felt the rest of the book read more like a Harlequin romance -- something I don't read! I found the story and writing too deliberate and forced. Without giving too much away, I also thought the explanation of Nelle's behaviour and the description of incidents surrounding Jesse's dad to be very weak. The end or 'resolution' wrapped up far too quickly, and too easily. At least save your money and wait for the paperback. Or, get it from the library, if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"Sue Monk Kidd is too good of a writer to come up with such an obviously contrived piece of pulp fiction. It is apparent that she just whipped something up quickly to capitalize on the success of her previous book, The Secret Life of Bees, which was very well written, if a bit tiresome. All that honey got too sweet and too sticky. But The Mermaid Chair is simply bad writing. She can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived imagery, but a great setting","review":"The Mermaid's Chair didn't draw me in. The plot was rather standard with bizzare elements like a compulsion to chop one's finger off guilt for a drammatic death sort of tacked on. I was eager to read about the area where this was set, but everthing felt so contrived that I couldn't really buy the story or the characters. The affair with the monk seemed unlikely piled upon contrived. I was not a huge fan of The Secret Lives of Bees either, but it was better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I read this book because I had couldn't get \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" and thought perhaps this book would be just as good. I have yet to read the \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" but this book is nothing to rave about. I felt the plot was weak and too much time was spent on description of location of the story.

When an author has to manufacture a character to explain a sticky part in a plot-in this case a retarded woman with insight-or constant dreams, you know you have a very poor book on your hands. Also, not once did Jessie ever wonder about her own culpability with her father's condition. And falling in love that quickly with a monk? The description of their charged glances is worthy of the Romance genre. And when she details what is annoying about her own husband the list is so miniscule it defies belief why it was even there. I'm sorry I wasted money and time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another charming story from Ms. Kidd","review":"The Mermaid Chair is very interesting, well written, with just enough mystery to keep readers hooked.

I had a hard time finishing this book, I kept thinking, \\"it has to get better\\" but it never did. With lines directly from any one of those books with the half naked women on the front the story is just pathetic. Don't waste your money unless you love Daniel Steel style novels (she was beautiful but didn't know it, he was a monk in training with eyes like denim). Such a HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't get through this book!","review":"It's been 3 months since I started this book and I've just decided that I can't take it anymore. This book is about a woman going through a midlife crisis who wants to leave her husband, who is intelligent, handsome, successful, kind and loves her very much, for a MONK! How can I have any sympathy for someone like this? If it were a man who was having an affair, this would be even more unacceptable. I find nothing appealing, romantic or likable about this woman or this story. Luckily I didn't pay for this book - because it is not even worth the one cent someone is selling it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing follow up to Bees","review":"I loved The Secret Life of Bees. I had high hopes for this novel as a result, but it was a disappointment.The characters were uncompelling. The only ones I found remotely interesting were a couple of the monks, and they were used peripherally and in bizarre ways to move the plot along.Although I had to force myself to plough through the story, the plot marched along at such a quick pace that events were happening in a way that seemed forced and unreal.The author doesn't seem to know if she wanted to write a story about female friendship, forbidden love, guilt and madness, or mid-aged crisis/renewal. The fact that she attempts all at once just makes for a really weak, unsatisfying story.Finally, the imagery in the novel seemed too obvious and not nearly as lyrical and beautiful as in her previous story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rush to publish on the shirt-tail of Secret Life of Bees???","review":"I bought this book just because I loved Monk Kidd's SECRET LIFE OF BEES, a beautifully crafted book, and knew this was an author I wanted to follow. What a letdown! I was rolling my eyes as I read thinking, oh please! The plot, unlike SECRET, is paper thin, poorly developed, thus, barely believable. While I can relate to Jessie's midlife crisis, nothing that actually happened is credible or understandable. The shifts to the mind of the monk and later the husband were a disjointing and rather ineffective technique--nothing was accomplished and I ended up understanding none of the characters. I cannot believe the editors actually let this book go to print as is, and I cannot believe Monk Kidd would stoop to publishing a harlequin romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mermaid Chair","review":"Very disappointing.

It plods along with the reader being told to believe that a woman goes to takes care of her \\"sick\\" mother but all she does for her is bandage her a few times a day and doesn't get the woman help until it's almost too late. The mom is going insane! An idiot could see that! Jessie is a psychiatrist's wife for goodness sake, so she has no excuse. The reason for the ignoring of her mother I think is simple though....she's much too busy having an instant affair with a wannabe monk. I can't feel happy for an adulterer and her accomplice. The other characters are cliche, silly and boring but we're supposed to like them because they have a secret.

The heroine's lover was milquetoast, at best. The mother was brutal, to the point of self-mutilation, an act which was never explained to my satisfaction. Even the mother's sidekick had issues. Nothing fit for me. . .except the heroine's cuckolded husband. He didn't deserve the betrayal.The actual story of the mermaid chair was more interesting that the people it effected.

After loving \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" and passing it on enthusiastically to friends and family, I was so looking forward to reading \\"The Mermaid Chair.\\" This just can't be the same author who wrote \\"Bees.\\" It is very nearly a formula-written romance about an affair between a bored, middle-aged woman and a monk, of all things! I could almost see the \\"heaving bosom, bodice ripping\\" stereotyped characters. Yes, I did \\"get\\" the point of the story, and, yes, such feelings could arise, but at the very first sighting?? Between such characters in these circumstances? Ms Kidd jumped into the whole premise with no buildup at all. Give readers credit for being unable to suspend their disbelief, something I do very easily with the help of writers and movie-makers. So, I did make it to the end, but closed the book, shaking my head, thinking, \\"Who wrote this thing?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaid Chair","review":"Truly awful!

It is shallow, the characters are ABSURD (except for the husband, Hugh...he was the only reason I wanted to keep reading!). I am 22 and this book was written for a much older audience (or at least an audience who has been married, etc etc) but I thought it was dull, unrealistic, and very far fetched. To me, the best part about books is taking something relatively normal and writing a story about it--that way, readers can relate. To me, there was nothing relatable about this book and it was lame....I haven't read her first, so I will just to be fair although I am not excited about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't care for this book","review":"I read it through only to find out why Nelle, her mother, did what she did but honestly...the affair story bugged the stew out of me. I didn't care for Jessie and my heart broke for her husband, Hugh. I was disgusted when reading the affair storyline which is the majority of the book. Her reasoning for breaking her husband's heart were poor. And I thought she was extremely presumptuous in just assuming the monk loved her too. It never leapt off the page at me that they instantly fell in love, I never felt that between them. I absolutely loved The Secret Life of Bees so I was excited to read this book but was highly disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I had high expectations after reading The Secret Life of Bees, but this book disappointed the reader about half way through the novel.

Otherwise it consists of poor character development and improbable situations which become unbelievable near the end of the book. I only finished it because I kept hoping it would improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully disappointing","review":"I had SUCH high hopes, only to find a book that is nothing but middle-aged chick lit. The only reason this is two stars rather than one, is that Ms. Monk Kidds' descriptions of the island are really lovely. Otherwise, it is the same anguished blah-blah of so many other novels. Give the main character (whose name escapes me, only one day after finishing the book!) a prescription for zoloft and hormone replacement therapy and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a tough act to follow","review":"The Secret Life of Bees is one of my favorite books, and I have been waiting anxiously for this novel to arrive. While Sue Monks Kidd is a talented writer, there is a huge hole in the story regarding the main character's life-long guilt, fostered by her own mother's lies. I kept waiting for the main character to confront her mother and hash it out, but it never really happens. The fact that a young child could be left to harbor such guilt while the mother just plods along selfishly is just too unappealing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This plot is so tired. The bored housewife, has an affair, \\"finds herself\\" and is magically inspired to paint again. Returns to her adoring husband who takes the blame for the affair because he \\"failed her\\". It's unrealistic, sexist (imagine if the character was a man - he would be viewed as a scumbag) and so over the top. Everyone has bored times in their marriage, you don't need to go have an affair to \\"find yourself\\". Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me count the cliches....","review":"A desperate housewife, a mysterious stranger with a tragic past, a crazy old woman, an assortment of eccentric, irascible but warmhearted southern women with cute names, interminable water imagery (drowning, eroticism, rebirth), an ending reminiscent of Daphne Du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\", and dialogue out of a grade B romance (\\"He pulled the leather cord over his head, letting the cross drop to the ground...'I've wanted you from the beginning'\\"), and as overstuffed with metaphors,similies and psychobabble as a plump girl overflows her low-rise jeans.And for this I payed $25.00?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How coud she?","review":"I have been a fan of Sue Monk Kidd for some time ,having read her books on spirituality and her essays and The Secret Life of Bees. That being said, I cannot believe how easily she fell from content to sappy-trendy. The concept of mid-life angst is far from new. I do not believe however that in real life, the consequences of actions for SOME people are nada and zilch. Or that it is of no consequence to betray those we love. How sad. And how disapointing.It is interesting to me that while we are to feel for the child that Jesse was, we should have little or no feeling for Hugh or her own daughter. It does not wash for me and seems to be a little paon to all that is bankrupt in the prevailing culture . Surely we can experinence growth without stamping on others.Or making them less important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not nearly as satisfying as \\"Secret Life of Bees\\". I found the main character vapid and annoying. However, the plot development and final revelation was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"First novel just did too well...","review":"I have nothing against Sue Monk Kidd--she is a good writer. Although I was not nuts about SECRET LIFE OF BEES--this one makes the former seem to be masterful by comparison. At least there was heart and sincerity in SECRET...this is just a mishmash of concepts thrown about and again as others have also stated, there are the implausibility issues (I saw some of this with SECRET--but it's a bit worse here.) The mermaid chair is just not a believable object in this context. Just as the three nice black ladies opening their home and everything esle to these strangers is not so believable. But BEES did have charm and a warmth that so many readers responded to. The characters were likable! Not so--this."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This book was a major disappointment. I really disliked the main character,I thought she was selfish and immature. I don't believe Sue Monk Kidd could quite figure out what the thrust of the book should be. It was too formula and cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad...","review":"After reading Sue Monk Kidd's previous brilliant work \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" I have to admit my expectations were fairly high. Not only was I disappointed in \\"The Mermaid Chair,\\" I genuinely felt let down. Ms. Kidd should have rested on her laurels rather than embark on such a boldly inferior effort. Alas, her publishing company didn't even do her (or us) the favor of pulling it before it got to the bookshelves.The \\"plot\\" drug hopelessly on, the characters were flat and the book on the whole failed to develop. Every one of the characters could have taken a flying leap off a cliff and I would have applauded.The reputation of her former work alone is not enough to make up for this drab and lifeless novel. Frankly, it's sad, because this author is capable of so much more. Don't waste your money. If you must, check it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doens't even come close to Secret Life of Bees","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I have a hard time believing it was even written by the same author as Secret Life of Bees (which was excellent).The story line just wasn't believable, and I felt the author was trying way too hard with symbolism. Bad attempts at depth and symbolism, usually equals cheesy and corny, and this was the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sit this one out, no pun intended.","review":"After reading \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" and not particularily loving it, I decided to try Kidd's newer novel, figuring there has to be something to a bestseller. Boy, was I wrong. This was worse, far worse.Kidd's descriptions of the southeast coastline of the United States are the best things this book has to offer. The story is weak, the characters lack credibility, and it was torture getting to the end. Perhaps, if Kidd had focused on the storyline about the relationship Jessie, a middle-aged frustrated artist, had with her father when she was a young girl, I would have cared a bit more about what happened to them in the end. Kidd describes a scene where as a young girl Jessie's father peels an apple for her, leaving the peel intact, calling her his Whirly Girl and from this we're supposed to feel an undying love and connection that lasts a lifetime.Sit this one out, no pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"This is a completely implausible tale, with poor character development, shallow portrayals of both marital & extramarital love, and unsympathetic characters. Need I say more?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad","review":"This book was a complete disappointment. While Sue Monk Kidd's Secret Life of Bees was vivid and imaginative, this book was contrived, unbelievable, and Harlequin romance-esque. The whole premise that this middle-aged woman caught in the middle of a family crisis would spy a robed monk and the two would instantly fall in love is just ludicrous. Unable to suspend my disbelief, it's been a chore to plow through this book and I don't know if I can stomach finishing it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed","review":"Reading this author's The Secret Life of Bees left me with high hopes for this novel. This book was dreadful, with a hackneyed plot, nearly uniformly weaker writing, utterly unbelievable and unsympathetic characters, and a disturbing message that has been much better delivered by numerous less promising authors. Almost every single \\"surprise\\" element of the leading character's less-than-convincing journey was telegraphed from the first pages. A terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this horrible book","review":"\\"The Mermaid Chair\\" is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish (for my book club). Nearly all of my club hated it. Why? The main character was so utterly selfish, egotistical and unlikeable. The situations were unbelievable. Worse still, the author aims to give cheating on your spouse justification, since the woman was just trying to \\"find\\" herself and \\"claim her life just for herself.\\" I suspect a serious case of reverse discrimination. If it was a husband cheating on his wife, would she make all the excuses for him? The sex scenes were disgusting, though not very graphic. This book is full of cheap psychology too. I imagine the author's ego matches Jessie's, and she thinks she is imparting wisdom to us lowly readers. That she would speak so condescendingly while spewing such drivel is just nauseating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't WAste Your Time and Money!","review":"I stopped reading this book about half-way through. It was so insipid and boring, that nothing could make me continue. Thank goodness it was the library's copy, so I didn't waste several dollars. This woman has a loving, psychiatrist husband who tells her at least once a day that he loves her. But, she is \\"unhappy in her marriage\\" for some vague reason--never really explained. The minute she meets Brother Thomas on Egret Island, the two of them exchange several emotion-charged glances. After that, they both tell others that they think they are falling in love. Come on!!! How sappy can you get? I didn't hang around to read about the consummation of this burning love because I was nauseated by this time. I also, liked THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES, but this was an extremely weak second effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sleeper!!!","review":"I immediately snatched the last copy of \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" in the bookstore, as I was really anticipating a great book by Sue Monk Kidd. I really enjoyed reading \\"The Secret Lives of Bees\\" and have recommended it to all my friends. I was highly disappointed with the \\"Mermaid Chair\\". The characters are extremely weak, and story is very mundane and ordinary. I huge disappointment and a waste of money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay seated...","review":"I had to force myself to get through this book, all the time hoping that it would get somewhere. The fact is that the jacket says it all.

Although it is well written and has an interesting premise, I had a hard time relating to the main charcters, who were all self-absorbed and none of whom respected the vows each other were supposedly bound to keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"?????????","review":"I tried reading this book and could not \\"get into it\\" at all. I then tried listening to it on tape with the same results.I didn't like the main character at all. She is weak and boring. She is a flat character who speaks of earlier interests in life, like her artwork, but who does nothing now. When her daughter goes to college she is \\"lost\\".I guess I just can't figure out how someone with only one child and no job could have so few outside interests or hobbies. It doesn't ring true at all. And why does she find reason to cheat on a husband that she doesn't articulate having a problem with; he seems like an interesting guy.The Secret Life of Bees was great and is clearly the reason she has sold so many copies of this follow-up book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Book","review":"I purchased this book months ago and recently sat down to read it. I was enjoying the novel until I finished page 206. After page 206, pages 176-206 are inserted. The novel picks up again at page 239. My copy, provided by Amazon (new), is missing 30 plus pages.

Like many reviewiers, I also, was a lover of \\"The Secret Life of Bees.\\" And now I am a lover of this novel as well. If pressed, I would say I like The Mermaid Chair better.A well-written, vividly detailed story of a woman searching for herself in many of the ways we all do: through our creativity, our families, our sexuality, our relationships and our limitations. The relationships portrayed in this novel are heartbreakingly honest, honing in on the distances we must keep even from those closest to us.All of the mermaid imagery is beautiful and mystical and with the monastary set right on the island, religion becomes a character that looms throughout the plot.Descriptions of the island made me feel as if I were right there and could smell the ocean. The island itself seems to make a statement about how isolated our true selves are. This book is sad, beautiful and so honest. I couldn't put it down. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaid Chair- Not all that great","review":"Okay, I read this book expecting to think it was great, since The Secret Life of Bees was. But it wasn't. I honestly felt like the author just... made this one up as she went along. It had a good idea to it, but it was all too familiar. Woman meets another man and falls in love. This sort of thing happensa all the time- why write a book about it and call it literature... I really don't think it was good. Jesse is a confused person- I can see why her mom is crazy too!I personally don't think someone should spend money on this just yet. Borrow it, go to the bookstore.... THEN decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bees","review":"boring. some interesting descriptions. obvious writing talent, but truthfully the book stinks. it is predictable, and the characters are flat. sorry i cant get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Book if...","review":"If you are a whore that cheats on your husband with unsuspecting members of the Catholic Church, then you may be able to identify with the protagonist of this novel. As far as being a \\"soul searching\\" book about a woman trying to find herself, it's actually about a horny woman who refuses to turn from temptation, and she gives in to her own selfish desires by dishonoring herself, her husband, and the monk she bangs on the beach. Oh, and the prose is second rate trash too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"This book was written so well, I am surprised anyone wouldn't like it.

It's plesant and light, but nowhere near the depth and beauty of BEES and surprisingly predictable. The worst part was, after sticking with MERMAID hoping it would get better, the ending was just a big thud. If you absolutely must read it, don't waste your money on the hardcover. In my disappointment, however, I found THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL by Phillipa Gregory and give it 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and under-developed","review":"The characters were under-developed and flat or two-dimensional. I was unable to feel sympathy for any of them, especially the selfish protagonist. It does portray yet another way that religious fanatacism can screw up people's lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than the first book","review":"I only ready this as it was picked by my book club. Since I did not like the secret life of bees I was dubious. And unfortunately I was right. The only fully developed character was shallow and I had no empathy for her plight or lack thereof. There are many better books about the south and growing up there, try Pat Conroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, utterly stupid.","review":"Utterly disappointing read. Characters are dull and unbelievable and Monk loves to hear herself speak and she describes in looong boring detail the island you really don't care about.

Not sure why I finished this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read this right after *The Secret Life of Bees*, you'll regret it.... but wait a while and then read and you may enjoy!","review":"At first, I didn't really care for this. It started out SO similarly to _The Secret Life of Bees_ - a daughter feeling responsible for a parent's death. And though the narrator was older, there was a lot of similarity between the two books' narrators. But, as the novel progressed, it grew to be separate from the first. It became a novel more like Jodi Picoult's - some chapters told by different characters and a revelation at the end. I will continue to watch for this author, because as a whole this novel was quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense plot","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I should have read the reviews here before I embarked on reading on this one. I was impressed with the Secret Life of Bees so I expected an equally engaging book out of this one. I will never understand a 40ish woman rocking the boat - her life when she has nothing to complain. In the end, she went back to Hugh her husband because for the simple reason, Brother Tomas, her lover couldn't continue their relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I absolutely loved \\"Secret Life of Bees\\", so I couldn't wait to read another of Sue Monk Kidd. However, \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read! First of all, the plot is incredibly close to \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood.\\" Could she not think of anything on her own? Second, the supposed \\"plot twist\\" was nothing more than a mere paragraph of nonsense that left me extremely disappointed. Finally, as this book is supposed to be powerful to women; however, it leaves the reader with the idea that you need a man to be complete. I can't believe I actually finished it! Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated the ending","review":"This was a great little read, but I was so upset with the ending.I believe that Jessie and Brother Thomas made the wrong choice, but that's just my opinion.Quick summary: Jessie goes back home to Egret Island to deal with her mother's illness. Upon arriving she begins an affair with one of the island's monks, a man by the name of Brother Thomas.She also begins to dig around in her mother's personal items and comes across an artifact that belonged to her father, an item that Jessie always believed that her father had with him when he died in a boating accident.Is Jessie's mother hiding the truth about her father's death? And just how many people are in on the secret? And what will become of Jessie's affair with Brother Thomas?The truth may surprise you.~~~Kat"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaid Chair","review":"Read this for a book club, and thought I would love it, as everyone else had read \\"Secret Life of Bees.\\" I had not read that one, so I was continually wondering what I was missing as I read \\"Mermaid.\\" I felt that it was contrived, made an overt effort to be \\"literary,\\" and omitted important connections that would have made the characters and action more believable. But because the author's style is smooth and natural, it was enjoyable to read--the disappointment comes with the overall lack of character development and reliance on coincidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok...","review":"It took me so long to get through this book even though it was an easy read. The main storyline, Jessie and Brother Thomas, is so boring. It is only her mothers storyline that kept me interested. I also enjoyed her mothers quirky friends. There are so many other books to read out there to waste time on this on."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ","review":"I read this book because I thought it had potential to be good= but about 1/3 of the way through I predicted everything that was going to happen and secrets that were going to come out. It was so predictable, not original at all, and definitely not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mudbath","review":"\\"The Mermaid's Chair\\" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\". A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina. Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally. Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"I really thought Kidd touched on the inner soul of the character's struggles to find themselves in the midst of their personal struggles. I was deeply lost in the book from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"I LOVED Secret Life of Bees and I checked out the large print edition of Mermaid's Chair from the library. I couldn't even finish it -- I made it half way through, and still was not engaged. It lacked the richness of culture and understanding that Bees had, and seemed like another \\"Oh, poor me\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed!!!","review":"The Secret Life of Bees will rank as one of my most favorite books. This was proof, in my opinion, that some authors only have one great novel. The story was not believable: it verged on the ridiculous. How convenient that all these events fell into Jessie's lap so she could go through a revaluation of her shallow life. Sorry, but I was so disappointed in this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Boy, I sure expected a lot more from this book because The Secret Life of Bees was so well done. All the elements were in place for The Mermaid Chair to be just as rich, but instead, I was bored to tears with the one-dimensional charectors and embarrasing-to-read romance. (I'll take the Thorn Birds anyday).The mythological elements were also not explored to the degree that I hoped. What happened? She certainly knows how to turn a phrase and her descriptions of the natural world of the island were beautiful, however, I never warmed up to any of the people, not even the main charector, and toward the end, I felt like I was being forced to read journal entries of someone with meager insight into life. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"What happened to the author of the Secret Life of Bees? That book was original, creative and very well written. I was looking forward to Sue Monk's next book. This was not it! It was totally opposite of her great first novel. As other reviewers have said it read more like a cheap romance novel, plot full of too much sex, predictable, and not very well written. I have recommended to my fellow book readers not to bother with this book and I would give you the same recommendation. Don't waste your time, there are too many good books to read and this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of cliches and shallow characters","review":"I loved Kidd's earlier book 'Secret Life of Bees' but this book has been a huge disappointment. The protaganist Jessie is shallow, her mother is shallow, her lover is shallow.....her husband Hugh is the only character I liked. And what a sorry excuse for having an affair. It is full of old cliched themes. Jessie needs to have an affair to 'find herself' and understand her marriage. The 1 star is for Kidd's writing style which is never boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MERMAID \\"CHORE\\"","review":"I was SO disappointed in this book! It proved to be a thinly veiled - and poorly written - romance novel. The contrived situations, from the trite mid-life crisis to falling in love at first sight with a monk, no less, make this book reek of the dime-store novel. I'm surprised that there wasn't a half-nude Fabio with a crucifix on the cover. Now that I mention it, the cover was beautiful - the book's one redeeming quality. Sue Monk Kidd should've done better, as BEES was wonderful. Don't waste your time or your money on MERMAID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved the Secret Life of Bees and couldn't wait for Sue Monk Kidd to write another novel. I was so disappointed in The Mermaid Chair. It lacked everything the first book had. The plot was disappointing and shallow - this woman had everything in life to be grateful for, but was \\"bored\\" so she found \\"love(?)\\" elsewhere? What a message to deliver to women. The only redeeming quality I found in the book was an occasional humorous, well written sentence or two. It was not enough to salvage the book. I only read to the end because I kept thinking it would get better. I hope for more from her next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe it won the Quill Award","review":"I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting. Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel. The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly. All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment....","review":"After reading Sue Monk Kidd's A Secret Life of Bees (which was wonderful) I was really looking forward to her next novel, The Mermaid Chair, because I thought it would be equally captivating. I was very let down. Maybe it was because the main character was a middle-aged woman who had a pretty good life and a great husband, but then falls in love with a monk and is enamoured with a chair. It's just weird, and I couldn't get into it. My recommendation: if you read Secret Life of Bees, don't follow it with this novel. If you haven't read Sue Monk Kidd's other novel, please go read it immediately...you don't know what you are missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad, predictable, disappointing novel","review":"What a disappointment after The Secret Life of Bees, which I loved for its character development, symbolism, strong female characters, etc... The Mermaid Chair would probably never even have been accepted by a publisher if it weren't for Bees. The main character is predictable, shallow and pathetic. What a sad commentary on mid-life and female weakness. I listened to the audio book and was also quite disappointed in the quality of the reading and the poor attempt at a southern accent by the reader who couldn't even pronounce Raleigh correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated!","review":"What was Sue Monk Kidd thinking?

It turns out I could have waited longer for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridges of Madison County meets The Thornbirds","review":"I loved \\"Secret Life of Bees\\" and ordered this book on faith, without having read anything about it. Although I enjoyed the sense of place and the creative use of imagery and myth, I found the story itself sappy and the heroine uninteresting. There was nothing new about the empty-nest, mid-life crisis, controlling husband angst, and the love-at-first-site hokeyness of the forbidden romance was unworthy of this writer. Sometimes I wonder about the pressure that the publishing world must place on a new writer to quickly produce a novel that can compare with one that might have taken her years to produce and perfect. I will not give up quite yet on Sue Monk Kidd, but I was quite disappointed in this trite story."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I had been looking forward to Sue Mon Kidd's next novel since reading the marvelous Secret Life of Bees. And man am I disappointed. The basic storyline? A self-absorbed and privileged white women takes a self indulgent oddysey, carefully masked as spiritual awakening. Especially annoying was her tendency to rationalize her extramarital affair, basically based on sexual attraction, as life-affirming, spiritually awakening... love. Pa-leeze. Enter her Mother's two friends, straight out of a Lifetime Network movie, a great husband who is somehow a villain for what? Not insisting that his wife find her own life? and a cast of bitter characters in a monastery, and you have a novel. I have no problem with characters with feet of clay. What annoyed me was the dishonesty of cloaking the novel as a spiritual awakening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bees was excellent. This is terrible.","review":"I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was in this novel. Bees was sooooooo good. Gone are the many wonderful turns of phrase and settings that drew you into the Bees story. Gone are the wonderfully drawn characters. Instead, you will be treated to the main character's endless memories of this and that, none of which the author gave any reason to care about. The endless \\"I recall when . . . I remembered that . . . It reminded me of the time . . .\\" just made the story drag and drag and drag and drag and drag and drag and I found myself reading Mermaid only because I liked Bees so much. Because the writing style is so much more amateurish, I suspect this book was either 1) written long before Bees, OR 2) written against an impossibly tight deadline. Just look at all the sentences with \\"as\\" connectives - it's a dead giveaway of amateur writers. Mermaid doesn't hold a candle to Bees and those that weren't blinded by the success of Bees can see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I loved The Secret Life of Bees and was expecting to love this one. I was very disappointed. I may as well have read a Harlequin romance. The plot was a predictable cliche, the characters were unsympathetic, and it was boring. I would recommend readers skip this one and hope the next novel is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"monks, & dogs, & weak women, oh my!","review":"The Mermaid Chair lacks all things belonging to a quality novel. The characters are undeveloped and flat in likeability. The story itself is a joke without the uplifting laugh to follow. And it may just be the most predictable book ever entered into print. Please don't let your time go to waist on a superficial mind-dulling book as this when there are so many incredible and intelligent novels abounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"i couldn't wait to get this book. i had pre-ordered it and was just waiting in anticipation. the secret life of bees was such a good book. so emotionally satisfying! i never wanted it to end..well needless to say i can barely finish this book. it is so ordinary..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not On A Par With \\"Bees\\"","review":"The first several chapters of The Mermaid Chair were, to me, very satisfying and interesting. Then I began to be bored with a very familiar plot and that's when I began skimming through the rest. Jessie Sullivan's dalliance with Brother Thomas was very predictable, and I thought the reasoning behind her mother chopping off her fingers was rather far-fetched. We're teased throughout the whole book with the death of Jessie's father and then the whole story was rather anti-climatic.I was disappointed after thoroughly enjoying The Secret Life of Bees."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are expecting the Secret Life of Bees, don't look here","review":"Sue Monk Kidd weaves a world of strong women with incredible backgrounds and great friendships. Beyond that, this book leaves alot to be desired. A monastary holds secrets that affect all the characters and really stretch the limits of believability. A really great build up to a dissappointing finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"two star rating generous","review":"i gave it a 2 star because i liked the setting, that is all i liked..this was drivel..the main character was annoying and making excuses for her life, unappreciative and spoiled. its as if this book was written by someone else. it certainly cannot be compared to the secret life of bees."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustratingly unsympathetic characters","review":"I had difficulty getting drawn into this story because the author does little to explain the characters' motivations for their actions, which are seemingly inexplicable until the end of the book. The main character, who is married to a good man and has a daughter, falls for another man who is a monk at the church where her mother works. By the time the author gives insight into the cause of her adulterous feelings, one has already begun to dislike the main character. The mother's violent acts of self-mutilation are incomprehensible since the author keeps the cause of her pain a secret until the end of the book. Even the father's mysterious death is not explained until the last few chapters. This book was frustrating because the author does not disclose anything to make you care about these characters until the final moments of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"taken from several other books","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I loved Bees so much and couldn't wait to read it, only to discover the plot and characters are stolen from several other books we all have read: The Thorn Birds and the Ya-Yas. She throws in Catholic symbolism because it worked with the first book. She puts in mermaid allusions \\"just because\\"...trying to be symbolic and follow her theme but so obvious it goes nowhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.....","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with this novel. Secret Life of Bees is one of my favorite modern novels, so I was expecting only excellence from Kidd's second book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I definitely shouldn't have bought the book. The plot was truly lacking in excitement and even her writing was unimpressive compared to the style of her first novel. It was totally overdone and unrealistic. I hope she gets her style back for the third novel--I'll give her another chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sue Monk Kidd Wrote This Beach Book????","review":"\\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" was an extraordinary book in every way, and I recommended it to and bought it for many, many friends. \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" surely was not written by the same author! What a vapid, one-dimensional potboiler! The heroine was a complete moron, apparently in a wife/mother coma after 20 years of marriage. The monk--well, what was so bloody irresistible about him other than his \\"denim\\" blue eyes? The poor husband, although also a caricature, held promise but was never developed into a real-enough person so I cared that much about him either. SAVE YOUR MONEY! This is a library beach book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Any Shred of Credibility","review":"I couldn't wait to read Sue Kidd's follow-up to my beloved Secret Life of Bees, and couldn't imagine it being anything less than another great story. I was so very wrong! The characters in this book are one-dimensional, boring, tedious, and absolutely unbelievable- with the exception of the long-suffering husband, Hugh. The plotline is preposterous! Instantaneous love affairs involving (mostly) happily married women of twenty years and monks just don't ring true at all. Don't read this book unless you're prepared to roll your eyes every few pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I thought that this story would have been much better without the affair. It just did not make sense at all for her to fall for this monk right off the bat. The rest of the story had some intresting parts but not enough to make it a worthwhile read. I liked \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!!!!","review":"What a let down. I loved The Secret Life of Bees. It's hard to believe they were written by the same person.One to SKIP!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"o.k. summer reading, but...","review":"Disappointing, especially if you loved Secret Life of Bees as much as I did. It seemed as though the author took her story-lines from the Thorn Birds, Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, and a bunch of Nicholas Sparks books. Don't get your hopes up for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"\\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" is one of the best books I've ever read. Maybe that's why this book was so disappointing. As other reviewers said, it's the same old plot, same old character(s). Where was the rich imagination and creativity seen in \\"Bees\\"? I forced myself to the end, but it was not an enjoyable read. I just kept hoping it would somehow get better---and her writing is beautiful. but not enough to carry this shopworn story. I'm interested to see what her next book will be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read The Mermaid Chair based on the hype, but the experience didn't live up to it. I was disappointed that the backstory of the chair itself was not more central to the novel. Also, the story of the mother's attempts at repentance through self-mutilation did not have enough depth. Telling the story completely in third-person as opposed to alternating first/third would have allowed more exploration of the mother's own internal reflections, shedding more light on her story. Just another midlife crisis story? I think so. The fact that the affair was with a priest even became boring. The ending was predictable.I am not impressed with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad second novel!","review":"I feel in love with Sue Monk Kidd's writing like many of us with her debut novel 'The Secret Life of Bees'. 'The Mermaid Chair' however was a different subject matter but like 'Bees' was beautifully written.In the 'Mermaid Chair', the author writes about how a couple can drift apart over the years of raising a child and what happens to life with the nest is empty. Ms. Monk explored the feminine soul and desires and helped Jessie come to terms with the relationships in her life. The focus was not only on her relationship with her husband but the relationships Jessie had growing up with her Mother and the loss of her Father.Jessie had to come to terms with all the events of her past so that she could finally lead a healthy present and future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danielle Steele in Kidd's Clothing??","review":"From page one to its end, I adored, The Secret Life of Bees, and waited hungrily for Kidd's next novel -- and paid the big bucks for the attractive hard-cover. Wish that I had read Amazon's readers' reviews before I dropped my 20 dollars for a another sappy romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful Book!","review":"I loved THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES and could not wait for this one. This awful book would never even have been published let alone received any attention without BEES. The heroine is a middle aged spoiled brat, her husband is just too perfect and understanding then she has an affair with a MONK? She and the monk fall in love at first sight of course. Sorry but I couldn't take any of the passages about her mother cutting her finger off either. There's also a poorly presented subplot concerning the heroine's \\"guilt\\" over her daddy's death years ago. I'll admit I didn't finish the book (highly highly unusual for me) so I shouldn't even be reviewing it but I couldn't resist giving my very strong opinion about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No feeling of truth in any aspect","review":"I do agree with all those who say the book was a thinly veiled pulp romance whose main character had no substance. But even worse for me was the fakeness of the description of the South Carolina coast - or rather, it felt as if it were a description from the viewpoint of a tourist looking at the scenery from within an airconditioned bus. For instance - the memory of the father taking his kids to see the time between ebb and flood - any other islander knows that from before they can remember. And somehow the leaving out of the immense amounts of insects and humidity left me wondering how the author could possibly live in a house on the edge of marsh. I bought the book for that description (not the insects per se, but the essence) - and finished it wishing that someone else would write the book I'm still looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Sue Monk Kidd is such a talented writer that it is difficult for me to fathom how she could even produce such an uninteresting and plot-free book. There were a few brilliantly written insights into the main character's struggle with the crossroads that her life was at, but other than that, this story was completely flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sue Monk Kidd needs atonement","review":"I can and can not believe that this is the same author that wrote \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" (which I loved). This book tried to have the same flavor, but was hugely unsuccessful. You really get the feeling that this book was slapped on the market to make money, based on the author's first books success. If Sue Monk Kidd uses the word 'atonement' one more time in this novel (three that I counted), I think I would have puked. This truly is one of the worst books I've read in years. If I only had known that she was the author of religious books before writing the \\"Secret Life of Bees\\" I may have steered away from both books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written Shmaltz","review":"I loved Bees and I am so disappointed! Although the imagery is wonderful, it gets old after awhile. I got tired of the protagonist wallowing in all her cliched 40 something feelings of despair and emptiness. Erotic? I don't think so. It was like reading Danielle Steele at her shmaltziest.I was irritated that the protagonist's plain old honest to goodness lack of maturity was portrayed as soul searching, and that a suicide would be viewed as anything other than a coward's way out. Because I like to believe that there are some elimental truths about life and spirituality, this story completely rubbed me the wrong way. All the main characters were victimized by one thing or another and I would have liked to see at least one of them realize that, as an adult, being a victim is a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Essay on \\"It's All About Me\\"--- Mermaid Chair","review":"Secret Life of Bees was one of the best books I've read in awhile and I couldn't wait to read Mermaid Chair. What a dissappointment. I have a hard time enjoying a book when I really don't like the main character and I didn't like Jessie. She was the embodiment of today's attitude of it's all about me and no caring of who gets hurt along the way. The story is ridiculous, not even the least bit believable. Monks condoning adultery? Secret poisonous plants? Some of the descriptions of the South Carolina coast were enjoyable but nothing compared to the lyrical quality of Bees. To bad I wasted money on a hardback as it's not a book that will be reread for years to come. Look for it in my next yard sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with it.","review":"Unlike most of the reviewers, I've never read Secret Life of Bees so can't compare this one to that one. I thought this book started out moving along nicely, then like many, I was ready to put it down when I got somewhere near the middle, but the last third of the book makes it worth the read. It gets more into what the characters issues are and you finally get to the bottom of what's going on with the Mom. So, I'm glad I stuck it out. The last thrid or fourth of the book made it worth the whole read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I've read her earlier novel, 'Secret Life of Bees' and enjoyed it, so was excited to see she had another book out. But to be honest, this one was difficult to finish. Had it not been Sue Monk Kidd, and had I not enjoyed the first one so much, I would note have stuck to it. But I had hoped she would justify my continued reading at the end. Sadly, she did not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Time is Not a Charm","review":"When an author debuts a novel as fine in plot, characterization, and emotion as \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" subsequent novels run the risk of falling short in comparison. Even in that context, \\"The Mermaid Chair\\" lacks the reasonance and poignancy I found and loved in \\"Bees.\\" Readers will find the same interesting, obscure female religious icons and circumspect, self-defined faith, but likely will fail to find Jessie Sullivan as engaging as Lily Owen. Two storylines intersect in \\"The Mermaid Chair,\\" but neither is especially compelling. It's not a bad novel, per se, just not what you might expect from Kidd's stellar fiction debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I am not able to understand why anyone would even remotely like this book.

Possibly an OK short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Attack on the Catholic Church","review":"I read through half the book and realized it was an attack on the Catholic Church. A priest helping someone commit suicide in a Catholic Church? I am offended. And is Monk your real middle name or a further attack?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I could care less about this book. It was boring and I only bought it because it was in the grocery store. Now I know why it was near the suppositories. Though the book wasn't horrific, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS SADLY DISAPPOINTED ~~~~~~~~~","review":"Having loved SECRET LIFE OF BEES, I was so excited when I saw this new book by Ms. Kidd. I don't waste time reading books I cannot get into and this was one of them. I see many mixed reviews, so apparently I was not alone.Be fair and give it a chance, but I did not even attempt to read after the first 50 or so disappointing pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaid Chair","review":"All I kept thinking through this book was, \\"Does this woman have no friends!?!\\"All she seemed to have to lean on was her mothers two best friends and her daughter. The book never hints that she was nothing but a mother/wife/artist working away in her studio. She never went out, never called anyone to talk to beside the few listed above. If my mother chopped her finger off, I think I would call some of my friends.Even though the affair part totally put me off, I did like when she made a string knot with herself and was attempting to find out who she was. Hopefully when she went home she would try to find her way out of her bubble life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth it","review":"I was never as in love with \\"Secret Life of Bees\\" as the rest of the world -- a lot of it just seemed impossible, given the historical period -- so I came to this book with low expectations. Which were fulfilled much more than I expected.\\"Bees\\" at least had some beautiful writing and interesting characters. The writing in this is watered down, and the characters are flat. Very little about them is original. The monk lost his pregnant wife in a car crash? Trite. Wife in a mid-life crisis, feeling unloved and unrecognized? Ho hum. Daughter carrying lifelong guilt for father's death? The same.The problem was, none of the characters came to life, so I couldn't care about their problems -- which weren't that original anyway. The mother, lopping off fingers? That was never really explained adequately.The only thing I give this book points for is the ambiguous ending, which is realistic and refreshing. Otherwise, a big bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gothic yarn","review":"I loved Secret Life of Bees and was disappointed in this book. The main character's indulgent mid-life crisis and affair inflicts hurt on a good, loving, husband and on a monk-to-be in crisis. Wacky mother allows daughter to believe that she was partially responsible for her father's death.Too much \\"me, myself and I\\" in this cruel gothic tale. Throwing one's self at a monk-to-be on one of your first few days back home - foreseeing the hurt that will ensue for everyone? Brother! My distaste with her began at that moment. Her \\"it's all about me and my crisis\\" extended thoughts and actions became annoying and irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed expectations","review":"I ordered this book based on the author's name alone; I have all of Kidd's books and they have been pleasing additions to my library, This time I was disappointed. The bizarre plot elements in Mermaid were distracting and disturbing, more Stephen King than Sue Monk Kidd. While reading, the accompanying mental chatter of, \\"I can't believe this is a Sue Monk Kidd book.\\" and 'Who can I give this to so I don't feel like I wasted my money?\\" kept me outside the book, a mere reader grounded in reality, unable to slip into that desirable state of observer and listener inside the story. Granted, I was expecting, hoping, for something more in line with \\"Bees\\", something more heartwarming, more loving, more believable, more nurturing. I couldn't finish it. That said, I still look forward to her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.","review":"I rarely return a book to the library without finishing it but this was one of those. I found the main character to be self-absorbed, narcissistic and lacking in character. What kind of person commits adultery with a monk she's known for about 2 minutes? I just didn't like her enough to want to know anything about her and I found her constant self-analysis to be self-serving and tedious. I finally skipped to the end to see what happened and didn't even care enough about her to want to flip back a few pages and figure out how her father really died. The stuff about her mother cutting off her own finger I just found to be contrived and gratuitous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Having loved The Secret Life of Bees, I was all psyched for another good read. However, the Mermaid's Chair pales in comparison. The characters are not very well developed, the plot is predictable, and the language lacks the elegance of that found in the Secret Life of Bees. As a matter of fact, it is hard to believe that these books were written by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so anxious to read this book after completely loving The Secret Life of Bees, and all I can say is I was completely disappointed. It was so predictable and typical-bored housewife falls for the taboo monk....gimme a break! I felt it was forced fluff, just to put another title on the shelf. Sue can do so much better, this was a total let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaid Chair","review":"This book disappointed me. I had heard such wonderful things about the Secret Life of Bees (which I did not read), that I had high hopes for this book. The Mermaid Chair actually tells two stories, and the author makes little effort to tie the two together. In fact, the affair the protagonist has with a Benedictine monk seemed gratuitous and certainly not necessary to the story about the protagonist's parents. There were a few beautifully expressed passages, but most of the prose was overdone and embarrassingly so in some cases. I would not recommend this book. I could not wait for it to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mermaids not so bee-witching","review":"Kidd's novel shares some threads of the tale she wove in the successful Secret Life of Bees; however, Mermaid Chair falls short of expectations. It is difficult to make a personal connection with the protagonist, particularly since the development of Jessie Sullivan is poorly constructed before she immediately falls in love with island monk-hunk Brother Thomas. How can the reader care about Sullivan or why this romance is important so early in the novel? Also, Kidd awkwardly throws in 1980s references here and there to lend credibility to this flashback. I found it to be an annoying, pedestrian, and sometimes painful read. I had to truly fight to just jump to the last chapter to put myself out of misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"hardly made it through","review":"I actually listened to Secret Life of Bees on tape, a first for me. I would give it a five, and it's the reason I picked up this book. It was a mistake. I read pretty much anything, but I could hardly make it through this one, and gave it away immediately when done. There were too many things going on in the book, and not one of them felt real to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better....","review":"I LOVED \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\", so I was really looking forward to this new novel.This was nowhere near as well written as the first. The characters were boring and self-centered, and I didn't really care about them at all - which was such a difference from her first novel. Half-way through the book I wondered if I even cared enough to finish it, but I finished it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to bee Kidding me ...","review":"Dear Sue,As one of your most supportive readers--I found The Dance of the Dissident Daughter brilliant--I must say that The Mermaid's Chair reflects a complete return to a stereotype of dominant patriarchal culture, where women need men to be happy. I agree with one of the previous reviewers who stated that from now on you should again write from the heart (remember St. Benedict's admonition to listen to the words of the heart). Jessie's actions in The Mermaid Chair just didn't ring true in this bodice ripper, sad to say. Much serious material got left by the wayside because of the sexual obsessions of the main characters.I'll look forward to your future writings, which I hope will plunge a little more into the true depths of female spirituality."},{"rating":"1","title":"flounder","review":"Ooo... Not a good book. Cold, meandering, sluggish and shallow to the point of embarrassing. But PLEASE do not let this book (or this review for that matter)shy you away from Kidd's other work.

I thought, if there is going to be such a whirl wind romance, at least make it worth my time. I couldn't care less if they ended up together or not. The whole mermaid chair myth had no point. I was hoping for something diffrent, beautiful even, with the name \\"The Mermaid's Chair\\", and all I got was a hardcover book full of nonsense....and stupid people doing stupid things without true objectives....not worth even paperback price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaid's Chair","review":"An obvious plot with \\"wooden-like\\" characters and an improbable, but predictable story line, The Mermaid's Chair became a forced-read for the sake of my book group. While the author does a fine job of describing places, she lacks the ability to adequately develop characters beyond a superficial level. It read like a made-for-TV script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. The poetry of the authors words envelope you in the story. I love the spiritual, humanity and mystery of Sue Monk Kidd's books. As a 45 year old woman, I especially related to the transition the main character was experiencing. Thank you Sue for another piece of literary genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.....","review":"I was so excited when this book came out after all i had just read Secret Lives of Bees and was so happy to have another Sue Monks Kidd book. WOW was i disappointed. It read very very slow and i was tempted to stop in the middle but couldn't do it. On average i read about 1 book very other day, this book took me four days...sooooooooooo boring. I hope the next one will be better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mermaids and more...","review":"The cover to this book will draw you closer no matter what! The story was heaped with descriptions and feelings but I felt it lacked in plot somewhat. Jesse has been called home to tend to her mother who has recently cut off her finger thus emerging past memories to enter the present for Jesse.Mystery begins to surround the death of her father when Jesse was young and a nearby monastry has secrets that Jesse wants to unfold to help in closure.The characters are very well defined and the writing is excellent but a doubting monk and his relationship with Jesse seems farfetched and seems to ruin the overall plot. Hugh, Jesse's husband puts up with alot I thought.Don't miss out on this long awaited second novel by Sue Monk Kidd - just know that it won't be as long-lasting as the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Tore My Heart","review":"I'm almost 20 years younger than the main character of this novel, but her choices tore me apart. Did you ever wonder if you are with the right partner? Have you ever taken time out of your own life to do something for you, or has it all been for your children, husband, mother etc.? I do not envy the choices the main character in this novel made, but I feel I learned a bit more about myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I was a huge fan of \\"Secret Life of Bees\\" and even subscribe to Sue Monk Kidd's newsletter. What happened here? This was a lackluster and self-centered indulgence of the writer. The whole thing felt very forced and selfish. Did the success of her first novel \\"get\\" to her? I hope not. Perhaps \\"Bees\\" was just too hard of an act to follow. I closed the book and immediately passed it to a friend with a great deal of warning. Kidd's descriptions of the locale and the environment of this barrier island are charming and enthralling, but the characters are sorely lacking. It's hard to root for a protagonist when one doesn't give a whit about her/him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mermaid Chair","review":"An excellent read - Susan Monk Kidd has a way of being able to describe things in an absolutely perfect way. She just has a way to put feelings down on paper so that we say, \\"Yes, that is exactly how it feels\\"; she's wonderfully descriptive. There is still a little bit of quirkiness though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it...","review":"I picked this book up because it was on the New York Times Bestsellers' list, and knew that it was by the same author as The Secret Lives of Bees, which I'd heard lots of good things about.Although everyone else seemed to find it ho-hum per previous reviews, I found myself not being able to put it down. Had it not been 11:30pm, I probably would have finished it all in one sitting.Yes, the plot was predictable, and I don't think it's right to ditch your marriage just because it's gotten dull. However, I have to admit for awhile my romantic side was rooting for Jessie & Whit to get together.I also loved the descriptive language about the island, and all that it entails. One drawback, however---It seemed like this could have been a remake of The Prince of Tides by Pat Conroy, except with a female main character.All in all though, it was a good read, and if Bees is 10x better than this, I can't wait to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reworking of \\"A Secret Life of Bees\\"","review":"If you haven't read \\"A Secret Life of Bees\\", start there instead. If you have, this is a slightly warmed over version--and one you can skip.The Mermaid Chair tells the middle-aged crisis story of Jessie, who is called back to her mother's home upon learning she has cut off her finger.There are few surprises here: the novel reads like an adult version of \\"what I did on my summer vacation\\", all of which can get set conveniently aside once Jessie returns to her safe, comfortable life. A tale that could be about growth and compassion, this one falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaids Chair Audio download","review":"This review is about the audio book narrated by Eliza Voss. I both read and listened to \\"Secret Life of Bees\\" and enjoyed both. I have not yet read Mermaid's Chair but did listen to it narrated by Eliza Voss. I would not recommend the audio book at all. I felt that either Kidd decided to write a terrible book for a change or the narrator didn't do a good job in interpreting the writting. I found myself trying to imagine the words without the voice just to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt. If I had only experienced Kidd through this format I would write her off as a bestselling beach book writer. When I have the time I may try the actual book but I'm afraid the sing-songy perky dialogue will still be yammering in my head. I apologize to the narrator for being so harsh, it probably just wasn't the right fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mermaid's Chair","review":"After having enjoyed \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\", I was extremely disappointed in Sue Monk Kidd's new book.

I was disappointed in this book, as I did enjoy reading \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" and this book had also received such high praise. The story line was only mildly interesting, and the book seemed very formulaic and 'blah' to me---writing was not exciting or original at all, in my opinion. The ending was inevitable, and I second what another reviewer stated: there is \\"zero suspense\\" or tension in this book.

I don't think I'd recommend this to anyone, unless you really like formula-based romance novel type books."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and uneventful","review":"This book had nothing interesting about it.

The story seemed really contrived and the midlife crisis/love at first sight was just not believable. Then, the ending that was so built up towards just fizzled away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable read","review":"I thought I would add my two cents as I read the book without reading her debut novel, so had nothing to compare to and didn't have the expectations that others may have had. I thought she wrote beautifully with a great setting of one that I am not familiar (live in CA). I enjoyed her descriptions of her surroundings, characters, and situations; and although the monk's character was not thoroughly examined, I enjoyed this romance that obviously couldn't have been. There was much more to the story than just this pairing, it did provoke some emotions in me, especially being in a long term relationship. I say don't judge too deeply, but enjoy the story for what it is - a love story about a woman and herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Wrong Again","review":"I love to read!!!

Our book club read Mermaid's Chair because we liked Secret Life of Bees: that story was original and creative, the characters were developed and interesting; and the prose was almost lyrical in places. I am thoroughly disappointed in Mermaid's Chair: the story is boring and just plain ridiculous; the characters are shallow and silly; and the prose is hackneyed. The end was so predictable that I had figured out most of it by p. 115.

Immediately I was reminded of Prince of Tides...only crossed with The Thorn Birds, with a little Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood thrown in...and then watered down considerably. Yes, her descriptions are lyrical, but the story is told from the viewpoint of a bored and boring housewife...the story is derivative and who really wants to read another book about a bored housewife's affair?

I also, regretably, found myself hoping the main character would fail rather than succeed.There were some things I found interesting but the romance aspect of her life overshadowed the rest. I'm not sure that I will be reading any more Sue Monk Kidd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Romance Novel","review":"I bought this book because I absolutely loved the Secret Life of Bees!I expected The Mermaid Chair to be as inspiring and complex, but it is merely a verbose, fluffy romance novel that caters to \\"40-something\\" women who are looking to live vicariously through the main character.A waste of time for those who are looking for more than a silly love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ish","review":"This book gives credence to something my mother once told me: \\"Many writers have one and only one good book in them.\\" In Kidd's case, that book was clearly \\"The Secret Life of Bees.\\" I kept reading \\"Mermaid,\\" hoping that it would redeem itself at some point. Didn't happen. Such drivel. It reads like a poorly written romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was disappointed by this book. While - as usual - I enjoyed Monk Kidd's writing this story didn't work for me. Specifically I found her relationship with Whit (Brother Thomas) unnecessary. Not only did it not help the narrative, IMO, it lessened the story and the characters.I think the story would have been better if Monk Kidd had instead focused on the other aspects of the novel - Jessie's midlife discontent, her father's death, her mother's condition and her relationship with her mother, her relationships with her husband and daughter, the relationships of the other island women, more information on the Gullah culture, etc.There is no comparison to \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" which I found magical and more compelling. Also Sue Monk Kidd's non-fiction \\"Dance of the Dissident Daughter\\" was, IMO, fantastic - and had a resounding impact on me.I would recommend other Sue Monk Kidd books before I would recommend \\"The Mermaind Chair\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"I know fiction is supposed to be fantasy but who fantasizes about intimate relations with a monk? There's not a lot of character development and everything seems way too far-fetched even for fiction. It didn't keep my attention at all and at times I found myself being repulsed by what I was reading. The main character is so annoying. I gave it two stars because the writing was understandable and not too verbose. The Secret Life of Bees is SOOOO much better than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Summer Reading, Compelling, Well Written...","review":"A friend suggested this book and I found it delightful. This was a fast read that I completed in a couple of evenings. I had that sad feeling when the book was \\"done\\" and I needed something new & fabulous to read immediately. For several days after completion, sequences in the book came pleasantly to mind. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as \\"secret life of bees\\"","review":"I bought this book because I really enjoyed \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\". In Bees, the main character Lily is a strong, vibrant girl - someone you really root for and have an interest in. However, the main character for this novel, Jessie, is annoying and whiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Don't bother with this contrived, predictable, overdone romance novel. If I wanted to read Danielle Steel I would not have picked up this book with high hopes. After Secret Life of Bees this is a horrible disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it.","review":"I just didn't get why Jesse would ruin her marriage to Hugh for the monk. I also didn't get that she was there to help her mother, but she didn't help her much since her mom went and did it again. It was all lost on me. I had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"The language, character development and intriguing story line in The Secret Life of Bees was rich and fascinating. This tale reads more like a dimestore paperback - one that I usually avoid. I finished it, hoping for something of substance to occur with the story line, but was disappointed. If you like a light read, the Mermaid Chair may work for you. I will be skeptical of Kidd's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many better books out there!","review":"I read this book because I did enjoy Sue Monk Kidd's other works. However, I hardly enjoyed this one. I found the main character extremely unlikable, whiney and self-absorbed to the point that I didn't care if she was happy, sad or torn. I eventually was so annoyed with the main character I didn't want to even finish the book; I did push through, though with hindsight, I wish I had just put it down and walked away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not finish it.","review":"Because I loved \\"The Secret Life of Bees\\" I ran out and bought this book as soon as it came out - hardback - full price. I read about half of the book and put it down. It didn't seem like the author actually connected with her own characters. I didn't see any reason to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipidness personified","review":"What a disappointment. It would be a rare reader who would care about these one dimensional characters. I do have to say, the ending brought it up to 2 stars. Sue Monk Kidd had to either make the husband a pastor or a psychiatrist to be that forgiving. And what a blase fling-never felt the 'heat'...enjoyed Secret Life of Bees and usually like a 'southern novel' setting, however, advise you not to waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite","review":"This tale had potential to mystify and beguile and most of what it did for me was to foster revulsion:Revulsion for the images called up by the actions of the mother who obviously had needed mental help for a long time, and for the casualness of the monk who blithely attempted to use physical sex to determine a spiritual outcome in his life.The mythical island described was beautiful, maybe to offset the ugliness of the selfish people involved in this slow-moving predictable novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly bad","review":"Horrific writing. The story was terrible, it was bizarre, unrealistic and relates more to terrible romance novels than a true book. I was expecting great things (I loved the secret life of bees). This book was the worst I've read in a while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Bees instead","review":"I should have read the mixed reviews before buying this book. I thought this book was very boring. The Secret Life Of Bees was a much better book with a better storyline. There are better books out there that deal with the theme of a mid-life crisis.Don't waste your time and money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried...","review":"The Secret Life of Bees was a wonderful, beautifully nuanced work of modern fiction, blending Southern gothic with mysticism and a modern look at the dynamics of family. This novel was, despite my best efforts to see otherwise, a somewhat beautiful mess. I applaud her effort, but to me, the characters never rose above the level of facile caricature, and at times I almost laughed aloud at the silliness of both the style and dialogue. Here's hoping the next is better. This author is truly gifted, but this novel is a well-intentioned flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best part of this book is the cover","review":"The best part of this book is the cover. I am so disappointed. I cannot believe this is by the same author who wrote The Secret Life of Bees which is marvelous and moving. This might be her sophomore effort, but sophomoric is more appropriate a description.I found the writing clunky and her protagonist unlikeable. The husband is a sympathetic character and yet Kidd tries to manipulate the reader into rooting for Jessie to have an affair with a soon-to-be priest. I don't care if fictitious characters have moral failings, without them most books would have no plot, but this was just poor all the way around. Terrible, terrible characterizations and descriptions. Everything was contrived and forced--like a good writer trying too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted So Much More","review":"What happened here? As several other reviewers have mentioned, Kidd's previous novel, \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" was chock full of wonderful characters and beautiful writing. The Mermaid Chair feels like a rushed attempt to get something else into print. I didn't like the characters and thought the story simplistic. I actually liked the Mermaid references but wanted Kidd to develop them more. And though I raced through to find out the big secret, I was ultimately disappointed that there wasn't much to the ultimate revelation. Overall, a disappointing, depressing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Having read and loved \\"The Secret Lives of Bees,\\" I had high hopes for this novel. Instead I got shallow, unbelievable characters, and a story line worthy (maybe) of a paperback Romance novel.Here is a middle-aged woman falling in love at first sight with a monk because of his beautiful blue eyes and intense way of looking at her. The monk also \\"falls in love\\" (more like \\"falling in lust\\") with her at first sight. And then she goes on to swoon over him every time she remembers the first time she saw him...puleeeze...Hopefully Sue Kidd will write another novel of the quality of \\"Bees\\" -- but this is not it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bee Serious","review":"Secret Life of Bees is one of my favorite books. I looked forward to the day that The Mermaid Chair would be released. What a huge disappointment! It was sheer drivel. The only thing that I like was the cover on the hard back. Such a predictable, boring plot. If ever there was a formula book, this would be it. It would have been an appropriate serial novel in a women's magazine. This book was so bad that I question if anyone can take her spiritual writings seriously. Insanity happens. Faith is doubted, and temptations are acted on every day. People fall and are redeemed. However, there was nothing redeeming about this book! They say that everyone has at least one good book in them. I guess \\"Bees\\" was her one and only. I hope she finds her voice, again. It was beautiful while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass This One Up","review":"I was disappointed after seeing this book on the bestseller list for such a long time. Though I was somewhat interested in the outcome of both relationships, I was very unhappy with the lack of development of Jessie's father. She starts to touch on the middle aged crisis of this frustrated woman/mother/doctor's wife, but it doesn't make up for the rest of the story. The ending was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I wanted it to be","review":"I had bought this book for my mother in law, as I was a huge fan of the Secret Life of Bees, but this one was a disapointment. She lent it to me when she was finished and I had a very hard time getting through it. I kept wishing that it would get better, and it never did. I did finally reach the end, after about 3 months, and was totally disappointed with the conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squandered potential","review":"After the success of \\"Bees,\\" this author was guaranteed a wide audience for \\"The Mermaid Chair,\\" and starts out with an intriguing premise - a woman in transition revisiting her childhood home before moving forward with her life. Unfortunately, the characters are poorly drawn, and the protagonist is narcissistic, shallow and irritating. The book fails in its effort to capture the rhythms of southern life and the importance of female friendship so evident in Bees. Despite the order in which the books were published, I'm convinced that this book was written years ago by a writer who hadn't yet found her voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"After reading \\"Secret Life of Bees\\", I could hardly wait for Kidd's latest offering. What a let down!! This book is self absorbed just like the main character! The story is ponderous and trite and lacks the realism of Kidd's \\"Secret Life Of Bees\\".I felt no affinity or relationship with the characters and in real life, (unlike this story) there are generally consequences for actions.In the end - I just didn't care..... about any of it, but was frustrated that I had spent valuable time reading such a disappointing offering from Kidd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tiresome, overworked, freeform poem","review":"This is the story of a 42 year old woman with no other compelling features than a dedicated self absorption and spiritual short sightedness. The author frames all this nonsense in rapturous verbiage. No spoilers because I did myself a kindness and gave up after chapter 28.(It's even worse as an audio book - like Auntie reading recipes aloud.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs. Claus","review":"After receiving the item it was a bit more plain than it appeared in the photo.

His previous novels have been extremely enjoyable because of their slick pace and the entertainment value they provide. Whilst HCR does not lack in pace, it is by-the-numbers and highly predictable.Set in the future, the novel tells the story of Jason Chaser, a teenage hover car racer who graduates through Racing School and then onto the Pro Circuit. Much of the plot is cliched - narrow losses, interspersed with narrow victories. A villainous arch-rival. Scheming plots to destroy Jason's quest for victory. And you can pick the ending a mile off (as with most fictional tales with a sporting bent).This will undoubtedly be made into a Disney movie - the racetracks and scenery described in the book, as well as the action packed races, will make for great viewing. Still, the book was far too kitsch and cute for my liking. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An intriguing idea that fails miserably","review":"As a case it's just passable with its bulky cradle and wraparound case that does not protect the PDA from the elements (the ends are open). A $$$ case from a myriad of others is much better. As a keyboard it fails miserably. The keys are like wiggly soft buttons that are nothing like a real keyboard. It is impossible to type at any reasonable speed, let alone touch typing. Feedback from the keys is horrible, you don't know if a key is registering or not. The keys move slightly, but nothing like a real keyboard. I now use a Palm Portable keyboard (like the Stowaway) and it is like day and nite compared to this thing. Full size keys, full travel, an amazing design. I love Logitech products, but somehow they lost their way with this thing. What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but ...","review":"I like the Logitech KeyCase. It gives me two things I needed for my Palm M130, a keyboard and a case. Overall, it compared with most of the other keyboards for the m130 that I tried out.I feel that they keys are a bit small and close together for my larger hands and thick fingers. If your fingers are thin or your hands are average size or smaller, the KeyCase would be a very good keyboard for your Palm.Having used other flexible keyboards, I was surprised at the responsiveness of the KeyCase. It wasn't nearly as mushy as I expected and was comparable to many other portable keyboards I've tested.Overall, I think that the KeyCase is a good value, very usable if you take into account the size of your hands, and is fairly priced. It also the attention to quality that I've experienced and enjoyed with many other Logitech products in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is garbage!","review":"I thought that this would be a great item.

My 9 and 6 year old girls have spent hours playing with it. Many things have gone on the slides to be examined. The specimen collecting items from the kit were a big hit.

Amazon was very good about taking it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not get microscope to function","review":"Or maybe it was just me. There was a dark 'spot' somewhere in the lenses that made viewing nearly impossible - tried cleaning it, etc. Or maybe it was a Mfg error/flaw, etc. I'll keep the slides and stuff, but will trash the microscope itself and get a 'real' one. Think about it..... This thing theoretically says it goes up to 600X - pretty much horsepower for a toy. Personally, I think the optics are not so good - but then again, for the price, and if it works for you - then maybe small kids will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned....","review":"Had to return this item the day after it was given as a gift for my son. Both light bulbs that came with it burnt out literally seconds from turning them on. The make of the microcope was not at all durable and the eye piece seemed small.

Ended up spending a tad more and getting the 'My First Lab Duo-Scope'...and would highly recommend that product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids love it at first, but the fun goes away as limitations arise","review":"Now I purchased this knowing that it was a toy, I wasn't expecting great quality and I was correct to think that way. The optics are terrible and it is very hard to view anything. I ended up putting a flash light on the mirror to give better results for her.Overall she loved it at first, and that is what I wanted to see, if she would like this sort of thing.

The light is faulty so it occasionally stays on, you cant focus on anything, only one of the three lenses focus's enough to make anything out. It comes with tons of stuff you dont need, wont use and will only be found through out the house later. Waste of money, dissapointing. We tried to look at an ant, psshhh. We tried to look at a leaf, Pshhhh. The premade slides, again you just cant focus to see anything so you get this terrible kalidaskope (sp) effect. DUMB!

It is very cheap, mostly plastic and low quality. The optics are horrible and the stage is made of a flimsy plastic. My son stopped using it because he was straining his eye trying to focus and keep things steady. The paint was chipping off around the battery cover, and since it's made overseas, I was also concerned about that. I'm sending it back.Note: I see this company has 2 different models, and from the pictures and descriptions the microscopes are the same, but with different accesories and a different magnification eyepiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"What \\"quality\\" are they talking about?","review":"I purchased this scope from a local school store as a gift. Within minutes my nephews were asking for my help focusing. I thought the excessive scratches on the lenses and slides were to blame, only to discover the eyepiece/lenses didn't even line up with the hole through which the light is coming through in the platform! What a waste of money. I'm disappointed that quality-control for a company would allow this product to be sold, nevermind made! (The difference between the models manufactured by this company vary only in the even cheaper painted-plastic \\"accessories\\" that actually, laughably, are labeled with \\"Warning: sharp object\\" labels!) I'll be calling the company first thing in the morning for a refund so I can purchase something that the boys can actually use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!","review":"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year. Within the first hour, it blew a lightbulb. The included replacement bulb lasted about two hours. I called the company and they sent me a new one. This one didn't work at all!

This is a terrible product and I wouldn't waste my time or money with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not overjoyed with the quality but...","review":"Got this for my 8yo daughter and she has fun with it. In the product description it touts itself as having a die-cast body but in reality, it is mostly plastic and is a rather flimsy piece of equipment. The optics are \\"cloudy\\" at best and not very good. I have not experimented much with trying to improve the clarity however we have observed some things under low power with some success. The higher power settings are marginal because the light requirement goes up and the optics are just as bad as the low power setting. The tools are cheesy plastic with a \\"look of metal\\" to them. Still, my daughter likes it and that is what counts - she doesn't have anything to compare it to.For the $35 I paid, I would expect a little bit better of a piece. Maybe I'm expecting too much in remembering the all metal one I had when I was a kid that I wish I still had now."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book...","review":"Overall, I found the information and stories in this book to be fascinating. The writing style, however, is sometimes a bit confusing and jumbled.

Liam Neeson was actually decent as Darkman, but the script let him down, and some really bad jokes ruined this film. The only real high point is Larry Drake who plays the evil villian Robert G. Durant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Raimi's movie ever made","review":"This is the best Raimi movie.Raimi used many dramaturgies in Spider man which were already used in Dark man.I think that the fact tells us how great this movie is...I truly hope that Raimi will come back soon with Evil Dead 4!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about","review":"I bought this movie after reading all the positive reviews. I enjoy high quality HD rendering too. Something of a disappointment I have to say. The movie is ok. Some amusing scenes but fairly predictable throughout. Nowhere near as good as his later works.The picture quality was medium level DVD. DEFINITELY not worth buying on Blu-ray...I can only assume the fulsome reviews came from people either trying to plug the movie, have a poor system set up, or haven't seen any modern efforts to compare it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have been drunk when I bought this one","review":"Well, what can I say. I KNOW that Liam Neeson can do better work than this, example Schinder's List, but weak plot, weak script, weak movie, get out the Jack Daniel's and call over your buddies if you want to get through this movie. Odds are you will have a better time shooting the breeze with your buddies than watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrasing","review":"What I mostly remember about this film, which I saw in the theatre years ago, was mediocre special effects, and that parts of it were so patently silly that the audience laughed about things that were definitely not meant as jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm surprised Neeson hasn't burned all the copies","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, the only thing that made it worth watching for the group of us who suffered through it one rainy afternoon was the sheer amount of MST3K-like abuse we could heap on it with little or no effort. It's a real stinker with horrific acting (yes, even Liam Neeson), a weak plot, a ridiculous screenplay, and a laughable ending that seems to have been scripted by an unpopular teenage boy set on making a statement that being a stubbornly lonesome outcast is heroic. If you're not in the mood for an evening of wide-eyed disbelief that a movie could be THIS BAD, save your money. On the other hand, it does have the same sort of unexplainable tragic attraction that leads people to stare at car accidents on the side of the road, and if you're the type of person who likes to point and laugh at the truly inane, this movie might be for you. I can't imagine for whom else it might have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can it be rated if it doesn't play","review":"I have now gone through TWO of these blu rays.

Although it has it's artistic imagery through its director Sam Raimi, as a movie the plot seems childish and not realistic.

If you really want to see this movie, I would highly recommend renting it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie.","review":"I had never seen Darkman and bought it because I like this type movie and it was rated 4 stars on Amazon.

This is a visually stunning movie with a lot of humor and intentional melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"wildly unentertaining","review":"Sam Raimi directed Darkman, so you would expect a lot of fun out of the guy who directed the Evil Dead movies. (He made Darkman before Army of Darkness) But I never laughed during this movie. If I did I forgot but there wasn't much to make me like this film. Liam Neeson seems to be the film's saving grace. He's an amazing actor that can play any role, although I prefer him in roles like the ones he did in Schindler's List and Michael Collins and Les Miserables. For a truly fun action film I recommend Army of Darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"snoopy133704","review":"Darkman is one of the best Dark comicbook adaptations ever done.

Good transfer to DVD. I would've given it five stars if it would've had DTS or Dolby 5.1 and more extras!! Hope Universal does a 10th Anniversary ED. in 2005!

She builds a bridge for us all in listening to beautiful traditional spiritual music that reaches our hearts. Makes our hearts listen ...lifting up the listener ... reminds us songs inspired by God are inherently joyous! I sense God nodding in approval ( ... and with Lorie's rhythms) in her uplifting arrangements of traditional hymns.

I have a fried with an older version of Quick Verse that is much better in this regard. His version was sold by a different company, and the content is much better.

In reality, I suspect that the XS is probably best suited to a young, thin-framed girl rather than a petite woman.I have no complaints about the rash-guard though.

I accidentally stumbled upon this book--didn't know it existed, and boy am I so glad I do now. What an enjoyable, fascinating, enlightening, eye-opening book. I am not terribly fond of ALICE, but after reading these chapter by chapter notes, I'm truly amazed at such a great author as Carroll. This is a must read for any teacher and adult who wants to discover ALICE again in a whole new way.

I would encourage any reader to get your hands on these, just the right size, especially for bedtime, full of FUN Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"average, boring heavy metal","review":"Just because its japanese, doesnt mean its great. This band really brings nothing new to metal, but if you want some headbanging good times without much thought or creativity, here you go. Their other albums are even worse, sprinkled with ballads that remind one of Whitesnake. Only for japanese fanboys and girls or \\"old old school metal\\" fans, the kind who think black sabbath is still the cutting edge of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"a word lovers fantasy come true","review":"I found this book years ago, even then in a used bookstore. I'd moved beyond all those dull \\"How to Improve Your Vocabulary Books\\", but picked it up anyway... and was so delighted. It makes for wonderful reading, even though it's a dictionary. The words in it are vibrant and complex and utilizable. A definition is provided of a given word, say, \\"saturnine\\", or \\"quiescent\\", and then examples of how the word appears in various texts are listed beneath. My one quarrel with the book is that too many of the examples seem to have been taken from the same sources; I wish Hunsberger had cast his reading net a bit wider. Nevertheless, the examples are wonderfully readable and truly do educate you about the various shadings of the words lucky enough to appear here."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read Vanity Fair, or similar, you need this book!!","review":"I originally got this dictionary when I started reading Vanity Fair and Dominick Dunne's books. If you don't know what \\"c'est la vie\\" or \\"elan\\" is, this is the dictionary for you. I've had mine 20 years and recently ordered one for a friend who needs no help w/comprehension but has started to do the NY Times crosswords (very heady stuff there). You can basically use it almost as a thesaurus and has boundless, wonderful words and phrases that are used often but not always correctly. FANTASTIC book for anyone who reads and wants to continue their education w/words and phrases that people today do not always use on an everyday basis. A must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference","review":"A good book for those who seek a distillation of a thorough dictionary. Can be read for pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving Praise to Those Who Came Before","review":"For the aspiring African American/Black filmaker, this three DVD set will hopefully give them the incentive to continue with that passion to make movies. This is a great place to start to learn of our story in cinema.

Matt Kramer and Phil Varone ARE this band...making The Lizard and self-titled CD's the best put out so far. So pick up those two. Also, Saigon Kick is currently on tour with original bassist Tom Defile, and new guitarist Jeff Blando (Slaughter), so go check em out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Twice","review":"Over a year ago, I purchased the 40GB model and was very happy with it until a couple months ago when it died. Thankfully I had a recent backup. I thought it was just a bad coincidence that my drive had failed, so I got the 80GB model as a replacement. Now, after having it for less than two months, the drive completely stopped working. I have tried everything and cannot get a computer to read the disk.I really want to like this drive. It is beautiful, easy to use, and otherwise worthy of 5 stars, but having two drives fail in the past two months is absolutely unacceptable. If you get this drive, make sure to backup your data constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply bad choice!","review":"I purchased the 80Gb drive last year attracted by good reviews and having my old Lacie 20Gb reliably working for several yrs already.But apparently times changed for LaCie. After 18 mos the 80Gb drive is completely dead, cannot be powered up at all. Since new AC adapter did not help and disk warranty is expired, the data will be lost.The LaCie's technical support turned out totally useless, they keep recommending to re-format the drive ... how can one do it without switching it on? no idea ..Simply bad choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hummingbird magic","review":"These are THE most favorably commented upon earrings that I own.There's plenty of hummingbird jewelry on the market but most everything I have seen does not capture the quality of hummingbird. These do. Period.Unreserved recommendation.Oh, actually, there IS a downside; every now and then I spontaneously give one away(that I am wearing) to a friend, and have to then re-purchase a pair. This phenomenon happens as fast as a darting hummingbird, so I am now convinced that these earrings are imbued with some kind of self-propagating hummingbird magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfire","review":"This book is a shill for an investment theory, and should never have been submitted to a sale on AMAZON.COM.The author Thought that people would get upset at the Murder of Vince Foster and institute some \\"Watergate\\" type hearings, which would drive down the Stock Market. Obviously that never happened. So people did not need the investment theories \\"shilled\\" for in this book.The Book is only about 125 pages long, and the minority of the book focuses on the \\"Strange Death of Vince Foster\\".My suggestion for the reader is to find another book on the Vince Foster \\"Murder\\" where the idea is NOT to subscribe to some whacko Investment theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work of art","review":"Incredibly, this author is argentinian. The tone, ambientation, and rythm suggest a writer with a closer relationship with the tale itself. A fine narration with the unique perspective of a talented homosexual of upper class upbringing. Not comparable to Capote or others that could be associated by mere characteristics. It is History, and it is a novel. Undoubtedly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"gutter bracket","review":"I had a hard time finding equipment locally.

I particularly like that it provides leadership tips that the most junior officer can put to work right now (unlike a lot of leadership books that seem to focus on how to be a great general). Every young officer should read this book..it's only 200 pages and crammed full of pure gold nuggets of wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy","review":"I thought this was a very well written book, considering that it was highlighting management techniques. Those types of books are ususally very boring, prop your eyelids open type of books. Michael Abrashoff explained his style of management in a manner which would make it interesting to a broad range of readers and it is told as a well written story should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theory at work","review":"There are lots of book out there that describe management theory, but few give you examples of how to put it to use in the real world. This book tells how Commander Abrashoff (the author) empowered his crew so that they could be the best that they could be. I work in law enforcement and the story was very relevant to para military management style of most law enforcement agencies. If you are about to take charge of a group of people, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remedial and self-indulgent","review":"Nothing new in this book. If you've done any reading on leadership, it's unlikely you're going to get anything from this. I did find it interesting to see how leadership techniques worked in an organization I cannot relate to so it was an interesting read nonetheless. Wholly self-indulgent however, and the author tends to repeat the same points over and over (yes, we get it, the job of a ship's captain is operational readiness - I didn't need to be told that 100 times over).Net: If you're an experienced leader looking for an entertaining read it might be fun. If you're a new leader you'll probably find some things useful in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's your Ship","review":"As an Army Corps of Engineers Senior Leader, this is the best management book I have read in my career. Maybe I am biased as this appears to be my management style, but I have also experienced similar results with the style implemented by Captain Abrashoff. I highly recommend this book for senior leaders and have referred it to numerous employees who were seeking management positions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved IT!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

Michael Abrashoff changed the way the Navy does business. He proved that by making the crew the team, his ship could outperform all the others in the entire fleet. While that didn't start as his goal, his leadership insights quickly spread throughout the US Navy based on the Benfold's operational performance. It's also a book about treating the members of the team as important contributors, and well as people. The book is about leadership, from a practical, reproducible point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy","review":"Outstanding example of the way things should be done!

Anyone can use the techniques, not just military personnel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Human Instinct","review":"If I were to summarize the whole book in one sentence than it would be \\"Michael has proved that extracting natural human instincts out of any person will drive positive results\\". Natural human instincts include Respect, Trust, Empowerment, Ownership, Belonging, Purpose, Team player and more: once fostered will motivate majority of people to give their best. While the book is filled with many personal stories and heroic actions, the theme circles around \\"Natural Human Instincts\\". I had the pleasure of listening to Michael before reading the book and his natural speaking style and down to earth sharing of his accomplishments are reflected in his book as well. Overall a very interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain D. Michael Abrashoff is \\"the Right Stuff\\"!","review":"This \\"out of the box\\" Naval Officer has written the \\"best d***n book\\" on corporate culture change, management, and empowerment that I have ever read. I have recommended it upward, sideways, and downward within my company and to my best customers as well. It has yet to be unappreciated.Managers at any level can learn valuable lessons from this story. This Naval Officer turned the \\"Worst Ship in the Navy\\" into the \\"Best Damn Ship in the Navy\\" with a simple game plan that not only changed his ship, but served to improve the U.S. Navy as a whole. (And in the process, improved our nation's security ... read the book to find out how he and an enlisted member of his crew did it!)It has given me the inspiration to expect excellence from not only myself, but my superiors as well.Well done, Sir!"},{"rating":"1","title":"never received product nor requested refund","review":"I never got the product for whatever reason I also sent a complaint email and nothing has happened, not even an apology much less an offer for a refund or even the actual product, i would settle for the actual product. due to all this happening and me relying on Amazon and the vendor I almost got fired from my job because thats what this book was for. as ridiculous as it sounds i had to read this book and write a report on it but again never received the book. so thank you Amazon i dont think ill be doing business with you anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 words rating","review":"\\" I DONT KNOW\\", how to rate this book because i have not received it.

I find it difficult to believe that the US Navy is still afloat without him. My company has suggested that the senior staff read this book. I'm all for improving and streamlining and more importantly increasing the morale and trust within the team. This book is nothing more than common sense. Treat people as you wish to be treated."},{"rating":"1","title":"FELLOW SHIPMATE IN SAN DIEGO","review":"WOW...I thought it took almost 300 people to run a Navy combatant. Obviously, according CAPT Mike, all the accolades received by the USS BENFOLD were all about him, and due to his leadership.As a retired Navy CAPT, I feel he has done a true disservice to his fellow Surface Warfare Officers and all of his senior enlisted members and crew. Obviously, Mike missed the first session of Command Leadership l0l...Command is not about you as the Commanding Officer, its about the sailors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the hype, look past the facade...","review":"After reading this book, I happened to ask the opinion of an very high ranking Navy Officer whom I am friends with. When I asked him his opinion of this book and Captain Abrashoff, his only reply was \\"He didn't make Admiral now did he?\\" Indeed. While reading this book, take note of the use of certain words such as I, me and my. I noticed a gross lack of the word we in this book.We as in us, the team, it was lacking. I'm sure Mr. Abrashoff ran a ship to be proud of however he lacks the hindsight to appreciate teamwork. It is in fact team work that makes a business run and run efficiently. This type of attitude is exactly what is wrong with American businesses today. The us and them mentality which separates management from peons is very evident here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered New but got Used book.","review":"As the title states. I ordered and paid for a new book, however when it arrived it was worn with a store added bar-code that stated \\"Used very good\\". Too bad they didn't send the back extra money with my order. I'm sure the book will be great. Go Navy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Business Leadership Advice","review":"This book offers excellent insight into the world of leadership. The theme is that \\"it is all about the people.\\" That is true today more than ever as businesses lose their way and employees become more disenchanted and disengaged from their jobs.The practical advice that Captain Abrashoff gives works on a Navy ship and works in a business. We have used this book as a training session to develop leaders throughout our organization. Further, I owe a debt to Captain Abrashoff as many of his ideas have found their way into my book on B2B Business Leadership.Build a Better B2B Business: Winning Leadership for Your Business - to - Business CompanyIn short, a great book for all business leaders that want to win by building a \\"Winning Team.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It is our ship","review":"This book is a must read for any military vet .It shows there some ZEROs worth sweating for in time there is grace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't finished but like it so far","review":"Good management book so far with a well thought out interweaving of stories to help give a reader real life examples of how to and not to manage people.

Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Disappointing book I've Ever bought","review":"I believe this is the most disappointing book I've EVER purchased! The entire book is mis-leading. It fails to deliver what it promises; ie, instructions which are easy enough for beginners. Although I am an experienced sculptor, I had difficulty. The photos are hazy and out of focus, with the only color pictures being in the \\"gallery\\", and even those are too small to see clearly. The author uses products, but fails to mention where to purchase them, or how to make them; but she does a bang-up job of promoting her push molds. The book is one big, poorly done ad for her products. I can't see how this ever got published, in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"a new method","review":"I was not impressed. The methods used in this book are way more difficult. Sculpting and then cutting it open to put the armature in seems a little silly to me. It is not a book to use for beginners and a practiced sculpter would find it very primative. There are a lot better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has it all!","review":"This book is very well written and easy to follow. If I had any actual talent I would be making fairies myself...believe me, I tried! Very easy step-by-step directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a huge disappointment","review":"When I got this book I was very disappointed. I love fairies and have started working with polymer clay. All the pictures are of bad quality, they are fuzzy, unfocused, bad color, and mostly black and white. For the cost of this book I expected a lot more. I have purchased polymer clay books from other authors for a lot less money and they have more craft ideas, great color photos and are truly inspirational. From the profits this author is getting from the high price of this book with the low cost of production she should invest in making a 2nd edition that has better pictures and better ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This book was a disappointment.

Another great feature, is the smart tags feature, which allows me to type in a verse reference in Microsoft Word and it will pull up the selected passage from QuickVerse whether the program is open or not. This is a huge time-saver is sermon preparation.I personally have used PC Study Bible and Logos and while are both are great products, I find myself going back to QuickVerse time and time again. PC Study Bible just doesn't have the amount of references that QuickVerse has and Logos is rich in content but difficult to set up and navigate.For someone looking for loads of content at an affordable price in a user-friendly format, QuickVerse is hands down the best fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised","review":"I bought this product because it said it contained Tongkat Ali, Cistanche Deserticola, Epimedium Brevicornum Maxim, Panax ginseng, but when I received I found it had Cordyceps Sinensis, Epimedium Brevicornum, Panax Ginseng which is a totally different product.

Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener","review":"This book looks like a typical refutation of evangelical Christianity for Catholicism. However, it is much more. I never have read such a joyous, clear explanation of how evangelical Christians view and live their faith. I have read many Catholic conversion stories but this is the first without any judgement of one side or the other. Mr. Howard clearly shows how the two views of Christianity complement and fulfill each other. Both are in agreement on the fundamentals (anti-abortion, intense focus on redemption and Jesus) although each group would be surprised to realize this because they are so focused on their differences. Evangelicals have intense personal passion for their faith and Catholics have liturgy and sacraments that speak to our human senses and innate need for repetition (the liturgy of the year for example). All Christians would be surprised how much they could learn from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm Reading","review":"I started out very interested in what Mr. Howard had to say.

Get your hankies out, and go through a little romance, a lot of excitement, have your heartstrings tugged and get some issues that weren't clarified wrapped up. This is well written, well acted and is well worth the cost of purchase. It is intriguing enough that I will be watching it again (several times) just to discover any of the fine points I missed in the first viewing. This is the writer's work at his best. And then I'll be sharing it with several girlfriends for chick flick night and crying over certain scenes again. I do have to add that it was also appreciated by my husband and my 20-something son so it is not strictly a woman's film. I won't spoil the ending for you but definitely do watch this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I love everything by Joss W!

It looks at the concept of what makes a person who they are.The idea of creating a person \`up-loading' it into a doll (blank slate) and then \`wiping' that person once the job is done which is in effect killing that person. This series looks at the grey area of this concept.Would have been eager to see the show last for another season or at least fill 22 episodes for season 2.

I am a very small woman so it isn't as if I have an enormous noggin. My ears hurt the whole time I was wearing these and after only an hour my ears were hurting so much I had to take the headset off.

I must admit i have only listened to it a few times but i can't see myself listening to it much more. A lot of the songs are slow and no heavy guitars no screaming solos' the singing a mild.

First and most importantly, the music is pretty much just watered down Nirvana over and over. The same light verse, heavy chorus, the same type of vocals. With Puddle of Mudd, however, we are lucky enough to be subjected to a glitzy string-infused sugar coating over the sharp-edged pill that was grunge, but without any of the artistry and bite. That leaves this music little more than a Pop Rock CD alternately pissing on and sodomizing Kurt Cobain's corpse. The lyrics are (as always with this band) inane, woman-hating frathouse material. No offense to any fratboys who are actually cool and respectful to women. They -and anyone else who doesn't think of women as whorish sex-objects - should avoid this disc at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"good band and deserve more credit","review":"this band is really really good i think and some people underestimate this band and dont give them the credit they deserve like for example i watch this show called that metal show and during show they have a trivia part and if the hosts arent able to get your question right then you get to pick from this trunk of stuff and this guy on one episode got to get something from the trunk and he got a puddle of mudd album and the host said ahhh man if you want something else you can reach back in there and put that back and i thought to myself wow that was harsh to say especially about a band such as puddle of mudd but anyway my point is this album and come clean and their other albums are good and people shouldnt judge them without taking the time to actually sit down and listen to them but this is a really good album and a great buy so give it a try and you will not regret it!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"It takes couple listens, before you catch on.Simply excellent rock.

This is a great comeback album from POM I am glad it took them 4+ years to make it well worth the wait as others have been saying. It also sounds progressive which is new for POM and personally I like it each song sounds different (unlike LOD).

So that means that someone out there liked this book. I am not that person. I read a lot of this type of novels, so I have a general idea what to look for. This book does has have action, but that isn't enough. The book is hard to read because I had trouble staying with the book. There are novels that once you start reading them, they flow and you find yourself caught up in them. This one is jerky in the action scenes. The characters don't mesh well in the story line. Maybe the second novel is smoother, but I am not sure I would want to read another one.

'Affinities' have been spotted, for example, between Beckett and Jacques Derrida -- another attempt to season Beckett in preparation for his comfortable digestion by our cultural machine. Derrida is simply far too 'contrived' for Beckett. Only a half-minded philosopher like Maurice Blanchot could be said to be truly 'sympathetic' with our Irish writer. As long as the 'relationship' between these two is concerned, Ms. Michiko Tsushima has done a great job not so much in analysing their 'affinities' as in exploring the possibilities of their dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was ripped off too.","review":"I ordered this cd and got a reggae greatest hits set.

In fact, if you liked \\"Alien,\\" you'll probably like this, the main difference of the two films being the different setting and a different cast.The cast may be different but the characters are the same: scientists-heroes who are all profane low-life-types who you would never see in professions and positions like this. Only in the world of film do you see sleazy people like this in high-tech intelligent positions such as astronauts or scientists. Who better to exemplify this in the 1980s than self-proclaimed macho man Kurt Russell?Back to the positives: besides the great suspense, the story is an involving one that hooks you in fairly early and never lets go. I have a widescreen VHS copy which looks nice, too, since the visuals definitely warranted a widescreen viewing experience. I suspect a Blu-Ray verson of this would really look great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent horror","review":"This film when released was way ahead of it's time.

This DVD also contain the making of the movie which is fasinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buried for years?? A great movie!!","review":"1982. I challenge you to show this film to someone who has not heard of it; shouldn't be hard. Ask them at the end when they think it was made. Their answer will not be 1982. The video transfer is nothing short of genius, when you consider the age of the source. The audio is pretty good too. Did they have 5.1 back then? Don't think so. The film itself is a masterpiece of terror (I am not a Carpenter fan). The fact that the cast is all male adds tension, to an already taught situation. The casting for this film is spot on. Russell is excellent as \\"Macready\\" and Wilford Brimley's performance deserves a mention too. The last ingredient that makes this film a classic is the special effects work of Rob Bottin. Some of it looks too real.Oh and it also happens to have some of the best special features on any DVD to date.If you don't own it on DVD, then why do you even have a player?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better as the years pass.","review":"Growing up I was very fond of the '51 version of John W. Campbell's story. One of my favorites that I made sure I watched every year. When VCR's strolled along it was one of my first movies I picked up. John Carpenter's story is closer to Campbell's work and is a very good movie with a compelling cast. it gives you the feeling of being isolated right along with the characters and you even start to wonder who is human and who isn't.This movie has become a cult classic and another movie, possibly based on Dark Horse Comic's, would have a good following too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than they say it is","review":"Professional critics have never given this film its proper respect. Much is made about the gorefest special effects and their alleged domination of other film elements.But this movie has a lot more going for it. Begining with the opening scene, confusion decends on the ill-fated outpost. Mistrust degenerates into paranoia as the trapped explorers realize they are unable to tell who among them remains and who has been replaced. Nothing is as it seems. Slowly characters and audience alike realize there is no way out. To his credit, Carpenter doesn't invent one. Yes, the effects can be rough, especially on the young viewer (remember the R rating). But this film is more than just an excuse for movie slime. It's a study in claustrophobia and worth the view. Moreover, the DVD format nicely fits the bill as previous VHS versions were disappointing. There are too many dark shots for video tape. The current release benefits greatly from the superior detail offered by DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a Thing","review":"The thing is by far one of the greatest horror movies ever made, it's one hell of a paranoia TripI wish they'd go back to the style of animation and effects they used in this movie.

This movie, which frankly speaking didnt do remarkably well at the box office because it came out at the same time as E.T. but did do well as a home movie is, in a word, terrifying. Its set at an arctic research base where a cast of characters including Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley stumble upon an alien life form and the results are gory and jarring.

Alien works; Buck Rogers doesn't. The Thing still looks fresh today, 22 years after it was produced. Thanks, in no small part, to Rob Bottin, the hirsute, smiley-faced effects genius who appears on one of the DVD extras. Here we have a man who seems to love what he does for a living, dramatically recounting some of the gorier effects he produced for the movie.John Carpenter must also take a lot of the credit; the casting is spot-on and the suffocating atmosphere in the movie keeps you gripped until the end reel.The DVD Collectors Edition has a great commentary featuring Carpenter and Kurt Russel laughing it up recalling and retelling anecdotes regarding the movie's production. Not worth docking a star for but I would have liked the alternative ending to have been on the DVD, too. Watch the skies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool,","review":"This was an interesting movie.

I had talked it up to my foreign-born wife, thinking it would be close to the James Arness \\"Thing.\\" I think Carpenter tried too hard to be different, or more complex. The monster alien was spaghetti on grasshopper legs, with facial gyrations that reminded me of the Arnold flick of Total Recall. I really think the 1951 movie was better, despite it being in B&W with no great special effects. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its just about which cover you prefer","review":"I like this cover (the one with the man with no face) better than the other cover (the face covered in snow).

Just pick the cover that you liek best.Other than that, this is one of the most claustophobic movies you'll ever see. Its really one of the scariest I've seen.

I'm really into scenarios where there is a small group of motivated, interesting people that are locked into a situation and required to overcome some weird dilemma. Throw in some techie stuff, an alien or two, some shotguns and various other weapons, and some rough-and-tumble he-man types, and you've got a seriously engaging flick to occupy some quality time.The Thing fits this formula exactly.

Seeing it in the blu-ray (worth every penny) revealed incredible detail I'd never noticed before, making this familiar film a whole new experience.

It exceeded my high expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah the eighties, before things went horribly wrong...","review":"Say what you will but the Thing was made during a time before rancid pretentiousness infected early every piece of Hollywood.

If you want to listen to awful music then go to your local record store and browse the Moby bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray is missing key features...","review":"The transfer looks great, but the blu-ray skimps on the features that were included on the normal DVD. There is no 80-minute documentary. Now you only get the picture in picture feature during the film. The original stereo audio track is not included in the audio options. Now, you only get 5.1 mixes. Not everyone has a surround setup. The isolated score that was on the DVD has been removed.Beware, if you're replacing your DVD copy. While the film looks better and the aspect ration has been corrected, it's missing all the above stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the best horror film ever made?","review":"Now I know Alien might even be a better movie than The Thing but I really believe that this is the best horror film ever produced.

I have it on videocassette,then Laserdisc, then several DVDs, then HDDVD and now on Blu-ray.You can't call yourself a sci-fi or horror fan till you've seen this movie -- there are lots of reviews online if you need a synopsis.The Blu-ray edition of this film has most of the documentaries already out before, but again, they're only standard definition here.

Carpenter takes his liberties in unfolding the story, but these gross-out effects are sure to keep you awake for awhile. More menacing than disturbing, this film is not THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL or 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and certainly if you like TV shows (TWILIGHT ZONE, THE OUTER LIMITS, LOST IN SPACE) you'll be put off, but those who can use their diabolically sickening imaginations should eat it up.

Excellent paranoid thriller is superbly directed by John Carpenter, who captures the tension with pitch-perfect tightness. Very good acting all-around (Kurt Russell's great), and Rob Bottin's gore effects are appropriately shocking. Suspenseful to the max, with only a few logic lapses to slightly mar an otherwise brilliant effort. Sorry, slasher fans, but The Thing, not Halloween, displays Carpenter's abilities in full glory. Tied with In the Mouth of Madness as Carpenter's greatest work to date.**** 1/2 out of *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still holds up","review":"Outstanding film, even 20+ years later.

Carpenter crafted a tale of isolation and paranoia that was unrelenting. An ensemble piece by a all male cast, (rare even today), that was superb. Kurt Russell played the ultimate reluctant hero/leader in MacReady. Even the 2011 prequel which I liked was not as engaging as this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"easily one of the best remakes if not movies ever made.

There are scenes in this movie where JC raises the tension and suspense to a level unrivalled by any horror film. (For example, the scene where the characters are all tied to their chairs along with the alien was exquisitely suspenseful) However, the movie does have gratuitous blood and gore scenes, and ends rather lamely, with a typical hollywood action scene; this scene was completely incongrous with the rest of the movie, with its chilling and subtle psychological suspense and build up. Despite these weaknesses, I completely recommend this movie to anyone interested in horror, sci-fi, or just a plain old good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, one of Carpenters best","review":"This is a great movie.

It had no humanity, and none of the commarodery of the original, and he managed to wring all the atmosphere from this movie, down to the last ounce! I know that the more gore the merrier, but it now leaves nothing to the imagination, and in the end death was not nearly swift enough. Sad to say, that one of the classic sci-fi movies of all times is now out of print; if you can manage to rent of a version of the original 1951 Thing, From Another World, you will be treated to sci-fi at it's best!

If only they had a universal translator or spoke Norwegian! The Thing may have been state of the art in 1982, but it just looks cheap in the 21st century where we are used to awesome CGI effects.I cannot believe that these men are \\"researchers\\" - they seem more guys you would find in a police station, both the cops and the criminals. So, you can get high at the research station? And roller skate around it? Not very professional, indeed.Kurt Russell channels Escape from New York's Snake Plissken for John Carpenter who directed both films. How does Kurt's R.J. MacReady, who is the station's helicopter pilot, know everything and always have the right answer? MacReady wears the worst hat ever worn in the movies.Don't bother with this unbelievable farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thing is out of this world!","review":"What a show! Carpenter has long been a favourite director of mine and I think that this is one of his best. He brings such a feeling of isolation and paranoia to this film that you you cannot take your eyes off it. Perhaps the best accolade that I can give this film is that when I watch it I begin to think what I would do in that situation - it all seem realistic (in a sci-fi kind of way).

To hear them talk about what they went through making the film, laughing about memories, etc. gave me a different insight into one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Horror films ever(although alot of people wouldn't agree). But, the film over the years has gained a following and viewing this DVD only made me love the movie even more. I love to watch it with someone who has never seen it and watch their reaction to some of the really scary moments in the film. The special effects are AWESOME and, in my opinion have never been equalled since. The best way to do that would be to make a sequel. John Carpenter....what are you waiting for??

There is no holding back, there is mutations everywhere.This is set in an Anartic research station and stars a very young ( and bearded ) Kurt Russel. Now this starts out when they find a charred thing outside the ruins of an other research station they bring it back to study. The rest of the movie is a phsycological horror fest with some pretty good eye-candy for 1982.My only gripe is a sequil that is a video game which is to frickin' hard to complete.The good side is that there is no movie sequil so then we can use our own thinking power to see what happens to Mcready and Childs... a.k.a. fan fiction at outpost31.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic; even better than the original","review":"The Thing was an obscure movie of the fifties and it was the real ALIEN predecessor.

The Thing was filmed at a time when creatures molded from plastic and by human hands were at their peak, as CGI was all but in its infancy. So, this movie will give you a real sense of fear and dread as you watch the story unfold. Set in Antartica, the sense of remoteness and the \\"nobody's coming to help us\\" aspect create a climate of self-reliance that really moves the action along.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

Even though this movie was made in the early 80's the special effects are very realistic and believable. It never fails to make me scream. But, more than just a monster movie, I enjoy the characters, the story telling, the spine tingling suspense and even the ambiguous ending. While it doesn't quite compare to Alien, another favorite scary movie with a similar theme, it is a very good movie for a Saturday night fright flick.I especially loved the behind the scenes \\"John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape\\" probably as much as the movie. Rob Bottin's description of his creative process and was absolutely fascinating and I loved seeing the set creation and on location filming. It was also really interesting to hear the actor's commentary.This is a very enjoyable movie, a great addition to a horror film collection and a timeless classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun as Blu-Ray, but UK version is better buy.","review":"I was watching the Collector's Edition of the movie, and it's definitely fun. I just wonder where I'm supposed to find the \\"Alternate Ending\\", as opposed to it being shown on TV once, or so I've heard. I like the crisp, crystal clear sound quality I recieved from Blu Ray on this movie, but with no extras, i condemn Universal for making such an unnecessary move. If you are looking for the thrill and re-digitizing aspect of good horror sci-fi making, then this is for you. However, if you have the Collector's Edition, and you plan to purchase the Blu-Ray edition, I strongly recommend that you keep the Collector's if you want those fun extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie excellent DVD","review":"I don't seem to get tired of seeing this. The film has a lot of great lines in it. The suspense builds as the characters try to determine who is \\"the thing\\". Carpenter may have gotten a bit gory in some spots for some people, but if you like his films it won't be a problem. I think this might be one of his best. One thing I really liked about the DVD was the commentary with Carpenter & Russell. It's very much like having them in the house discussing the movie. At one point you hear a loud \\"cling\\" of a drink glass or ashtray that kind of adds to that feeling. Listening to them say stuff like \\" yep\\" \\"here it comes\\" \\"he's toast\\" keeps the movie fresh over time.

Even though she was the first First Lady of any country to have had a ph.d, she comes across in this book as very opportunistic, seeming to play any part necessary to keep herself out of the poverty she came from. And an awful lot of the book is devoted to frivolous matters, like what a clothes horse she is, or what they eat, and the decorations of their various abodes. She just seems hard and self-serving here. And not a little selfish. There is some description of conditions in Russia at the time, but thrown in as a side line only. And at times the writing was a little disjointed, times and dates being out of synch. A book I could have easily skipped. Perhaps as a foreign journalist stationed in Russia, Jurgens just didn't have access to enough info, but then why bother to write the book at all?

I am very-very critical when it comes to musical content and quality. I am more forgiving of video editing/quality since to me it's all about the music. That being said the REO portion of the disc suffers from neither.EVERY member of REO brings something to the table here people. Especially refreshing are Dave Amatas guitar riffs and Brian Hitts Fabulous drum performance. However, Neil, Bruce and Kevin are no slouches either. This is 1 of the tightest concerts ever recorded IMHO. This is the disc that I consistantly grab when I want to get up and ROCK.Don't miss \\"Keep on Rolling\\" @ the very end of the disc AND be sure to give a listen ALL of the STYX \\"Brave New World \\" songs other wise buy \\"Return to Paradise \\" for the rest of their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Show","review":"This is one of the best concerts I have ever seen. I attended the actual show that they is presented on the DVD. When I found out a DVD was coming out, I had to buy it.

The sound quality is great on the first part of the video featuring Styx, but is poor during the REO set. Sounds like they are recording it in a tunnel with the mic on one end and the band on the other end... can barely hear Kevin Cronin sing. The only complaint of the Styx segment is too many hits are not being preformed. No one wants to hear a 20 year old band do some obscure album track or non hit , people want to hear the hits... where is \\"Come Sail Away\\", \\"Grand Illusion\\" and others ? I would give this a C- rating"},{"rating":"2","title":"Styx/Reo Speedwagon..Still the best.","review":"I was lucky enough to be at the Arch Allies show when it was taped. If you want to see two bands that truly enjoy what they do, then buy this dvd. Styx plays their hits and throws in some of their songs from the Brave New World cd, and even with the replacements, Gowen and Sucherman, they are still Styx. I didn't miss DDY at all. And with Glen Burtnik back with the band, it makes the show that much better. Another bonus is Chuck came to St. Louis to perform with the band. Reo Speedwagon keeps getting better every time I see them. Kevin Cronin still has the pipes to bring you back in time when Can't Fight This Feeling and other songs were on the radio. You can tell that Reo is humbled and proud to still be playing in front of thousands of old and new fans. The jam at the end with both bands is great. Being there and seeing it live was the coolest thing I ever saw. Get a piece of rock history and buy this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent...but not great","review":"Overall worthwhile, but with some disappointments. Styx sounds great but man that keyboard spinning all around is really annoying. They just aren't the same w/o Dennis but Tommy does sound great.I love REO but Kevin's voice has really lost it's power. It's like he's trying to save it, or maybe just been too many nights on the road. Whatever the case he sings pretty gingerly. The Gary replacement plays great but he seemed to be buried in the mix rather than at the forefront as you'd expect in a rock and roll show. Still a rocking good time (did they need to play Blue Collar Man twice??) and worth the $$ if you haven't been able to catch them live. BTW I thought the camera work was good - not too many annoying audience shots!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment for Styx fans","review":"If you're a fan of the classic Styx sound, this DVD is not for you.

I have been using this book for over 3 years and find it invaluable. Don't forget, it has 501 roots and this actually means a lot more verbs. Easy to use once you get used to it. Very worthwhile for any student of this difficult language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Publisher take note: we need this book in HARDBACK!","review":"Since most of us who are involved in Hebrew study use a reference book like this constantly, why is it in paperback? Even with careful handling, a thick book like this doesn't stand a chance in paperback. Within a year the owner must contend with loose pages, as others in my class have also discovered. If this problem were corrected, I would immediately rank this as a 5-star book because it contains many verbs along with their vowel markings, and it is far easier to use than Tarmon's Hebrew Verb Tables. (It's good to have both books!) Another problem: Many verbs aren't listed in the index, even though they are actually in the book. This can be frustrating--especially if a person isn't sure of the root of a word. But, aside from these two problems, the book is indispensable to the student of Hebrew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusingly Organized","review":"The earlier 201 Hebrew Verbs was a masterpiece in that each root's conjugations (binyanim) were presented in the exact same order. In this volume the author chooses to order the binyanim by frequency of use. This is of no value to a student of Hebrew who has to master each binyan's pattern of conjugation. All it does is confuse. In 201 Hebrew verbs, if you wanted to memorize \\"Kal\\" you would find in on the top left of each set of facing pages and you could compare and contrast slight variations in \\"Kal\\" by comparing the same location on different pages. You can't do that with this edition making it useless.The inclusion of example phrases is nice, but the lack of consistent organization makes my blood boil and makes it useless as a tool to teach the language.Go back to the older format. Please!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Usful book","review":"I looked at this book many times...The author is a professor at my college...He is a wonderful professor and he did a good job on the book...It was usfeul for me who couldn't remember some of the words that I have learned so far...It is a better than the book that I am currently using...but at the same time it also helps with the book that I am currently using and it also lets me expand my learning for the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but confusing order","review":"The book is very helpful, filled with not only the verb conjugations and meanings, but examples, as well. Five hundred and one verbs will get you pretty far in most languages. The only ding against this book, and it's an important one for anyone who has been reading Hebrew for more than a few months is that it is written English style, from left to right, opening with the binding to the left. This can really mess with your mind when you're trying to find a word! By the time you're ready for a reference like this, you're familiar with the alef bet and have probably used a few Hebrew dictionaries. So, as you're looking a a word up, you start with alef and one and and expect tav and the other and look words up in the middle according to that order. It would be helpful if the next version of the book were bound in the opposite direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"Thorough. Organized. Pagination as an English book, which always feels a bit odd. Lots of examples. Nicely printed. Biggest problem is that there are no groupings of paradigms. For instance, I want to see the possible forms of a Pe Ayin Ayin verb, as TaMaM let's say. There is no way to find one. This is where the now buried but much mourned Luach haPoalim shone--you could find a paradigm for any root.

This book gives only some of the forms, and in descending order of frequency of use. It leaves out the rarer forms such as pu'al. Also, it uses far to much full (plene, or malei) spelling for a book with vowels."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing and disorganized","review":"If this book had followed the format of Barron's first Hebrew verb book, 201 Hebrew Verbs, it would have been great. In that work, every verb was clearly spread out over two facing pages. You could see every possible form of each verb all at once, and for each verb, you could always tell on which part of the page you would find each conjugation, since it was the same for each verb.This book has only one advantage, and that is the higher number of verbs. It is lacking in clarity and organization. I am a Hebrew teacher since the 70's, and have always used 201 Hebrew Verbs with my students. This book, 501 Hebrew Verbs, would be useless for my students. I can barely follow it myself.I would strongly recommend that Barron's consider a revision... keep the same verbs, but arrange them the same way the previous book did."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"This item arrived in time and as expected.

I had to use a tuner so that i would place the first bar in the right place. It was quite easy to place it on the violin also. I hope it will come out just as easily. You cannot feel it with your fingers when you play.I would recommend it to all players especially those who are learning without a teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well once you get it properly fitted","review":"The trick to this tool is that you have to have the bridge positioned in exactly the right spot, and you need to get the size that works with your bridge position. So ignore the violin/viola size and only look at the string length.Typically your bridge is placed aligned with the little tick marks in your F holes. But to use these appliques, you must place the bridge so that the length of the strings matches the length indicated on the side of the applique. Choose the size of applique that is closest to your natural string length (nut to bridge) then tweak your bridge location accordingly.The reviewer with the German violin may wish to try a different size in order to get it to work. Just because it says 4/4 violin doesn't mean that is the size she actually needs.

By the end, you will be wonderfully surprised by your ability to complete an authentic bollywood dance. All in all, it's a great workout, easy to follow along, and tons of fun!

Although this book has cool pictures, it leaves out a lot about the Sailor Scouts. I recommend it to only those people that are just learning about Sailor Moon. It briefly explains each characters power and their transformation. The only thing that I like about this book is the pictures. They are really cool, and their are some pictures I've never before seen. Also, this book lacks a page on Sailor Jupiter's and Sailor Venus' (my favorite character) descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"OK. I know some of you may be offended by my rating, so let me explain...Meet Sailor Moon is a good book for children, ages 5-7. (If you're older, try the Sailor Moon Junior Readers.) For others, like me, who are ULTIMATE FANS, this book has no meaning whatsoever. It is around 18 pages long and the descriptions are not detailed! I mean, they leave out the Outer Senshi and Sailor Chibimoon!!!If you REALLY want to check it out, try and find it in a bookstore. Then read it there. I mean, it takes you only 5 minutes at the most.

Well,I hate to say this,but unless you're REALLY obsessed with the show,you might be better off buying something else instead. There is nothing in this book that a Sailor Moon fan wouldn't know already. And it's not a very good introduction for those who don't watch Sailor Moon and would like to know more about it, either...It's not incredibly accurate. Therefore, there is no point in buying Meet Sailor Moon. Its only redeeming qualities are the illustrations.

Otherwise Windows 8 recognizes the monitor as a generic monitor. This is not that big a problem though.

I have thick wavy hair. Like one other reviewer noted, it doesn't do the ends very well, I had thought it was because I needed my ends trimmed, but I guess not. For the rest of the length though, it does great.

It also \\"crimps\\" when you turn it to tight, whereas the CHI would always leave a nice curl no matter what!I have only given it this long so that I could ensure that it wasn't \\"seasonal\\" dry hair, or elements, etc. This product just plain STINKS!

My hairs are coarse and thick so I was looking for something that doesn't give my hairs that dry unhealthy look. I was willing to spend more but not at CHI price range. My flat iron also broke finally, so I had to purchase one quickly. Let's just say that it doesn't work that much better then a $20 one that I bought from the store.

Product should last longer than 5 months!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Effective but dangerous.","review":"The main issues I have with this iron is that it gets incredibly hot on the outside felt area (near the ceramic tongs), and that in combination with the problem that the hand clamp (when used as intended, with your hands on the half of the iron near the cord) does not entirely depress the tips of the ceramic iron together means you have to clamp down further up on the iron (using the felt area) in order to get it to properly depress all the way. Since the iron is poor at keeping the heat only in the ceramic iron part of the tool, you're probably going to be getting your hand burnt if you really want to use this tool effectively.To me that is a fundamental failure in the design of this iron and I can't recommend it at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Just got these for Christmas. They are great. They heat up quickly, and get hot enough to straighten my African American hair. The curved edges keep my hair from being snagged.

But my daughters hair took so long to straighten and about time I was done, she was upset and I was left with an aching arms and burns on my fingers. I think the old fashioned heat on the stove top iron will work best for my child. She has that biracial hair- half afro american, half white- so it's very thick, curly and long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work well, but...","review":"I have had this flat iron for 2 months now and it seems to deliver each time. I have a multi-ethnic (native american, caucasian, african, asian) hair type so to get my curls straight takes lots of heat, time and effort and this product sure delivers HEAT! Thankfully the heat's adjustable. My only uncertainty comes from not being sure that the plates are really ceramic. The color of the plates is a bit off and looks a little too metalic. Thus, I am not sure about the long term effects on my hair (which is natural and has no chemicals in it). For those who have chemially straightened or coloured their hair I would be even more careful about getting this product in the event the plates aren't really ceramic. I wish the manufacturer would get back to me on whether the plates are truly ceramic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I bought this straightener because I wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp.

It heats up quickly and has various heating levels. I was very impressed with how quickly it heated up since my old one used to take a while. I used to have to step away in between doing sections of my hair to let it heat back up but this flat iron stays hot and gets there pretty quickly.I love the soft velvet type coating on the back of the heated plates. This iron fits great in my hand, is easy to use and most importantly, doesn't snag or pull on my hair. I almost ordered one of the more expensive ones but decided to give this one a chance first and I'm really glad I did. This is a wonderful iron and can be used on all hair types. Just make sure you set the heating setting to the correct number for your hair type.

If you wrap your hair around and try to pull the iron, your hair will hesitate on the velvet and burn or create kinks. My hair is already straight and now this is a complete waste of money for me.

I used the saw for about 6 or 7 months and could not get accurate 45s, the clamp block that locks in angles other than the preset ones broke and the fence is not easy to adjust because there is a groove milled into the table that it sits in and adjusting the detent plate is a pain unless yo uhave a star driver on hand.Dust collection sucks!Bottom line, buy a makita, or if you want a 12\\" look at the Metabo KGS 305 I just bought one and am Very impressed with fit and finish, it has marks for pitch cuts for cutting rafters and a lever for setting at any angle for repeat cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy I paid that much for it","review":"I'll sum up the only flaw that matters. Its ability to return to 0 bevel.The way the bevel detent/lock works is when you flip the lock actually bends a piece of steel up to release. With lock engaged that piece of steel still flexes and lets the bevel move over 1 degree. This is a real pain when you want to cut crown angled against the fence and base, or cutting trim vertical against the fence.Rough in carpentry is about all that i would recommend this saw for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy DEWALT718 miter saw","review":"I ordered this saw after reading good and bad reviews, hoping that the bad reviews were unfounded. Well they're not! The detent locking system for the dual bevel tilt consists of 3 pieces of adjustable metal plates. They were hard to adjust, one of the adjusting screws stripped out the aluminum threading and even when locked in and tightened down there was play in the saw when pressure added, causing a different angled then wanted cut.

So we had to make ones and attach them with the 1 1/2 inch of melamine that we used. Another thing the dust collector is poor.

I use the Freud blade for laminate instead of the contractor series from Dewalt. The cuts are smooth & chip free. Lots of power from the motor. Didn't even slowed it down with a 2.5\\" thick cut in MDF. The cut settings are right on & with the additional work table (you build it) a 16\\" rip is unmatched by other saws.

Great quality blade, great cut, dead on. The saw was heavy duty metal that did what it was supposed to. I got a little greedy when I saw some of the features on the new 718 model like the bevel presets and laser capability.Here are the complaints... First of all. With the old 708 you could grab the handle anywhere to depress the blade. The first time I grabbed the handle and depressed the blade on this new 718, the plastic blade guard swung up and sliced the skin off my thumb. I cannot believe that made it through product testing. Second issue is just general quality of construction and materials. The 718 is such lightweight low quality aluminum that I cannot believe it will stand the test of time. Honestly, it is hard for me to accept that both these saws came from the same company.It is sad what Dewalt has let happen to their product quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"DW718 Not a finish saw","review":"If you are going to build furniture, cabinets that sort of thing.

No more Dewalt for me, they can keep their Chineese and Mexican junk. Selling at american made prices, and made at 30 cent an hour labor--sickning. I don't look at them as Dewalt products, I look at them as cheap Mexican and Chineese products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"Im a General Contractor and a carpenter.

This saw is junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality saw- accuracy right on.","review":"I bought this despite the reviews from folks like Jay Concepcion who I think works for another company. Most of my tools are from Dewalt and I have I had little disappoint from black and yellow label. I used the DW 718 for basement boards in my entire house and have started to use it for remodeling my kitchen cabinets. Out the box there were no craftsman defects and it was nice and clean. The 45 and 90 degree angle slots out of the box were correct and did not require any additional calibration. It cut quickly, accurately and smooth everytime. The only complaint I have with this saw is the dust collection. It is horrible. Dewalt should not call it a dust collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"I was excited to receive my new Dewalt saw. While making some test cuts to align the laser add-on I noticed the saw did not cut square or perpendicular as much as 1.5 degrees out. I never expected to have to set up a new saw before I could use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst saw ever","review":"This saw has SERIOUS issues regarding performance. Believe me it really is that bad...I run a workshop and bought this with confidence as a site saw. It never seems to cut a perfect mitre even when setting the blade with a digital bevel box, somehow the blade decides to cut with a mind of it's own and has wasted a lot of my time and money.If your looking for a saw to chop up off-cuts for the stove then it's perfectly fine but for anything related to joinery look elsewhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've used a DW708 for finish carpentry for years and have been satisfied. However, the Dw718 is a different story. The biggest issues for me was the rough slide and inaccuracy. Others I know industry agree that DeWalt let us down with this saw. Get a Bosch or Hitachi. I hear the Makitas are nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped the ball big time","review":"This saw is terrible compared to the older 708. I like a few of the changes where they tried to make shortcuts for beveling with the adjustable stops and an easier accessible bevel lock but it all stops there. Completely innacurate no matter how much you try to dial it in. Uneven tables warped bases and fences and the fit and finish is terrible. It looks like someone spray painted silver over a dirty rusty saw base. Took it to dewalt 2 times to repair trunnions and they kept scratching their heads after full replacement and said they got it as good as they could get it. Would not replace it. $700 piece of Mexican garbage. If you own a 708 and are thinking of upgrading don't do it. If you are looking for a new saw then go buy a used 708 or even an older makita. Dewalt always had the trophy for 12 slider, now they no longer produce a single decent tool. Just yellow and black n decker. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw","review":"The Dewalt DW718 sliding compound miter saw is built very well and works extremely well. The vacuum system chute is very poor. It misses about 90% of the sawdust while using a powerful vacuum.The DW7187 laser system leaves a lot to be desired. It is difficult to adjust and cannot be adjusted properly to the right side of the blade.The DW723 miter saw stand is built very well and is very functional. It extends to handle 16 ft. lumber and folds, making it easily portable. The saw can be easily installed or removed by releasing two clamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Size Capacity but everything else sux!","review":"I bought this about a year ago and I will tell you one thing.

These batteries were terrible about holding a charge. Additionally, after I purchased them I found out that there were \\"knock-offs\\" that had infiltrated the market with significantly lower quality than the real thing. I don't know if that's the reason for my poor experience, but I've already had to throw some of them out after only a few weeks as they no longer hold a charge, and they turn extremely hot to the touch when I put them in a charger. If you're looking for an excellent rechargeable battery that you can depend on to hold its charge for an extended period of time I would suggest the Sanyo Eneloop"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Eneloop instead","review":"For only $0.92 more you can buy the Eneloop AAA 4-pack. I thought these batteries would give better service being rated for 900mAh versus 800mAh for Eneloop, but I needed to consider the rapid self-discharge rate of the Sony batteries. The Eneloop batteries will give a longer useful life in most applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good batteries.","review":"I bought this in December 2007 for less than $10 bucks here and i used them for my sony digital voice recorder. I used the recorder for lectures and other stuff as well as a speech lesson i was taking. I'll say they do take about 4hrs to charge, and it holds the charge pretty well. I think when i started for my voice recorder, they'll hold a charge for a week or so. In terms of using them for back to back 2hr lectures, i think they last for at more than 12hrs of recording. i usually recharge at the end of the school week. I usually recharge them when my recorder shows a single bar or 2 left. They are good batteries, i still have them except i had to buy extra ones last week because i use the old ones for my recorder and remote as well as my TI-83 calculator and i'm getting tired of swtiching batteries between those three items.

I charge-discharge all my AA and AAA NiMH batteries in the MAHA MH-C401FS made by Powerex. This charger keeps them in pristine shape.

I like to refrigerate it then eat a couple squares (read: half the bar) chilled and crunchy jagged. Most Americans will find this chocolate too bitter for their taste, at only 5g sugar per half bar serving. But if you're the type who likes your espresso straight up, and bitter flavors in general... you will HEART this chocolate! It also may not be as bitter the 2nd and 3rd time you try it... so hang in there and at least eat up the entire bar.I just reallyreally wish they'd find a better substitute for the soy lecithin.... which is the only reason why I took away one star.

No sketchy additives or high amounts of sugar here! Just honest amounts of protein, magnesium, fiber, and good fats. And less sugar than a serving of ketchup.Finally... the price is fair for the amount of chocolate in a bar. I eat about 1/3-1/2 a bar a day, and this is my \\"indulgence\\".

This is definitely not an everyday type chocolate for me--a bit too sharp. Still, for a once in a while taste, it's marvelous. It's creamy and complex and has very subtle nuances. When I say 'sharp', I do not mean bitter! It is just a more powerful punch of cacao if you're not used to it. It smells divine and was in perfect condition when bought. I'll definitely be buying this brand again (and perhaps in some of their other flavors too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing - bland,sweet and dry","review":"Being a great fan of 85% plus chocolate I was excited to try this 88% product. What a disappointment! It manages the remarkable feat of being bland at 88%! It lacks flavour (tastes like extremely cheap chocolate), has a poor, dry mouth feel and is overly sweet. I suspect the presence of Soy Lechtin is not helping. It is very light in colour compared with similar strength chocolate - again amazingly so for a claimed 88% bar. If you only eat 85% plus chocolate then it is unlikely you will enjoy this chocolate :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by heat","review":"I was keen to know what this chocolate tastes like though unfortunately when it arrived it was clear it had melted sometime during shipping which changed the structure and turned a bunch of it back into cocoa powder.

Early on, comparisons to the Byrds dogged their steps. Now, the church has moved on and is combining influences and innovations in surprisingly fresh ways. Witness the (dare-I-say-it?) jam-oriented feel of some tracks while being overwhelmed by the subdued jangliness of both lead guitarists and steve kilbey's almost vicious, certainly clever repartee with his inner demons. This albums also displays the keen talents of monster drummer and erstwhile producer tim powles, who is without a doubt their most capable and energetic drummer ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bollocks to the Folks Who Diss Earlier Church CDs","review":"I don't know what type of earwax has been clotting the brains of some of the folks who have reviewed baal, but the ONLY blot on the Church's record is part of Sometime, Anywhere--there are at least 7 songs on it that suck, which is made up for on the bonus CD that accompanies it, since all 7 songs on it are great. Bollocks, I say, to the infirm of ear who didn't like Golden Afternoon Fix or Magician Under the Stairs. What a load of crud--those CDs are actually better than Baal, although Baal is good.

But for some reason they changed the head for the figure and I'm not really feeling it. The expression is so bland it's not even funny.

I felt that I never got to really know the Sonya character. She was one big mystery. Her past and secrets should have been disclosed in the beginning making her Jovan's Bonnie to his Clyde. That would have made for a better story to tell. The innocent love-struck and over-bearing character she portrayed didn't quite fit later developments.

The sister and her husband were scam artists. The father was a pretend disabled wierdo who treated his living son like crap. And Jarod, OMG, I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jemaine Clement, he is so super hot, but what a dick in this movie. I just wanted to smack him in every scene. A deadbeat father, an a-hole who will invite a girl to stay with his family and then dump her a few days later.

Our history books have misinformed us and downright lied about the experiences of so many people as if they did not exist. When we speak of genocide the first thing ringing in our ears is the Holacaust in Germany and what happened to 6 million Jews. What about the 20 million Armenians on April 24,1919 (or thereabouts). What about 9 million Africans drowned in the Middle Passage. How about the annihilation and almost termination of the indigineous people of the Americas. The importance of this book lies in taking a factual, first person, look at the other resident citizens of Germany who were also issued a death penalty under Nazi rule. Hopefully knowing the world wide experience of Genocide (still going on), we as people of the world can stop it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity","review":"Pity this book is out of print, for it is worth remembering that many millions of non Jews were enslaved and persecuted by the Nazis, the majority of whom were (as recently scholarship confirms) Ukrainians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary, but not particularly inspiring","review":"A book of this kind has long been needed. Friedman attempts to cover all the main victim groups although she was not successful in finding Survivors from all groups. Gay victims, for example, are mentioned but there is no account of an individual. Although the accounts are described as \\"first-person stories\\", they are all retold in Friedman's rather dull writing style which gives a sense of unity at the expense of expressing divergence. It would have been much more effective to have heard the Survivor's own accounts rather than Friedman's retellings of their stories. Overall, the book comes accross as a text book. Useful for teaching, but unlikely to be read without adult coercion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Pop-Rock","review":"Since the 1970's the Italian musician Renato Zero has been making highly original pop and rock music with meaningful and intelligent lyrics. Zerolandia (1978) is one of his most satisfying albums. The melodic, hook-laden \\"La favola mia\\" (My Story) open the album on a high note, being one of those poprock powerballads that becomes addictive after the second listen. \\"Io uguale io\\" (I equals I) is equally catchy, while \\"Triangolo\\" is a fast number with lovely strings and soaring vocals. \\"Sesso o esse\\" impresses with its unusual synth effects, while \\"Fermati\\" is a gentle ballad. \\"Amaro Madely\\" starts like a radio playing an old song from the 1930's before developing into a dramatic ballad. \\"Una guerra senza eroi\\" (War without heroes) with its marching beat is another catchy song, and the sax-heavy \\"Uomo, no\\" concludes his varied and enjoyable album. Zero's great talent lies in his integration of the tension and urgency of rock with the melodicism of the Italian popular song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marksman Grip ROX!","review":"This launcher is one of the best!

The violent work of the special death squads is chronicled in such a casual manner that the authors might just as well have been sending to Berlin a litany of materiel needs or a laundry list. The report from Kiev in late summer 1941, listing the tens of thousands killed at Babi Yar, remind one how casually these Nazi \\"supermen\\" seemed to go about their grisly business, at least at the outset of the mass killings. It also reminds one of how efficient the Germans were in keeping records--even of some of their worst genocidal atrocities.

The pictures are not very good when compaired to other camaras in its price range. Also think about how since the lens is fixed you cannot take a closeup picture of anything. It says in the owners manual that you the closest you can get is 1M. Think if it as you can't take a picture of text and read it as it will be too blury. The flash is also very weak as other people are saying. Don't get sucked in because of the \\"cool\\" factor of the camaras small size. I had one for a month then bought a Canon S200 to replace it.

Indoor shots with low light are bad, as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos. These are the drawbacks. I got this camera to have when I don't want to carry my larger camera and to take places that I would not otherwise have taken the other. It is cool and will draw a crowd. You will need to get an additional SD card if you want to take any number of pix, but they are cheap now.

I find Casio has great features on paper but after the sale service not at all satisfactory. Now I have a very simple 5MP Kodak Easyshare.

When I first listened to their music, I was blown away. These guys will rock your face off. They have a VERY dark and heavy sound, not the heaviest sound, but they have an amazing combo of great voals and great instrumentals. I would also like to add that Nothingface is NOT dead, in fact they will be releasing another album some time this year. If you like music that isn't like everything else out therem and if you like heavy, dark music, I HIGHLY recommend Nothingface."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"The best band in the world, easily put.

I view this record as a blueprint for alot of the bands that are big in the hardcore scene right now. Back in '98 not that many bands where screaming AND singing on the same song. And what the hell happened to them anyway. This is way better than Pacifier. I saw these guys live down in Misissippi once. They were really good, just ripped everyone all to hell. Anyway, listen to \\"Villains\\", \\"The Sick\\" and \\"Goldtooth\\". And then go punch someone in the face."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic...R.I.P.

None of those 17 bucks were wasted. You are probably thinking that Nothingface is \\"yet another nu metal band\\". Wrong. Nothingface, unlike many of the carbon copies, know how to deliver some brutal stuff. These tracks are all classics. \\"Breathe Out\\", \\"Goldtooth\\" and \\"So Few\\" are the best tracks on this CD, along with \\"Grinning\\", \\"The Sick\\" and \\"I, Diablo\\". I recommend this for people like me who don't necessary like nu metal, but they like the stuff by artists such as Helmet, Vision Of Disorder, Earth Crisis, Will Haven and Killswitch Engage. I guarantee that you will not waste a minute of your time. Calling this \\"nu metal\\" would be an insult. This is just straight forward metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Hardcore Albums!","review":"It is amazing how bands like Nothingface can be ignored by the public just because they don't get radio play.

Unfortunately, that isn't the case. The vocalist has the stereotypical death metal Cookie Monster growls and yelps. He sounds absolutely awful when doing soft vocals. The music is the predictable super-heavy 2-3 chord BS followed by a few seconds of softness. It's really nothing you've never heard before. The whole band comes off as a weak, talentless imitation of Disturbed, even though they came out before Disturbed. The reason it didn't get one star is because there really are much worse new metal bands out there. The band has potential, but they need a new vocalist and to learn to play longer riffs. If you like this and want something better, get Disturbed. They're so much better that it's frightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEAVY","review":"Nothing face first compares to such acts as SNOT and other Hardcore bands, then blends softone and melodic styling similar to Deftones and Spineshank, giving the listener a new feeling after every song"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Audio Guide for me","review":"definately. these guys haven't been around the longest, but their music is unbeleivable. from start to finish, the drumming, the bass, the guitar riffs, all unbeleivable. not to mention the vocals, which are in my opinion the best metal vocals worthy of the level of Dez Fafara of Devildriver, Bjorn of Soilwork, or Randy of Shadow Falls. Personally, i find the best track to be the last, Sick, with its unique quiet beginning, its catchy yet powerful chorus, and its also unique ending as it winds down this masterpeice.definately a must have for any metalhead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHINGFACE for President.","review":"I saw these guys open for Stuck Mojo and was blown away.

Well, I have to be completely honest: they changed 2004 for 2006 in most instances. I owned both and regret I bought latest edition myself. There were only few minute changes since 2002 and none of them affected answers (few question stems were re-written in 2004). So, if you're really want to waste your money, buy latest edition of Kaplan books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for step 1 prep","review":"Questions are very similar to USMLE step 1 stuff, but I found them to be a little brief. This book puts your knowledge to the test and does a good job too. However, don't plan on using it throughout second year. The questions are done by chapter and each chapter is comprehensive. In other words, if you find that you have finished cardio and GI physiology but are still deficient in other areas, don't even try to do a test in physiology. Otherwise you will be wasting your time picking through questions. If you are ready to review for step 1, this can be a quick cheap way of picking up the best questions from the Qbank. Oh, by the way, don't be fooled by the new edition every year. This book hasn't changed for years. They slap a new cover on each year to lure in suckers.

Buy this only for questions, because there are no \\"strategies\\" presented here. That section of this book is mostly just vague repition about studying a lot and testing yourself, and there is no clear study method presented.One of my friends recommended a smaller and cheaper, yet BETTER book called \\"How to study for the USMLE\\".

With the release of this new album, she has really surpassed anyone's expectations.Who would have thought you could take something golden (speaking of all of her past hits), and make them any better? She has completed this task in numerous ways.

But after a few more listens,I eventually opened up to it. 'Mary' is a truly amazing song, but I can't say the same about 'sweet dreams'. The version of Jackie's stregnth is wonderful and it makes up for Spark-which seems less emotional and doesn't tug at your heart so much. I was very disappointed that 'Cloud on my tongue' and 'Talula' weren't on the cd, and didn't see why 'Way Down' was even on it. But as always, Amos gives us an emotional ride with this cd as she has with her others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid Tori fan","review":"I, like many people, picked up this cd after work and couldn't wait to get home and listen to it. In the weeks before the release, I'd heard that it was going to be similar to a greatest hits album, but offering a new perspective on past work. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. I was expecting the songs to be like those of her live perfomances, where the song has a completely different sound and the only thing that you can recognize of the songs are the lyrics. Having said that, I do love the album! There are sounds and images brought to the forefront that were hidden in the original recordings.

However, I do think a better Tori Amos experience is to start with Little Earthquakes and work through the albums chronologically (skipping To Venus And Back).

As a general matter, I like the original versions of the songs better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good selection of Tori's music","review":"She's talented, her lyrics are amazing and her instrumentation is pretty intense.

I think it is unfair to call the performances and out take \\"phoned in.\\" It was meant to be a fun addition to the CD, and one should look at it as such.

As with every \\"Hits\\" disc in the history of the world, this is missing a few in my opinion, specifically \\"Past The Mission\\", and the recent \\"A Sorta Fairytale\\". I love that song.

I learned that you have to buy something to clean it with. How often do you have to clean it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This is a great little product that functions just as you would expect it to. The only thing that I can't speak to is the longevity of the unit as I've only been using it for a few weeks now. However I'm able to easily produce about 3 gallons a day, cleaning is easy and turn around time between gallons is low. Also many people talk about the noise of the fan, it's actually not that loud, similar to a higher end desktop computer.

The distilling process is one of the best purifying methods and this product does it well. It is a well thought out product. The water tastes great.

Hours of trying to attach the handle to the bottle, I finally succeeded in tightening the last screw. ( Failure after failure convinced me to look for a slightly longer screw with the same threads while searching among 40 or so possibilities in a box.) How was it that I was the only moron among so many satisfied customers? Then a light bulb went on. One customer mentioned loving the idea that the glass bottle could be stored inside the distiller. Of course that meant that no handle had been installed on the bottle. How many customers have given up or did not bother to attach the handle? After saying these unkind words, I want to say that I am extremely pleased with the water distiller. However, if you are mechanically dysfunctional like me, buy the Megahome Distiller with the plastic bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best water distiller ever","review":"This is the best water distiller ever. It is constructed of steel inside and out. The lid fits tightly on the machine and ensures that no steam can escape out of the seal. The fan is very quiet compared to another model. This distiller takes close to 5 hours to distill a gallon of water from a cold start. I am happy with this model, I would recommend it to a friend who was looking to buy a distiller. I also recommend using an appliance timer with the unit to turn it off before it boils dry. This keeps the inside of the basin from becoming dark and burning on deposits found in the water. It will also be easier to keep clean without too much scrubbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful clean water!","review":"One of the best purchases I have made. To see what is left in the machine after the water is distilled...well...YUCK. I am sure glad I am not drinking that junk any more.

It does make a noise but I would compare it to the fan in a microwave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Pleased","review":"I bought this so that I can use distilled water in my espresso machine to prevent lime build-up. This simple device is working perfectly. I don't know why eveyone is so worked up about the residue left behind in the tank. Perhaps there are so many minerals in our water in Irvine, but there's not much left behind and it doesn't have an offensive smell.

The internal Stainless steel parts were not properly cleaned during manufacturing though. They appear clean to the eye, but there is the oil and metal residue left from manufacturing the metal parts. I thoroughly washed everything with dish soap prior to the first use. The first batch of water was produced as expected, but it tasted strongly of metal. I rinsed every thing out and wiped out the boiler, and it left a black residue on the cloth. I filled everything with a water and baking soda solution, and will retry tonight. If this doesn't work I may need to return this, and find my wife a different unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable good quality water distiller","review":"Before purchasing this unit I did some research and found some other name brands that sold for around 600 dollars, I am sure that they probably do a goodjob but when it comes time to repair these more expensive units the parts are very expensive the parts can be almost as much as this unit from Megahome for 199.This water distiller is not loud at all, if you are watching TV or listening to music you wont notice that this unit is on. The water tastes great but you shoulduse two of the activated charcoal sachets as they recomend, the unit comes with 6.I filled the unit using fitered water from a faucet filter then I almost boiled the water before adding it into the distiller to speed up the whole process.From the point where you see the first drop of distilled water it will take 4 hours and 15 minutes to finish.Even though I was using pre filtered water I was still able to see the chemical(fluoride,chlorine) residue at the bottom of the distiller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Works well for a small but busy dental office.

Unfortunately I had to return the distiller. When I first used the distiller it produced, after aprox 3.5 hours, water with a strong metalic taste. I can't stress this enough. I could not drink it at all. But I thought that perhaps it needed a couple of uses to eliminate this awful taste so I tried again. Five times! It didn't work. The company suggested I distill with 2 cups of vingar mixed in with the water. It did not work. I then decide to return it. The company was reponsible enough to give me a full refund. I thank them for this. If you are looking for a distiller, and don't want your water to taste like a can, this one is not the one for you. I gave it 1 star because the machine did work and produced distilled water but with a big flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this product","review":"I have used this distiller almost every day since I got it.

I have a dental office and we use distilled water for our sterilizer, and I thought my time was too valuable to go to the grocery store. Before it stopped working....this was about as much work, but probably at a higher operating cost for the electricity, plus the additional a/c bill to cool the room back down.Might be useful if you live a long way from a grocery store with distilled water, but I 'd get a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The examiner","review":"I am so satisfied with this product that I purchasing another unit for member of my family.

I rated it one star to get a little attention because FYI, the bottle that comes with it is a #7 type plastic which contains BPA which is a little controversial. Putting warm water into it is a little mentally dissonant as one reason for going to distiller is to reduce chemicals that one drinks. I don't know if BPA is really an environmental threat (it probably isn't), but just call it informed consent.

My only complaint is one that others have mentioned....the exit spout for the water is very short so you can't use any other container to catch the water except the pitcher that comes with it....and you even have to have that one positioned exactly in the right spot, or the water will spill off down your counter to the floor...as it did on me once.But with all the news about the drugs and other pollutants showing up in tap water these days, I feel much safer using pure distilled water and taking care of my own minerals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Distiller","review":"Had this distiller almost 2 months.

I use the charcoal packets that were provided. Also been using trace minerals to add to moderate amounts to drinking water. I have a ready supply of up to 8 gallons of pure distilled water. We keep stocked and have been consisently using ever since it arrived. I have no complaints really.

I unplugged it and tried again after resetting the GFCI. Again, it blew the switch. Everything else that I plugged in works perfectly except the distiller.

It is easy to clean, easy to disassemble for cleaning, and the water from it is delightful.

A very good buy, I think.My main problem is that the carafe is really hard to pour from when it is full. Water seems to go all over the place. I am working on my technique, but it seems to be a design thing. Not a deal breaker. Just be sure you do not fill past the line in the distiller and the problem isn't quite so bad.FYI.

Unless, of course, you already believe the government is in cohoots with aliens, there are secret alien hide-outs and tunnels under sensitive military installations, etc. in which case everything falls into place as you might expect.

Studio 8 is excellent (though this comes with a Studio LE which is a trimmed-down version). But the video, that is captured using it, speeds up (or skips) once in a while (as if it is trying to catch up). To give an example, I had a video of a moving train. The train moves like a centepede in the video. From asking around, I heard that the USB must be the bottleneck. I think I have USB 1.0 and that must have been the problem. I hear that USB generally is not recommended for video capture. So, I went ahead and bought a PCI card for video capture.

Because it it stickless so there is a coating inside this pot. But the coating will corroded by the rice and water only after 1 year of using. Because I am afraid that we will eat the corrotions from the peeling in the pot. I have to replace this $100 investment with other rice cooker after using it for 2 years. I did not want to replace it until my husband said \\"Which one is more important, $100 or our health?\\" So I suggest if you are going to spend $100 on the rice cooker, find the one with the best pot--I bought Sanyan eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I though I got a bargain for $49.99, not so fast.The switch to \\"cook\\" can not be depressed and just left thepot sitting inside warm all the time. So my wife can notmake the steam rice for dinner and I have to investigatethe problem since I am an engineer. So I took the pot outand put someting flat to depress the inside center springbutton. The button can not be depressed to allow cookswitch to work. If I use finger to depress the buttonslightly deeper, which means below the bottom surface,then the cook switch works. But how can you use finger tohold the button below surface while the pot iscooking the rice? You can't unless I attach some disk tothe bottom of the pot to depress the button.

Some excellent set pieces, such as when for example \\"IT\\", the odd creature they discover on the magic beach, succeeds in cloning the 5 children to perform the tedious household chores devised by their barmy Uncle, and some splendid clashes between the occasionally irritatingly sensible children and their nerdish overweight cousin.I'm sure if this film had been made in America more would have been made of the absent father fighting in the trenches, who is only slantingly referred to in a rather stiff-upper-lip sort of way, but this is after all a British film and very faithful to the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, clean fun","review":"My daughter chose this movie during a recent visit to the local library.

Nesbit book Five Children and It hated this movie. I have also read the book, and the movie has very little in common with the original story. There is no eccentric uncle and cousin Horace or secret door in the greenhouse. The children are not sent to the country because of the war. Even the wishes the children make are not true to the book. My nine year old enjoyed the movie because she had not read the book.So, although it is pleasant, clean, family entertainment, I think E. Nesbit would have been disappointed at the adaptation of her book. It seems to me that the producers of this movie merely plagiarized E.

I really liked the story line of the book and the twists and turns but I thought that it could have flowed much better. The problem I had with this book was that each couple of pages changed to different characters and situations without giving many details, making the beginning somewhat confusing. I also was distracted and often thrown off by the constant mention of Menage's Canary yellow Escalade ESV with Burberry seats. There were also grammatical errors that were overlooked.

This book consists of lists of people or organizations who pose a threat to freedom and personal responsibility as judged by P.J. and those who contributed. Reading the book was a chore. I finished it more as a testiment to finishing that which I start, than entertainment and information. There are some chuckles in the book. If the reader is just learning about Mr. O'Rourke, I highly reccomend \\"Parliament of Whores,\\" as \\"The Enemies List\\" is more a tribute than enjoyable reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"This is, frankly, a terrible book. I'm a conservative, but I didn't find O'Rourke funny, clever, or insightful in the slightest. This book is exactly what it claims to be: a list. It is a sequence of long, boring lists of names, many of long-forgotten figures and celebrities. Explanations for the choices are rare, and superficial.The essay about Carter at the end is mildly amusing, if trite. The \\"why I am conservative\\" is slightly better, but nothing most conservatives haven't already heard a thousand times before, in a more articulate manner.I've never read O'Rourke before this.

When working the lower body the video focused primarily on the upper body so I could not see how the exercisers feet were positioned. Many of the shots taken were from a side angle as well. Would have been nice to see the exercisers feet perhaps photographed from above so that you could see the whole person and the reformer together while performing the exercises.

I also agree that assembly of this (as well as the runway disco) should be more permanent. The Bratz playsets are fun but they are pricey, not very durable or user friendly. We buy them because we don't want to disappoint the children.

In fact, I take Lunesta every night and have for years. But, Lunesta doesn't help me fall asleep. It helps me stay asleep.

After several uses I'm on my second bottle and convinced it works. It's very mild and I can't really tell its working, but that actually the reason why I like it. I don't feel drugged or delirious. I chew mine instead of putting it under the tongue for faster effect. I usually take it just before I lay down and it helps me \\"fall\\" into sleep easier. My thoughts turn into dreams which is why I can get to sleep. I work nights so I sometimes need to rely on a sleep aid to get to sleep.

It did not. This module eliminates any aspect of character free will in the game, even forgetting that an integral plot mechanic demands that the PC's die early on. It's very leading from the first day, and a very linear plot that demands the players not deviate one iota.It might make a good novel, but as an adventure, it's terrible. Add in all the mispelled words that the editor slept through, the stilted description, and sheer repetitiveness (how many times do I have to read \\"glowing coals in the fireplace\\" before the players get sick of hearing it? I counted three, there's probably more)of it all, and you'll probably do what I did after the first session - get the players out of there, and make a blood oath never to speak of the module ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice change","review":"If you are looking for a dungeon crawl this is not for you.

Loose and poorly placed buttons will give you lots of headache when you go on a trip, and battery life is quite short at less than 30 minutes when you shoot with the LCD. LCD framerate is also problematic. In short, the few dollars you save with this isn't worth all the hassle or anxiety over when it might break. Go with a Sony or Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Camera Ever!!!!","review":"I have used my camcorder about 5 times, on my 7 month old's 1st trip to Disneyland I went to change the tape at the end of recording, and put a new tape in. After changing the tape, the camera would no longer play nor record. Of course I was just out of the 1 year limited warranty, and now it will cost almost as much to fix the camera as it would to buy a whole new one. It has never been dropped, nor mistreated. It just stopped recording or playing for no reason at all. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture","review":"I bought this over 2& 1/2 years ago. The only problem I've had is the flip-out screen. It stopped working after 6 months, so I have to record through the viewfinder. But the picture quality is great for a non-digital format. It charges quickly. I do not film for hours upon end, so I haven't had problems with battery life.

Over all this camera has some good points, I must admit. The zoom on this camera is phenominal and it charges quickly.This camcorder, though, only lasts about 30 minutes, so it is hard to do any filming.

Not bad, but it could be improved..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, but quite entertaining","review":"I gave this book 2 stars based simply on its entertainment value: my friends and I have never had so much fun reading a book before. I would guess that the person that donated to our college's coffee shop did not feel the same.However, Ms. Spindal's advice is insulting and superficial at best. Sure, she has some down-to-earth common sense tips; but, as other reviewers have stated, if you need to be reminded to keep up with personal hygiene, you have other issues.Some of her advice is even disturbing: we can and should live without carbohydrates? I'd like to see some scientific studies that back-up that claim, Ms. Jindal. Also, a man that alphabetizes his bookcase should be avoided, but a man that has been in several failed marriages is still ok?All in all, I would not recommend this book for anyone that is not a wealthy urbanite."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!","review":"I think this book is harsh and unrealistic. I also met the author (at one of her OVER PRICED parties) and find her ways of meeting people to be extremely shallow... I say, love yourself the way you are. You do not need to change for someone else. And if you do, who wants them? To her, if you are not a young, Barbie doll, you will never find love. I guess she must be doing something right. She is making a lot of money off of her advise, parties and books. I would love to have my money back!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta love it","review":"This book is amazing. It is really straight to the point. I can't stand some of the reviewers on this page who can't handle it. I'm sorry if you were offended because she said homely people will not find a mate, and I know you probably can't afford cosmetic surgury. That is not what she was recomending. Why not just get a new haircut, put on some makeup, find some clothes that play up your best features, and go out there??!? There are plenty of men who don't look like models either. Believe me, there is someone for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Take it Too Seriously","review":"I found many aspects of this book quite helpful. For example, her make-up and fashion advice really helped improve my appearance. However, I can't take her too seriously, for example, hiring an image consultant is way out of my price range. I would nonetheless recommend the book, just please don't take everything to heart.An even better book on this subject is Why Men Marry Some Women and Not Others.

There is something for everyone in this book. No one is too old to learn new ways to relate to the opposite sex. Common sense plus all the things mom never told you, but should have! Not only does Janis share her expertise, which is legendary, but she provides resources to go to for added assistance and guidance. This is an empowering book that gives women the tools they need to get the love they deserve. I for one loved it. Bravo Janis, for telling it like it is and helping single girls everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use her services either","review":"I bought this book (and her other book, which I gave the same review) because I was required to purchase it in order to be in Ms. Spindel's database. I'm sorry to say there is nothing new or interesting in it.As a customer of her services, I have interacted with Ms. Spindel twice by phone. In both cases I have found her to be \\"in your face\\" aggressive. (I brought up the *fact that her fees unfairly vary from person to person, and that you get nothing for your $500--except filling out some forms with her assistant.)Ms. Spindel aggressively defends a business model that gives *nothing* to the customer after they give her $500. Pure genius if you don't have a conscience.If you research her online you will find others with similar experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Don't bother with this one.

It's only a guess but Spinel probably receives kickbacks from her resource guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw her on television","review":"She said plain people won't find a pot for their lid. She said the world is superficial. I'd already been to the bookstore, so it was too late. I was shocked to see she'd stolen most of her ideas from other writers in this genre. As a regular reader of this kind of book, I could not have been more surprised to see all the cliches. Pots, lids, superficial--doesn't she know we are people with hearts and souls and, most of all, feelings that can be easily hurt?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Serious About Getting Married : 365 Proven Ways to Find","review":"I saw the author on the morning news show on Sunday, Jan. 2. She said that homely single women WOULD NOT find husbands. Well, that takes care of a lot us single women and I didn't appreciate it. Not everyone can afford to have cosmetic surgery or to do a lot of the things this author was talking about. Sure didn't make me want to buy her book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there.","review":"The majority of this book is about looks (which I agree is important when attracting a man) but Janis thinks everyone over 100 pounds will never get married. If you are not 25, under 105lbs and live in a fashionable area of New York she does not think you have a chance. Some of the advice in this book is ridiculous..get professional blowouts, massages, a personal trainer, image consultant, veneers (which cost at least $15,000),etc. how many people can afford this? Also, she has several plugs in the book for service providers who are listed on her website. Does she get free service from all these people she mentions? There is some good advice but her New York attitude definitely shows throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book on relationships","review":"I have purchased in excess of 100 books on relationships, self-help. My hobbie.I have to say, this book is without question, the most worthless book I have ever purchased. It was written for a 5 year old. This book will not help you in any way.

The main message was that as women we had to look sexy, our best, nails, hair, clothes. The questionaire inquired nothing of real personality. I was very disappointed. This was not a book for real people. This book is for those that make judgements only on the surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something fun and helpful for women over 35!","review":"The aspect of this book I like the most is the tip format. You can read this book straight through (I read it last night in one sitting) but you can also dip into it anywhere and find something amusing and useful. The author is pretty frank about what women need to do, especially those of us who are over 35, but it's really honest and helpful in the same way the British \\"What Not to Wear\\" women are: \\"your best friends won't tell you but we're not you're best friends, and we will!\\" That's the attitude this author takes. Harsh at times, but frankly, I do need a new haircut. There's also a chapter that is devoted to places where you can meet men, many of which seem pretty imaginative. By the way, Johanna Davidson is my real name, not a pen name I just don't want to give Amazon my credit card number."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book you need to find (and keep) Mr. Right","review":"Janis has the BEST, most accurate perspective on relationships and knows the RIGHT way to find (and keep) your ideal partner. This is the only book I have loved enough to write a recommendation, and it is truly the only book you'll need to get on track to discovering a happy relationship in a timely, practical manner. Janis writes with style and humor. She knows, and it shows. Her quotes from men are priceless and REALISTIC: Sometimes it all boils down to cleavage, cleavage, CLEAVAGE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OLD and IRRELEVANT","review":"I bought the Spanish narration edition. As I live and teach in Ecuador, I bought this video hoping to use it in my cultural anthropology classes. Unfortunately there was very little information about the culture and customs of the indigenous people. It was more of an introduction to some of the cities in Ecuador and Peru and some of the crafts that the indigenous people make. The footage is ancient (from the 60's I think) and amateurish (much was shot by a shaking hand or by holding a camera out a window while riding in a car). Also the information presented was severely outdated and irrelevant. I don't understand how the release date come have been listed as 2006. In my opinion it should be listed as 1966. I feel this video was misrepresented as a documentary and I would be ashamed to show it to a kindergarten class here in Ecuador."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beezus and Ramona","review":"The kids loved this story.

I found this out after being unsatisfy with the life I was getting from my batteries. I decided to put the batteries in my \\"slow\\" charger one day and found that I was getting much longer life via my \\"slow\\" charger. What I do now is let this charger do most of the work then when it says it is done, I put the batteries in my slow charger to get a full charge. Also, you are better off buying some other rechargeable batteries than the ones that come with this unit. These are about as low rated (600mAh) as you can get. I get around 3 hours of playing time with these batteries in my mp3 player. My 800mAh Sony batteries last about 50% longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"Charges batteries in about one hour and beeps each time a battery is fully charged. Batteries comes in 2 carrying cases which is useful to keep batteries apart and to store the discharged batteries until you get home.

It works fine but was expecting a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Book That Made Me Want to Be a Historian\\"","review":"Well, maybe not THE book, but when, for my first graduate course in history, I had to pick the work of history that most influenced my professional ambitions I picked Big Trouble, which I read in an undergrad U.S. Industrial History course. Big Trouble is a wonderful book and Lukas an amazing writer. I was interested all the way through the several hundred pages, which was not true for any of the other books I read in Industrial History, or in almost any other class ever.What really struck me about Big Trouble, however, was what my professor passed out on the day we finished reading it: Luakas' obituary. He killed himself a few months before Big Trouble was published because, after winning two Pulitzers and a National Book Award, he felt that he had been a failure as a writer. I am sad that he did not live to write more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent , balanced investigation of mostly hidden episode","review":"As a labor lawyer, and native of Homestead,Pa., I thought I was very familiar with U.S. labor history. Lukas reveals the events in Idaho with a skill and tenacity that is eye-popping for even the most-seasoned reader in this area. The turn-of -the century class war in the West comes alive, exposing the extremes resorted to by both sides. After this book, Idaho from 1890-1906 will take a place in U.S. labor history alongside Homestead, Matewan, Blair Mountain and Harlan County,Ky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two books entangled....","review":"The problem with \\"Big Trouble\\" is it tries to be two books at once. The first is a chronicle of the murder of the governor of Idaho and it's aftermath. The second is an general history of the U.S. during the latter 19th Century.If you could separate the two, say 2-300 pages on the murder and trials, and 500 pages divided into chapters on all the various subjects the author thought worthy of research, it would be both a good read and a useful reference.But the way it's presented, with the narrative constantly interrupted by discourses only tangentially related to the story itself, it is neither.I do appreciate the tangential material, but not the way it's presented. The narrative becomes increasingly difficult to follow when the events of a single week may be interrupted with accounts of something that happened in 1892, and then another in 1866, then a page later on to a new tangent...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book. Reads like fiction.","review":"It was with great sadness that I learned of Anthony Lukas' death. Having been prompted by 'Big Trouble' to read his other prize winning book 'Common Ground', I am convinced we've lost a major talent and human being. Having lived in Boise, Idaho, this account of the murder of the Governor during the turn of the century was fascinating. Readers may be interested to know that the Idanha Hotel, where many of the key figures lived during the trial still bears their famous names on the room doors. The book is so exhaustively researched that details of conversations come out allowing it to be read almost like a novel. I found the diversions helpful in illuminating and embellishing the atmosphere and culture of the day. The beauty of this book is that you learn about so many different historical events and issues, not just the one at the center of the story. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hundred words when only a few are needed.","review":"I thoroughly enjoy reading historical accounts of epic events and especially when the writing is discriptive and gives good background coverage. But this book goes into such intimate details of so much unnecessary information that it weighs the story down. You loose any direct connection with the object of the journey. The writer goes into every nuance of everything even remotely related to the subject. Words, words, words and more words. I finally gave up and I'll be selling this book back on Amazon soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to eliminate tension and stress","review":"Artie Butler has been arranger,producer and supporting keyboard player for many top music artists, such as Janis Ian, Tommy Boyce & Bobby Hart and Joe Cocker (that's Artie on the legendary piano opening on \\"Feeling Alright\\"). There are few albums released under his own name, so CLASSIC BROADWAY, issued in 1995, is a special treat. The selections are all well-known standards, mostly instrumentals superbly executed by the Hollywood Rainbow Pops and arranged & conducted by Mr. Butler. Guest vocalists include Michael Dees (\\"Try to Remember\\" and \\"If I Loved You\\") and Julie Budd (\\"All I Ask of You\\").Artie Butler in 1968 released a more uptempo pop-jazz collection, HAVE YOU MET MISS JONES? (A&M SP 3007- CTI). This earlier set, which showcases his piano playing, has yet to be issued on CD.

P.s i'm from Connecticut, and hope to see them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a timeline than a biography","review":"Clearly Giles MacDonagh did a great deal of research for this book. It shows on every page. Unfortunately, what we get is more a straightforward, day-by-day description of Wilhelm II's life than a real biography. Very little background information or interpretation makes it onto the page. As the bones for a first-rate biography, it seems to be excellent. But I was left with no real understanding of the Kaiser or his critically important times. Perhaps someday Mr. MacDonagh will revisit the text and flesh it out into a real biography, rather than a \\"facts on file\\" type of timeline. Clearly he is complete in his research (after a while, I began to think that he could probably tell us what the Kaiser had for breakfast on October 13, 1911) but the book lacks real style and needs a good editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics with No Personality","review":"I picked up this book on recommendation from my dad, a history buff much like myself, and was extremely disappointed in it. Instead of dealing properly with the Kaiser himself it spent the vast majority of the time discussing and analyzing German politics and political figures active during the Kaiser's reign and made only the most fleeting references to the personal life of the Kaiser (or anything to do with him personally, for that matter). It's as if the author was too afraid to delve into the private life of this controversial figure because he knew that the bright picture he put forth of the Kaiser would be blown to pieces. Needless to say, this book should be entitled \\"Politics and Political Figures During the Reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II.\\"Go to another book if you are looking for a true biography of Wilhelm. This one will only disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid Rock's new CD","review":"This is a great CD. Kid Rock shows us just how talented he really is!!

What happened to the Devil Without a Cause??? Where are the songs like BullGod and Cowboy??? Long gone I guess. I'm not saying this isn't a good album. It is if you like country music and slow songs.

If you see the old kid rock, please tell him to come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the other albums, didn't like it much","review":"This CD is NOT a regular Kid Rock release. It's a bunch of ballads and southern rock. He seems to have gotten alittle to full of himself with Picture. Maybe Pam has him whipped to a cream puff?I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone looking for more of his usual rock/rap blend.

Otherwise I would avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This album is horrible! No edge, no power, no drive.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Rock has left the building","review":"Well, I thought I was buying the new Kid Rock CD, and then I picked up this piece of work. If you like country music and redneck singing, this is for you. But the artist that came out a few years ago formally known as Kid Rock has left the building. I do not recommend this album. It is nothing like his past releases. If you're up for something new, and you don;t mind being disapointed, then here ya go. WAIT!, I take back everything I said. I have now had a chance to listen to the album for a second time, and it's worse than it was the first time. And as a matter of fact, if anyone wants a free CD let me know. I would possibly pay someone to take it off my hands. IT S__KS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Kid Rock fan","review":"I never liked Kid Rock's earlier Rap/Rock stuff... but it wasn't until I heard Carson Daly speaking on how talented this guy is that I started to pay attention. And now I can fully appreciate his sound. This artist is the most versatile artist I know encompassing exactly what he says on \\"Son of Detroit\\", country, soul, rock and roll, and hip hop. Although he is definitely taking a risk losing his earlier fans, I think he'll be able to pick new ones up (like me). This is the first Kid Rock album I have purchased (and mind you, I didn't hear one song prior to purchase)... This CD seems 60% rock and roll ballads, one or two hip hop/rock songs, and the rest a fuse of rock and country. Artists mature... styles change.. otherwise people would complain about it sounding the same as the first album... Rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD! I LOVE IT!","review":"Nothing like good ol' American Rock & Roll!!! Way better than Cocky, not the Rap/Rock of Devil, but as any Kid Rock fan knows, he's going to change it up. I'm a HUGE Bobby fan and he did not disappoint me this time around.If you like classic or southern rock, country and maybe even a little honky tonk, you'll love this album. There are appearances by Billy Gibbons, Kenny Wayne Shepperd and Sheryl Crow to give you an idea of the flavor of this CD. \\"Black Bob\\" is cool, \\"Jackson Mississippi\\" & \\"Rock & Roll\\" ROCKS! Even the slow songs are incredible with excellent pull-at-the-heart-strings lyrics. And the best thing about this album is that, aside from \\"I Am\\", is that he doesn't spend the whole damn thing talking about himself!It an excellent CD!

Man...was I mistaken!!! On a recent long roadtrip, my traveling companion brought her copy of this CD along and I'm sure glad she did!

This cd is truly horrible. Kid is not a singer, and never has been, so to put out almost a whole cd of him trying to sing is disgraceful. I'm not saying the guy doesn't have talent, don't get me wrong. He's a great lyricist, and song writer. He just needs to continue doing what he's good at, and stop trying to be something he's not, a country singer.To sum up, don't buy this cd if you like Kid Rock. AND if you like Kid Rock and DO buy this cd, please don't kiss his ... and say it's good. Be honest with yourself, and let him know not to do this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"yep","review":"i must agree with this jano bjourn guy. I have seen that spilt side anna band a couple times in athens, georgia where the likes of r.e.m, widespread panic, and other bands have gotten their start.

But if you're not, i insist you come to athens and check these guys out for christ's sake.

Yes he might be digging deep into his roots and yes he might be trying to break free of the hip-hop rap metal genre, but my God let your fans know that your new album will be slower than the Christina album my wife bought.

I also don't even mind country music too much. It's just that the image he is trying to pass off as an in your face white trash rapper does not match with this new country-rock singer persona. There is a huge discrepency, and this is probably the most unimpressive cd ive heard in quite a long time. Honestly, all of my friends warned me not to buy it, but I gave him a chance, even after I heard the single, a remake of the Bad Company classic that should be entitled, \\"More of the same crap.\\" He's gonna have to make a huge comeback for me to consider buying another one of his cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kidrock the MAN!!!!!!","review":"I have to say that I have not heard the new cd yet but I am buying it, I have the other 3 CD's that he has made, and I got to tell you, I am the number 1 kidrock fan on the planet, he is my idle.

I don't like the seriousness that the songs have. I dont really care for the cover. I'm not sure where Rock goes after this.I think after he \\"made it\\" with Devil, he really didnt care what the fans thought of his stuff.

I bought this album thinking I would hear at least one \\"Bawitaba\\" or \\"Cowboy\\" calibur song and all I got stuck with was a bunch of Lame country sounding songs about how he's the best thing to ever come to music.

As one reviewer said \\"if this were free it'd be a ripoff\\" I concur. I have enough drink coasters lying around my house...I didn't need a shiny one.

I mean, I was looking for that hard rockin', American Bad Ass attitude which Kid Rock is so famed for! Where was it? All I heard was a bunch of whiney, blues-like, country songs (minus the one rap collaboration) on this album.I don't think that this should be a self titled album.....I think it should be called \\"Kid Rock - I Wussed Out!\\" And after listening to the CD once.....I really want my money back!Sorry Kid....I don't mean to make you cry....as long as you like it....that's all that matters.....just keep telling yourself that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different side of the Kid","review":"First let me start by saying that I have all of Kid Rock's cds. Its been cool to see him mature as an artist. I really liked the way he slowed it down on Cocky and started singing about life. I can relate to what he has to say. This cd still has the rap-metal tracks that made him famous. It also has more of the slower songs that show his southern rock, country, and blues influences. This album is definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"I hesistated in purchasing this CD because of the many negative reviews I read on Amazon. Finally, I shelled the money out for it and well, I was TOTALLY surprised by it.

Yes, it is different, but it shows that Kid Rock is \\"growing\\" as an artist should. He says what he sees and what he's learned and shares it in the styles of the Blues, Country, Rock and yes, Rap too, all musically done well in my opinion. The lyrics on the uncencored CD do \\"Shock\\" and are \\"Sharp\\" (again in my opinion). I am glad I bought it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kid does it again","review":"Perhaps I haven't listened enough to get the full impact of this album, but it's good. How good? I don't know if it's up there with Cocky, it might take a few more listens. BUT, one song here, \\"Black Bob\\", is the most creative, and probably his best song to date. This album has the least hip hop out of his four major releases, and this will tick off some of his fan base. Listen guys..... you have GOT to broaden your horizons for Gods sake. There is more to music out there than hardcore and rap. Kid Rock should be commended for exploring other types of music out there. There arent many artists this versatile."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOO!","review":"Now i'm a huge Kid Rock fan, and i'm not one to immediately start accusing artists of selling out and I appreciate musical growth just as much as the next person, BUT THIS STUFF SUCKS!This album did absolutely nothing for me and I knew what it was going to be like going in...yah, some of the slow songs are good, but theirs like 5 of them. And every \\"rock\\" song contains a lameazz country guitar riff that I hear in every other country rock song. The only song I really gave an ish about is Jackson, Mississippi.People want to say he's \\"moved on\\" and \\"rap rock\\" is dead...if you though Kid Rock was rap rock in the first place your stupid.

Otherwise you'll be late to where you're going because you won't want to turn it off. Each song flows - I especially enjoyed the guest spots by Hank Williams Jr. and Kenny Wayne Sheppard (he lays down some fantastic licks). No matter what your musical preference is (rock, rap or country) you can't help but be drawn in by one of the most underated rhythm sections out there today. If you've seen Kid Rock live, you know that he can really sing and how tight and versatile the band is. This CD, even though its a studio album, really captures those \\"live\\" qualities - the best case in point being the cover of \\"Feel Like Making Love\\" - no one can do a cover song like Kid Rock. He has a knack of making the song his own but at the same time respecting the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Schlock","review":"I know that Kid Rock likes KISS, and this is evidence: He's created his own version of \\"Music From The Elder.\\"OK, \\"Picture\\" was good song, but did you have to abandon everything in favor radio play? You were getting that when you carved out a niche for what you do best, which isn't this. This is the worst George Strait album ever made. If it was free it would be a ripoff. Pat Boone's \\"In A Metal Mood\\" is the only album that compares to this that I can think of.

No one should have to pay full price for an album like this to realize how bad it is. I absolutely loved \\"Devil Without a Cause\\" and \\"Cocky\\" and listen to both of them weekely but this new self-titled album is just nothing like either of them. Why this album is listed in the \\"Rock\\" section I have no clue. It belongs in the \\"Country\\" section at best, in the \\"$.99 Bargin Bin\\" at worst. If you liked Kid Rock's other stuff, you should be disappointed with this album. Download it first, or at the very least go to a store that will let you listen to all the songs before you buy it.

The first I'll buy, the later you'll be forgotten.Update: don't take my word for it, look at the billboard charts. After 15 weeks on the chart he's fallen to #81. The highest this cd hit was #8 and that was probably driven by people hoping he'd gone back to being Kid Rock. Sadly instead he has continued his slide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going solo was not the best for Junior","review":"This album is Junior Gonzalez first album as a solo artist after 5 years with Larry Harlow. Can't say the change was all good for him. I really think that Junior and Larry were made for each other (musically) and that they should of never split (even though Junior returns a couple of years later.)\\"Comedia\\" is good as well as \\"Violencia\\" which has a meaningful message. In \\"Cadenas\\" there's a special appearance by Luis \\"Perico\\" Ortiz who gives a sensual trumpet solo. I have somewhat of a deal with the song's lyrics because it speaks about a person as property, although metaphoric (I believe), still a tad bit uncomfortable.Even though the album is not terrible, is it not good either. No song on this album made me jump for joy like I did with \\"Salsa\\" or \\"Hommy: A Latin Opera.\\" Don't pay more than the suggested retail price for this one, specially because this one is very rare and people are going to try to sell it expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Scrappy?","review":"I agree...why do they keep releasing duplicate episodes?

It has only rained one time and there are no sprinklers anywhere near the unit, so the paint is basically falling off without any provocation. When I inspected the unit after noticing the paint chips I tipped it slightly and a large amount of water came pouring out. Apparently it is not only not sealed against water intrusion but it also allows it to collect inside. Given the small amount of rain we get here it is surprising that any was able to collect at all.

You can use a 400 to 800 firewire cable but it will not draw enough power for even a USB keyboard"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't use it with my new Mac Mini at all...","review":"This item unfortunately doesn't say that it won't work too well with the latest Dual Core Mac Mini, due to the new Mini design which moves the rear USB and Firwire ports to the other side, making it nearly impossible for the tiny connectors to reach. I finally got it connected but the resulting tangle of cords made it nearly impossible to add additional cables, and kept turning the Mini slightly so it sat kind of off-kilter on the hub and looked pretty silly. I also had no use for the front Firewire port, since none all my small peripherals (Palm, iPod, camera etc.) use USB so I had to have a bulky scanner wire connected to the front of the hub, draping around both it and the Mini. What a mess! I would make sure you check the back of your Mini before purchasing, to see that the locations of the connectors line up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What they don't make clear","review":"Nice aesthetic design and all that, but what's not at all clear upfront is that this Belkin hub only supports up to Firewire 400. Who uses that any more if they don't have to? And know that if you're using this for anything but a MacMini you'll have to purchase new cables (Firewire 6-pin (400) and USB) because the cables provided with the hub are so short as to not reach anything except a MacMini sitting directly on top of the hub. The new cables will end up costing you more than what you just paid for the hub. So the problem is not with the information provided BEFORE the sale, but with the information NOT provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Pretty, But DOES NOT WORK","review":"I am in full agreement with the previous reviewer, this unit needs a seperate power source. I plugged in USB connections to all of the ports and one iSight Webcam to the firewire and this unit just failed. Connections are spotty at best and my external hard drives will not be recognized at all.It was a too good to be true price, and in the end, a pretty much useless piece of hardware."},{"rating":"2","title":"It hasn't failed me yet","review":"I was worried after reading some of the other reviews, but I took a leap and am pleased so far. It is almost perfect for the Macmini except it would be nice if it had a lip so the computer wouldn't slide around on it. When I plug something in to the ports on the front of the hub I have to hold the top of the computer to prevent the whole thing from moving because it is light weight. Sometimes the computer slides a little on the hub when I do this. It only takes a second to realign it. The only operational error I have encountered is when plugging my thumb drive in the front port it sometimes does not read it and so I have to plug it in the back. Other devices work fine when I plug them in there so it might be operator error when I unplugged it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Mac Mini, you're kidding","review":"I bought this specifically because I wanted it for my Mac Mini and it is advertised for a Mac Mini. My Mac Mini has a Firewire 800. This has a Firewire 400. If you have an old Mac Mini, go for it. A newer Mac Mini, keep looking! One more thing, Belkin support isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the mid-2011 Mac Mini","review":"The Mac Mini (mid-2011) has four USB 2.0 ports and a Firewire 800 port on the back. I have two firewire 800 devices, an external hard drive and a Seagate GoFlex portable drive. I ordered this because it would expand my USB and Firewire ports PLUS give me one of each in the front. However, when I received it I was very disappointed. The Firewire ports are for the slower 400Mbps devices, not the faster 800Mbps. I could get an adapter, but it would basically cause the devices to slow to half the speed of which they are capable. I returned it and am continuing to look for a similar device for the faster devices. Currently, when I need to update the portable drive I plug it into the port in the hard drive. I thought about keeping this unit just for the expanded USB ports, but the cost was pretty high for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"I love the form factor -- it looks great sitting under the Mini -- but in practice it has been mostly just a source of frustration. I have a chain of self-powered Firewire hard drives which simply would not come up when plugged into this hub, but mounted just fine when plugged directly into the Mini. In addition, it does create quite a mess of cables behind the Mini, exposing only one port of each type on front where you really want them. This is a purchase I regret.In fairness, the USB portion of the hub does seem to work a bit better. So if you only need a USB hub, this might be OK, but I wouldn't recommend it for Firewire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but be sure to buy an adapter...","review":"I had read that the trick is that the firewire port is how the unit draws its power. But oddly, even though this is SPECIFICALLY made for a Mac Mini, they don't include a wire that can plug into a Mac Mini. So, you also need to order a 800-400 adapter.Otherwise, once the adapter arrived I plugged everything in and it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent port expander","review":"This item does exactly what it is supposed to: provides more USB and Firewire ports, both on the rear and front of the device. It just works. I have not attempted to test speeds, but all port seem to operate as well as the built-in ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, kind of disappointed.","review":"So out of the box the unit looks nice and is as described. Upon connecting it to my brand new iMac, I quickly learn that I can't see my two external drives connected via Firewire. After some troubleshooting, I decipher that the Firewire port in the back is bad. I can use the one in the front, but suffice to say I'm a little disappointed. Not worth the hassle to ship back to Amazon for a return. Honestly, I wouldn't buy it again. I expect more from Belkin, but they must have just thrown this together to serve a niche market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squeals when you connect the firewire cable","review":"I'm sure this product was a nice idea when it was made, but today it's just not that good, and it appears that Belkin has no interest in fixing the problems.First, as others have pointed out, it draws power from the Firewire port. Unfortunately, this appears to be a bad idea because it (or my Mac -- it's hard to tell) squeals when I connect it to the Firewire port. This might be because my Mac Mini has a Firewire 800 port, and I need to use a 400/800 converter to connect it, and the power drain is probably too much.I'm returning mine to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"eeeeeeeeeeeee","review":"The first one I ordered was busted; something rattling around inside. I can't assume that's Belkin's fault, though, and I got my replacement really quickly. Anyway, after getting the new, intact hub, I hook it up to my laptop and all I can hear is this annoying high-pitched whine from whatever is going on inside this thing. After about a minute of that, I unplugged it and sent it back to Amazon. It was whining at a pitch and volume that I could not ignore, much less get any work done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but not a good value","review":"This hub is an expensive hub that fits well and looks good, but because it has no power, it isn't very useful. You need power for USB devices, in particular, or many of them won't work. It's OK for a printer or Flash memory stick, but not so good for a keyboard, mouse, iPod, camera, or many of the other devices that power up via USB ports, when plugged in.Worse, the one I bought only lasted 2 years before it failed or burned out!?There are better products and a POWERED USB HUB is worth the extra money. This is my 3rd Belkin USB hub and I have not had much better luck with the other two. They make nice cables, but got cheap on the USB hub design."},{"rating":"2","title":"usb hub","review":"The hub is small in size, which makes it nice for small spaces.

The shipping and service was really good as well. HDTV is amazing, speechless, I didnt expect it to be than much better. I cant believe I have a home theater for a little over a grand, this would have cost 3k a year and half ago probably. The sound is fine, one thing is you have to get the good dvd cables for a good picture, they are called component cables, the ordinary composite cables gave a mediocre Dvd pic, now w/ composite its rivals the hdtv pic. They are cheap too.Its seems as if samsung fixed the sound problem, I got mine AUG 1st and have had no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice 720P","review":"I got this TV a couple years ago. I'd looked at it in the store, and I thought the picture was OK for what I was willing to spend. In addition, I have a 1080P Mistubishi, and 3 other 720P TV's in the house (I know - that's a sad commentary on our way of life ...) and this unit has the best picture of the 720P units (the others being a 40\\" Sharp a 32\\" Insignia and a 32\\" Dynex). Most of our TV viewing is either DirecTV or DVD's. The Samsung's picture is not quite as good as the 1080P Mistubishi, but its a close second and much better than the others. For the money, this Samsung was a very good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasure to watch","review":"This TV is just a pleasure to look at. The screen looks great even in a brightly lit room and shows no glare at all from reflections on-screen.I only have two very minor complaints. First, the remote isn't great. It's not very intuitive to use I find, and although it is supposed to work with the Samsung AnyNet DVD player I got with it (DVD-1080P8), it is terrible for that (it doesn't even have a \\"menu\\" button for the DVD play menu). So I just use two remotes instead of one. Not a big deal.My second complaint is even more minor. There are many inputs in the back of the set (which is excellent), but if you need to change the input source channel, you often have to scroll through several options to find the correct one. It would be handy if it could autodetect what is plugged in and what is providing a signal, and skip those channels that are not powered up.Overall, a very good set and it looks GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"LNT4053H","review":"Great TV, fantastic color and calibration options.

The TV looks good and is working as advertised. I got a TERK indoor antenna and the local HDTV channels look impressive. But the regular channels I receive via Dish network look a little worse. Hopefully in a couple of years all the American channels will be broadcast in HD and some more years after that, the International channels will be broadcast in HD and then all will be well :-) I played a couple of DVDs and they were awesome.

I've read online that Samsung used some cheap part and they are aware of this problem. of course this tv is no longer under warranty so now, we have to figure out how to fix it or just live with it. I had done research on this tv before purchasing it. at the time, all the reviews were good. so i'm very disappointed in this tv and will not buy another Samsung again! Very sad to say since I'm Korean and I like to support Korean products along w/ U.S. made ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different model","review":"Within a year of buying this TV, it started to have problems turning on. I would click for 4 - 6 minutes and then it might turn on with no sound at all or at full volume (which wakes up everyone in the house). Sometimes when turned on all you see is a stripe pattern or a \\"tye-dyed\\" effect. Lines of pink squares also appear. The TV has to be turned on and off several times before it corrects itself and is watchable at all. It has been highly annoying.We paid quite a bit for this TV and bought it as an anniversary present to each other when my husband got back from serving in Afghanistan and it has been nothing but a headache. Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand/model."},{"rating":"2","title":"great picture","review":"We got this flat panel tv for our second home.

I got a call more than a week after ordering informing me I would be contacted soon to arrange a delivery. Well they never called back, and after nearly 2 weeks I got fed up. It was 4 days after the delivery estimate and 3 weeks after I ordered. I had to call and cancel the order. Now I will not get credit for the the visa payment I already made until this delivery agency returns the TV to Amazon.

The customer service has been terrible and they can't seem to make the appropriate arrangements to come get this thing.

After a year or two (after the warranty expires), I (and many other people -- review online blogs) have had the capacitaor fail on the tv. The result is a clicking noise when you try to power on, as the tv continually tries to recycle. It takes 5 minutes, sometimes more, for the tv to start, and it constantly clicks. Samsung is well aware of the problem and is refusing to fix it, despite numerous complaints from many people. The customer service is just awful. If you buy this or other Samsung tvs, beware, because your tv will last only as long as the warranty and then you are on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple Technical Problems","review":"Like most people I had one major problem with this unit right away which was the sound cutting out regularly. Samsung tech support did do a good job remedying the problem by express mailing a thumb drive with a firmware update that fixed the sound issue immediately. After that I didn't have any problems for quite some time until about 2 1/2 years after purchase the set started having serious difficulties starting up. After being turned off for a long time, turning the set on took about 3-5 minutes during which clicking noises would occur. Once the set finally turned on, often there was no sound and even sometimes no picture. Samsung has no firmware update to fix this and recommended that I be referred to a service center who said it could cost from $150-300 to fix with several days of waiting.The TV in the end, seemed like a good purchase but after all of the problems I've encountered I couldn't consider buying another Samsung TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV; Great transaction","review":"I bought this 40\\" LCD HDTV through Amazon.

We've had it in our home for about 3 weeks now and love everything about it. My son plays his Xbox 360 on the set and is amazed at the difference from our previous non-hdtv system. It was easy to hook-up and enjoy quickly.

Blacks are black, colors are accurate, images are sharp. With the built-in digital receiver you can get over-the-air HDTV channels that are simply beautiful. One complaint is sometimes if the image is mostly low-contrast with subtle tones of greys and darker colors, there is motion blur. This effect isn't noticeable for high-contrast images like sports. Great for football, especially with the \\"Vivid\\" image setting and the HDTV over-the-air feeds from national channels.I'm also using this TV as a computer monitor, using DVI-HDMI converter. Games look great. Not so good for web browsing because the max 1360x768 make it hard to see much, have to scroll down a lot.

Beautifully written, beautifully translated, this is one of the best books of the second half of the twentieth century. This is the story of a young Italian woman and her sons, mostly during World War II. The beautiful portrait of the young baby, and then young boy, was just so moving. And I loved the descriptions of their dog, Bella. As she looked at each of her puppies, she thought it was surely the most beautiful one in the world. Morante captured the essence of motherhood.

Despite what others say however, Frodo does have a Return of the King hand and this could just be an error.

It advises AGAINST IRAs??? and AGAINST 401-Ks??? It advise people to carry large mortgages well into retirement??? It supports these preposterous strategies with illogical premises and conclusions. Two examples: first it ignores that the contribution in a 401-K are deducted from your W2 earnings thereby allowing you to invest money that would go to the IRS; second, it assumes throughout all its examples that \\"tax-exempt\\" investments and taxable investments pay the same interest rate.

This is a very dangerous book. It went in the trash when I finished it.If you're looking for a prudent way to invest, I'd suggest \\"The Intelligent Investor,\\" by Benjamin Graham.\\"Missed Fortune 101\\" is Douglas Andrew's contribution to the housing and credit crunch we're in today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay far away","review":"This book is horrible.

You are aware that the author \`teaches' in seminars for a fee.The whole idea hinges on the fact that you are better off investing in this 'investment-grade insurance products'. I noticed that every time author talks about the 'investment-grade insurance products', he says that a 'competent' insurance broker or financial planner would know how to set it up. So I decided to look for an insurance broker competent enough to know.

He presents hypotheticals in which his subjects find themselves in a 33% tax bracket. This is very misleading, since by today's tax codes, the subjects depicted in his stories would actually be in a 15% tax bracket.The only way his examples make sense is if we assume the tax code has been rewritten, we are all being taxed at a flat rate, and someone making $75,000 is taxed at 33.3% That's a far cry from the system we have today.Be wary of advice gleened in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same old tripe","review":"Lots of new ideas that challenge conventional thinking.

When oh when are queer filmmakers going to STOP making bad gay films? (Eg, Slutty Summer and Bowser Makes a Movie.) When oh when are they going to STOP using terrible drag queens in key roles.

The concept of focusing on the bottom line and its dynamics rather than on unit costs has its appeal, but aside from using a flashy name for total cost, there is nothing inherently new in the idea. Further the exposition is repetitive and inconsistent. For example, the author switches on numerous occasions from a unit view to a total cost view to make an argument against unit costing, but resorts to misleading links which would be apparent to anyone with even a superficial grasp of micro-economics.And any author who gives his own book 5 stars and abuses the review system to promote himself and the book does not deserve more than 1 star from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive review of gratitude literature","review":"I purchased this book as I was interested in an overview of the extant literature on gratitude, and this 100% fit the bill!

The heroine is admirable and really likeable. I came to worry about her and cheer her on.Also, this is a murder mystery, with the emphasis on whodunit and not on the grisly details of death.

The plastic faceplate is brilliant in the way it protects and guides your thumb around the wheel.My only real complaint is that it's compatibility with speaker docks is limited. It will not work in my Altec Lansing IM11, nor will it work with a Nyko Speaker Dock 2. It does fit into Memorex clock-radio, and into the official apple universal dock without an adapter. I had a very difficult time inserting it into a dock with the flap over the docking port cover, but after cutting it off it works well. It is possible with the flap intact, but it took me a long time time every time i tried and it would wiggle loose. It is looser than a naked iPod with the correct adapter, but not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Iceman","review":"I bought outer UFC DVD's and they were very intertaining.

Kasey Chambers' \\"The Captain\\" is one of the more nauseating assembleges of trite, tired, and beat-to-death-boring cliches released in recent memory. Miraculously, she somehow manages to lurk all over popular radio stations. Reading comparisons to the likes Emmilou Harris or Patty Griffin conjure up sounds of screaching tires - Kasey (note trite spelling of name) does not possess a fraction of a percentage of the talent held by those two women. \\"The Captain\\" is great for people who require the lowest common denominator-over produced garbage in order to recognize emotions in music.

He questions the underpinnings of this concept and asks if it depends upon class or is an Anglocentric, racist projection. Those interested in Puerto Rican studies should purchase this book. However, it was somewhat boring and overly sociological. It's far slower than Mirande's \\"Hombres y Machos\\" and far weaker than Gonzalez' \\"Muy Macho\\". The chapter on male homosexuality seemed entirely stolen from other academics.

That argument would make sense if a coherent system of justice could be devised to match it. As it stands, Nagel only has moral theories, and everybody has one of those.Nagel tells us we cannot appeal to private property in order to justify the current distribution within society, because it is private property itself is that which needs distributing. Basically Nagel is opting for a collectivist (moralist) starting point in which every person must justify their holdings to Nagel's morality. The obvious alternative, Lockean rights theory, is dismissed on the grounds that \\"there are no property rights antecedent to the tax structure.\\"Of course Nagel can define property rights how he wishes, but there have been plenty of instances of property rights (as most people understand them) in the absence of tax structures."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of ink","review":"The short version of this dopey book is this: Without Uncle Sam to protect your stuff you'd probably get mugged without hope of getting it back.

Those who are tired of hearing about his squabble with Mia Farrow will be relieved to find that the author concentrates on his work and only mentions facts of Woody Allen's life that are relevant to his films. The book painstakingly analyzes the psychological and philosophical undercurrents in Woody's work, and especially delves into the issue as to whether art cand lend coherence to an otherwise contingent and random life. It'll help you see Woody's films from a broader standpoint but also set you brooding over your life as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One","review":"Another great book - a classic on an e-book!

It was as if someone else had written the second half. It all starts promising enough, I was enjoying it very much, until about two-thirds of the way into it. Then, everything fell apart. Interesting characters were never more to be seen, the unmasking of the murderer was completely anticlimatic. It felt like the author suddenly stopped midway through the book and quickly decided to pick a murderer at random. Really awful, the real mystery is: what happened in the writing of this book? I'm a bit wary of buying anymore in the series if the next one is going to be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is good and bad......","review":"I purchased this Jelly Roll Air Pan to roast sweet potato fries coated with peanut oil and corn starch. The corn starch gives oven baked French Fries a good crunch and maintains a nice orange color. However, the corn starch is very sticky so the Wilton Jelly Roll Air Pan seemed to be the way to go; no stick and resistance to burning food.The Good: Heavy weight/heavy duty, good burn resistance.The Bad: Even with the exclusive use of plastic spatulas, the no-stick finish has chipped and is peeling off after using the pan 3 times.The Solution: I purchased a 16ga heavy half sheet baking pan and a matching non-stick baking mat. The sweet potato fries actually come out way better using the sheet pan and the non-stick baking mat.

There's a lot of background information to Catholicism that you get during catechism, but at that age who remembers it? As an adult, you start to question things and need the background information to find out how your faith fits you. This is a good book to help you with those questions. I also recommend \\"The Essential Catholic Catechism\\" (which is an easy-read version of the Catholic Catechism) and \\"Catholicism For Dummies\\" for anyone with an interest in getting to know your Catholic faith.The Essential Catholic Catechism: A Readable, Comprehensive Catechism of the Catholic Faith,Catholicism for Dummies."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT!

This book received a scathing review from Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk when he was head of the US Catholic Bishop's Conference Committee on Doctrine. The major overall flaw is \\"doctrinal minimalism.\\" The book presents dissenting theological opinions on such controversial issues as womens' ordination(NEVER) and homosexuality(ALWAYS EVIL) as if the faithful may choose which they prefer. The book is OBE'd. The 1998 change in Canon Law issued by the motu proprio Ad Tuendam Fidem with the attached doctrinal explanation Ab Ipsis Primordis, clarifies that the faithful must hold the magisterial position on these matters.

Everything from the Early Christian Church, through information on the different councils, to different religious movements, and the lives of the popes and saints can be found. Also included are some excellent photographs that span the history and culture of the Church. There are a few entries that only provided basic information, but other than that, it is intended as a general overview rather than a profound work. Every eager Catholic, young or old alike, should and must have a copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT about Catholicism","review":"This book is very dangerous to read for both Protestants and Catholics because it does NOT contain the truth of the Catholic Faith. The entries are very highly unorthodox and inaccurate, extremely liberal and modernist. With its authoritative title, it deliberately misleads the reader into thinking it is an authoritative work condoned by the Catholic Church. I mistakenly bought the book wanting a reference book on Catholicism, but now keep it as a reference to see just what is being touted as Catholic doctrine by those within the Faith who are trying to destroy it from within."},{"rating":"2","title":"McBrien and His Team Have Performed a Great Service","review":"Since I received this book from Amazon last week, I have had real trouble setting it aside. Not only does it contain a staggering amount of information; it also is beautifully produced and intelligently written.It is huge, a good thing for any encyclopedia -- 1300 pages and over 4,000 entries. It is full of pictures: photos of important individuals and sites, reproductions of famous artwork, and explanatory drawings. Major topics, such as each of the sacraments, are covered in long, well-organized essays. And all the details indicate that this project was undertaken with the seriousness and dedication it deserves: the entries are cross-referenced, helpful bibliographies follow many entries, boldface subheads break up and organize the longer entries, bylines are provided after the more analytical entries, a complete list of contributors with their affiliations is provided, pronunciations are given for unfamiliar terms -- I could go on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be misled -- this is a great resource.","review":"Richard McBrien is a scholar of great distinction and this book is a useful and reliable resource for believers and inquirers.

The story consists of two wooden dolls who wake up and try to figure out where they came from--whether they were made by someone or just accidentally created by nature.

The figure comes with the her most important weapon--the Magic Lasso. The likeness between the book and the figure is almost perfect. The articulations are truly magnificent. But I will not recommend this for kids below 10 years of age (though the warning on the box says 14). The expression on her face really shows both her gentle and Amazonian character.

The figure is great because it comes in such bold colors and has a unique hairstyle. The way it is built seems to be pretty durable as well. It also comes with a seperate green plastic lantern recharger which goes along with the super-hero's back story. (Of which you can read on the back of the packaging.)

The warg rider Sharku is pretty neat. Some problems are that it is very difficult to position him on the warg. Also he isn't very durable. One time my sister took him and sqeezed him between the couch. When I found him his left hand broke off. Anyways Sharku is highly detailed and looks as ugly as he does in the movie. He also has leg moving and sword swinging action. The warg is really awesome. It is extremely detailed and almost fully possable. It has jaw-chomping action. The warg's head is covered in rubber so when its jaw chomps it looks really realistic.It also has a rubber tail and mane. The jaw is filled with teeth and is sticking out its tongue. This is a fantastic toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET LOST IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!","review":"This might as well be the best Lotr toy deluxe beast and rider!

Warg details and accessories: bloody detailed mouth, wet and shaggy fur detail, rubberish skin detail, poseable body, and chewing and moving jaw action. But there's the rider sharku too! Sharku details and accessories: knife, scars, metal blade stuck onto his forehead, knife slashing action, poseable body, rubber suit, real movie details, and great authentic look while on warg. I do admit it is a little rubberish, but mostly it's hard body parts. A must buy for every Lotr fan! I got this toy December seventh, and opened it as quick as I could and always knew it would be awsome. And it was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not very durable","review":"I have nothing bad on this toy by how fun it is because it's really fun. The Warg beast is awesome and has jaw-chomping action. The jaw chomping action looks real because it's face is made of rubber, not plastic. It is very detailed. Sharku has a couple problems. He is almost impossible to get it to stay on the Warg. He also has knife-stabbing action, but the arm with the knife-stabbing action gets pretty loose sometimes. The best part of Sharku is that he is one of the most detailed Orc figures I've seen. My bottom line is that the Warg is awesome but they could have done better with Sharku."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warg!

Aragorn doesn't think so,so if you buy him on Brego you can make him whop Sharkus head off! unfortunately in the pitched battle Aragorn takes a little tumble off a cliff.Sharku dies but is happy with his heroic deed.Thank goodness for Arwen and Brego!

The Hybrid GP, however, is an absolute winner. It not only precipitates out and traps all sorts of dust/dirt/grunge, but also kills odors with the ozone produced...and then goes one step better and uses a catylist to turn the ozone in to pure oxygen.

I hope that other manufacturesalso create ones like this.If you have set up a network printer before, it would bea lot easier to set up this print server. Assign a static IPaddress to the print server, create a standard TCP/IP portas a local port on your Windows PC, and configure the TCP/IPport as it speaks LPR.Even if you are new to network printer, the manual shows howto do this, step by step, although it doesn't explain whatyou are doing, or is not so descriptive. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tech Savvy","review":"Well, after trying to get this item to work for several weeks, and having used up a full ink cartridge, I'm sending it back.

Once set up, the bi-directional communication required by some printers (like my Canon BJC-2100 and i950) is not available; this produces error messages to the originating pc for each print job sent (\\"printer not responding\\" in the case of the Canons, although the print job had already started), and caused more serious problems when the printers stopped printing to communicate a low ink condition. In addition, sending jobs from a second PC while the first is printing causes a crash of the original job.

Peace Kills is an awful, rambling collection of unimportant observations (\\"the unspellables killing the unpronouncables\\" written by an ignorant bigot who, because he can't spell or pronounce the names, thinks that they are of worthless inferiors). O'Rourke is a typical Midwest, clodhopping ignoramous who thinks he is God's answer to America's moral and political problems. Well, he is not. His observations and respective judgments are jejune (probably because his brain is atrophied from the tobacco carcinogens and the neurotoxins in the booze) appealing to intellectually insipid adolescents and intellectually and morally shallow imbeciles who claim to be \\"libertarians.\\" This book is a waste of any decent human beings time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supercilious and glib","review":"I've enjoyed hearing PJ on NPR, but was sorely disappointed by his writings in this book.

I did not find that he had any insights or profound observations, nor did he have any particular point of view.Unfortunately, I would have to say that it was kind of like attending the lecture of an incompetent and older college professor who talks on and on without ever getting to the point.

The mat reeks of chemicals (gets better over time, but I was taken aback at first); the animals are a bit odd-looking (one of them is still unidentifiable to me); and most important, the mat is too thin!

This is novel of suspense, indeed, a brilliant use of plot/mystery, but to an entirely different end that most writers use the genre.This novel defies category. It's a novel and an intellectual rift on America, on the Cold War, on TV, on the Dead Penalty, on Regression Therapy... It's all here in a hodgepodge way that somehow works, since the narrator is a psychological disturbed man. His rift, his excesses, his rants thread a surreal journey through the America of the Nixon Years and backtracking to the birth of the Cold War.The effect is disorienting at times, but fascinating.

On the plus side, I think Ward does bring to the lay public an interesting subject that for the most part is explained fairly well. Moreover, I like his attempt at making more general biological classifications beyond the Life We Do Know. On the negative side, however, I do agree that his lack of documentation is frustrating, his style is too breezy, and his organization could have been improved just a tad. This book is definitely worth a read, but I don't know that I'd be willing to pay the price for such a thin (in more ways than one) volume. And, in fact, I didn't; I checked it out from a library and I suggest you do as well.

First of all the zipper is not durable at all, the quality is poor, and it barely zips. You have got to hold the sides of the bag close together to get the zipper to glide together and close. There are no compartments on the inside, just 2 velcro pieces that are supposed to be to hang on the floor tom. This is a cheap bag, made with very poor quality materials and not very durable at all.

First, I use it for a 17\\" laptop and it's a bit too small; it would be nice if bigger sizes were available. Second, you really need to use a cooling pad underneath this lap desk if you're doing anything heavy duty or even in a warm area.

When it took much more than 16 liquid ounces of water (remembering the old high-school physics reminder, \\"a pint's a pound the world around\\"), I became suspicious. Some more semi-scientific inquiry (i.e, a couple of 500-gram bags of pasta from the store) made me realize that this scale consistently measures 25% light! No amount of adjustment and tweaking (I even tried \\"stretching\\" the coilspring by over-turning the adjuster) made things better. Sorry, but, aesthetics aside, scales need to do only one thing well, and that's to weight stuff accurately. 5% error is (somewhat) forgivable; 25% is a joke.

As the novel opens the parents are discussing their day over a glass of wine as peppers and garlic sizzle on the stove in the kitchen of their restored gingerbread house (it survived the great hurricane). Mom goes to a meeting, the two boys play in the bath and Gordo is shot through the chest when he answers the door. Their charmed existence is shattered and paranoia, an uneasy relationship with suspicious police officers, and a desparate search for a safe haven become the order of the day.Leavenworth creates rich descriptions of two of Texas' most vibrant cities, Galveston and Austin. He expertly juxtaposes the never ending summer, beach umbrellas and gingerbread houses of Galveston with the shadows the lie behind its shutters and under its seashells. When the family flees to Austin, we smell the heady, seductive aroma of the hill country and wait to see if they have been followed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Believe","review":"Her prose is exquisite but the apologia for the most vial aspects ofChinese culture (foot binding, widow suicide) is hard to take.

The planar abilities are easy to understand, and quite clever. Plus, they even have decent prestige classes.

I knew nothing about his childhood, his handsome and successful father with whom he had a great relationship. Their competitive drive, their help to each other throughout their lives, and just how Alan got started in the first place with drama, and comedy.There was just enough stuff about the entertainment industry to make this interesting without all the name dropping, gossip, and other finger pointing that goes on in so many celebrity books. Nothing that I would label tell-all.I was relieved to come away with the same honorable opinion of him as I have always had...his wife and daughters come first. He is a good human and worthy of all the film accolades, but still, I think it is rare that the man actually stands up well to the \\"part\\" he plays.

Famous kisses? with little mention of his other interactions with anyone. Very little material on MASH.

I've used the standard DVD cleaners to see if that was the problem...nothing. Secondly, the remote control unit is horrible. The buttons are very small and I have to be, literally, 7-8 feet from the unit, standing up, and pointing it exactly at the unit to get it to work. I've changed the batteries many times just in case that was the problem. Basically, it's a worthless clunker of a unit. I'm shopping for a replacement today.

The tone is unequivocal: encouraging and articulate.Zinker has been been immersed in the field to such depths that his writing shows evidence of integration of his findings. He covers gestalt therapy; a difficult topic to write about. He spells out his findings about working with families and does so in an aesthetic, almost spiritual.Yet, I also find the book written with an intellectual rigour that invites revisiting.

Well, almost. The only drawback to this product is that the info given in the books is somewhat abbreviated, and players end up buying supplements which repeat about 40% of the important info.

The emitter is not replaceable, but Wein claims does not wear over time. This is a very powerful industrial strength generator, which does make a slight hissing sound. My ion detector registers a high level of negative ions even some distance away from the emitter. The coverage area is 800 sq ft, so I recommend this unit for work if you are in an open area, or heavily polluted areas, such as your garage.

I think if it is broken after only one month, repair is out of the question; replacement would be the only option. Then this morning, a second unit stopped functioning. These units are not in \\"high pollution\\" areas--one is in my office and one in my bedroom. Very sad, because when they were working, it was the best three weeks I've had in terms of air quality.

Both are bright young women just beginning their careers; hopes high, ambitious, not yet tainted by the world. In both cases they encounter an extremely powerful man who robs them of their innocence in the worst way possible, igniting a burning desire to succeed and take revenge.I'm not so big a fan of the boardroom part of the boardroom + bedroom genre, so all that talk about designing computer programs and having meetings was hard going; and there was quite a bit of it, I'll add.

From the title we were hoping for a first-person narative exploration of the subject of female masturbation, including physical techniques, fantasies, and some of the social prejudices surrounding this subject. However, the text is much more abstract than this. Some of the subjects have included brief commentaries on their pictures, some poetry, and some have provided no discussion at all. The photos themselves do not hold a great deal of artistic merit and would probably not even be considered particularly erotic by most people. The work is \\"groundbreaking\\" in that it shows real women engaged in an extremely intimate act, but does not have much to offer individuals of either sex interested in the subject of female masturbation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and affectionate","review":"Six photographers and twelve female models present this most intimate kind of play, solo sex.

The women in these photos also vary widely in build and appearance. Some are much curvier than the current fashion demands, proving that fashion doesn't always get it right. With the added alchemy of intense arousal, all of these models come across as deeply beautiful women.Many photos attend to genital details, including the different kinds of caress that different women prefer. Breast stimulation matters to many of these models, so the photographers document that too.

Not good. Ever try fishing out baking powder from flour, since your scale turned off while watching the display INCREASE it's measurements?So, weigh ingredients seperately as a work around. But now the scale won't tare correctly. Goes from zero to 1 to zero to one on a flat surface.

The greatest in the world at present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concert but poor editing","review":"U2's performance at Boston lived up to expectations. The sound quality was as good as it gets. My major complaint however was the editing. The director would switch camera angles every 2 seconds which was really annoying. Maybe this is the popular way to edit now days but for me it was almost unwatchable. I don't need to see a song performance from 60 different angles in the span of 2 minutes. The idea of using the fancam in the audience was what I was waiting for. I would watch the whole concert from the fancam option. But unfortunately the picture quality was poor and the sound was also poor. A better way of doing it would have cameras zooming on each of the band members and have the option of choosing which bandmember you wanted to watch on screen. Much like the webcast concert from Notre Dame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like being there","review":"The concert portion of this packed DVD set is fantastic...great, clear picture quality, certain angles that are like you're in the heart, and great moments that feel just like the real thing.This set is an excellent value with all of the extras they've added."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragments","review":"Fragments...the best way to describe this DVD. The third leg of the Elevation tour - performed in the fall of 2001 - was very different to the first leg performed in the spring. The 3rd leg took on all of the emotion of the 9/11 attacks, and U2 did an heart-wrenching job of uniting our emotions.Unfortunately, this DVD is from the first leg (i.e., pre-9/11). Much of the content of the 3rd leg is missing. And unbelievably, \\"One\\" is missing from the DVD setlist. Is \\"One\\" a song that is just so sacred that it will never be shown?I also agree with other reviewers around the country who have complained that this DVD is disjointed and fragmented. It is little more than a collection of photographs set to music. It is by no means a view from a front-and-center seat with a start-to-finish view of the concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 should really stop touring.

The important thing is if it captures the experience of a U2 concert. I don't care how terrific the footage is, how neat the special features are,how great your home stereo is; if you've seen Bono and the boys LIVE (not pay per view!), than you will be dissapointed by ANY DVD.

The band's playing is great and Bono's voice is impeccable. The show itself is modestly beautiful. It's not on the same level as Zoostation, when comparing the degree of technical productions.

They have a 20 plus year career with countless hits all over the world and this DVD captures the group at their best. The concert itself is magnificent. Seeing the tour live and then watching the DVD gave me goosebumps all over again. The picture is crystal clear and the sound is amazing. If you are looking for something special in the extras you may be dissapointed. Being a big U2 fan I was excited to see the some footage of other tours were going to be on the DVD, but when I went to view them it was only a 30 second clip not even a full song. This DVD is still well worth getting and I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"We saw this concert when U2 performed at the University of Notre Dame, early on their tour (the date had to be delayed due to the events of 9-11).

Its oviuous this editor should'nt be editing any shows what so ever and needs lessons as to how to tell a story to an audience. We are not at the show, so stop trying to create an atmosphere, of swishing shots, because the atmosphere for the viewers is the flaming living room, and your job is to bring something into the room, not try and pull you in, with disasterous effects - what? A great big switch of OFF on the remote and a $13 dollar cash in at the second hand store.

Why all the movie style editing and camera work. At points it looks completely fake. It not even the entire show. Three tracks are missing due to them wanting to put other bonus stuff on there. The making of is really interesting though. Proves that they just manufactured a show. The energy and atmosphere at the show just plain sucks. Slane Castle was way better. Dont waste your money unless youre a huge fan. Get Slane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But U2 Slane Concert is Better","review":"Great musical performances, but Bono's voice is a little hoarse on some tracks. The mixing emphasizes bass too much overall, and the voice is drowned out a little on a few songs. The Slane concert is much better overall. Bono's voice is really fresh on that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great 5.1 showpiece","review":"A great high-energy performance by U2 during their \\"Elevation\\" tour in 2001. The band is in high gear during this performance, and they don't miss a beat. The presentation is great on this DVD - great visual effects, sweeping boom-camera movements. But the real centerpiece of this DVD is the Dolby soundtrack. You must have full 5.1 surround to do this DVD justice... A decent surround setup totally immerses you in the show; it almost makes you feel like you're at the Fleet Center listening to U2 live. The audio mix is top notch. The DVD also has some pretty cool extras, such as multi-angle, a making of documentary, and some additional tracks. I just wish it had some music videos...If you like U2, this DVD is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying","review":"I thought it was a great dvd. I've bought a lot of concert dvd's and this is definately among my top 5. It was really cool that you could see part of the concert from Bono's perspective. Undoubtably worth buying. Zoo Tv Live from Sydney was great too if you don't have that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am elevated and elated !","review":"After the intensity of Zoo TV and the seeking of Pop Mart, the Elevation Tour was a big hug and a kiss from the boys from Ireland. This is U2 at their spiritual, musical and interactive heights. From the loving interaction between the band members to the obvious delight of the fans this DVD captures a magical experience. Each tour from U2 is a gift and this DVD is an excellent way to remember! The tour is captured well -- great footage and sound.

I prefer the more outlandish U2 concerts like ZOO TV but the stripped down, intimate version is still better than any other concert out there. ... Bono continues whether he is at his best vocally or not to give his all in his emotion and the way he trys to touch everyone in the crowd. As far as some people whining about the camera focusing on Bono too much well he is the front man with a mike. Does it make sense to focus on Adam for 10 minutes while Bono is singing and jumping up and down 100 feet away? I would have given this 5 stars but as everyone mentions the leaving of One and several other classics was bad judgement. Don't bother with the 2nd DVD because it was a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 100% complete but...","review":"I don't give it a full 5 stars mainly b/c it's missing One, Mysterious Ways, etc,. from the original shows.

I mean no ONE,PRIDE,NEW YEAR'S DAY,ANGEL OF HARLEM, MYSTERIOUS WAYS,ALL I WAN'T, ONLY 1 SONG FROM ZOOROPA,no DISCOTEQUE,or STARING AT THE SUN!! They could have easily added 3 or 4 of these songs...I mean,no 'ONE'!! Plus I heard some of the Boston shows weren't up to U2 standards. Then again U2 at their worst are better than most. The extras look awesome though and hopefuly they'll make up somewhat for the play list. I'm still pi$$ed of cause they did almost the same thing at the Miami show I went to!Oh well,I'm getting it anyways..its U2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Fake' stuff going on...","review":"Beautiful Day is an awesome song, yes? But on this DVD, you can hear 'Bono' doing the backup, while the 'Edge' is actually attempting to fool the audience by lipping Bono's words. If you ask me, it looks retarded. What the hell were they thinking?Anyway, everything else is real. On surround, you have to pay attention to your center speaker, because if you don't 'increase' the volume, the performance drowns out Bono on nearly every 5.1 or DTS setting that you may have. I love U2, and thought that I would be getting a newer and amazing dvd; however, I got the shaft on this one.Do yourself a favor and go purchase yourself a DVD, but make sure its a movie. Ha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This One If....","review":"...you don't want to see another fawning review, because this is one too. This is quite simply the best concert video in existence.

Alcohol can be slightly corrosive, but the amount you get in these small bottles is nothing compared to the methonal gasoline mixes that are sold someplaces.This product claims to remove water, yet it contains no alcohol, the key chemical needed to dissolve water in the gasoline so both will burn instead of separating. It claims to contain \\"jet fuel\\". Jet fuel is similar to kerosene, and does not dissolve water. I just used two bottles of this STP Water Remover in my 40 gallon boat tank, and my boat stalled, after running rough for 20 minutes. I took the fuel filter off and found about 3 oz of undissolved water in it. I would like to see a scientific study of this stuff from an objective chemist not affiliated with STP to explain and rate it's ability to dissolve water."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good stories","review":"Maybe I have completely different tastes than the editors of this anthology, or maybe there just wasn't a whole lot of excellent fantasy published in 2003 but I found Year's Best Fantasy 4 to be a hit and miss affair. Many of the stories are decent but nothing special. A few are pretty bad. Even the usually reliable Neil Gaiman has a misfire with the dull \\"Closing Time.\\" Kelly Link's \\"Catskin\\" is just plain bizarre (but I suspect it's supposed to be). Among the few excellent stories are the Nebula Award winner \\"Basement Magic\\" by Ellen Klages, a clever update on the fairy-godmother story;One Thing About the Night\\" by Terry Dowling, a creepy ghost story involving a mirrored room; and \\"Dragon's Gate\\" by Pat Murphy, a well-told high-fantasy quest adventure. There are also some good stories by Lucius Shepard and Terry Bisson. I should also mention the editor's introductions to the stories often contain plot spoilers so I recommend reading those after reading the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Conan book by Howard I've read and I loved it","review":"Howard the creator of Conan is most definitely his master. His use of description is excellent and his exciting storyline kept me reading. I finished it a day. However, his treatment of the female characters leaves alot to be desired, but considering the time period it was written in it is still an excellent work of fiction and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the band, love the CD","review":"I saw the band on a salsa cruise and had to get the CD.

You'll have no problem at all setting it down to watch TV or cook dinner. The hero & heroine are pleasant, but you never feel that \\"connection\\" with them. The dialog is laughable, the plot thin, the love story weak and the end only slightly fulfilling. If you must read a Dodd book make it THAT SCANDALOUS EVENING. It is MUCH, MUCH better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this book down!!!!!","review":"I made the mistake of starting this book on my lunch break. Little did I know that I wasn't going to be able to put it down. Usually I look forward to going home to be with my husband, but after starting this I just wanted to go home and read. To be honest I finished the book the very same day I started reading it. I was very surprised at the twists and turns the book took towards the ends. I did think that the chasing of Evageline and Danior was a bit excessive and got old after a while.

He claims that she is the princess of Seraphina, his betrothed. Unable to convince him she is not the princess, Evangeline is kidnapped by a determined Danior.On the road to their kingdoms, they are shot at by revolutionaries, Evangeline runs away many, many times and the two fall in love. Will Evangeline ever be able to convince Danior she is not the princess, will he still love her if he realizes she is common?I found this book to be, although a good story, rather predictable.

I would have liked it to be more indepth at some points, but it was fun trying to figure out who was the real princess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pure Pleasure","review":"I laughed all the way through THE RUNAWAY PRINCESS. Her hero is big, domineering, sexy as can be and won't take NO for an answer. But the heroine is more than a match for him -- she's resourceful, quick-witted and funny, making wry observations about men (even in the 19th century, men apparently wouldn't stop for the directions --or anything else.) Dodd creates a fantasy country and then peoples it with irresistable characters in this fun and romantic fairy tale. You can't help but enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Runaway Plot?","review":"What was the point of this book? It did start off a bit interesting, and Danior is definitely appealing, the same can be said of Evangeline. The love scenes were very well written, but the plot, and ending where just too much to swallow. I do not believe a young man of character, let alone a Prince from an important bloodline would behave as Danior does at the end of this novel. And don't even get me started on THE PRINCESS. The half-brother was a disappointment and how can the nun be supposedly what Dodd is trying to sell? And the whole idea of this birthmark which isn't tattoo-ed on but appears on every single female of the lineage is laughable at best. There was some good banter between the couple, and I could have enjoyed it, but for the lack of realism.I enjoy romance, not fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks luster","review":"I thought this book would be a good read because of the reviews but to my dismay it was soooo boring.

I have enjoyed several of Dodd's Regency novels but this book is too much of a farce. The concept of an orphan reared by an ancient wise woman who is taught esoteric knowledge from all over the world such as oriental martial arts, treatises on how to climb and descend mountains, scientific knowledge on use of plants and to speak 7 languages in a remote English village who traipses off to the Pyrenees for adventure and is captured by a prince who thinks she is his long lost princess is just too outrageous.

Anyway, this figure is a great idea and really would have been great if it weren't so badly constructed. It comes with replaceable arms and legs that look excellent on the figure and really add to value of playing with it. BUT, the legs (any of them) do NOT stay on after a significant amount of use. The arms stay in nice and tight even after changing them many times, but the legs always come off whenever you try to have the figure bend at the hip in a back-and-forth or in a in-and-out motion.

Back then the ktel records were very cheaply done affairs. The records weren't as well pressed as the artists versions and such. But it didn't matter , you got alot of hits for cheap. This sounds alot better than the records did because this is digital. You get 10 solid early seventies hits like 'loves theme', 'shambala\\" by three dog night, \\"yes we can' by the pointer sisters, diamond girl by seals and crofts and some others, these songs still sound great today. And the best thing about ktel was that they mixed soul and pop and rock hits together.

New Jack loves stabbing Grimes with the fork, and I have doubts the stun gun brought into the match was the slightest bit real. The scaffold is high but there are tables stacked upon tables in the ring so it's not that big of a fall.The commentary is terrible. Most of the matches are terrible. If you like hardcore violence you might enjoy the deathmatch. The ring is very poorly lit and the picture quality is pathetic.Don't be fooled by the buck naked match.

New Jack is definately a sick MF'er, but Vic Grimes deserves major props for this as far as being hardcore. Other than that and the little part that showed Veronica Caine and Lizzy Borden (who were pornstars at that time) naked, the rest of the show was horrible! I still haven't figured out why they would book a match between Webb and GQ Money for their World Title! My 4 year son would beat the sh@t out of GQ Money easy. It's tragic that the world title of that wrestling organization has no clout anywhere. You know you have a horrible show when the crowd boos and yells \\"boring\\" the whole show.

The only reason i bought this DVD was for the scaffold match between New Jack and Vic Grimes since I am a very big fan of Jack whom i've met and is a very interesting person to talk to but the match itself sucked in my opinion the second reason was the buck naked match in which the lights go off when the girls get stripped down but they do atleast try to make up for it with doing a sort of striptease with the two ladies afterwards(available only on the dvd or video) but that in itself is only worth watching once and its pretty dull after.

For instance, on page 23 of Chapter Two \\"Let Them Eat Cake\\", Bossie mentions that Kerry voted in 1999 to increase tobacco taxes by $133 billion to pay for prescription drug benefits. His reference, #41 of Chapter Two refers to S. Con. Res. 20. This resolution refers to investigations into the bombing of the Israeli Embassy and has nothing whatsoever to do with tobacco tax increases.Make sure you check a writer's sources before you take his written word for fact.

Clinton and former VP Al Gore. His work is based on truth and facts. Always well researched. No forged documents here.Bossie's only fault is that he is too honest and too analytical.

Here's some information that it is difficult to believe, but true:This book was solicited to bookstores before it's publication, which is very common. This book, however, was a special case. When it was sold to bookstores, it was not presented as a book about John Kerry-- no, the tentative title was something along the lines of \\"Democratic Presidential nominee.\\"What does that mean? The author and the publisher decided they would do a very negative book about a flip-flopping, card-carrying liberal politician-- they just weren't sure of the outcome of a little formality called the Democratic primary, so they did not know who the book was going to be about. You know how Sports Illustrated or whoever runs a commercial right after the Super Bowl or the World Series with the team that just won?

There's one whole chapter where lowercase L's are used in place of the number 1.Apart from that, his peculiar \\"faction\\" or I-was-there style doesn't really suit the material, or his talents.

Many, including those pictured on the cover are left OUT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-gifter!","review":"I recieved this book as a X-Mas gift. RE-GIFTER. Brock Yates' writing reads to me like that of a fellow who has too much going on and decided at the last minute to add \\"write this book\\" to the list.There's a few decent passages, but so much of this seems read as bland, hurried text. I own it, but I sort of wish I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to read a research paper, read this....","review":"I have read other pieces that covered motor racing in the 50's and 60's, and this book read as if it was a research paper. Although the author was detailed in his accounts, he would change subjects frequently and the separation of chapters seemed random. Knowing about some of the events he wrote about, Yates seemed to rush through the races only to repeat a point as if it was his thesis statement. He would state his points bluntly instead of letter the reader discover what he was trying to say through a vivid account of what had occurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention to detail mars extensive research","review":"I got only so far as the build up to the 1955 season, which I believe was still chapter two, before growing tired of simple English errors which show a lack of attention to detail. Even the great Denis Jenkinson is the lucky recipient of an additional 'n' to his name.The author also attempts to pass the subjective as fact, and is heavily biased towards Americans. The book had the prospects of a fascinating read, though attention to detail is critical, and when he cannot get simple facts correct the book becomes worthless. Such is the case here. Do yourself a favor and buy anything by Christopher Nixon or Mike Lawrence instead, writers who don't bastardize the English language and check their facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"My imagaination is racing!","review":"I knew nothing about auto racing & I've never been to a race.

Well, time spent, time wasted...It is such an incredible thing the things they do to call for audiance, like \\"dance\\" semi-nude perfomances and most of the songs with extremelly innapropriate words. Unfortunately, many children likes these songs and their \\"dances\\" that I don't recommend for as many would not recommend Britney for them (but I think that even Britney is better for children).Even if you like Axe Music, you should be very careful for this CD. Daniela Mecury, Ivete Sangalo and Margareth Menezes have good dancing songs that don't appeal to dances and words that does not express the true face of the brazilian music. And put this CD away from children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think one more time before buying","review":"I'm advising you to think very well before buying this record, otherwise you will regret doing that.

I can't image it is a book that will interest the general reader with its physcoanalytic interpretations and academic lingo.

Two of the original quilters are leaving and the others interview people to take their places. Each chapter is about one of the interviewees. I found it difficult to get through. The only person I enjoyed reading about was Russ, the lone, male quilter. The others, especially Anna and her boyfriend and Karen and her husband, were more extreme caricatures, and annoying.

Oh well... maybe there's an instrumental version out there somewhere! Despite my feelings about the album, Do You Feel seems to have a pretty strong fan base, particularly among Christian rock fans.

This is almost like listening to a John Denver CD.(sorry) My suggestions is to not bother and purchase Eggshells if you are looking for another Shawn Mullins CD to compliment Souls Core.

I especially liked the iridescent fabric pictured on the turtle on the cover of the book. When the book arrived, the turtle had a boring green polyester fabric on his shell, and the rest of the touchable fabrics were of a lesser quality and less fun than in the fluffy chick book. Additionally, the stitching work looked sloppy, so I sent the book back. On top of all of this, the book was mailed 3 weeks after the rest of my order. I suggest buying a used version and washing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"tons of fun for baby","review":"This book contains everything you want in a children's book. The colors are bright and vibrant. The creatures are made of different textures that baby loves to feel. The crab has a leatherish shell while the octopus has eight dangling felt legs and the oyster's shell is lined with a nice silky cloth. The pages are lightweight so that baby can help turn the pages, but made of cloth so no papercut worries! My baby's not quite old enough to do any real damage to objects yet, but I've safety tested this book (the 3D objects, the stitching, etc) by pulling hard and test teething and the book seems very durable to me. And the cover is crinkly, which my three month old loves.

It has the same elements as Fuzzy Bee so my 2 month still enjoys it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I did not think this toy was as great as all the reviews indicated.

Each sea creature is interestingly textured and the short, 2 line rhymes on each of the 8 pages are clever and I actually enjoy reading them out loud. Of course, he loves to linger on each page and feel the terry cloth starfish or pull back the pink plastic oyster shell, revealing a pearl. I found myself going crazy over some of the silly rhyming books I was reading over and over, and while he doesn't appreciate the cleverness of the rhymes in Squishy Turtle, I can, and that makes a big difference!\\"Little fish with shiny scalesare fleeing from alarming whales!\\"Doesn't get much better than that.

First, the emphasis of this book is on simplifying your work place with limited references to simplifying your home or social life. Secondly, I did not find any new or revolutionary ideas in this book: It just took several pages to present ideas that take only one or two lines in other books on simplification and decluttering.Elaine St. James' \\"Simplify Your Life\\" on CD, as well as any of the Don Aslett books on decluttering, are superior to this book, especially for motivating you to actually begin decluttering and simplifying your life.

The title is the theme of the book as well as its own powerful metaphor of what is happening in the globalized world. His thesis is encapsulated in the subtitle of the book: \\"The Bigger the World Economy, The More Powerful Its Smallest Players\\". The ever-increasing speed of change provides ever smaller economic entities - businesses and countries - with greater opportunities given the flexibility inherent in being smaller. Pink talks about this in \\"Free Agent Nation\\". Naisbitt relates it to countries. It was this idea that inspired me (in my book \\"The Optimistic Jew\\") to think of Israel as a disproportionate (to its size) driving force in the world economy and to aspire to the highest median income in the world by 2030."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The first time, I read this book, I expected analytical contents and insights.

What a wonderful book. Each story had a life of its own. I have forgotten the beauty of the short story and how full it can be. The book was beautifully written, the deatil and description were so wonderful to read. This book makes other books I have read pale in comparison.

Buy your own copy, it is the kind of book you will want to read and reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic and great sensory details","review":"I enjoyed this book, mostly the second half. Although, 'The Shell Collector' story is one of the carrying pieces for the theme of the book. Great sensory details about one's connection with nature and soul-searching..and written so well. Most romantic is the last story and I am secretly hoping for a movie to come out about it alone =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to see that good writers are still being born...","review":"This is a very solid and enjoyable first story collection, particularly the title story and a little romp called \\"July Fourth.\\" You can see the gears turning a little bit, and there's a tendency to lay on the technical details too heavily, but Doerr's got great authority in his story-telling voice. He's like a nice mix of Richard Powers and Tom Paine, maybe without the fully realized vision of either, but without their weakness for didacticism as well.

In general, this is a book written with much indignation but little attention to the writings of those about whom Nagel is so indignant. The best part of the book is the section on religion, where he admits that his atheism is not as firmly grounded in reason as he would like it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential general guide for at home mechanic","review":"This is an essential reference guide that cover a wide variety of outboard motors.

The strip continues today, though only in reprint form, alas. There have been reprints from Kitchen Sink (these are the best), Dark Horse, Comics Revue, and many other publishers. Some of these are still in print, others can be found on ebay. This book, from Checker, reprises the Kitchen Sink material.The strip had its ups and downs, but most collectors agree that it was in its prime in three eras, the Alex Raymond era from 1934 to 1944, the beginning of a revived daily strip, by Dan Barry, Frank Frazetta, Jack Davis, Wally Wood, Harvey Kurtzman, and just about the whole E.C. Comics gang, from 1951 to 1955, and the Harry Harrison era, from roughly 1958 to 1964. (Harry Harrison also contributed to E.C.

Those colors are terrible: washed out, unfocused, uneven. Nobody in the know is going to be impressed by that boast.What you guys should have done was find the original black-and-white drawings, scanned those in, and then colored them afresh with vibrant, computer-generated colors.As it is, I think they scanned in the original newspaper printings! They look horrible! Frequently the text is so faint that one must strain to read it, and the colors look faded and amateurish.I bought all seven of these volumes -- some at great expense -- and am starting to rue my purchase. There is another printing of these coming up, and the guys behind that are apparently going to do things differently.

DeFelice is either a product of the dumbing down of American education, or is merely catering to the techno-nerds who couldn't tell an oratorio from an opera. The wrting is so devoid of cogent plot lines, developed characters, and continuity, that it might as well have been written for people who are more comfortable with pictures than words. This book is truly the result of someone imbued with the postmodern notion of deconstruction, i.e. that words have no meaning. It is nothing more than a listing of high-tech gadgetry (real or imagined) that would display itself in mindless video games. It is definitely a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alcohol Free IT IS NOT","review":"This claims to be alcohol free but the first inactive ingredient on the label is BENZYL ALCOHOL.

After using it for years, it is now riddled with attempts to get you to pay more for add-ons, charges rediculous amounts if you have questions or problems.And then...I spent two days trying to e-file, always getting a Server busy message from Intuit. This is AFTER they got my credit card number and $34. to file the fed and state tax returns. So I had to hand assemble the return and make the trip to the Post Office. Intuit lobbied the Gov to let them keep this big $$$ plum, and then screwed it up. They had this same problem last year, and it is WORSE this year. Time to call all our representatives and get E-File FREE from the IRS. It saves the IRS money, far more than it costs. Why is Intuit allowed to suck this much more from us after making big profits on the package?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taxes made easy","review":"As always, TurboTax Basic makes filing federal IRS taxes easy.

This is particularly bad for older users (like my parents) who don't want to have to buy a whole new operating system just to run Turbo Tax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping historical novel","review":"\\"The Falcon of Palermo\\" is a gripping historical novel.Its author, Maria R. Bordihn, introduced me to one of the most colourful and dazzling personalities in history: Frederic II of Hohenstaufen, King of Sicily and Germany, Roman Emperor and King of Jerusalem.I felt physically moved into the 13th century, where I took part in Frederic's life. I followed him in his search for the truth and came to admire him for his exceptional tolerance for other cultures and religions.Bordihn tells the story of his life, his struggle with the papacy and the crusades, his search for power, for freedom for his people and last, but not least, the story of his great passion for Bianca Lancia.Bordihn's historical facts are accurate. Her Frederic is vividly human and all the main characters she convincingly introduces really existed.This is a very well written book you will be unable to put down. You will solely regret the fact that there is no sequel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent historical novel","review":"Interested in medieval Sicily, I found this book a wonderful read. I was impressed with the historical accuracy and how Ms. Brodihn made the characters come alive. I loved the historical asides--for those of us who could use some help in this department. In other words, the author never left anyone behind. I also loved the writing style and the rhetorical techniques she used to move the story at a brisk pace. I now have a renewed interest in Fredrick II.

Through history, profiles, and photographic portraits by Carolyn DeMeritt, Gaillard tells the stories of those who, despite disease, removal, poverty, and oppression have managed to remain and at times even thrive in the lands of their ancestors.

This film noir is soft as a ripple of silk and sensuously ghostly. Pandora's mind is another dimension; where the captain is. A romantic ache is created between the lovers and we long for the completion. This movie is delusively calm.Fine acting, as expected, from James Mason the love-tortured captain Hendrik of The Flying Dutchman, who waits in the jewelled waters of Esperanza, a Spanish seaport, for fulfillment of a legend.

Poor sad souls. The Dutchman is a 16th century man and like Karloff in The Mummy he is pursuing his 16th century beloved through the centuries. The dialogue is frequently formal or mannerist, exceptionally romantic in the artistic meaning of the word. Totally appropriate for the baroque characters of the story. This is a tale Lord Byron could have spun for the Shelley's at his villa on Lake Geneva. The cast couldn't be better. The cinematography is excellent though the print isn't the best. I have it recorded off DVR. There is a DVD remaster out there which I think damages the mood of the film. They brighten the movie beginning to end. Technology run amok. This a film noire Romance. It's a dark story told by candlelight. It's a Carravagio; light and heavy shadow. I believe KINO's 1080p renovation is the offending version. Stick with the original print if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD format","review":"The ulitmate love story.

That tone is boredom. When Mr. Dyson is not trying to make your head explode with statements like \\"black pride is good but white pride is evil\\", he will instead try to conquer you by providing you with too much information written in a monotone style that would be more suited as a sleep aid.Michael Eric Dyson has abused the Seven Deadly Sins series for his own personal agenda, by pushing his writing to readers who would otherwise refuse to buy anything with his name on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm from Brazil!","review":"I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT BRAZIL HAS A WONDERFUL AXÉ AND SAMBA MUSIC, AND I KNOW, BECAUSE HERE IS MUCH HEARD.

Wayne plays it tough as the no-nonsense sergeant that clashes with marine John Agar, the son of his mentor. The emphasis in this film is on the action, which is what it should be, although the usual stock characters are brought out to round out the supporting cast. Real life battle footage is effectively mixed in with studio work to create a realistic feel to all that is happening. When you watch a John Wayne war flick, you pretty much know what you're going to get, and this one hardly surprises. But it is competently made, well acted by Wayne, and an easy way to fill in a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good neutral Balance Shoe","review":"Good neutral balance shoe.

The proofs don't always make sense. I'll get to the end of a proof and have no idea how the proof actually connects to the theorem. The problems are significantly more difficult than the examples provided. I don't understand why textbooks sometimes make such a big jump in difficulty from examples to the end-of-section problems, because I find it incredibly irritating and difficult to learn. My professor has basically quit using the book, but won't assign a new textbook because he doesn't want us to have to buy a new textbook. Like another reviewer pointed out, it's binding is really bad. Mine is falling apart more than any other textbook I have ever used and I barely open this book. I do not recommend this book. Surely there are better analysis books out there. My professor says Bartle or Rudin would be good options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst text ever","review":"Half way through chapter 1 I got online to find a different text.

Buy Mary Hart's Guide to Analysis in order to understand the materialGuide to Analysis (Macmillan Mathematical Guides). It will get you through the first half of Wade, but sadly ends before the second half of Wade. Only use wade so that you have the assignment questions.The author skips major sections of proofs necessary to understanding the material with a snide arrogance that is downright insulting to the student. It is astounding what tenured professors and coddled publishers can get away with these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Textbook for mathematics lover","review":"It has a lot of problems and concise anwsers and hints. It is a very good book to challeng your mind and push you to think more. I've read Apostol's, Rudin's and Courant John's Analysis textbook. Wade's is even easier and also clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Hated Book?!","review":"I believe a much better book is Victor Bryant's Yet Another Introduction to Real Analysis. At any rate, I'm defintely skipping this one. (This review also serves as a reminder to myself that I have decided to hate this book. The author shouldn't take it personally. It's just necessary due to the reality of a bounded rationality and its limited resources.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"review for Intensive Spoken Chinese","review":"It's a very good book. Quality is very good. Worth a buy if you're teaching. Has a lot of sample dialogues. The approach on grammar is pretty nice. Good to use as a text book.

Recommended as a textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sewing machine value","review":"Tension was perfect right out of the box. It is plastic cased, so I am treating it gingerly compared to the hefty metal machine on which I learned to sew. Very easy to thread and wind bobbins. The manual has very clear illustrations.

When I mailed Hirt's Gardens regarding my dissatifaction, they simply ignored the problem and suggested returning the hosta. They do not want to address the problem. Now I am stuck with a $10 plant that will not make it through the winter. What they could have done is told customers it would not be ready till next year, then shipped in the spring when the tissue culture had roots and could live outside. I have to assume that all their plants are this way, since that is the CHEAP way to grow hostas. This whole plant is no larger than a CHICKEN EGG, if that gives you a hint at how bad it is.

Design had major flaw with locking mech. You could only use the lock for the lid if the lid is sung to the handle which squishes larger food items thicker than a piece of paper. The lid locking mech is the real downer, seems like its just used for storage of the basket but you can't hold the lid in place when you flip the basket because it will get hot with the rest of the basket. Works great if you are cooking paper. Could not close grill lid on handle, grill lid will push up the whole basket. Also, when you flip the basket to top down, that side sits farther from the heat (not that big of a deal).

Always a plus. For the price, I can't fault them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasts","review":"These were nice while they lasted, they brake nicely and strong. The problem is they have been completely worn down in less than 100 miles of riding. I use them a decent amount as I stop at most stop signs and lights but to think they can wear down so quickly is a let down. I would not buy them again as it is going to cost me an arm and a leg to be replacing these monthly."},{"rating":"2","title":"brake pad review","review":"I purchased these pads to replace the factory ones on my bike.

If you are a world class mountain biker go for the high priced items."},{"rating":"2","title":"working good","review":"haven't had them long but so far so good, actually work better than the pads i replaced that came with bike. easy to install, no noise from them. easy to control braking. would highly recommend these. even work well in cold weather, today it was 28 degrees F and they performed well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice replacement pads","review":"These pads really helped my Giant hybrid stop better (smoother, quieter and faster than the stock pads). They fit well, make good contact with the rim due to their shape and look to be well-made. Time will how they hold up but I'm pleased with their performance thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most cost effective improvement to a consumser grade bike","review":"I bought a set of these to put the front wheel of a Schwinn Sidewinder 26\\" mountain bike. I ride paved/gravel roads some hills, and a railroad converted trail. The postitive reviews are correct. Before any other expensive brake upgrades try these Aztec 2 pads. They did not squeal at all... just be sure to set the \\"toe in\\" so the front of the pad hits the rim about 1/16-1/32nd inch sooner than the rear of the pad. Follow the instructions to the letter and you should have squeek free progressive brakes with real stopping power. I do not ride in the rain so I can't speak to wet performance but dry they feel better than good. I will buy another set to replace the rear OEM brakes soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the front brake, 'cause @ the back 1 they're just waisted!","review":"Of all the brands I had, this one has the best braking power, ever! Because of the weight-shift during (hard-) braking, the front brake has to be activated by the stronger hand! Since I'm right-handed, that's the right brake lever; for left-handed people I suggest to switch (or have switched, at a bicycle shop) the brake cables, to get the shortest braking distance possible! (It's not a matter of habit as some people say, it's a very important safety measure!)P.S. To be noted that the braking position of racing bikes (dropped handlebars) is very dangerous, because of the weight of the cyclist which is way too much up in front, this determined by the curved-forward position! In this case I advice to the owners of racing bikes, to get the cross brake-levers, which are mounted at the >top< of the dropped handlebars, in order of moving the center of gravity toward the back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Brakes","review":"The brake pads that came on my mountain bike were damaging my rims and nothing I did would fix the issue. I decided to try these Aztec2 pads and so far I am very happy with them. They have a larger contact area than my old pads and fit the shape of my 26 inch rims perfectly. I can stop significantly faster now and they don't chew up my rims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal to Kool Stops","review":"These stop the bike with the same exact feel as a set of regular Kool Stop pads. Quiet, not grabby, and good linear feel. Put these on my kids bike, so I don't know how they are in the wet. These pads are slightly curved to better fit a bike wheel. They lined up perfect with a 26\\" wheel. On my boy's 20\\" wheel, the curve allowed me to get more brake surface against the wheel than a straight pad would. I gave 5 stars because the standard Kool Stops get five stars. I don't know how these would compare to the pad inserts, but I do know they are better than the stock Shimano pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aztec Aztec2 Bicycle Brake Pads (Threaded) are GREAT!","review":"These pads excel when it comes to wear and stopping power.

My guitar sounded flat out amazing. I loved it.Yesterday (Now in October 2004) I decide to change my strings, as they are quite old. I put in the blue steels (which I bought arbitrarily, as I'm no expert on acoustic strings and these seemed like a respectable brand), and now my guitar sounds as the name implies - metallic, especially when played with a pick. There is little definition and quite honestly, I would not even consider buying these strings again.

Big Mistake.The tabs/chords that are included are inadequate at best and useless at worst. They might have well just left them out, rather than waste my time with 2-3 _measures_ of the song. Who's brain-damaged idea that it is sufficient to only include a few measures of a song?That being said, I enjoyed reading about the various artists. I don't mind that a tiny fraction of the best players were included -- to think that all of them should be included seems silly to me--such a book would be thicker than an Encyclopedia and cost hundreds of dollars. Of course no book will include all the artists that I think are important, unless I write it myself.Either way, avoid if you want to \\"learn to play like the greats,\\" consider if you want to learn _about_ the greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"Sloppy scholarship, ridiculous commentary. There are far better editions of Heraclitus's fragments available from Marcovich. The standard scholarly edition is now (and will be for many years to come) the multi-volume edition from Serge Mouraviev.Kahn uses (and abuses) Marcovich's edition of the fragments in this volume. Marcovich handed Kahn his hat in a lengthy and detailed review in Gnomon (54. Bd., H. 5, 1982). The positive reviewers do not know what they are talking about. This is not a serious work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Considered the academic \\"bible\\" on Heraclitus","review":"The book contains all of the fragments, and an exhaustive analysis of each one. Some of the commentary can get wordy and focus too much, in my opinion, on the author making it a debate on whether he or his academic peers are correct. But the way the author has grouped the fragments and explains the underlying themes in Heraclitus's philosophy, you can't help but be amazed at the extraordinary insights and poetic genius of Heraclitus. Anyone who needs to study him for a course, or has an extensive interest in the pre-Socratics, this book is essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Product","review":"Do not buy a Bialetti product! It is possible for the stovetop espresso maker to explode, damage your appliances, make a hole in your ceiling, and maybe seriously injure you if standing too close. When making a claim to the manufacturer, they will require you to spend serious postage to return the product to Italy, ignore requests for closure, and prolong the process.

I've had little experience with NetWare, and this helped me through my first few installs of NetWare5. The author does take time to explain things although she only touches on things I wished she covered more.

Server requirements are inaccurate. The book does not follow the exam objectives closely, which can be very costly. Some areas are not detailed enough to give you the information you need to pass: Block Suballocation, rights and IRF, installing a NetWare server and Z.E.N.works.Authors need to be more responsible when it comes to producing certification manuals, because their customer's careers are depending on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not quite there.","review":"This Study Guide provides a good reference for beginners to NetWare.

The ones I purchase from the store are buckwheat AND YAM. I think the yam and buckwheat taste better and are more fulfilling. For some reason I thought that's what these were but I didn't read carefully. I am very happy with my purchase. Delivery was horrible. They delivered the package on a bright sunny day but the box was so wet that it disintegrated when i tried to pick it up. WTF? This is not Amazon or Hakubaku's fault.

Like one of the reviewer has written before: it is not deep but it is also not broad, it is not a nice read, it stops at the point, when it would be interesting to dig deeper. Even the attempt of Epstein to marry practices of Buddhism with western psychotherapy is not more than an attempt.It seems the author was so enthusiastic experiencing Buddhism in his life that he needed to write a book about it. That makes sense for him but not for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant Reading","review":"After 20 minutes of reading I just couldn't take Epstein's self-absorbed writing style anymore.

When the main character, Bear, finds out his brother is a suspect, he is set between a rock and a hard place. He is the detective in charge of the case and has to face sending his brother to the electric chair or to set him free.

I'm sure there will be women who will find this type of truly rudimentary explanation illuminating, but do not buy this tape if you want to learn professional techniques. I was especially disappointed by title, it implied to me that there would be specific lessons in creating different looks, what they mean is there are two looks, (one for day, one for night) for many of the different ethnic models, and not even two looks for each of the models. Really not a terrific tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave me lots of good tips!","review":"I've been borrowing lots of makeup books and some of them have been very good.

I also liked the fact they had different nationalities as models (since I'm not white) and different artists. I preferred the guy makeup artists.

The very fact that readers are so evidently worked up about Carrie's personality indicates Packer's achievement -- these are made-up characters that she's conjured out of words, but she's made them human beings.Life doesn't always progress the way it should. People make bad choices, date the wrong people, act irrationaly. That's what makes life, and novels, interesting. Packer succeeds because she gets all the details exactly right.

I was very disappointed by the book, not by the ending but by the weak-heartedness of the main character. She depressed me and I wanted to throw the book out my window when I (finally) finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlett's savvy","review":"The audio version of this novel is entrancing due to a combination of fine writing and Scarlett Johansson's scratchy sexy interpretation, perfect for the character of Carrie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like 'Lifetime' movies...","review":"This book is very much like a made for TV movie. If this is your thang, you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....","review":"What a boring book. For the first time in my life, while reading a book, I skipped to the end to see what in the world was going to happen in this boring book. Therefore, half of the book went unread. One has to keep in mind, the book originally came out in 1959 if I read the front pages correctly. So when you read about the clothing - dresses, etc., remember the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a notch above a Danielle Steele novel","review":"Very disappointing after all the hype. This book just goes on and on with the dreadfully boaring lives of these people just out of college who act like they're still in the 9th grade. The dialoge did nothing to enhance any of the characters. Good thought behind the plot but no delivery. You CANNOT live in New York City [or just about anywhere else] for 3 months for free and why they heck did she wear her engagement ring the entire time even during her love affair with the \\"Kilroy\\" the ultimate \\"Kill joy\\".Quite a waste of time reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overpriced Harlequin Romance","review":"If you like stories like this, you can get them for around [price] at the supermarket checkout. Except for the fact that it was published in hardcover, this book has no discernible differences from the pulp romance genre. A young 23 year old woman, engaged to be married, undergoes a life-altering transition when her young, dashing fiancee becomes paralyzed! She escapes her contrained life by fleeing to New York and taking another lover--she also pursues her dream of becoming a fashion designer.. . .the sex scenes (frequent) are hilarious--full of euphemisms like \\"he pressed 'himself' into her\\"--also reminiscent of the Harlequin romance-genre. As a bland, predictable romance--it's okay. But to somehow claim that this book approaches \\"good literature\\" is just plain wrong. If you're in the mood for this kind of book--toss it in the shopping cart with the milk and eggs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unlikeable Carrie Bell","review":"I did not care for this book at all. I thought the first half of the book was very believable and thought-provoking. You might not like her character, but at least Carrie was facing truly deep moral issues...but then the second half of the book just proves that your first impression of Carrie was actually right. She is a shallow, young, clueless girl that is pretty much a loser. Not the \\"deep-angst, I feel sorry for your inner turmoil\\" loser, just a loser. She could not make a commitment to anything or anyone and therefore, left the end of the story to be flat. I like flawed characters, but Carrie was just see-through without any connection to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep engrossing book that stays with you long afterwards","review":"I feel very lucky to have happened upon this book. I was rummaging through an airport book store unable to find any of the reliable titles on my read list. Instead I took a chance on this first time author and it turned out to be the best book I've read in awhile. I don't like tear-jerkers, but I loved the real and complex emotion in this book, following the character along, understanding her every move despite willing her in a different direction at times. I felt connected to this book in a way I have not in quite some time. Although the ending will leave you with a few nagging questions, this is not a book that dissapoints at any stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shameful Main Character","review":"Carrie Bell has to be the most selfish woman I have ever read. I was outraged at her behavior when her fiance is tragically injured in a diving accident. Carrie chooses to play the woe is me role as if she were the victim. The woman never redeemed herself and while I know there are people like this and this is realistic, I really don't care to read about such a person. There must be some redeeming value in a main character in the book. This trait is fine for secondary characters, but when the whole story is told through her eyes, it gets pretty old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply lacking...","review":"The beginning of the book starts off a little bit on the slow side, but once Carrie meets Kilroy, the books takes on a whole new life. The most interesting parts of the book was the character of Kilroy, it brought spice to an otherwise average list of characters.I really started enjoying it until she went home to Madision. Never in my wildest dreams did I think the book would end the way it did. I felt that it made the storyline and buildup completely fall apart. Midway through the book, I thought the author was trying to make the point of, it is natural for people grow out of relationships. That is what helps one mature. It was evident she had nothing but good memories in Madision and so such a bright future awaiting her in New York. I didn't agree with the heroines final decision. It left me irate and disguisted by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. As I read it I kept waiting for it to get better. It just seemed to drag on way too long, not really going anywhere and when you get to the end all you can think is \\"that's it?\\". I would save your money and just watch the TV version of it on Lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing(Spoiler)","review":"What I got from the book/movie was that she stayed with Mike because he was one of her demons that she had get rid of before she and Kilroy can get together.I would love a sequel to Diving with Mike as he finds a new love that doesn't think of him as one of her demons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I don't understand the positive reviews for this book. It was a big disappointment. I felt like I was reading a Judy Blume book - this book feels like it is written for teenagers. The characters are two dimensional and the literary devices cliche. I was angry for wasting my time with this book, but kept reading to see if it got better. It didn't. If you are at all curious, read the first and last four pages of this clunker. Not much happens in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Mike becomes a quadraplegic.His fiancee, Carrie, leaves town for the big city in search of herself. She sews, takes a lover and spends several months feeling gulty only to return home the same person she was when she left.The book is easily read, but incredibly boring and shallow. The characters remain undeveloped through 400+ pages. I kept reading, although I must admit I frequently read only every other page, and I'm fairly certain nothing substantial was missed.If you still want to give it a try, buy it used. Better yet, visit your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!!!!","review":"I was really into this book till close to the very end...and then I feltreally angry and cheated. The writing of the book and character developmentwas going great. And then I felt shocked that the writer had chosen the maincharacter to go back to her codependent chameleon life where her past offamily and friends owned her after she wrote pages of her breaking out and transforming.Very disappointing and sad...I am sorry that I even read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"... couldn't put it down","review":"... but not for the reasons you think. I couldn't wait to see if Carrie would turn into an interesting character - and of course, she didn't.Being from a small town in the Midwest myself, it's easy to understand the supposed mentality of those around her. But the friends are so stereotypical and unmotivated that even I didn't believe them. Then she goes to New York to try and \\"find herself\\" and THOSE people are cookie-cutter, as well. Carrie so clumsily feels her way in the dark in this novel, that it left me wondering a) if the author had ever actually experienced life in either of the cities and b) what possessed her to write a story around Carrie, the most flaccid character ever, in the first place. If the point of the book was to convince the reader that Carrie was deserving only of the lack of the emotion she originally showed Mike after his accident (and her best friend who she all-but abandons and her mother, who she barely keeps in touch with): mission accomplished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Realistic","review":"An excellent read. The author had me wanting to know \\"what will happen\\" throughout the whole novel. I found the book not only to be entertaining but very realistic. This reader could relate to Carrie's thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I alone out here?","review":"This book was chosen, unread, by a member of our book group. When the selector finished reading it she called several of the other members saying she hated this book, disliked the graphic, gratuitious, soap-opera-sex style of writing. She disliked the characters, finding no one who seemed authentic. She made the statement, \\"I chose the worst book in our 4 years of meeting.\\"When she made her calls, it was to find out that only 3 out of ten even continued reading the book to the end and all unanimously agreed with her assessment. This group is a cross section of ages, experience and all are extremely well educated and have great tolerance for lives different from our own. However, we found the writing lacking in \\"elegant prose\\", and couldn't identify with anyone on any level. Cardboard characters with real concerns but only cardboard solutions to those concerns.Please tell me the \\"Young readers\\" mentioned in editorial reviews won't buy the media hype. This book is schlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Packer's The Dive From Clausen's Pier kept me turning pages not only because her prose is strong and graceful, but because this is a story resting on Packer's conviction that life is fragile and that it's the worst times that reveal the truth of who we are as human beings. This novel is poignant and compelling, sure to satisfy readers who are drawn to stories about our own uncertainties about where our loyalties lie and how much we owe the people we love. It vividly captures how the bonds of friendship are pitted against the trials of surviving a tragic accident."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dive From Clausen's Pier","review":"Look away for an instant and your life could change drastically. While going through the motions of life Carrie Bell has no idea what she wants or how to get what she wants. Twenty three and engaged to her high school sweetheart, never leaving her hometown and abandoned by her father.One day her life all changes when her fiance dives from the pier into the water becomes a quad. After Mike wakes up Carrie freezes and runs to NYC where she flounders and enters a relationship destined to fail. When her best friend calls with a tradegy Carrie realizes she has to go back and make amends.This is a book of relationships that teaches you in an instant your life will change sometime for the better or worse.

A quick read and absorbing at times, but in the end it left no impression at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was let down by how the book resolved","review":"I became really engaged with this book and especially caught up in the NYC part [ since I have lived here for 20 years]. I cannot speak about Madison but I did get the feeling regarding NYC that she was creating largely stereotypical characters. I also felt that she had so much promise as a designer that she should have stuck with Parson's School of Design and was too influenced by relationships than really finding her true core and who she was as an individual. I wondered if down the road, she would not be sorry she did not stay in NYC.But my biggest gripe was the ending conversation with Kilroy. He was a complex character as well as being terribly dysfunctional and I felt that his character needed a more interesting and complicated explanation than the simple one answer about his brother being the cause of his behavior.Like many books, this one was good until the last part and I did not think the resolutions were very satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and dull.","review":"The premise of this novel really caught my attention, but there just isn't any substance. Mike is paralyzed after a dive into a reservoir, and Carrie, his fiance, is torn between doing the \\"right\\" thing or ending the relationship...which we find was in trouble before the accident. It is hard to care what she does after the plodding and lack luster beginning to the book. Carrie just seems to be devoid of personality and spunk. I was glad when she decided to run to NYC, and saw a bit of hope when she found her \\"calling\\". Unfortunately the end was as gloomy as the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dive from Clausen's Pier","review":"The title entices. But the book is unsatisfying. Don't waste time with these characters. They are all selfish, pitiful, co-dependent bores. Carrie Bell's personal quest barely keeps the plot moving forward through settings which are stereo-typical images of New York and the Midwest. Readers are offered a predicatble ending with trite explanations about motives. As for the 'intimate and emotional' thrills, touted on the back cover? They are more like 'guilt trips and loosely defined moral values'. Send this book to the bottom of Clausen's reservoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"why does everyone give ole' carrie a break? i couldn't find any reason that her boyfriend, her best friend, even her mom thought she could do no wrong. they were sure understanding. that's unconditional love all right. then there are these people who walk into her life and are instant \\"soul mates\\", Simon, Kilroy, Lane. What is the attraction? i couldn't find anything in her personality that would make her so instantly appealing. she sure didn't have much of a sense of loyalty. she \\"loves\\" Mike, she \\"loves\\" Kilroy, what a way to show your love. i finished this book thinking, \\"what in the heck was the point?\\" did the author have a purpose here, what is she trying to say?i, too, was looking for some connection between the nightgown and the story. was there one i missed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one book was a complete waste of my time.","review":"I bought this book in August, thinking I would read it immediately, which of course didn't happen. SO I finally sit down and read it, and when I finished I had wished that I had lost it before getting to read it. It started out with so much hope of being a really good book. I was so utterly dissapointed.The book could have been sooo great, but she misses the mark about 3/4 of the way through.Please don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whimp","review":"I started getting into the book when she went to NY. All of the sewing!!! I was so happy when she started design school, I thought great ...she's finally going to do something.Kilroy was definitely the most interesting character in the book, I wanted to know more about him, his brother Mike, his family, his time in France.I couldn't believe the ending, what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have done without it","review":"Starts off ok, then muddles along endlessly. Its ok but I wouldn't waste time reading again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dive with a devastating ending","review":"Being a former midwestern and having numerous family members graduate from University of Wisconsin at Madison I was really excited about the book taking place in Wisconsin. Ann Packer does a fabulous job describing Madison and the charachters in the book. The book focuses on relationships not only with couples but with friends and family members as well.When Carrie moved to New York City I enjoyed reading about her journey but with some doubt. Having spent a couple of years in the \\"City\\" I found it a bit of a joke that it was so easy for her to exist without a bit of culture shock. It seems as if Carrie cannot function without a man in her life. The ending was a bit hard to believe. All in all, it is a fabulous read and I learned quit a bit about individuals in wheelchairs.Check it out - you won't be able to put the book away and forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, tedious..........","review":"This book is very benign considering the subject matter. Carrie as the lead character is one dimensional.It's very hard to like the character of Kilroy and he's oh so boring! There's no \\"love\\" here, just sex. Carrie doesn't even know who he is half the time.I wanted to stay in Madison during most of the New York chapters, with everybody else BUT Carrie.A big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but the [weak] characters and plot did nothing but annoy. It has it's moments, but they are so few and far between that they paled in comparison to the rest of the tedium."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dive from Clausen's Pier","review":"Started off with a great deal of promise... but I was physically unable to finish. A truly horrific main character, who inspired nothing less than repulsion and dismay. The book quickly became unrealistic, as how anyone could covet such a selfish, spoiled person is beyond me. Strong first 75 pages followed by a great deal of unbearable repetition and needless detail. Do yourself a favor and AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!","review":"I could never identify with the main character. She had NO redeeming qualities and never grew as a person. She was very selfish and finally I really didnt care what she did or how she felt. Dont waste your time reading this one with so many good books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much unrealized potential...","review":"I agree with all of the reviewers who were drawn in by the premise, and disappointed with how the book carried it to conclusion. Several things didn't make sense, or seemed like NYC plot contrivances, but the thing that doomed the book for me was the utter lack of a sympathetic protagonist. For the first few chapters I was right there with Carrie as she struggled with her decision. What soon became apparent was that being wishy-washy, self-absorbed, and incapable of following through on a decision was not just her starting point as a character, but her ending point. I really didn't care what she chose, I just wished she would stop explaining bobbins and out-dated dresses(dark green velvet? really?) and hurry to the conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"Positives:I enjoyed the character development of Mike. He was such a focus of the novel that I felt he was the only one I really got to know.Negatives: (sorry if you liked it, I really didn't...)I found this to be very predictable.. in a bad way. Is there even a good way to be predictable?A lot of it was also completely unbelievable.. Hello? Free rent in NYC? Reality check please.So much of the plot developed her relationship with Kilroy, and then it ends up burning out and I was just like- what? That was such a waste of time.Not to mention the central characters relationship to her fiancee... They were supposedly together for 8 years and they just stop talking? Trying? They both just give up- and practically IN SILENCE? It seemed so unrealistic. It was such a relief the few times in the book when the central character cried. I was practically begging her to cry. Even when she did, though, it felt contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffocating","review":"Many too many details. This book was okay to read, but it was pretty depressing and difficult to get through. It deals with a some tough themes (loving, letting go, self-exploration, family responsiblity, expectations, ethics). It's easy to slip into the main character's shoes, although her shoes are rigid, uncomfortable, and terribly, heartbreakingly painful. The writing was not bad, but it's just a difficult story to read. Not uplifting in the least. Could definitely have been streamlined, it felt quite drawn out, which is undeniably what the main character probably felt like in the situation she is put in. Not one to read again, for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God it was a gift!","review":"If I would have wasted my money buying this book I would have been very sad. Few times have I ever given up on a book, but I did this time. I made it more than half way through and I just couldn't take anymore. It was a punishing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?? Bestseller??","review":"My cousin and I read this book for a book club we are in. We read it while we were on vacation together. Both of us could barely get through the book and had to keep eachother going by finding ridiculous references and descriptions of Carrie's boyfriend, Kilroy (yes, Kilroy.) The best part of the book for me was when my cousin finished it and threw it on the bed with a sigh of disgust followed by a sigh of relief. The book itself, however, annoyed us so much that even sitting on a beach at a luxury hotel in Cabos could not make us feel better about having to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dive From Clausen's Pier","review":"I'm a teacher and I enjoy reading during my summer break.I had to make myself finish it as I did not care what happenened to any of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer vacation novel.","review":"I just got back from a vacation in Lake Tahoe where I read The Dive From Clausen's Pier. I thought that the premise for this story was so interesting and the characters were very unique. I was intrigued from the beginning, wondering what Carrie would do next in her search for her \\"self\\" and whether it would lead her back to her quadraplegic fiance.Ann Packer is a very eloquent writer and I enjoyed her descriptive wording. I finished the story wondering what would happen in the life of Carrie Bell. Hopefully, Ann Packer will give us another glimpse into her life in the future with another story about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written slow drive to the end","review":"it's a well written novel and that's why i read to the end. the charachters are bland at best and the story is slow moving and predictable. i don't presonally recommend reading this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Looking for a great summer read? This book is not it. Packer's characters are lackluster at best. There's little to like about any of them. They have little depth, are wooden and remote, like they aren't really in the story, just sort of hovering around the edges of the plot. And, just when you think there might be an interesting story line developing, it slips away. This book is not clever, compelling or intriging. I kept reading,hoping the story would deliver in the end, but it never happened.Don't let the book reviewers fool you. There is nothing satisfying about this novel. Reread anything by Annie Proulx instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying Angst","review":"This was a strange novel that meandered its way to the finish, which ended with a sigh rather than shout. Carrie was such a weak character that I found myself rolling my eyes half the book.And I thought this novel would be about empowerment, but instead she ends up sacrificing her dreams for a guy. This particular guy doesn't even seem to care about her hopes and dreams, even though he says he loves her.This book started with promise, but it sputtered at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this girl ever stop whining!!!!","review":"This book sounds interesting, but does not deliver. I became very frustrated with the main character. It seemed like she felt guilty just so that those around her would feel sorry for her. Actually, she feels so sorry for herself that there is little space for anyone else!!! I ended up siding with Mike's parents when they tell her that they feel she isn't \\"reliable\\". She pretends to be a strong woman, but is really just a spoiled brat. Don't bother reading this one!!Oh. . . WHO lives in New York for 3 months for FREE??? Come on Ms. Packer!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"This book was a featured selection on Good Morning America which caused me to receive it as a gift. Having now slogged through it, I'm forced to conclude that [the] book club has been reborn on GMA. If The Dive is an example, GMA is making the same kind of selections...namely novels dealing with angst- and guilt-ridden women in excruciating detail while ignoring any semblance of good plot development.There's a big market for books like The Dive. No doubt the same market that [some talkshows] target[s]. However, unless engaging in several hundred pages of handwringing and indecision with a protagonist is what you want, take a pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, shallow, and predictable","review":"The plot is predictable, the characters are shallow and boring post-adolescents, and the underlying social premise is victorian. If you have to read this for a book group, read the first two chapters and the last one, and skip the tedious chapters in between. You won't miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does it all mean ?","review":"I have to say this book was a big letdown, even though it is rather well-written. I can't possibly like a book where I can get to the end without once understanding the protagonist's motives. Ok, so she moves to New York City to get away from a difficult situation with her paralyzed boyfriend-then what ? Why does she get involved with \\"Kilroy\\", who is completely emotionally unavailable ? Doesn't it bother her that he is so distant and unapproachable ? Why does she up and leave to go back home ? Shouldn't she at least let her lover know she is leaving him ?I gave the book two stars because of the interesting cast of supporting characters, and the description of Carrie's life in Wisconsin. Apart from that, I had a strong desire to shake the heroine by the shoulders, tell her to wake up and stop being so passive and emotionally half-asleep.I can't recommend a book that left me feeling so irritated at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hype doesn't make sense","review":"Reading this book was mostly frustrating. I too didn't like Carrie (or Kilroy, Jamie, or Mike for that matter) or her snobbery about the midwest (although I have no objection to Carrie's main decision after Mike's paralysis).But being a frustrating read with an unlikable characters doesn't MAKE a book bad. Dive From Clausen's Pier could have been an interesting book had the motivations for people's actions been realistic or well-explained. But they weren't! I have no idea what Carrie is thinking at the end and why she thinks she is making a good decision. What kept me reading was the big \\"secret\\" about Kilroy that was dangled in front of you for most of the book. It turned out to be completely unsatisfying and unrealistic as a reason for why he is the way he is.I really don't get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was mistaken","review":"I read about 1/4 of this book and then put it down--picked it up again read about 1/4 more--so about 1/2..and I stilled didn't like it. The themes running through this book were familiar--and not really new. I grew up near Madison and thought reading about some familiar places would be fun--author used some familiar names but there locations were different. I know this is a work of fiction but it even pushes that genre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"starts out well, ends badly","review":"This book could have been so much better. I really enjoyed the beginning of it and kept wondering how it would end. I wanted to see Carrie become a self-sufficient fashion designer in NYC. Instead, she is a victim of the Midwest and a classic martyr character. How pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Give me a break. What a very boring book. Carrie is so shallow. All the characters lack depth. It made me think of the book, The Prince of Tides. Someone with problems goes to New York to find himself. But the Prince of Tides had so much more. In fact, it is one of my favorite books. I cannot believe I spent several hours reading this book hoping something would happen to make me believe that it belongs in the best seller category. Actually I never read it all, I skipped to the end after finishing two thirds of it. Surely this author must be related to the publisher and was due a favor. I am so glad this selection was a loan from the library and I lost only valuable time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book - perhaps it would have been more engrossing if I had read it but I doubt it. The \\"reader\\" sounded like she was bordering on laryngitis, which was annoying enough, but her reading was bland and devoid of any emotion.The story itself had promise but I found the writing to be uninspired and the diagolue weak. It was also lacking in depth and I found it hard to care about any of the characters. I literally had to force myself to finish listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"If I could give this book 0 stars I would. I can honestly say that it is the worst book I've ever read. Packer's main charater, Carrie, is unlikable, indecisive and just down right annoying. As a matter of fact, all of the charaters are annoying. Trust me, any other book you pick will be 10 times better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I was really disappointed by this book, given the great reviews. I found the characters not believable and the dialogue awkward. It was boring and I finally put it down after struggling through the first half of the book. Don't waste your summer on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This coming-of-age and self-realization story is one that, unfortunately, did neither. While the author did a successful job of setting up a situation that made it possible for the main character to grow and expand, she (both the author and the character) seemed to grow tired of all that required effort. This resulted in a work that never seemed to attain its possibilities. The stylistic characteristics of the work were not enough to rescue it from this short-coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"First of all, it took me two weeks to get through this book. That is bad for me. Secondly, I could completely empathize with Carrie's need to find more in her life. To live her own life even if that meant hurting others. I could even understand her moving in with people she barely new and taking up with a new lover. I could not however understand why she did not follow through. I mean, I understand why she goes back to Wisconsin at the end of the book, but why on earth did she stay? Was it guilt? I felt as though the author rushed through the ending and didn't take the time to make me feel as though I understood her decision to stay in Wisconsin. It is not as though she was getting back together with Mike. Finally, just a little \\"fat\\" to chew on....who the hell is able to live in New York City for almost a year on $1,800 from a savings account with absolutely NO job!?! Even if she didn't have to pay rent no one could do that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Boring","review":"This book was so boring I put it down after 100 pages, after peeking to see that it went on and on in the same predictable way. I can't imagine why anyone would care about Carrie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading....","review":"I give this book only four stars because the main character - Carrie Bell - is possibly the most selfish character I've ever gotten to know. I didn't like that, I didn't like her and, since the book is ABOUT her, I have to account for that. However, the book is nicely written. I enjoyed it and, although I won't ever read it again, it was worth the week I spent on it. Be warned however that there isn't much substance to this story. I told someone about it after I had finished and ... well ... I told a pretty full account of it in under two minutes. The story is pretty basic. There are some good questions raised by the story but much of it is just mundane detail. However, it is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoyed","review":"Yes, it has its flaws but I found this book to be really engaging and read it almost straight through over the holiday weekend. Couldn't put it down. I felt like the author really understood the 20-something mind--and yes, Carrie was mixed-up, illogical, self-centered at times. That's how it is at that age for many. I do wish the author gave us more with the character of Kilroy and that the ending offered Carrie a wider horizon, but those are minor complaints. Great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marytrdom?","review":"I was only mildly interested in reading this book as I felt the writer was going to toy with us and she did. Ann Packer seemed to be determined to take us down a long and winding road, one that did not engage, only left the reader cold and frustrated. I feared what Carrie would choose to do and she didn't surprise. To give up the dream of going to fashion design school in NYC, and to leave a man she admits she still loves, smacks of guilt. Once I saw the predictable outcome, I stopped reading and skipped to the end, hoping I was wrong in my assessment. Unfortunately, it was predictably unimaginative. If you're looking for something philosophical, there are more appropriate choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"I loved the opening chapter--it was shocking, jarring, and beautifully written. The book doesn't let up--I was hooked from the start and read it almost straight through. Carrie is a complicated character--likable and flawed as we all are. A truly compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly surprising and wonderful","review":"I loved this book and I can't quite get away from it. There is a wonderful lesson about loving people here. People aren't always what they seem; each situation gives something new. Don't miss this book. I am a librarian; I read everything. There is something here that you cannot miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull read...........","review":"I was anxious to read this book after hearing it reviewed on Good Morning America. They made it sound like the best book of the summer! I felt it started off well but never did much after the first few chapters. I did not like the main character, Carrie. Just could not relate to the choices she made and found her very self-involved. Also did not care for Kilroy who was very self-important.I made myself read the whole book in the hopes that it would get better. Carrie just seemed to float through life with no plans, no ambition and not much thought for her so-called friends! The end was also a disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it GMA that started the hype on this book?","review":"I will never again follow a recommendation from them. This was painful to read. I read 150 pages and came to my senses and quit punishing myself. There wasn't a character I cared about or respected. This book should be tied to a boulder and pushed off the closest pier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Cry, cry, I don't like my boyfriend anymore.

The only character in this book I could stand was Kilroy, he was the the only one with any depth.In the end Carrie ends up exactly where she started, I doubt any wiser. This book was a waste of my time, avoid reading it if you can, maybe watch the movie that just came out on lifetime? It would take less time, and you could have that many hours back in your life"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just watch a Lifetime channel movie instead","review":"This book is written in the first person. For 413 pages, I suffered through Carrie's boring life, but amazingly by the end I still didn't get what made her \\"tick\\". The characters are so shallow and poorly developed that I felt(as you can read I stink as a writer) like I wrote this book --- when I was in highschool!!! Book is full of cliches. By the end you don't even know what point the author was trying to make - but then again by that time you may just be happy that you're done and that you can move on to a better book. Save your money and watch a Lifetime movie - at least you will only waste 2 hours of your life that way and save $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"pullease.","review":"this was a pretty horrible read. the book started out with a bang and coasted down from there. what happened to kilroy?? sheesh.will everyone think less of her if she dumps mike? YES. is she mature and capable enough to deal with such a limited future. NO. adding the stress of caring for a paraplegic to an already failing relationship would be a recipe for disaster. compare this to the realization of her dreams - carrie was right on the brink of becoming what she was meant to be. from now on she can use all of that incredible fashion sense in the design of mike's nappies. gimme a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glurge","review":"If you are looking for gripping drama keep walking.The best way to use this book is as a self help guide as Carrie (the protaganist) weighs choices for pages without end.Their was one character I cared about. One character in the bunch who was central enough to register and wasn't so emotional immature that I could care about his history.It led me to soul searching. But that was for more satisfying than the book itself.And the ending would've angered me to no end if I were emotionally invested enough in the characters to BE angry.I just felt I was wasting my time.To the Good?Packer captured the monotony of a life that has never changed nicely. The claustrophobia of sameness.The difficulty of making life altering decisions before you feel ready.But in the end?I didn't care about any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped, underwritten","review":"I had heard and read so much praise for this book, I ran out to buy it the day it came out in paperback. What a huge disappointment. I felt like I was reading the script for a Lifetime TV movie of the week. After Carrie moved to NY, it was all downhill. Ridiculous situations, thinly written characters, and a sappy ending. I skimmed the last 100 pages just for plot, and to find out what choice she made. By the end, I just didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"Carrie just lets life happen to her - everyone she comes in contact with knows what she will end up doing before she does. Lots of people just let life happen around them, but it doesn't make for a good read. Her only passion is sewing, and it doesn't make for a good read either. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting points but mostly stagnant","review":"This book introduced very common characters with common lives. Nothing spectacular. After the accident the main character takes a downward spiral into selfishness. She runs away from her problems abandoning all her friends and family back home but the storyline wasn't more interesting than that. She tries to reconcile but does a poor job because she's afraid and too self involved with her new lover. A slow story about nothing more than a girl who likes to sew and has no life after college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle & Gripping","review":"I just finished this book, and felt it was great. I almost didn't pick it up because I thought it might be depressing (it was, but bearable) given the subject matter: paralyzed boyfriend, relationship in the dumps. I found myself relating to the main character Carrie for several reasons: I studied fashion design in New York City, dated a paraplegic guy, and have felt that frustration at the end of a long-term relationship when you know its over, but don't know how to extricate yourself... Brilliant observations of minute details in everyday life that somestimes we miss, or sometimes we notice, especially in moments of stress when a fly on the windowsill becomes something you can't tear your eyes away from.I look forward to more of Ann Packer's work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had big hopes for, but still hoping...","review":"I am currently reading this book, and already struggling to get through it. I had also read all of the reviews, and was excited to begin reading. However, halfway through and I am already wondering how long it will take me to finish it. The beginning had promise, with the underlying currents in Mike and Carrie's relationship, the hot-headed best friends Rooster and Jaime, but I feel like the book is now wandering. All of the sudden Carrie is in New York hooking up with someone she met once in Madison. Huh? I am sure I will end up finishing this book, but I don't anticipate it being an outstanding reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to get lost into","review":"I loved this book. It held my attention from the first word all the way to the end. It is really a book a person can get lost in the story and find themselves unable to put the book down to get to the end. I was a little disappointed in the ending, though. Seemed a bit cut off, but all in all a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"This is by far one of the best books I have read. As someone who has little time for pleasure reading, I found this book to be nowhere near a waste of time and definitely not boring. The characters are complicated and dramatic enough to be novel material, yet realistic enough to relate to. The issues that Carrie deals with are those that affect every woman in her early 20s. She must decide what she wants from life and whether or not the town of Madison is standing in her way. There are times when you hate her and other times when you just want to console her, but in the end you can accept her for what she is . . . human. Packer's writing is engaging and, unlike some other books being produced lately, not too witty for her own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.....","review":"Overall, I was disappointed. The idea was good and the plot and characters could have been much more developed without the cheap sex scenes. Ann Packer has talent, but needs to \\"clean up\\" her story lines. It's sad to me to see the lack of Christian standards in her characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Angst","review":"This novel is far too dark...and draggy...for me. One loses patience with the main characters about halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzz....","review":"I thought Dive from Clausens Pier was one of the most boring things I have ever read in my life. Pages and pages of this book are spent describing sewing...and it's not a sewing manual. I thought surely that all the sewing talk would actually lead to Carrie's finding a new career, but no. Apparently, we just get to hear about it endlessly and it goes nowhere. Much like the rest of the book. Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book.","review":"This was not your typical chick lit book, but might have had a bit more depth to it. I enjoyed this book and had fun going on her journey with her. Not everyone or everything turned out perfectly, but it was a satisfying ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Bad","review":"I'm not sure I've ever read a book so utterly boring or encountered such unlikeable characters. The review entitled \\"Reality Check\\" has summed up the essence of the main character as an \\"annoying, condescending and selfish cypher.\\" It's unclear to me why or how this book made it to the best seller's list but I suggest you save yourself the time, money & disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I have never written a review before but this book was so laughably bad that I felt compelled. The book is a bad romance novel filled with shallow characters and cliches. The characters are shallow, superficial, and unbelievable. Carrie, the main character has the intellectual and moral capacity of a preteen. The circumstances of her life are neither believable nor compelling. I wanted to throw it out after 100 pages, but it was picked for my book group so I forced myself to finish it. I should have thrown it out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHARACTERS ARE AWFUL","review":"I didn't care a hoot about the selfish main character and was not impressed with Packer's writing style. This book was not well written and the characters did not seem real. All in all, quite boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of losers","review":"This book was about people who are losers. People who remain friend or lovers with people they went to grade school with because they don't have enough self-esteem to get a real life.The main characters in this book live in a microscopic world of limited emotions, selfish neurosis and fear of life. It was pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst dialog I've read in a long time","review":"This book is so horribly written at times I want to heave it across the room. My dog keeps looking up at me as I read with confused, questioning eyes as I groan over and over, unbelieving how bad the dialog can be. It is completely juvenile and contrived. And the character Carrie is unlikable and whiney. This book was so highly promoted and recommended that I bought a hardback copy, excited to read it. The premise is interesting and seemingly thought-provoking; the end product is sappy and boring. It's the 'Bridges of Madison County' of 2002. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly engaging","review":"I wanted to like this book. The premise was interesting. The prose was nice. The dialogue pretty real.I even bought a few of the characters. I wanted to like it a lot. But that Carrie Bell was a real piece of work. The author's insistence on perpetuating the image of the Midwest as a vapid expanse of bland nothingness and by contrast, New York City as a cultural mecca so ripe with coolness that even tortured, emotionally detached losers are deep, is an insult to residents of both areas. Don't even get me started on the inexplicable arrival of the very trendy Gay Male Best Friend character...All that said, I did finish it. I found it interesting. And, glaring cliches aside, well written.Perhaps it was simply the Wisconsinite (NOT Wisconsonian) in me who just couldn't get over the insult of having being born and bred in the same state as that whiny, shallow Carrie Bell."},{"rating":"1","title":"The world through an unaware person's eyes","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but was dissapointed. The lead character appeared to be skimming along through life, and I found myself reading the book much the same way hoping for something to catch my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rate it 2.5, but don't have the option.","review":"By half way through \\"The Dive..\\", I was just biding time, waiting for things to wrap up so I could move on.It seems like a kid's book, a coming of age story better recommended to younger, 20 something readers, but not containing enough depth or texture for a more mature reader with some life experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking coming of age in the face of tragedy","review":"Our bookclub read this book which provided lively and passionate emotional feelings on behalf of all of our members. We were all in agreeement that this book is extremely well written; lovely use of metaphor and imagery. We were divided as to the nature of Carrie's abrupt departure. Some of us (therapists) believed that Carrie was in a state of exteme crisis and was unable to fulfill the \\"obligations\\" others of us felt were appropriate for someone in her position. Exactly what did Carrie owe Mike? This led us to explore deeply held values as to the nature of family and sense of obligation. It was one of our best discussions ever. I would highly recommend this book and will look forward to others from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dive From Clausen's Pier","review":"I eagerly bought this book thinking I'd enjoy a good read having read numerous positive reviews. About 175 pages into the book, I cared nothing for the main character, Carrie Bell. In fact, she was a bore and if nothing, undirected and pathetic. Unfortunately, the other characters failed to come to life and just sat on the page. There was so much potential! I have yet to finish the book because reading it became a chore--and that's not why I read novels. The story line is flat yet when given the description of the book I thought it would be moving and interesting. The writing lumbers along and it was easy to leave this book again and again to the point finally, I didn't want to return. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, very mediocre","review":"I had high hopes for this book, after reading initial reviews from Publishers Weekly and others. When I finally sat down to read it last weekend, I was sorely disapoointed. The book jackets claims \\"ferociously paced\\" and I found it dragging immensely.Carrie is a truly vile character. For some odd reason, however, her friends in Madison continue to cater to her when there is truly no need. Halfway through the book , the ending is blatent. Many parts of the story that were interesting were left totally unexplored and hanging.I found this trite and Carrie's entire existence in NY seemed fruitless. Although some parts were fine and it was well-written, it was a very typical Midwestern story, with no real distinction between the thousands of other coming-of-age, change-of-heart midwestern sagas out there. Not much to fuss about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately, who cares?","review":"Although this book was quick and somewhat engaging, when I completed it I was left wondering what I had just read. The character development is so anemic that you don't care about Carrie, Mike, Kilroy, Rooster, or any of the other main players. The best one in the whole thing was the mom, who at least spoke some sense once in awhile, but who rarely made an appearance and was never fleshed out. I was waiting for some major symbolic meaning to emerge in the use of the sewn garments (nightgown/robe and green velvet dress) but it never surfaced. We never find out what makes Kilroy tick, and the cliched description of New York was too much! Overall, not worth the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dive From Clausen's Pier","review":"Dive From Clausen's Pier was very good. It was an easy read and kept my attention. I think though that the characters went through so much but handled it really well. Im glad that Carrie was able to go out and find a closer look at who she really was. Yeah Mike and her have been dating for 8 years but this gave her a chance to see if her and Mike were really ment to be.This book went to a series of events. This book went on and on and kept you going and wanting to know more.I didnt really like the ending though, I thought that it could have been more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Danielle Steele romance novel with literary pretensions...","review":"...that Ms. Packer can't quite live up to. Oh, she writes well (which kept me going the first hundred pages or so), but her main character is such a passive, ambivelent person that it's very hard to care what happens to her. And Kilroy is a real pain in the butt, a completely bogus character. As a lifelong NY cynic myself, I saw nothing in the guy that was in any way authentic. He's a writer's pretentious idea of what a deep, troubled intellectual must be like. I kept waiting for Carrie to slap him and tell him to get over himself, but no such luck. Mike, for all his confinement, is the most active person in the book. Ultimately this is nothing more than a plain, old-fashioned Harlequin-type \\"women's novel,\\" tarted up as literature. I lost interest half-way through and skimmed the rest, and I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better beach reads......","review":"This is one of those books that you have to convince yourself to continue reading, and in some cases, particularly in section 2, bribe yourself to finish. The only character of any interest is Mike, and at times, Carrie's mother. Why anyone in New York was begging Carrie to return is beyond me. On a good note, I thought the author did a nice job with the ending, not everything needs to be wrapped in a bow and resolved. There are better beach books this summer, I am on to \\"The Lovely Bones\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great journey through Madison!","review":"I loved this book, especially for the great detail of my hometown of Madison, Wisconsin! Ann was true to detail in all the background ongoings while Carrie was in Madison. The story was engrossing and so human and I couldn't help but be empathetic to her situation. I envied how she just picked herself up and moved out to New York and tried to find out what she really wanted to do. I don't think I would have had her courage. I could not put this book down; I love very human and lifelike stories like these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The first half is so boring I don't know if I can go on","review":"This book is so over-filled with so many details and descriptions that are actually distracting from what could be a good story. I find the main character, Carrie, unlikable as well, so I don't really care what happens to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, original.","review":"Carrie Bell was faced with a choice - she can stay with the quadrapalegic fiancee that she had been thinking about breaking up with before his accident, or she can leave. She chooses to leave and for that she has to face the consequences of emotional guilt from her friends and from herself. I liked this book because it made me think about Carrie's situation and what I would have done. I'm a 20-something female myself, and to wonder if the situation Carrie was in is something that I could have handled well at 23, I think not. It's a very engrossing book which I ripped through in 2 days. *I obviously don't work!* I was very satisfied when it was over with and would recommend it to all my friends..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let in Life","review":"When I was 17 I had the distinct pleasure of seeing the Bad Brains at a sweaty, smokey, packed club. I remember alot about that day, but what I remember most of all is how a part of life I felt, how I was existing within a moment. I have felt that same feeling since, but never as strong until I read these great new poems from Mr. Rathbun.The words of Want drip with a life of their own, and with all lives they come in contact with.

Rathbun writes the poems that you wish you would have written.He writes the poems that you wish you would have written after walking home drunk with the certainty that this time it was for real, or the poems that you wish you would have written after she left with your Wallace Stevens, your bootleg cassette of the Clash at CBGB's, and the last third of the Maker's Mark, or, quite possibly, the poems that you wish you had written on the bus to San Francisco as you watched the sunrise burn away the last three years of your life.These poems are solid. They are real. They are right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book is absolutely perfect. I have favorite poems: Want, The Meanings in More, Need, Infidelity, I'm the Type of Guy, The Pace is Glacial... But I read the book cover to cover when it arrived in the mail (a present long awaited) and each poem feels like a person or destination, their story or map like an imprint on the page that wanders on living when the poem is through. I am in awe. I can't wait for volume II. AJ Rathbun is a talent to watch and his poems are genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the product is good ... but!","review":"After ordering the Addonics pocket CD-ROM from this electronics fender it came in reasonable time.

The only problem, my account has not yet been credited three weeks after returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling apart was never this fun","review":"This is a lovely first novel which follows a Salt Lake City family as it implodes. My favorite part of the novel is the extended section that takes place over a day, including some hilarious and harrowing forays into a diner and a nursing home. The adolescent protagionist's crack-up is as compelling as Holden Caulfield's--a claim I don't make lightly. I hope this wild and wooly novel finds the wide readership it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"never a dull moment, harsh reality with a twist","review":"This book is unlike anything I have ever read.

The story is fine its the graphical aspect of the movie. Most older movie that are converted from vhs to dvd are set to fit your lcd or plasma tv. However those dvd's aren't. Most of the time you would see 2 black thick lines between the images if it's an old movie, but this one, its 4 thick black lines, like the shape of your old TV which the ratio was 4:3.

From page one I knew I wasn't going to like the book. But I was very bored and finished it anyway in 3 hours. The writing style is so simple it seems like its for a person in grammar school. There was no real plot. No interesting characters. And an another major problem the book would talk about Detective so and so for seven pages and the next paragraph it would switch to another character's perspective. There was no transitioning between different characters stories. The ending was stupid. Surprising but stupid.

LadyHendrix says her friends say she talks about this movie too much. I agree. Insanity loves company. I have seen this movie and I have seen LadyHendrix act it out and I would say in comparing the two, LadyHendrix's version was much more entertaining. Of course the movie has more then one actress and that limits LadyHendrix' scope somewhat. But the film lacked a great deal of what I like to call \\"realism.\\" This was obviously made during the free spirited 60's and maybe those that love it remember it through a fog of LSD.

This book is soooooooooooooo boring. I'm not even sure if it would have helped to read the prequel. This book obviously has trouble standing on its own. Skip this one, but if you don't, it may or may not help to read the first one (maybe I should pick that one up b4 I continue this one).Update: I managed to read a few more pages and for me, this story makes no sense. it's very choppy and disjointed. How did we jump from opening statements to summations with the flip of a page? And the author's excessive use of \\"umm\\" is very annoying. I really dont know whether to continue reading this nonsense"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Forever\\" in love.....","review":"\\"Forever\\",a sequel to \\"Until\\" will take you on a marital journey with Betty and Drew. After a whirlwind courtship, Betty and Drew marries and then all hell breaks loose! Drew's mother becomes sick, Betty's no-good ex-boyfriend shows up, and Betty gets the case of a lifetime that requires most of her time! However, the subplot involving Jacqui and Stefan was so real! You could feel their emotions and concerns about their relationship. THE HIGHLIGHT? The highlight of the whole book was the character Blue. Blue gave some very encouraging words about self, life, and most importantly, love. I found myself underlining what he said!! It was that motivating! Mr. McCann is an extraordinary writer whose characters are both believable and loveable.I have read ALL of his books and I'm looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Literally Took Forever To End...","review":"This book has the potential to be a great read, but the character development came along so slowly, I lost interest more times than I should have while trying to get through the book. There was just too much extranneous information and unnecessary text/description in the novel that made it just drag on.The author could have shaved maybe 50-70 pages off the novel for the reader to get the messages he was trying to convey in the book. I actually didn't read the book, but listened to the audio book. Maybe it was the narrator, who was trained for stage plays, but her narration was amusing at times, as I found her to be overdramatic to the point I thought she sounded silly.Overall, the book had some very believable story lines, but to sum it up, the book was just terribly too long for what story actually was."},{"rating":"1","title":"It almost took FOREVER to read this book!","review":"I kept reading this book in the hopes that it would eventually get better, but it never did. I can't understand how these characters can be so intelligent and successful but yet trifling and stupid at the same time. What woman, no matter how busy, wouldn't be there for her husband when his mother is dying? I just didn't find the characters or the plot for that matter, to be believable. If you really must read this book, save your money and go to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever The Bomb!!!!","review":"I read this book over the weekend and it was the BOMB! I could not wait to see what happened next, that's what I love about his writing it keeps you anxious for more. It seems that Timmothy McCann's work only gets better and better.

This struggle was two-pronged i.e. independence from the British and partition of India. This movie is a very good look into the causes and effects of the struggle for Pakistan under the capable leadership of Mr.Jinnah."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cheap, it works","review":"As an earlier reviewer mentioned, keep your expectations realistic for this device with its low price point, and it will fill the bill. I'm using an old Canon Speedlite 188A flash unit with the adapter, and it works reliably under controlled conditions -- my main usage is for taking portraits. I have the adapter screwed onto a tripod (you'll need to find a wingnut or hex nut plus a washer to clamp it down tight) and I set this up off to the side anywhere from 2ft to 10ft away from the digital camera to get a range of lighting effects. Pointed at the ceiling, you can get a nice bounce flash for even lighting. I discovered that I can mount the flash either forwards or backwards on the hot shoe to give me greater flexibility in sensor placement. For just a few bucks, I've improved the lighting of my digital pictures immeasurably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works nice","review":"Using it with a 20 year old Sunpak flash 433D and a new Canon A610 digital. I set the ISO value on the camera and the flash manually to 50.I set the Flash Adapter to selection 2 and the Canon to Av (with the same F-number as the flash) and Red Eye prevention \\"on\\".Shots made with a bounce flash to a white ceiling look great, just like with shots from my old fully-manual film camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Construction","review":"The extension arm that connects the adapter to the camera seems especially weak, particularly at the point where the arm and the adapter connect (the unit is designed to allow the adapter to disassemble into two pieces). This is particularly evident if you grip just the adapter and not the camera. Although my camera is quite light, the arm flexed enough under its weight that I had serious reservations as to whether it might not snap off and send my camera crashing to the ground. I ended up strengthening the arm with a stip of metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy plastic :-(","review":"Don't get this if you plan on using it on a SLR with any real flash - I should have paid attention to the reviews - it is too light to hold up a 540EZ or any similar flash."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a joke ;(","review":"Never buy this product, it is made of f....king cheap plastic that you can break easily.The grid is useless if you try to attach a heavy camera to it.The slave sensor for the flash is also another joke, it had been NEVER worked at all.My suggestion, buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give any camera exernal flash capability","review":"This item is great - for those of you that bought a great camera in the past, but it just didn't have a hotshoe, or for some reason your hotshoe isn't working, this is just what you need.

I just followed the directions, it took one off right away, the other one took two applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is a joke!","review":"Entirely too much money for something that absolutely does not work. Save yourself the time and expense for now and have your MD apply liquid nitrogen to the wart during your next routine visit. The majority of clinics keep a supply of liquid nitrogen available for this purpose. They pour a little into a cup, soak a Q-tip, apply it to your wart and, in about a week, the dead wart/skin falls off. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for small warts","review":"Freeze Away is great for small warts.

This stuff did nothing at all. It's simple enough to use and only slightly painful, but such a huge waste of money. Plus, once you use it you can't treat with something else while you wait for the freeze to (not) work.We had one child with a hand wart and it did discolor it, but after several treatments we switched to a bottle treatment with applicator brush. That did the trick.My other son has come up with a wart on his foot recently and we tried freeze off on it. It didn't do a thing.A total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work for me","review":"I used it once. Skin became red in the area of application, then purple.

They are both still there and look just as bad as when I started my first treatment. One wart is all calloused up and the other is soft and both still look that way after 3 treatments.Someone told me that this doesn't work well on the warts that are calloused, but then why didn't it work on my other wart?

The instructions say \\"if you use a treatment wait 2 weeks before attempting another treatment\\" Well, after 2 treatments over 1 month didn't work for me I tried 3 treatment in 10 minutes, and each treatment was 10-20seconds over the recommended application time. Guess what happened? well, it is 2 weeks later, and the wart on my finger has doubled in size.i have seen positive feedback on this product and i'm curious if they bought it when it was a very very small wart or a d-bag share holder/company man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of money","review":"I spent $25 on one treatment of this stuff and it didn't work at all. It give you a nice stinging sensation while it's being freezed, but I could've done the same thing with ice. I didn't notice until you actually open the package that it says you may have to try it 3-4 times to get it to work. It didn't start to work the first time, so I'm not wasting another $25 to get the same crappy results. This should be a money back guarantee."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still running to the end where rainbows are","review":"Featuring the voice of the real Soeil Moon Frye (who had played Punky in the live action show) this series was really successful for a cartoon tie-in.She's still with Henry, Cherrie, Allen, and Margaux, but for animation sakes, Punky was given a new friend. While riding her bike, Punky discovers a gnome-gremlin creature named Glomer (Frank Welker). Glomer has accidentally left his world, Shandoon. Glomer is capable of performing all kinds of magic, which causes Punky to have all kinds of really fun adventures.If I remember correctly, Glomer was kept a secret from Henry, something which the kids shared amongst themselves instead of telling the grown ups.This is the first volume of the cartoon series when it was released on VHS format. Considering how long it ultimately ran, I think that it deserves it's own DVD treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"River Road Map","review":"Good product, Holds to gas tank well.

It comes inside another clear pouch similar to what you intend on buying. That's what the other reviewer is asking about. I don't see the purpuse either and would prefer they save the material. Back to the review...This pouch has four strong magnets that hold it well to the tank, and a zipper closure. The best thing is that you can use your smart phone through the see-through plastic. In other words, this works with capactive screens. It detects the tiny electrical signals in your finger and you can control your phone's touch screen. I actually use this pouch upside down and keep my phone, headphones, sunglasses, and garage door opener in it.It seems to be at least water resistent, if not water proof. I just rode through the rain and everything stayed dry.It's a sweet, low-profile pouch that works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"River Road Map Pouch","review":"This product worked great for my HD Softail Heritage 2009.The pouch has four magnets and sticks to the tank very well.

When we saw this stand we thought we got lucky with the price. Boy were we surprised when we received this. First it smelled as if it lived in an attic for a very long time. Second it arrived with all these small brown spots over the entire top, along with some brown smudges on the side. When I notified the company they shipped another one free of charge. I waited the week for the next one to arrive only for it to be in the same condition! The seller ended up refunding us, letting us keep these damaged ones, they said they were obviously having an issue with ther supplier, but now we have to figure out a solution to fixing them or go out and spend even more money on a hopefully better quality stand. Huge bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great buy but a good buy","review":"I was a little dissapointed with this product.First of all it has some brown spots on it I had expected it to be shiny and glossy looking, but it was dull and kind of old looking.But once you can clean it up it can be used for various occassions.It was a good buy overall but not an excellent purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid read","review":"The highlight of this book was Lady Scruples, and if the book's main plot had been about this aristocratic tabloid writer, The Art of Seduction would have been a hilarious and sexy read. Instead, it is filled with over the top characters and antics, gaping plot holes and cliched plot devices. The heroine's pain over her unrequited love for the hero would have rang true had we been shown why she felt the way she did about herself instead of being told. The hero was quite dim at times, but his redeeming quality was that he was immune to the villaness' evil doings towards the heroine. If the heroine hadn't spent so much time pouting over how unworthy and unlovely she was for the hero, TAoS would have been an entertaining read. Instead, TAoS forced you to suspend your belief, stretch your patience and have you gnashing your teeth in frustration by the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"Heroine has been in love with hero since childhood & seduced him mysteriously 1 night.

Hero has also been secretly in love with heroine for years & is now determined to win her this time. But big misunderstandings get in the way.This George historical was a sufficient read. It was a quick read. Although it wasn't emotionally gripping, it engaged my emotions enough. Sexual chemistry & love scenes were good. Big misunderstandings were typical romance-novel Big Misunderstandings & could've been easily resolved it Hero & heroine just talked it over a lot sooner.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"The title is totally misleading. The author has probably given the story this title hoping that people will buy the book in order to learn about the tricks of seduction. However it is barely possible to read even the first five pages. The book itself is neither hard porn nor soft porn,nor a top class story. I would recommend a hard porn \\"Oh Wicked Country\\"---BY Anonymous but written by Jean Paul Satre' according to common knowledge,probably leaked out by some insider. This book simply doesn't fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice computer case.","review":"I don't travel much to wear out a computer case, but I have had the Blue one for about 18 months. It has held up really well. Fabric still looks new. A 15.4\\" non-wide screen laptop fits well.

I have been taught perspective before with 1, 2, and/ or 3 vanishing points, so I thought that I knew what I was doing. But sometimes I just had to eyeball some of the perspective in my drawings, because objects would look too distorted. This book showed me what I was doing (and taught at art school) that was acceptable but not perfect. Within the first few pages, I easily learned the correct rules to doing perspective from a floor plan at any point of view that I choose.

My son can't even skid the back tire on dirt!Perhaps the rubber material is too hard to bite the rim surface? They seem to slide along too easily.The shocks are also very suspect, but a bit of silicone spray seemed to smooth the motion for now.If you need a bike for a kid to thrash on for a year or so, you can't really go wrong for $79 but you may need to upgrade the brakes for safety reasons, which will add a few bucks to your investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"when i first bought this bike the bike was on sale for 60 dollars and it looked cool but it sucks it does not shift right and i kept having problems with the shocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfict bike","review":"I received this bike 7 days ago and I liked it right away.If you want a really good mountain bike this is the one for you.It has duel shocks, extended handle bars for long rids and also its a 21 speed.

The book is not appropriate for parents who are trying to get a game plan nor for general education teachers who are looking for a book to better understand their students who display ADHD-like behaviors; it's just too much and will probably be put down and not finished by the majority of people who purchase the book.

Well, the good thing is that you won't want to miss any parts of this book and like to read every written line anyway. If you have intention to learn MTS, this book is definitely the start, and it won't let you down.There are many other MTS books out there too, but I think without this one, others are either too advanced or do not cover the foundation good enough.

With the detailed descriptions, you'll feel like you'vevisited the same locations as the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOrrible","review":"I can't believe that I spent money for this poorly written, poorly edited, self-absorbed book. Thank God I used a coupon so I didn't pay the full amount! The idea seemed really good but the book itself I couldn't wait to get rid of. I don't believe in throwing books out (although I almost broke my rule for this one) so I quickly gave it away to a book sale.

It was exactly what we wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hole is too small","review":"We got this potty seat for our 20 months old son but the hole is just nice for his size and he is just a medium size baby. It is not easy to put him on this potty seat especially with the splash guard installed. He didn't like to go on this potty seat with the splash guard on as he feels uncomfortable on this thigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son Has moved past the little potty","review":"My son is about to turn three. At first he was afraid to use the large potty but now refuses to use anything else. The handles and general structure are great. We decided to remove the splash guard. Our toilet is rather high and he found it awkward to move around. The only negative is that the item seems to slide/move when he tries to sit down. I think this is caused by the odd shape of our bowel. At a friends house the item stays in place without any trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes training quite easy...","review":"Granted my little Reagan was showing all the signs of being ready to begin Potty Training. Her mother was unsure as to how to do this, so I ordered this seat (her seat at home had no handles and Reagan seems to sway from not having handles to hold. Reagan was successful in her use of the potty seat almost immediately. The only issue that we are currently taking care of is a step stool so that Reagan can get up to the potty much more easily. This step stool will also double as a hand-washing stool.... I can barely believe that my 2 year old Grand-baby is potty trained already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight to the junk pile","review":"We got this as a second potty seat so my son would have child sized potties on both floors. Assembly is easy and the seat is very soft but the hole is significantly smaller than the other seats we have, forcing us to use the splash guard which my son doesn't like. As other reviewers have mentioned, clean up is messy, and the seat can be wiggly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty Seat","review":"Not a very good potty seat. Doesn't sit right on the toilet.

Handle and the guard is awesome but in that complicated design urine gets traped and it STINKS. for me it's not possible to clean all the parts everytime my son uses it and i try to wipe it clean with clorox wipes but still unless and until I wash it with soap water it STINKS..I won't recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend 5-10 mins after each use cleaning it and disassembling and assembling ( it's quiet easy but 10 times a day it's time consuming)seat together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not adjustable so it shifts around on the toilet","review":"It's a cute seat, but it shifts around on the toilet so when my son sat down on it it nearly dumped him in the toilet!

Second ...you have to assemble the seat: the plastic seat, the cushion, the pee guard, then the sticky tab.

Too many disconnecting parts!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - Don't buy","review":"First, I didn't like that I had to put it together. The soft ring itself is crappy. My daughter weights 25 lbs and it 'flattened' after 2 days of use (exposing the plastic underneath and making it uncomfortable for her to sit on). It is VERY poorly made and to be honest, I am surprised it's even on the market. Went to Target and bought a REAL one (which cost me $2 less than this POS) and is made a million times better (and comes complete with a potty hook for the toilet). I didn't feel like dealing with the return so I just threw it out. What a WASTE of money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only spashguard for boys that's BIG/TALL ENOUGH!","review":"Love this potty seat for my son and I searched for a looooong time to find it! Potty seats used to have this big guard for boys all the time. Now the guards are so small they are useless for a boy to sit and urinate.

The cup isn't tall enough and he peed all over the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for boys!!!","review":"We have been searching for a seat that has a \\"shield\\" that actually does what it is supposed to do...this does! Our 2 year old no longer sprays on the seat because this shield is high enough to work! The others are the same height as the seat, so do not shield. I highly recommend this for boys! The only thing that could be improved is it wobbles a bit on elongated toilet seats. Not enough to be unstable, but it could fit a bit more snug in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a stable potty seat","review":"I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat. He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months. He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard. Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor. He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor. This seat is quite tipsy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This potty seat really does start to stink after a while..","review":"I had originally written a great review for this potty seat. On first getting it, it seemed brilliant. My son loves it, but that's no surprise, it has Lightning McQueen on it..why wouldn't he love it. I loved it as it caught his pee...but here we are a few months after the initial purchase and it stinks.I clean the seat dry after every use, however the pee gets in the plastic lining of the seat and as my son has gotten heavier his weight pushes the cushioned piece down and allows some of his pee to go between the cushioned piece and the seat base. This means that you would have to take the seat apart and wash it off after every use. It's just not a practical seat.I will be looking for a better seat, as this one is unhygienic. It's unfortunate, as it seems to be the only seat that has the higher front piece suitable for little boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This is such a great product. It is so easy to use, lightweight and cleans real easily. My 16 month old son loves this seat and runs into the bathroom to put it on the toilet every time I ask him if he needs to sit on the potty. The hole in the seat is just about the right size and you can easily take of the plastic guard on the front."},{"rating":"1","title":"One weird thing","review":"So, the princess seat part isn't attached to the pink part with the handles. It's weird. It falls off when you move it at all. I ended up duct taping them together. FYI. It's still a good product, I was just really surprised that they're not attached to each other. So weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay together","review":"Seat has too much foam and top and bottom piece will not stay latched together. Would not buy this seat again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wont fit on toilet","review":"It's cute but when my baby sits on it it slides. There is extra room in the back and it doesn,t fit securly on the toilet so she has to literally follow the seat because it moves back when she sits on it. Not a good trainer seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok...","review":"i bought this potty seat for my son and the lip part to keep the pee from shooting me keeps falling off. the sticky grips dont stick to well. i would ask for my money back but it was cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seat works good for little boys - has high pee guard.","review":"Great little seat. The old seat we had would move around on the toilet but this one has a rubber grip on the bottom side with helps ensure it doesn't slide. Also, it has a high pee guard so little boys keep the pee in the toilet and not on the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly, child falls off seat, broke into 2 pieces","review":"This seat wobbles alot, but we have an enlongated, curvy toilet. Holding onto the handles does not help the child because the whole seat is wobbling. Also, it came unglued into 2 pieces. Poorly constructed. But at least it has a cushioned seat. I am throwing it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"It looks nice and fits on the toilet well, but that's about it :( I bought this trainer seat because it's one of the few with handles, but apparently I should have spent the extra $$ and looked for something else. My daughter is 2 1/2 , and she is not a big child, however, the hole is just to small.. I have to readjust her seating position if she goes for no1 or no2 so that the seat doesn't get al dirtied up :(. The other problem is the 2 part design, which lets the fluids get between the two parts. ANd no matter how well I rinsed and washed the seat every time, after only a month it was all stinky - the foam in the upper part had absobed the stuff that got on it, so.... I'm looking for a better alternative"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potty Seat","review":"I just purchased this Princess style after we bought the same brand but Winnie the Pooh style at Babies R Us. They must have been out of Princess. We originally bought the Fisher Price potty that sits on the floor and plays music when the sensor is wet, but my little princess wouldn't use it because she wanted to sit on Mommy's potty. So I looked around and decided on this brand due to the handles. She loves it, can sit by herself on it, and it doesn't slip off of the toilet when you add the self adhesive tabs on the bottom. The price is great as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, but not very functional","review":"I bought this yesterday (after the Diego seat we originally picked out was recalled and Target wouldn't let us have it).It will be going back to the store today. My son is 2.5 and not a big kid. With the pittle pee cup thing on the front (a must for boys) the opening is not big enough to keep the peeper in there and have his but be totally over the hole. It made a HUGE mess.Not to mention that he was so crammed up against the cup, he screamed that it hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small to be useful for 3.5 years old boy","review":"I was too disappointed by this small potty seat. It may be good for those smaller toddler. Definitely not suitable for a 3.5 years old boy, or any boy if you know what I mean. Your boy would make a mess with using it. I am giving it away to goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered two of these training rings - one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week. One arrived in perfect condition, the other was disappointingly split at the seams. So I returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it. I received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams. So I am returning it once again and asking for a refund, since I feel I will be better just going to the store to buy one that I can inspect before hand. To be honest, the one that arrived in tact works just fine. I guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective. Good luck if you decide to order this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted a few weeks","review":"This fit well on the toilet, and I lived the splash guard, but after only two weeks the top padding kept coming off. I kept putting it back together because I didn't want to give up and pay fir a new one but then in started to smell like Urine badly and the connecting parts made it really difficult to clean. I opted for the Arm and Hammer seat, and we love it. In fact, it's lasted a year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I guess it's hard to make one to perfectly fit every toilet seat.

It comes off easily from our seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves it's purpose!","review":"I've already purchased one of these before and needed a second one. The first one was for my daughter and it worked fine. The second was for my son and the training is different...but he sometimes makes a mess. It does leak through the front, but it depends on how he's sitting and how much he has to pee. You'll have to do some cleaning, but I think it's better than my son in a diaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love This Seat!!","review":"I bought a different seat first, and soon found out the the pee gaurd was not big enough. So my son would pee everywhere. This seat you wont have to worry about that, the pee gaurd is the perfect size for boys. And the handles are a big help in making them feel comfortable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed too...","review":"This seat is adorable and comfortable - if it only fit our toilets. It does not fit the toilet and my daughter cannot use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"This potty seat is not very sturdy. It just lays on top of the regular toilet seat. It does have rubber cushions on the bottom of the potty seat, but it doesn't do much to keep it from sliding around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as convenient as I thought","review":"My son insisted on having a \\"Cars\\" potty before he would potty train. So, seeing how this seems to be the 1 and only Cars themed potty, I bought it. I thought it would have a snapping mechanism of some kind to make it secure on the toilet, but all it has is weak foam non slip pads that go underneath. It slides around easily on the seat and is too dangerous to allow my son to climb up himself so it's useless for us. It was a waste of money. Maybe it sits snug on some other toilet seats; I thought our seat was standard but I guess I was wrong. I would advise against this seat unless your child is almost as big as an adult because it doesn't stay in place and could cause them to fall. In our case, a fall in the small bathroom could easily result in injury; not worth the risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for big kids","review":"My son is on the large size. He is 37\\" tall & 39 pounds. These seat is too small for him. The hole is too small which requires him to push forward right up against the splash guard. The guard is hard plastic & cuts into his legs leaving deep red marks. He hates it. He tried it a couple times & now refuses to use it.I switched to a combo potty seat that has a removable soft seat & a much bigger hole. This one will be placed on Freecycle. I only recommend this for those training very small children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Princesses","review":"I absolutely love this. My daughter is 33 months old and loves princesses. She was terrified t use the big potty or even sit on it until we got this seat. She loves that it fits on the \\"big\\" potty and allows her to be a big girl. The seat doesn't slide around at all on our toilet, but we don't have a padded seat or an elongated seat. The plastic is separate from the cushion but it hasn't been an issue for us. The handles are wonderful because it gives comfort to my daughter that she isn't going to fall. We use a step stool to get on and off the potty so her feet are on the step stool teh whole time. It fits well in the diaper bag as well so i can take it with us places and she can use the toilet when we are out and about as well, which for us is a lot of time not at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute and comfy, but doesn't fit our enlongated seat well","review":"I had high hopes for this training ring. It is the perfect size for my children, but it slides back and forth on our toilet seat and, especially at the beginning of potty training, its movement is causing some unsureness on the \\"big potty.\\"The handles are great.Unfortunately, I think my search for the \\"perfect\\" aid in potty training continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so comfortable","review":"This toilet seat made it very discouraging for my son to start potty training since the splash gaurd left him with a rash on his inner thighs and lower tummy. The splash guard does not have a smooth finish and when it rubs against his skin, it can be quite painful. I plan on trying the baby bjorn seat, it looks like it would be more comfortable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Product that i ever bought","review":"This is the worst product that i ever bought from amazon in my entire 10 years history.Thickness of the cushion is so low, i can see my son's thigh impression after the first use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap-o","review":"Like others mentioned, I did not receive the seat pictured (little roads with red handles) but I ordered two so I thought at least one would be the red one. No luck. The big bummer is that the seat is so cheap that it comes apart really easy. The cushion isn't well connected to the plastic ring at the bottom so I can't imagine trying to take this on the go or doing consistent cleaning. The good thing is that my son won't even think about using them so I can consign or return them. He likes the original, plain old white Mommy's Helper seat I got as a hand-me-down. Cheers to plain and simple. The Mommy's helper seat is especially nice for me since it has a handle in the back (far from dribble) and is ALL ONE UNIT...no concern that it's gonna fall apart every time I move it. Potty training is tough enough without extra crap like this. I just though he would get excited to see McQueen...but instead he thinks is a toy. Ho hum - Live and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My son went right to it and had no problems peeing.

The guard made it a little difficult for my son to get onto the seat himself, but the handles are genius! My biggest problem w/this seat, is that because the cushion fits into the seat base and the guard fits into the base & it all clicks together... unfortunately this leads to urine getting where you don't expect it to and before you know it... you're sniffing around your bathroom like a bloodhound. And we wiped this down pretty much every time it was used... but to have to unassemble it and wash each component after each use... is a bit much to have to do. It's really disgusting actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"We just bought this potty seat for our 17 month old who is starting to show interest in the \\"big potty\\". He fits on it great, and enjoys the \\"handles\\". We have found the shield on the front useful, but it does detach as well. The seat has small foam pieces on the bottom that give it a \\"non skid\\" surface against your toilet seat. It is easy to remove when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable for my son","review":"It's really cute and my son was very excited to use it. However, the splash guard in front is made of very hard plastic. It's very wide and it dug into his inner thighs every time he sat on the seat. After a day of using it he refused to go on the potty because he said \\"it hurt\\". He's just learning to go on the potty so taking the cup off didn't work well because he splashed all over. He really needs that guard. We had to put his old seat back on the toilet for him to start going again. We'll keep this seat for when he's older and doesn't need the splash guard anymore but I'm disappointed that the guard was so made of such hard plastic and is so wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great socks!","review":"I'm a bit picky about my socks ---- I want something to keep my feet warm and toasty but I don't want anything too thick and bulky. I also can't stand scratchy, itchy wool. These socks are EXACTLY what I needed. I tried them on as soon as they came and went for a romp in the 18 inches of snow outside.

I bought them to wear indoors, because I don't like to wear shoes, but my feet seem to get cold easily, especially my toes. To be honest, I cannot actually tell any difference between these socks and any other socks I have. They may be slightly thicker, but they do not keep my feet warm at all. I am wearing them right now, indoors, and my feet are cold.They are very comfortable, they just don't do the job.WIth shipping, I paid $30 for two pair, and I feel it was a total waste of money.

They're warm and cozy and these are rated for-30 degrees. The top of the socks is loose enough to not constrict and comfortable in boots. However the size covers sizes 5-9 for women and they may not fit snug enough for my size 7 foot.

The reason I gave this 2 stars is that even because the story is so well written by Alan Moore, the art drags it down to the point where its hard to read through because Mr.Liefelds shoddy grasp of anatomy and telling a story are more sophmoric than the work of an art student in his first year of art school. Its like paying to watch a movie with a good story only to have to sit through bad special effects, weak acting and piss-poor cinematography. Skip out on this one or better yet, borrow it or read it at a comic store but its not worthy of your money unless you find it for a bargain. Poor Alan Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unreadable on my iPad","review":"As others have mentioned, this is a very low resolution scan of the graphic novel.

Unfortunately, on the Fire it's almost impossible to read. The default view isn't legible and can't be zoomed. A double tap lets you view the pages as images-this enables zooming but you have to close each page to view the next. No swipes or tap to turn pages. I'm sure comic fans would have a fit, but this would work much better if Amazon broke up the panels onto individual pages.

This works with Windows 9x if you know how to tell Windows to not share IRQ's with this card. You will also need to manually change one of the driver settings from \\"Auto\\" to \\"Fully Asychronous\\" to achieve full speed.This card will not work at all with the Windows 2K/XP hardware abstraction layer (HAL) because the new HAL does not permit overriding IRQ settings. Therefore, the most you will get out of this card with IRQ sharing is about 100 bps (far from the rated 100,000,000 bps).

Then I got smart and put it in the sink in case it happened again.

I just read the other reviews and it seems as though most everyone else agrees--do not buy this for your kids. Be sure to read the other reviews, they list everything wrong with this toy. Here are just a few things...--hard to follow assembly instructions--leaks water from ice cubes--makes very little ice cream (barely 1/4 cup)--needs a lot of salt (3/4 cup everytime)--hard to crank--bores child while watching parent try to put it together--it has to be completely taken apart again to washI could go on but in short, not worth the time or money.Make homemade sundaes with your kids and they will have a lot more fun!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Assemble","review":"My 8-year-old daughter was very disappointed when her babysitter could not assemble the product.

And I didn't screw in a certain part tight enough so all the mcflurry dripped out everywhere. Plus they only give you enough for one mcflurry and the end product isn't even enough to fill the cup. the picture is very misleading. It tasted good, that's about the only thing going for it.

We looked at the confusing directions for hours (The directions said connect the \\"switch plate\\" to the McFlurry Maker \\"base\\" and didn't describe the piece, they showed a poorly drawn picture.) We spun the crank for 5 minutes and dispensed the McFlurry (the ice cream only filled up one-third of the cup) and added sprinkles & cookies.

It takes about 6 mintues for the half & half to become ice cream consistancy, but that's a lot of turning for what little bit of ice cream this ends up making--my arm was killing me. It does taste much like a McFlurry and my 4 year old was thrilled with the results, but it's just too much of a pain to make and the product is not sturdy enough for me to recommend.

Wrong! First of you have to buy cream, & add a salt & water mix to the top just to make a serving of the stuff that only fills about half of the cup. Then it's not really ice cream it's just creamy liquid that if you don't eat it quick enough turns into nasty foam. Also in order to get it even remotely thick you have to turn the crank ontop forever! If you put it together to loosely you can end up with a salty liquid mess.

We also had salt water everywhere and I had to run to the sink with it so that it didn't drip all over my kitchen floor. My son said that it did taste good, but it wasn't worth the wait.

I am returning this toy to the store and will tell everyone I know not to buy this toy. McDonalds should be ashamed for being so deceiving in the advertising of this toy. Don't believe what you read on the box - it is not simple and it's not fun. It was very disappointing for my kids. Since the adults have to do all of the work (every single use), you might as well go buy a sturdy, easy to use ice cream maker for your kitchen. It would be A LOT easier to use and fun for the kids because they would actually get what they are expecting.

Once it is put together, you then need to make sure you have half & half in the house (3/4 cup), ice and 3/4 cup (!) of salt (to pour over the ice and make it colder). Yes - the finished product is very tasty, but not very big. The kids got a kick out of it, so here I am buying refills already (it only comes with enough to make 2 servings.) So, if you don't mind doing this with your young kids (mine are 4 & 8), then go for it.

I do not agree with the other reviews about it being hard to put together. Slow is better when making the McFlurry. Turning the crank slow for 4-5 minutes results in a thicker shake. To one reviewer who said she needed a towel under the machine must not know about the on/off switch so the shake doesn't pour out until it is finished.Another reviewer mention how careful you have to be not to get salt in McFlurry, if you put the correct plastic piece on the metal cup than no salt can get in the cup.We all think the McFlurry has a very good taste.[$$$] for two mixes is a better deal than me having to drive to Mcdonalds and buy a McFlurry at almost [$$$] for one.Salt can be bought at [your local store], 4lb box for [$$$].

And I agree with the people who wrote reviews...I can not believe that McDonald's would attach its name to this so-called toy ice cream maker. My child was very very disappointed.

It took quite some time to put this toy together. I thought we had won the battle when it was assembled. However, to actually get ice cream is another battle. After cleaning up the spills and cranking for 5 minutes my sons end result was a tsp. of ice cream. I am very dissappointed with this product. What a waste of time and money. Too bad it's such a dissappointment for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISASTER!!!","review":"Like the other reviewers said, it takes a grown-up a considerable amount of time to put this contraption together and handwash all the parts. Then, when we poured in the the half-and-half and the salt-water-ice mixture, everything leaked everywhere! It brought my 6-year old daughter to tears. Even if I could get my money back, it won't change the disastrous morning we had. Don't buy this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"Don't waste your time or money.Requires adult help to put together and to use. It is not worth the hassle, very messy and hard for children to use. My grandson said it was boring and to hard for him to turn the crank!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceived","review":"This item has several flaws:It leaks constantly.The instruction manual is terrible.The crank is very difficult to turn.The item tends to throw itself apart when you are turning the crank.The refills are expensive.It must be broken down into approximately 16 parts to be cleaned. Then you are expected to reassemble it by reversing the order of the disassembly instructions.The \\"treats\\" that it makes fill the cup provided to about the 1/3 mark. The picture on the box shows a cup \\"mounded\\" with McFlurry.The box says, \\"Easy to use! Easy to clean! McKids always quality. Always fun!\\"Yeah, right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loser Product","review":"Please do not waste your money on this. The assembly of the equipment is very complex (we put together a bicycle in less than half the time). Once complete, you discover you do not use milk, but half and half, 3/4 cup, plus that much water AND salt. The crank is very difficult to turn, my eleven year old was getting frustrated. And the result did not fill up half the container they supply.The end product did not turn out as good as the original, the rainbow sprinkles were tasteless, and my son spit it out after spending close to half an hour getting everything ready. He was close to tears that it did not \\"work correctly\\" (as he expected).I had \\"thought ahead\\" and bought extra boxes of the mix, but now will use it in a real ice cream mixer where we have a little more control on the end product.You will be disappointed and your children devastated when they find their \\"McFlurry\\" tastes like runny custard. Save your money and buy an ice cream maker instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!","review":"You would be much better off going to McDonalds and buying a McFlurry for your child. After taking the time to wash each of the 15 or so parts by hand (NOT dishwasher safe), I had to run to the store and buy half and half, and salt. I then put all those pieces together, filled it up, and began the never ending turning spree. You have to crank the handle for at least 6 minutes. After six minutes, I had runny substance still. I had to add more ice, and crank for another 2 minutes. By now, my arms are completely worn out, and I still have a runny substance. My daughter drank it with the spoon, got it all over her, and I still had to wash each piece again by hand, and clean her up. I think I need a nap!! Don't waste your money or valuable time. You would have more quality time taking your child to McDonalds and eating a McFlurry there with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Thing Sucks","review":"The McFlurry maker was the worst Christmas present my kids have ever received. It will be returned quickly"},{"rating":"2","title":"End result tastes great","review":"My 8 year old son was able to put it together in a snap by following the pictures. I only helped in the measuringof Half and Half and Salt. He did the rest. He did seem to turn crank handle for a long time and got a little tired but after adding more salt to the ice, which makes ice colder, the McFlurry mix and cream started hardening.I helped push mixture out and we each had a small McFlurry from one packet. Clean up was a breeze as everything came apart easily and we could get our hands in with a sponge. We used the Sprinkles but I see us using everything in the cabinets soon. I hope the refills are available soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet water, anyone?","review":"This is the grossest blob of sugary water ever to touch my lips! How could you make ice cream taste so rotten? Bat barf I say!! Even if it was good, it is much too great of a hassle! It took my Dad over 2 hours to put together, and what did we get?! A tablespoon of milky water with sprinkles on top! I got this hunk of junk 2 years ago, Christmas. It has gathered dust on my shelf ever since!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS FUN OR EASY IT LOOKS!!!","review":"My daughter wanted this flurry maker sooo bad, so we finally gave in & got it for her for Christmas last year. What a mistake that was!! She was thrilled & is thrilled everytime we make flurries (which isn't very often). It's a pain to put together & take apart, she can't turn it by herself, which at 4 she wants to do, & it doesn't tast anything like the flurry you get at McDonalds. I would recommend going to McDonalds & buying a flurry rather than wasting money on this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on something else....","review":"Worst toy ever!!! We bought this for my son for Christmas. It was difficult to put together at first. The written directions are worthless but, the picture helped. My son had a hard time putting it together with out our help. The mix was messy & hard for him to crank. Plus the re-fills are expensive. Cleaning all the little parts each time was a pain for me. This was definatly a big dissapointment on Christmas morning for him. The money we spent on this product would have been better spent on anything else. We already threw it away. Save your money- use your blender to make milkshakes, and let your kids put on thier own sprinkles- it's easier to clean, and the kids actually get instant gratification that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"messy","review":"this toy is messy.it is so thick that it stays in the contanar so it wont come out the instructions say to wait and so it sticks too the container it wont clean so you have to toss it out but then i got antor one thiking maby i did somthing wrong that one broke right out of the box that was a rip off"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"my 5 year old son put it together in under 5 mins.by himself!!! very good toy i recomend to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"baddest decision ever made","review":"my friend bought me one{im ten}for my birthday. the instructions were hard to follow even with an adults help. they told you the name of the pieces and expected you to figure out the rest. they give you a picture but that doesn't really help because they all look the same. i gave up and through the thing away after spending hours trying to get this thing to work. i think this is the worst item to by on this website for its lack of fun and easy directions. i warned you. dont buy this piece of junk that will end up in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not happy","review":"All my 4 yr old wanted was a McFlurry Maker for Christmas. Of course I gave in and got it for him. He was thilled with the whole thing, but for the amount the expensive refills make it was not worth the money at all. At least he was happy"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"My 7 year old got this from Santa and we went to work on it today. Wish I had read the reviews before I had his aunt purchase this for him. He was totally disappointed. It took forever to put together, and like other reviewers said, the cream followed by salty water, just poured out from the bottom, even though we had made quite sure everything was locked as per the directions! There was no cream left to stir. Which didn't matter anyway, because you couldn't crank the darn thing not even once around. What a joke. I was ready to give it another shot (thinking I clearly must have done something wrong), but after reading the other reviews, i will box it up, print the reviews out and return the McStupid Maker with the reviews to Toys R Us!!! Do not buy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It's the day after Christmas and we still can't put this thing together correctly. The directions leave out a piece so we have to guess where it goes. I thought I had it in the right place but the cream leaks out the bottom of the canister. Very dissappointed 5 yo on my hands. I'm returning it tomorrow....Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Money","review":"I'm about to throw this McFlurry Maker out. Too hard to put together, and takes forever to make. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to McD's for McFlurry","review":"Expensive, messy, frustrating. Produces decent 'McFlurry' but in much smaller quantity than pictured on box. Best part was getting all pieces back into box and placing box on high shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mc Weird","review":"There is no way the McFlurry Maker makes McFlurries. I have a college degree and the instructions make no sense. The sludge that comes out of that machine does not remotely resemble a true McFlurry. My kids cried their eyes out when the &quot;product&quot; came out. If you want a McFlurry, go to McDonalds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time on this McFlurry Machine","review":"This is my first review that I have written and I'm only writing because I don't want anyone to waste their money on this machine. It does not work well. It produces liquid instead of a thick shake. It is a hastle and not worth owning. Read the other reviews and see what the majority says. This thing should be taken off all shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge McDisappointment","review":"This toy was a huge disappointment. The machine was difficult to put together and leaked half and half everywhere. The instructions warned to make sure that the stopper was locked but it did no good. I finally had to put my finger underneath the unit to plug the leak while the kids cranked. My nine year old did enjoy the cranking but my eight year old almost cried when after all that work we only got about 1/3 of a cup of McFlurry. The only thing my six year old liked of the whole experience was setting the kitchen timer so we would know how long we had cranked. Anybody need any half and half?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good digest of many theories","review":"I should perhaps start by confessing that I am skeptical of pole shift claims. That being said, I found this book far more interesting than I expected. The author has done substantial research, including digging up biographical information on some pretty obscure people. If you want to get a good idea of the scope of pole shift theories, from those with strong scientific aspirations to pure apocalyptic visions, this is much quicker than reading a stack of sometimes hard-to-find books. White does a good job of pointing out strong and weak points of each theorist, though sometimes I wonder why he even included someone he obviously considered \\"out there.\\" It drags somewhat in the later chapters, hence the subtraction of a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about","review":"like one of the reviewers said-first two chapters ok then starts going downhill. All it is a summary of what other people wrote about the pole shift. I was already familiar with Velikovsky's and Hapgood'd theories but the rest is downright ridiculous. i could care less about various crackpots and clarivoants that he quotes. What I was expecting was some scientific theories and I certainly didn't get much in that department. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best water gun a boy could have","review":"This is probably the best water gun anybody could have. It has four nozzles to choose from. There is a big one, a medium one, a small one, and one with three little jets. It has a flip-out shield, which will protect you from all kinds of things; water, shaving cream, mud, you name it! The tank is huge, but the tank tends to run out fast, because when you squirt the water, it uses a lot of it. However, if you run out, you have your trusty shield to protect you until you get to a place where you can reload.Their is a handle at the side that allows you to keep the water going. Their is also a strap that keeps your arm secure.Overall, I think that this Super Soaker is one of the best money can by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love all the songs!They are great when I was listening to it!I anted to listen to it again over and over again"},{"rating":"1","title":"send me the wrong product","review":"Well I bought 2 of these kick stand as one of my many orders from amazon and the company send me a kick stand that doesn't work properly the bolt that you sent with the kick stand package is too small to screw into the tread pattern that's in the lick stand. I can't even believe your company is to stupid to look at the product to see if it works before you ship it out now i'm out 16 dollars plus shipping cost. Well i'm gonna think twice before i order from here again"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little frustrating","review":"The tent looks great and fits on a twin bed with a bit of tugging and mattress wrestling, but the construction is a bit lacking. The tent poles must be secured into \`pockets' at the base of the four corners. I use the term pocket loosely, however, as these more closely resemble flaps. As such, they do not secure the poles in place at all well. It's possible to fiddle and cajole the poles into the proper position, but in the end they always pop out."},{"rating":"1","title":"bed tent","review":"I Received the tent and sent it as a gift.

He likes the tent, but the corners that are suppose to hold the poles in are not very adequate. The poles seem to keep popping out from the corners. I will have to rig something up to keep them from doing this. I reread the directions to make sure I had the tent put together right. It was right. Just a poor design!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arabic Groove","review":"Cafe Najjar is punchy Middle Eastern coffee.

I own a set of Grapevine dishes made in USA and I purchased a set of Winterberry dishes for my mother made in USA prior to 2005 (when they sold the company). Last year I purchased a set of Winterberry for myself but returned them because the glaze was uneven, the colors were not the same and they could not compare to my Mom's set.

This little pamphlet is worth every penny of 99 cents! I still can't believe I spent the money I did for a superficial, spiral bound pamphlet that's geared to a reader with the intellect of a turnip (I can't even call it a book!). There is no useful content of any substance in this pamphlet. This might be a good resource for someone who is completely in the dark regarding anything internet or business-related, who is looking for a very high-level overview with a lot of bulleted lists. Maybe a Dilbert-type manager who wants a few buzz words to throw around at meetings, hoping to impress someone, would find it useful.

The description and other reviews made it seem that I would have a greater understanding of how to set up an e-commerce site after reading this book. This is not the case.

This book seldom got beyond high level concepts.Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally false advertisement...","review":"Looking at it you would think that you were getting all 4 what they don't tell you is that you only get 1.

The picture quality is very good, especially compared to projecting on my wall as I was doing before -- no obvious imperfections and noticeably brighter. Certainly does the job for my home theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"An elementary survey of machining","review":"This is a basic introductory textbook of machining. It explains what most machine tools are and how they work in simple language and padded with copious, though often uninformative pictures (e.g. the cover page for the chapter on CNC machining shows a picture of an old manual Bridgeport). It also includes some elementary instructions on common machining operations like using a center finder, cutting threads on a lathe, etc. However, it is much too brief to be considered an actual manual of machine shop practice.It is in textbook format and has simple questions at the end of each chapter. It seems like it would be a suitable overview text for a high school machine shop class. I think the title, \\"...from basic to advanced techniques\\" is misleading. There are no advanced techniques here, unless you consider the several paragraph descriptions of things like EDM and explosive forming to be advanced techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"No shame!","review":"ZERO STARS for this musical pothole of a collection!K-TEL duds it again, with their disco set, GOOD GROOVIN'.

When they arrived, they were not the same stairs shown in the picture, even though they arrived with a label that showed the same picture as the one listed on Amazon, with one continuous strip of carpeting. Our dog will not use them, as the carpeting is only on the base of the step. I called Solvit Products and they blamed Amazon for having an outdated photo, while stating that even though they haven't made the stairs in YEARS, they have not updated the photo on their own labels either.

Almost unbelievably, the mock-serious philosophical pamphlet included with Sade's Philosophy in the Bedroom- easily the most interesting part of the work, is missing- because \\"Meredith X\\" (the translator) has decided that it disrupts the 'continuity and flow' of the text. In the body of the translation itself there are in fact words and phrases absent from the French.(ie 'Crimson! F...ing Goat of Satan! etc) And at the end of the book there is a section transplanted from the 120 Days of Sodom- more or less a catalogue of tortures and degradations.
