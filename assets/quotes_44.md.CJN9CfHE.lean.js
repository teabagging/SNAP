Salvatore explore his own world, unfettered by character timelines. An interesting new fantasy world, and this book only explores a small portion of this new land. I look forward to sequels!However, not his best writing in any sense and a lot of it is unoriginal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salvatore at his best!","review":"This book was incredible. The main character is amazing. From begining to end there is never a dull moment. Salvatore shows that battle scenes aren't the only good part. Some of the greatest character developement I have seen since Dark elf trilogy. I could not but this book down. I was reading it while eating dinner. This book shows a whole new view on Corona. It explains what the abellican church used to be like, and it shows an old religion not discussed in the other Corona novels. This book is stand alone so you can read this and enjoy it without reading the other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you've come to expect from RA Salvatore","review":"RA Salvatore delivers an exciting, fast-paced tale based in the world he created. The book is what readers should expect from a fantasy adventure book; great story, great characters and a great read.The reader does not need to have read (although it's highly recommended) the Demon Wars novels Salvatore has written to follow The Highwayman. If you are looknig for action-adventure, look no further!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can it get any better?","review":"It never ceases to amaze me on how well Salvatore can develop his characters. My first impression of this \\"Highwayman\\" was an aloof cheesy expectation........I was dead wrong. To my chagrin, Bob has yet to disapoint, granted it is a very quick read, but non the less a very good book.***SideNote***If you are interested in obtaining a signed copy of any of Salvatores books, check out his website: www.rasalvatore.com. There is listed his book signings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun and adventure!","review":"Let me start by saying that I am not a complete Salvatore-o-phile. As much as I enjoyed his orginal Drizzt stories, the later ones have been done to death. There is nothing left to write that hasn't been written about the dark elf and I would recommend that Salvatore move on. Having said this, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the Highwayman. There is nothing new in this story, there are no deep revelations or Universe expanding messages. This book is just good, clean, swashbuckling fun. It follows the life of Bransen (the Highwayman) and his parents as they struggle with racial bigotry, bigotry towards the handicapped, and religious xenophobia. You will find no surprises in this novel, but you will cheer for a small handicapped boy as he learns to release the hero within, and see himself the way God sees him.I had a great time and can't wait until Salvatore dishes up another helping of the Highwayman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh....","review":"Some spoilers(ish).This was an average book, but terrible in comparison to Salvatore's others. The book is split up into three different time periods ten years apart from each other. I felt as if I was reading three short stories, not of which were gripping/entertaining. The title character isn't even involved until the second \\"story\\".While Salvatore does kill off characters along the way, the main character showed an aura of invincibility and seemed as if he could fight any amount of opponents of any skill and I knew he would win without much struggle.I am a huge fan of Salvatore's other books (namely those involving Drizzt and Cadderly) and found myself finishing the book just for Salvatore's sake. I doubt I will continue the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"silver arch disapointment","review":"i would love to leave a review of the book(purshased at silver arch bookstore) but i never received it.yes it was inexpensive and not alot of money but i never got it.all i have received is a computer generated email stating i would getcontacted by customer service within 48 hours...

Im still shocked when I read stories about apartheid, and realize that it wasnt too long ago when it ended.

Most young people were craving for a better life but didn't have the resources to make it happen due to systematic government oppression. A good, insightful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"There is nothing particularly Jungian about this Tarot deck.In order to utilize this deck of cards as reflective of Jungian thought,you must have the Wang workbook, which is sold separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wanted this deck for ages because I love Carl Jung and felt the symbolism of this deck would be amazing. Alas, I was really, really disappointed. If you are looking to expand on the traditional Rider-Waite deck (which I was), this will probably disappoint you as well. There are no numeric values depicted and the imagery is boring and barren. Each suit of the minor arcana has the same background images for each, is lacking in symbolism and the only difference between them is another sword, cup, etc added to the picture. I was really hoping that this deck would be rich in symbolism and depict the meanings behind the cards through that imagery. I have a hard time finding the meaning just staring at six swords with clouds in the background. So, if you are anything like me and look for a story within the imagery, this deck is not for you. I would not have purchased it if I had known this and will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor - returning this deck","review":"This is a Majors only deck - the minor arcana are pips only. not work the money. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy images","review":"I am a long time student of Tarot, and use Wang's excellent text, \\"The Qabalistic Tarot\\" as a primary source. Since I find his insights into the connection between Qabala and Tarot invaluable, I thought I would order the deck he created. I found the images creepy, and the human forms all white, pasty and weak looking. Wow. For someone who makes the case that the knowledge at the basis of the Tarot came from Egypt, in Africa, the Eurocentric look was appalling. I despised this deck, and wanted it out of my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the point","review":"This book the Author and the cards are entirely missing the point.I wasted my money.Three words boring,static,uninspired.The cards are rediculous. The picture of the child in the Major-Arcana \\"Sun\\" card looks like the Author----Very disturbing and neurotic.The analysis is nothing that has not been said before but more arrogant and unpersonal. Exactly what Tarot is not...Why is this guy famous? Not for me to answer i guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent qabalistic deck with an eastern twist!","review":"I really enjoy the symbolism of this deck. Robert Wang provides a unique interpretation of the entire deck. Each Major Arcana has a unique chakra incorporated in it. Chakras are visual tools for meditation, most popular in Eastern philosophy, that were used by Jung. The cards are simple compared to the symbolism of other decks (ex- Thoth). I have to disagree with Deb28 when she says the Minor Arcana are \\"so unimaginatively rendered.\\" There are very simple, uniform symbols for each suit but there is also a sphere on each card representing the sepirah in the corresponding color scale that the card represents. The colors and symbolism is subtle, but with a good knowledge of qabalah and/or tarot, this deck can be very powerful. It works well for readings, study, or meditation. This is a great deck but I wouldn't recommend it for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a readable deck","review":"I collect tarot decks and have long been interested in Jung, so I thought this would be perfect for me. Unfortunately, I find it very hard to read with these cards. The reason--ironically for a Jungian deck--is that the people in the images have such specific features that it is very hard to see them as generic archetypes. It's a bit like seeing your neighbor on a tarot card--I find myself wondering who the models were and what their lives were like. This might not bother other people, but it drives me nuts when I'm trying to focus on a reading. The cards aren't particularly aesthetically pleasing, either, so they're not the sort one would buy to keep on the shelf and cherish. Intellectually, they're interesting but would be more so with at least a small booklet explaining the artist's thinking--it's a little annoying to have to buy a separate book in order to have any explanation whatsoever. In short, an interesting deck but no use to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A practical approach to pharmaceutical analysis","review":"Being worked with the author myself I am maybe a bit too partial to write this review. However, since the book has had no review so far, I felt compelled to write something. This book is full of good practical examples of instrumental methods applied to pharmaceutical analysis, writen by someone who had taken the time to actually DO most of the experiments from which the book is based. Not deep into theory, but very good for those seeking practical and sound advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to Predictable!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Sparks other works - The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. I was however disappointed with a Walk to Remember as I found it lacked depth and was extremely predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"I really expected more from this author as so many movies have been based on his works. I never quite got reeled in and it seemed more like a novel for teenagers, not adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real tear-jerker!","review":"This is the first book I read by Nicholas Sparks. I was immediately drawn in by Landon's folksy, slightly humorous narrative, and although the ending was fairly predictable from the start, the simply eloquence of Landon's slow evolution throughout the story kept me reading every word. I finished the book in one sitting, grateful I had tissue on hand at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"One of the best books I've ever read! I cried and I laughed. No book has ever intrigued me as much as this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"This is one of those rare cases where the movie is better than the book. I don't think Sparks did a good job of writing this one. The main character doesn't sound authentic. He sounds like an old guy trying to talk young. I don't think Sparks remembers his high school days very well. I like the story concept, but Sparks did not execute well. I recommend the movie, but not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sweetest Movie?","review":"A Walk to Remember is one of the best movies i ever saw?I was once at a friends house and we were watching the movie and it was about 3:00 thta morning and there was ten people watching it when then end came one of my friends starts to cry and laugh at that same time it was so fuuny and so sad at that same moment? And at the end was the sadest end to it?And that could be a lesson in life take chance and become something you now you can become? take chances? Become something?And it was all because of her?kayla,13"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nicholas Sparks's best work","review":"This book didn't resonate with me the way Sparks's other books did. Although it was sad, the characters didn't touch me enough to make me cry. After reading Message in a Bottle I was really eager to watch the movie when it came out. I have absolutely no interest in seeing A Walk to Remember - The Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Predictable","review":"I LOVED Message in a Bottle and The Notebook, so I was bitterly disappointed when I read A Walk to Remember. The plot was too predictable (from who Landon was going to take to the prom to what he was going to do to make Jamie's dream come true).It reads like a book that was written in one weekend because Nicholas Sparks' book Editor was pushing him to put out another book on the heels of his first two books' success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring to bother with.","review":"Fortunately, compared to others who rated this book likewise, I didn't spend a cent for my copy, and I'm glad I didn't waste my money. It came free with a book club offer. The plot is simplistic and predictable, the characters, even for the fifties (my generation), are unbelievable and the writing style is that of an eighth grader. Although a Christian and one who appreciates a well written work of wholesome literature, I did not shed a tear as a result of reading this title. I sincerely doubt Mr. Sparks would get a passing grade in a college level composition course if he turned in this kind of work. As far as I'm concerned, this book is a real \\"sleeper.\\" I am astounded at the number of people who give it a five-star rating. For my money, I'll stick to Jane Austen, the Brontes, Charles Dickens and others of the classics genre -- authors who've stood the test of time and have given their readers something to sink their literary teeth into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best Work","review":"A little too syrupy for me. Keeps reusing \\"if you know what I mean\\" - probably as a device. It doesn't work - if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk To Remember","review":"It is so nice to know that there are still areas in the heart not so jaded that they cannot be reached by innocent joy and sorrow. There are still stories that find those areas in the heart. There are still some writers who know how to reach into the depths of the reader and find the soul. Nicholas Sparks is one of those writers. A Walk to Remember is one of those stories. What a perfect gift for Christmas! Thank you Mr. Sparks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read in a long time","review":"This is a powerful little book. It touches all the emotions. I am going to buy it, read it again and pass on to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparks' newest novel warmed my heart.","review":"Sparks' characterizations are excellent. You feel as if you know each person. The story doesn't really get moving until the middle of the book, but it will keep you turning the pages. What really got me was the ending--HOW exactly DID it end? Did she die? When he said that \\"he hadn't told us the whole story and that miracles still happen\\", I got the impression that she lived. Can anyone share with me what they think? It is sort of a cliffhanger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -","review":"I read Mr. Sparks first two books and thought they were beautiful. I especially cried at the end of \\"The Notebook\\". I cried so hard, I couldn't see the words on the pages. \\"A Walk to Remember\\" was a real disappointment. Sounded so much like \\"Love Story.\\" If this had been his first book, I don't think it would have been published. A few passages were good, but not many. Because of his other books, I knew how it would end. Hope his next is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears of Sadness and Joy","review":"It took me less than a weekend to read this book...and it was a very busy weekend. Somehow, I couldn't put it down. The story of Jamie Sullivan, the awkward daughter of a widowed Baptist minister in the 1950s, and Landon Carter, the popular son of a US Congressman, is absolutely incredible.They begin as absolute opposites...she's the shy, sweet girl who everyone makes fun of in school. He's the guy everyone wants to be friends with. They end up having the leading parts in the Christmas play, and their friendship begins to evolve. It turns into love, but then a heartbreaking discovery may split them forever.This is a walk everyone should take, but be prepared with plenty of tissues.Nicholas Sparks did an excellent job describing the settings and happenings of the book. I'd never read a book by him before, but now I'm contemplating checking out some of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk to remember","review":"I chose this book because I love the movie. They always say the book is better than the movie. It is just as good if not better, so just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!!!","review":"This book truly warmed my heart. It's filled with joy, sadness and love. I'm not sure how anyone could read this book and not absolutely love it!! I appreciated how the author incorporated biblical references.

Well done!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me cry 3 times :)","review":"Love it!! I could read this over and over. Such a romantic book. The movie was good but I would prefer to read the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I saw the movie first","review":"This book ... but thank God I saw the movie first. The book was only good for one thing . It helped to clarify the title of the movie and book. In the book Landon is not that bad boy that lured girls in the movie. He is as cookie cutter as they come. Jamie is absolutely perfect though. Nothing about her changed. Save all your money to buy the movie and skip this stupid book. you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"I read a walk to remember in two days. The book is one of the best I have ever read. When the movie came out I wanted to see it but first I wanted to read the book. The way Landon falls in love with Jamie is so touching. The book gets very sad at the end but when they get married that is the happiest part in it. I think if anyone wants to read a great book, to read this one, it's sad and will make you cry but it's also a glance at true love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic at Heart","review":"A Walk to Remember is a delightful book about a teenage boy who unexpectedly finds the love of his life. This is a romantic story of a boy named Landon who grew up in Beaufort, North Carolina with the reverend Sullivan's daughter, Jamie. The two grew up together; however, did not become friends until they had to do a school play together. While rehearsing together, Landon discovers that there is more to Jamie than just being the reverends daughter. With an unexpected ending, this book will leave the tender hearted with a tear in their eye a smile on their face. I would recommend this book to anyone, but particularly teenage girls looking for a little bit of romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book's FAR greater than the movie","review":"I've been hooked to any books by Nicholas Sparks after reading this book. It's simply fabulous! All my friends who borrowed this book from me got their eyes swollen. \\"A Walk to Remember\\" is really touching but at times can be humorous. Best of all, it doesn't include any sex scenes so this is a very clean read. The movie, on the other hand, is quite disappointing because the way the story is told is very different. But you'll only feel that way if you read the book first. Like me. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic, old-fashioned romance","review":"I read this book in one night! It's pretty short (200+ pages, but they're small and the print is big). After seeing the movie, which was disapointing, I wanted to read the book. The book is way better, especially since it takes place in 1957. The movie's main problem was in trying to set a 50's book in a 90's setting without updating critical aspects. The book is sweet, but not overly so. I think it helps that it's told from Landon's point-of-view. Also, Jamie and Landon spend so much time together before there relationship finally changes. It creates great tension. There's also so much detail in the relationships in Landon's friends and family that's missing in the movie. It makes the book much richer. Overall, it has several important messages and tells a touching and real story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quick Read","review":"I read this book in one night. It was so great I could not put it down. I had to get up in the middle of the night to go into another room to finish the book because I was crying and did not want to wake up my husband. This was a true romance book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story that truly makes you smile and cry","review":"A Walk to Remember, was the first book I've ever read by Nicholas Sparks and he has immediately become my favourite author. The plot of his book was simple and predictable, yet it was the way he wrote it that truly captivated me, full of feeling and passion. It made me smile when Landon and Jamie's love blossomed and cry when I found out how their love was doomed and how they were never going to be with each other. And the ending of the book was just so powerful that i couldn't stop talking about the book for months and even now i remember it, for A Walk to remember is truly a memorable book that is absolutely worth reading and crying over."},{"rating":"2","title":"a muz-read for every one!","review":"This is the book for you all!

So go and find out for yourselves about this sweet, touching, lovely expressed and pure love story now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk To Remember","review":"Nicholas Sparks really shows his sensitive side in his books and A Walk To Remember deserves five stars. The story line progresses along nicely and keeps your attention from the first page to the last; a glass of wine and Kleenex are optional. This story shows how two teenagers find love, find moral values in life and face death in a short period of time. I can't wait for Mr. Sparks' most recent book coming in October."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable","review":"I only read this book because I received it as a gift and I love to read.

Sorry Mr. Sparks, you've found no fan here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpectedly disappointed....","review":"Having read The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, I was expecting Sparks to deliver another novel that would be equally captivating in storyline. A Walk to Remember was a big disappoint for me, in the sense that it ended so abruptly.

I loved all of his books but I think A Walk to Remember may be his best (or it could just be that it's the freshest in my mind). In any event, it is another moving story that will keep you from beginning to end. I think the reason all his stories are so well written is that he bases them on true stories of those closest to him. Along with Fried Calamari and Tara Road, this is one of the best books I've read this year. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable! ... real drudgery...","review":"After reading 'Message in a Bottle', I was prepared to read yet another wonderful love story.

Instead, the entire book was predictable and artificial, perhaps written in a rush, and a disappointing Sunday read.

I now find myself saying silently to myself, \\"it is the Lord's plan,\\" whenever something negative happens, which is so soothing! It's renewed my faith in God. I don't want to write much more, because I will give away the plot.I urge you, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"The Notebook\\"!","review":"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books, and I have to say that this one is the best one of them all. Yes, it is even better than \\"The Notebook\\". Although the begnning was somewhat slow, the story picked up, and before I knew it, I was totaly engrossed in the love story of Landon and Jamie. And being the sentimental person that I am, the end of the book left me in tears. Sparks has improved so much as both a writer and a story teller. I am looking forward to his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will make you cry","review":"I could not put this book down. I read it in one day becasue it is so good. I enjoy reading this authors books and this could be the best one. If you saw the movie Message in a Bottle and enjoyed it then go to the library or buy this book. It's that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nick, where has your charm gone???","review":"I am a sucker for good romantic stories - however, A Walk to Remember is a disappointing third book by Sparks. The characters are shallow and the story is so predictable (if you have read the first two Sparks' novels). The lines are repeated time and time again to bring out the readers' emotions and none of the sentiments touched me deeply ... I'm sorry to say that the book was written to popularize tissue papers. Sparks tried to please the readers too much that he lost the charm that he had so deeply in \\"The Notebook\\". Please Nicholas, bring back your charm from \\"The Notebook\\" and stop trying to please the readers ... The Notebook is the best of his novels so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure drivel","review":"I had read message in a bottle, and while it wasn't the BEST book I ever read, it was still enjoyable, with a little twist at the end. But this was absolutely midless drivel. It was lazy use of the English language; it was so un-thought-provoking!And the story was so predictable, that it is inexcusable that Sparks would not even devote an iota of effort to making the launguage interesting! I felt I had wasted a few hours of my life that I will never get back.Read this if you are hard up for entertainment, and just want to kill a few hours. But do not look to this book for stimulation, or even for a good story! It was just mindless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable --- same old story","review":"USA Today tells us that Nicholas Sparks \\"has taken as his subject romantic love\\" -- I beg to differ. I believe he is obsessed with death! People who believe that this is the best author they have ever read have obviously not read very much or of any variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to either of his previous books","review":"To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I was eagarly awaiting the arrival of A Walk to Remember, having devoured Mr. Spark's previous two works. I did read this all in one sitting, thinking that this had to get better. Unfortunately, it didn't. The story seemed to sappy and sugary sweet, and did not ring true. The plot was entirely too predictable, especially if I can figure it out. The characters were stereotypical and shallow. It just seemed like Mr. Sparks was trying too hard this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"made me ashamed that I had actually read it","review":"I read this book. When I first picked it up, I honestly thought that I had mistakenly purchased a copy for those readers who are visually impaired! The type was so large and the margins on the page were huge! As I contined to read, I realized why: Nicholas Sparks has nothing to say. He is riding the wave of the Bridges of Madison County, \\"romance lite\\" books -- those kind of small, shallow books that is taking advantage of American readership these days. He knows our attention spans aren't what they used to be, that we're not really that bright and certainly don't like to be challenged intellectually, so he is laughing at us all the way to his bank while publishing this fiction that passes off for books. This was the most revolting, insulting book I have ever read, and actually made me ashamed that I invested the time and money to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent","review":"I almost put this book down after the Prologue. It was poorly written, overwrought at times, and it failed to evoke the emotions Spark was trying to evoke.When I got to the meat of the story, I was wondering who had written the Prologue. Spark has a warm, conversational tone in the book that draws the reader in. The story and the characters are interesting, and you grow to care about what happens.When he's not trying to evoke an emotion, Sparks is much more effective. When he's attempting to manipulate the readers' emotions, he fails. The ideas and images are trite and hackneyed. Sparks should let the emotion speak for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This will be the last Nicholas Sparks I read.

I have not read much of this author's work but I did really enjoy this. It's easy to know where the story is headed, which in this case made me want to keep reading because of the sweetness of the writing. There are lessons to be learned from this, such as that things are not always what they seem, imagine yourself in the other person's shoes, don't jump to judge people. The book was well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book of all time","review":"An amazing book. I'd had several people tell me to read it and now i understand why. Definitely not your ordinary corny live story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is better than the movie.","review":"This was my very first Nicholas Sparks book. I got it in my Christmas Stocking one year, but I didn't immeadeatly start reading it. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Then the movie came out. The movie is still a good movie, but, the book is much much better. The book is set back in earlier times, where as the movie is present day. Still a good movie, but the book is 10000 times Better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WALK TO REMEMBER==Not worth the Read","review":"A Walk to Remember is a poorly written, incredibly predictable novel. I was honestly surprised by the number of positive reviews that it received here. I have read Nicholas Sparks's other two novels and don't recall being so disappointed. Had I not known the author, I really would have supposed this to be the work of a high school student.I am a romantic too, but there is so much more out there better to read-more heart-warming, more touching, more satisfying. I would not recommend reading this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"This is such a horrible book from Nicholas Sparks. I very much enjoyed The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. However, this book is EXTREMELY predictable and you almost hate the main character. It is almost as if Nicholas Sparks ripped off a sad yet very predictable Leave it to Beaver Christmas Special. A Walk to Remember is very forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please, What Foolish Pablum","review":"I didn't laugh, I didn't cry - I found it totally predictable. This is probably a great book for teenagers or young adults. Those who haven't read much or are just starting to forge adult relationships might find meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it zero stars, if this site would let me..","review":"Nicholas Sparks is one of the worst writers I have ever seen.

He is very detailed and has perfect description. I love the way all the books connect in some way and I hope he continues writing. I will always be open to reading his work, he has become my favorite author. Im not fond of reading but his books grab you that you have to see what happens.

Mandy Moore, the beloved pop singer will play the part of Jamie in the major motion picture release of A WALK TO REMEMBER, due out in January. This movie will be a tear jerker!!! I read the book in one day. It was very easy to read and very touching, However, u can almost feel what is about to happen next, which is not really good, I want surprises. You will fall in love with Jamie, and Landon. You will be able to relate and learn from both characters. I dont want to spoil anyone's fun but I will say the ending was cute but a little too fake, \\"unreal\\". Read the book, its a treat. Then, when the movie comes out, go watch it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"ANSWER THIS QUESTIONdo you enjoyA. reading booksB. watching movies better?THOSE WHO ANSWERED A. read the book first, it was a GREAT book (though i watched the movie first so i didnt think it was the BEST)THOSE WHO ANSWERED B. watch the movie first (as i did...not even knowing there was a book)the movie was my favorite movie in the world. However, when i read the book, i was slightly dissapointed (so different)its ur choice which you should watch/read first. I persononly LOVED the movie, i would suggest watching the movie first, becasue i know most people need a great love story that is different than the tyical predictable love story. if you enjoy the movie/book i would highly suggest reading SARAH DESSEN'S books. THE MOVIE AND BOOK WERE BOTH GREAT, GET THE BOTH, BUT BE SURE IN WHICH ONE YOU WANT TO LIKE MORE WHEN YOU CHOOSE WHICH TO WATCH/READ FIRST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for students","review":"Normally I do not like love stories, but this novel is not like others love stories. There is some suspense and humour in it, which makes it interesting. The end is quite sad, but this shows quite well that even when you finally reached happiness you cannot be sure that you stay happy. So the book makes you think about life in general and your life in specific. The long descriptions of some people, houses or so are quite boring I think. Nevertheless, it is a very good book for young people, the best book I ever read in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"This book is my favorite book of all time. It's heartwarming, sweet, and of course, very emotional. Most people who see the trailer for the movie will be like, ewww, it Mandy Moore or that looks really good! Well either way read this book! It will make you smile and cry and make you want to change your life. If your totally into love stories, don't pass this by! And, if your not into love stories, still read it! I am going to see the movie the day it comes out. The only thing I wish now is that I was more like Jamie and that somebody will love me as much as Landon did for Jamie. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've, Should've...","review":"been good. Instead it was a big disappointment. I cried til my eyes swelled after reading Notebook and Message...not a single tear was shed for this one. It's a sad story but it just didn't do it for me. I agree with the readers who said it's good for a teenager, not for a mature reader. Everything was so one-dimensional, there was nothing there. Maybe if Jamie and Landon's relationship developed faster we would've been more drawn in but in the end it was sad but I didn't really care."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"This is one of the absolute best books I have ever read!

I never have been more into a book in my entire life. Only one word to describe it...amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming","review":"I loved this book. It made me smile and cry. But I also think it was completely wonderful. I was sorta disappointed that it didn't say anything about him helping her do everything she wanted to do before she died, or about him making her a telescope. Other than that it was a beautiful book. I would recommend it to anybody. Even though I'm 13, I will always want a love as strong as Landon and Jamie's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sappy for words!","review":"I read this, against my better judgment, because of the setting. WHLE I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book, it degenerated quickly into typical maudlin Nicholas Sparks during the second half which I did finish by reading only topic sentences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"A very good romance. Lots of literary elements were implemented. Possibly better for a younger audience, however. Overall a good and quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"After watching the movie I knew I had to read the book. It was very different but in a good way. I enjoyed that in the book it talks more about how sweet Jamie was. It was a bit of a disapoment to know that didnt get to stand at her wedding but at the same time it was so sweet that Landon knelt with her that I almost didnt care. Every girl should read this book because it tells girls how a guy should really treat them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to Nicholas Sparks","review":"This was the first Nicholas Sparks novel I read and it tore my heart out in a wonderful way.

Predictable. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read all of Nicholas Sparks' books, I was excited to read A Walk To Remember. I was very disappointed in the predictability and language used in this book. I agree with some of the other reviewers when they say they were sick of Landon saying, \\"if you know what I mean.\\" The plot was just ok; very cliche. This wasn't typical of the writing of Sparks--it was more \\"basic.\\" What I like about his books are the surprises. A Walk To Remember lacked that element of surprise, and that's the main reason for my low rating. Another reason for the 2 stars is that I have high expectations of Nicholas Sparks' books. This one was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A love-hate relationship","review":"I have read all three of Nicholas Sparks' books. I loved and hated them all. Mr. Sparks, please, will you write one book that won't cause me to cry through its final 20 pages? Sentimental, predictable at times, but a wonderful novel. I swore I'd never read another Sparks' book as I once again emptied a box of tissues, but I am eagerly awaiting his next one. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh . . . Saccharine!","review":"I am not hard-hearted or lacking in sentiment (I loved \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\"), but the only word I can find to accurately describe this book is CLOYING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk not worth remembering....","review":"To my disappointment, \\"A Walk to Remember\\" left me puzzled on how a writer gifted enough to pen \\"The Notebook\\" could turn out such a mediocre novel. This story is slow, predictable and lacks the creativity and story telling worthy of a best selling author. There is little to no character development and plot suspense. \\"A Walk to Remember\\" demonstrates a writer producing a novel which can easily adapted to the Silver Screen. No need to read this book... just wait for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A walk I hope I forget!","review":"This was my second attempt at a Nicholas Sparks novel. I really went into this one with an open mind after I completely detested the Notebook. Unfortunately this one was not any better. The dialogue is so unrealistic...people don't talk like that. There is nothing for descriptions and the story line is so predictable. Maybe Sparks is good for some people but his style is definately not something I enjoy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a Glorified Harlequin Romance","review":"This, as all of Sparks' books, are just romantic, predictable, sappy drivel.

It is simplistic drivel ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablum for the Soul","review":"Perhaps I'm too jaded, too stupid or too old to enjoy this novel, or perhaps this novel is vacuous, insipid, formulaic and fatuous. DOES THE LARGE PRINT REALLY FOOL THE READER THAT THIS IS A NOVEL AND NOT GENERIC, DIME-STORE FICTION? I'm sorry, but I will never read another novel by this author since he apparently has no compunctions about churning out this drivel, one after the other, while glaringly omitting meaning, purpose, originality, intellectual challenge, fire or inspiration. Perhaps I am mistaken and this work is specifically intended for the very young, for those learning English as a second language, or for the mentally infirm. \\"Pop\\" fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Walk to Remember","review":"\\"A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book. I have read it at least three times. You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book. First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.

I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance. And that believes in fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I was very disappointed in this book considering how much I liked Sparks' A Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. The characters in A Walk to Remember were one dimensional. He didn't explore how his characters became the people they were. We assumed the minister was the way he was because his wife died in childbirth; but how did that affect how he raised his child, etc. Jamie's character is so flawed, uninteresting, and apparently soooooooooo nice that it's grating. I got through the book because I bet myself that Jamie's character would not be well (though it would have been interesting to see how far this kind of relationship would have gone). Definitely, not one of Sparks' best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"Preachy and predictable. This book is very religious and sends an over-simplified message of right and wrong. It separates the world into the righteous, religious types and the \`sinner' who see the light as soon as they give the \\"believers\\" a chance to reach to them. This is the type of message you take your kids to church for. They deserve better in literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Book to Remember\\"","review":"If you a looking for a light, relaxing read, look no further! You have definitely found the right book. The best way to describe this novel is compare it to TV. It is the soap opera of the literary world. Anyone who enjoys any of the Oprah Book Club books would take pleasure in this novel. I would also recommend this book to any teenage girl looking to learn a thing or two about love. Although it was overall wonderfully written, I would not recommend this book to someone needing to do any type of book report or analysis. It is too much of a \\"light read\\" and does not go in depth enough. Even so, the plot is in many ways both compelling and heart warming. It is easy to get into, and really does touch your heart. It is not too deep nor does it require much thinking. It is by far, the perfect answer to a lazy Sunday afternoon! (Don't forget the tissues!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was suprisingly good","review":"I don't make it a habit to read love stories, however, this book was quite good. This is one of those books that I had to stay up late reading just to figure out how it ended. I truly enjoyed this book despite its extremely feminine nature. It is a love story so beware. I think that this book would be enjoyed by people thirteen years old and older. Mind you, that age range does include males also, though, i wouldn't blame males if it is not on the top of their lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"A Walk to Remember is a great book about a high school girl named Jamie. Jamie spends her time helping the poor and working with the orphanage. She is always doing things for others, and rarely thinking about herself. Landon is a typical high school boy who is always in trouble. He is one of the popular boys, and doesn't like Jamie until he really gets to know her. They were in the church Christmas play together, and ended up being very close. Jamie's father, Hegbert, doesn't like Landon, but he still allows them to see each other. Landon and Jamie spend a lot of time together, but soon Landon finds out that Jamie has cancer. It was very hard for him, but they worked through it together.Jamie and Landon's story is very heartwarming. I loved everything about it. I would recommend this book to anyone because it is so great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A WALK TO FORGET\\"","review":"I was VERY disappointed in reading this book. It meandered for the entire 224 pages. Very simplistic and a third-grader could have written a better book.I can't believe all of the positive reviews. People must really be hard up for a love story. This is sophomoric at best. When the name of the author is larger than the name of the title---WATCH OUT!!It was a waste of my time. He could have summed the entire book up in one paragraph. What a pity!! Time is so valuable and I had to waste it on this ersatz piece of \\"literature\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK","review":"This is the first book I have read by Nicholas Sparks and I DO NOT plan to read another. This book was so sappy (i.e. Jamie, sweet Jamie, was dying . . . my Jamie . . .) and so unreal. The classic story of homely, plain girl falling in love with Mr. Perfect is completely ruined by Spark's undeveloping, uninteresting characters. The beginning especially, where Landon Carter (Mr. Perfect) starts narrating his story: \\"As if through someone else's eyes, I watch myself grow younger; I see my h air changing from gray to brown, I feel the wrinkles around my eyes begin to smooth, my arms and legs grow sineewy.

I found it very disappointing. When the narrator tells you in the first few pages..that you <the reader> will laugh then cry....I did neither of these. The whole novel sounded like a college entrance essay...\\"How I Spent My Senior Year\\" or \\"What Event Changed My Life\\" both of which..makes very boring reading. Im hoping Kevin Costner doesnt pick this book up and decide to make a Movie of the Week out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"This was the best book I think I have ever read. I read Mr. Sparks' other two books but this was by far the best. The simple, honest story was great. I don't want to say anything about the characters or the story because it will give the ending away. This is a book that should be pulled off the shelf and read with no other information. I feel it is a must read for all high school students. In fact I gave it to my 11 year old daughter to start on. It has so many good lessons to learn. It just makes my heart feel good to just think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"This book was a terrible letdown to me after reading the first two books by Nicholas Sparks, The Notebook was one of the best books I have read in many years, Message in a Bottle was also excellent as was the movie, I hope that if Sparks writes any more books they are up to the excellence of his first two! I recommend reading his first novels and saving your time and money by not reading his last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story of a first love!","review":"I purchased this book at an airport - just to pass the time. It did far more than just pass the time, it consumed the time and made a lasting impression, a story I will remember for a long time. I couldn't put it down! When I read the author's prologue \\"First you will smile, then you will cry\\", he knew exactly what he was talking about! I DID smile, I DID cry! The book was very well written and a wonderful, delightful story! I recommend this book to all ages. A great story for the young and old! Bravo Nicholas Sparks! Another great novel that I've very much enjoyed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sunday Afternoon Read....","review":"I really enjoyed this book. While not as powerfully emotional as The Notebook, I still feel this was well worth the afternoon it took to read it. I am not normally a romantic at heart, but I love Nicholas Sparks' stories, and look forward to many more. I won't give anything away from the book, but was anyone else left wondering at the end? I gave this book to a couple of my friends to read to see if they thought the same thing as I did. I can't quite decide what the end means.

I'd love to see how you interpreted it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saddest of Sparks' books!","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen - let's get ready to cry! - This was by far the saddes of his books.

Its not a \\"bad\\" story, and yes, it offers insight to the wisdom of \\"doing good\\", but it sure didn't live up to its covers promises.

I found it to be a touching story of long love. Though A Walk to Remember was an easy, quick read, it was less than believable. The characters were superficial and I found it depressing as well as unlikely that Landon would have spent the rest of his life alone. I'd be reluctant to read another of Mr. Sparks' books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Trite","review":"I had high hopes when I first bought this book that it would be a great read. Books are expensive in my country, costing me $30 a paperback. I regret buying this book. The characters of the book had no depth. The author seemed to rushed through everything. Being an avid reader, I can tell when an author's heart was not really there when writing the book. This is such a book. Even so, I forced myself to finish this book and almost laughed at how the author wrote \\"almost want to cry\\" so many times and how the characters were so boring. The only good thing I can say is that the first few pages were okay and that's even praising too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very jealous of Nicholas Sparks","review":"The man is building an empire -- presumably a very lucrative one -- by crafting a simple, winning formula. One that I could have crafted if only I'd thought of it before he did. The formula is so simple: write a weepy, excessively sentimental love story. That's it. That's all it takes. Who buys books? Mostly women. What do they buy? Weepy, sentimental... well, you get it.This book isn't even well written (as one reviewer has pointed out here, the first-person protagonist starts out telling his story in teenage-speak -- even though he's now a middle-aged man). But all Sparks had to do was create a character who was so smitten with the ethereal girl that he NEVER got over her -- never even considered getting married or even having a relationship of any kind with any other woman as long as he lived. Voila -- his target audience is hooked. Sparks gets richer. I get more jealous."},{"rating":"1","title":"My long wait was in vane.","review":"I had been waiting with bated breath for Mr. Sparks to write another book. After The Notebook and Message In a Bottle, my hopes for another great read, I thought, would be worth the wait. Not. I read it one sitting and found it to be very predictable and not funny or sad at all due to the pedictability. After his first two top notch books,I expected much more then he delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down for me","review":"This book certainly bombed for me. I very much enjoyed the author's earlier two titles, but found this most recent work trite and predictable, as well as overly syrupy and sweet. No twists. No \\"moral.\\" Way too predictable. This is what you might see on a made-for-TV movie that lasts 90 minutes. Sorry, this one wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Remember!","review":"Wow! I really enjoyed Message In A Bottle and The Notebook, but I have to say Sparks' novels just keep getting better. This one was equally romantic as the first two, but in my mind more heartwarming and less tragic. If you've enjoyed his previous novels, or the movie Message In A Bottle, you are sure to live this one. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never read books like this","review":"I am by no means a \\"romantic\\" type, nor do I read romance-style books, but this book captivated me. After reading The Notebook I just had to read A Walk to Remember. I was not at all disappointed. I could recommend this book to anyone - no matter what style book you prefer - this book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you're sure to remember","review":"I bought this book before going to see the movie. So I could conpare the two, and I'd have a clue as to what's going on during the film. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It's a very easy to follow book that I really enjoyed reading. It's a bitter-sweet love story. I've read this book several times, and I love it so much that I can actually sit down, and read it within a days time. I recommend this book if you enjoy reading about love."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a great book/movie!!","review":"This book and the movie were great! My friend Erika saw the movie before me and she said it made her smile and feel like crying. She loved it so I just HAD to see the movie myself. It was great. I loved it, but before I even watched the movie I got the book and read it so that I could have both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sweet book!","review":"I hadn't really intended on reading this until my best friend gave it to me for my birthday. I had seen the movie and liked it, but I was really blown away by the book.The story loses some of its teeneybopper movie elements in favor of a sweeping, romantic story that still retains younger generation appeal. I loved the descrpition of the Christmas play in here better than the one they did in the movie, and all in all, the book was better.I read it while listening to the \\"Love Affair\\" soundtrack in my headphones, and it really accentuated the romantic longing and feelings. I would recommend this book to anyone who liked the movie -- you will probably like the book even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 5*'s for A Walk to Remember","review":"Landon Carter is a most ordinary teenage boy concerned with girls, his own future, his own image, girls, etc. Jamie Sullivan is a minister's daughter without a mother to guide her through the challenges of her teenage years. She dresses funny and is not one of the mainstream kids. Jamie and Landon are an unlikely pair, but they are friends who grow to love and support one another in an extremely sensivite and well written love story. A Walk to Remember promised to make me laugh and to cry. I did both. If you have not read it, it's a wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelously funny! Heart-wrenching sad!","review":"You may know the guy gets the girl, but as the story unfolds you are reminded of your own thoughts and feeling when you were in high school. You laugh as Landon relives his high school years and remembers the crazy things he felt and did. Then Landon learns the secret and you become sad, angry, then hopeful right along with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one alive can write like Sparks.","review":"I wish I could read a \\"Sparks\\" book every week. I HATE waiting on them! As with the first two, this book gives you the lump in your throat & warm fuzzies,,,but THE ENDING? I loved all but the last line of the book. Maybe I am stupid, but spell it out for me...WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GIRL?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old fashioned love story!!!","review":"This book really touches your soul and makes you appreciate the person you fell in love with. Nicholas Sparks takes his time in telling the story so that you are put in that 1950's frame of mind. Courtship was very different in the 50's and Sparks did his best to capture that. It is a wonderful love story that makes you a believer in true love. I laughed and cried."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I am from Romania and the book arrived in about 2 weeks. I am very pleased of it, it has no damages, it arrived quickly and, most important, it's a very good book. A touching story that will make you laugh and cry. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Sweet","review":"A Walk to Remember is the best book I have ever read in my entire life!! Nicholas Sparks is an absolutely a delightful author, mixing the age- old story of 'rich boy meets poor girl' with the 1950's backdrop. It's wonderfully sweet. The plot is very simple; Every year, Landon Carter remembers the girl he met in high school that changed his life forever. It's so a beautiful book about how true love conquers all."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you HATED Bridges of Madison County You'll hate this too","review":"This book made me want to puke. It is poorly written and an insult to the reader's intelligence. Nothing is left to the reader's imagination--rather, all is spelled out for you lest you miss an unsubtle nuance. Not worth the time it takes to read, which isn't much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the notebook....walk to forget?","review":"Sigh....looks like a late ditch effort to get a book out before the holidays to pay for the family boat. I loved 'The Notebook'. This pales in comparison. Believe me, borrow a copy from a friend if you're curious. Hope this is not a trend...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Amazing","review":"I had been wanting to read this a while back but never quite got around to it. I just finished reading it weeks ago and it was AMAZING. The movie is my favorite movie so I knew I'd like this book--and I happen to like it more than the movie! Theres so much more detail in explaining Jamie and what she likes to do in her spare time and how her and Landon got together. Nicholas Sparks is just a great writer--I'd love to write like him someday. I like books that incorporate teenagers with spirutuality without trying to make it sound too forced (and I should know...being a pastor's daughter and all like Jamie!) If you want a book that touches your heart and soul this is a great book to start with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best","review":"It stirs the emotions like no other book I've ever read. Deeply touching, romantic, heart tearing and gut wrenching. I cried with joy and sorrow. While its a short book it is so descriptive you see the town and the characters clearly in your minds eye. It stirred up deep emotions like no other story, it left me so emotionally drained I had to read a Stephen King novel to stop the emotions. The book is definitely better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Read this book!","review":"I have never read a Nicholas Sparks book and my friend recomended this one for me! I am so happy she told me to read this! I promise you when you start reading this book you wont be able to put it down!!! Every chapter ends with a surprise event!! This is my most favorite book EVERR!!! Great job Nicholas i loved this book soo soo much! i bought the movie the day after i finished reading it and i have 2 copies of the book and 1 copy of the movie!!BEST BOOK EVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"The first Nicholas Sparks book that I read was The Notebook. What a wonderful novel, which pulled me along and kept me reading right through to the end nonstop. Then came Message in a Bottle. I really enjoyed it, too. Not quite as much as the first book, but it definitely had its good points. Unfortunately, A Walk to Remember truly disappointed me. I don't know if it was the tacky setup in the prologue which told me that he was planning to manipulate my emotions right from the start or if it was just the story itself. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. I believe Mr. Sparks does a much better job of telling a story when he is NOT doing it with the sole intent of emotional maneuvering. I read it and found myself thinking that my 12-year-old daughter might enjoy it when I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEW RATINGS UNBELIEVEAB LE","review":"Three pages into this book, I found myself checking to see if it was age-specific for teenyboppers, or published years ago, before Sparks hit his stride in Time in a Bottle or The Notebook. The poor, amateurish writing was extremely disappointing. I did finish the book, first because it was just a few pages and I read it in a couple of hours, but secondly, to see if there were any surprises in the ending. Unfortunately there wasn't. I will be much more cautious in purchasing any of his future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too saccharin for my tastes","review":"Though his other two books are quite good, if overly sentimental, this book didn't quite do it for me. The story was too syrupy, the characters to young to really be believable. Landon had a very quick change of heart... These could be forgiven, I suppose, if the heroine was not so disgustingly perfect. She wasn't even human (I realize she is only seen through the eyes of a young man in love, but still). Her character had no complexities at all. I suppose my main problem was that the story was too sweet to be believed. It was better before Landon fell in love and before Jamie told him of her illness. After that it was just ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"What a sweet story. I don't usually get that emotional with most books, but this one got me at the end. This is the type of book that lasts after you have finished reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, corny, unrealistic","review":"I have been reading all my life. I have never seen a series of books that continue to use the same formula: Predictable, sad, unrealistic. Mr. Sparks will continue on his path toward fame in the publishing world, but not by being a true master of his craft. Literary?...A Walk To Remember is Not. And, sadly, it will not be remembered when true great writing is ever discussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thouroghly dissapointing attempt by Sparks","review":"I was really looking forward to reading Nicholas Sparks's latest novel but was very disappointed and would NOT recommend this unless you really want to read a sappy, predictable love story. I was truly disappointed in his latest effort. However if you have not read his first novel, The Notebook- definitely read it, a wonderful, beautiful story. Unfortunately he seems to think he has a winning formula and just needs to turn up the sap factor in \\"A Walk to Remember\\". This is set in North Carolina in the 1950s and is a love story between two high school students, he is the popular bot, son of a Congressman and she is the bible carrying preacher's daughter. Sound nauseating already? Good then I won't bother to continue. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!!!! Nicholas Sparks did it again.","review":"It's a little slow at the beginning, but it turns out to be a heartfelt novel that strengthens your faith in God."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Unfailing Love--An Experience to Remember\\"","review":"If this book doesnt move you, if it doesnt shake the very core of your soul, you can't be moved or you may be dead inside. Nicholas Sparks has taken an ordinary story and transformed it into a rich,moving story of the heart. How can even the most hardened soul not wish they were Landon Carter? I found myself wanting to be him, to be half the man at 38 that he was at 17, to love like that...unconditionally ,no matter what the cost or the circumstances. To reach back into our childhood, to remember the stages of our lives, the joys and sorrows, the loves gained and lost, and then to find the one great love of your life...it is a great happiness and doesnt come around more than once in life. Landon found it and i found it again.Hear the music of your heart...read\\"A Walk to Remember\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not as good as Notebook and Message","review":"I loved the two previous books by Sparks and could not wait for this book to come out. As I was on page 80, I was still waiting for the magic of the story to hit me as the other two stories did already reading page 2. It never came. It was a nice story, but not what I expected from a writer who wrote such beautiful stories as Notebook and Message. I am definitely disappointed. Please Nicolas, we need more romance, this was more like a nice children's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Direction Is a Winner","review":"After borrowing all of Sparks' books from the school library, this one I have to own for my own personal library. In the character of Landon Carter, Nicholas Sparks spreads his wings. We get to see humor that is missing from both Notebook and Message in a Bottle. While I would recommend all three titles to people who like a good love story, I'd only recommend buying A Walk to Remember. This departure from his normal feel-good love stories may disappoint some of his earlier readers, but it shows versatility not seen before and should have a greater appeal. Sadly, Oprah will probably choose Message in a Bottle over A Walk to Remember. Sparks needs to write more with the tongue-in-cheek one-liners. True you could see some of the outcome flying at you, but at the same time, he leaves you on a note of curiosity. Anyone who has ever loved another in their senior year in high school must read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk that's predictable.","review":"This is my first experience with a Sparks novel and likely to be my last. If after 20 pages you can't figure out where this book is going you're probably going to enjoy it. The time period of the fifties serves no real purpose and adds nothing to the story. (Sea bass and salad in a restaurant in the 50's, please!)The spirituality of love is no trifle but this book never convinces me that this callow youth has made such an incredible change. The prose reads like something that could be picked up the young adult section in the library. There was one saving grace however; it was short."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting, revolting, and dumb","review":"When I bought this book, it was so bad I decided to throw it away. I do not recommend anybody to read this book except who think that there is such a thing as magic. Nicholas Sparks, the author, has written other books that are good. But this is his worst. I would rather read picture books about Sesame street,than read this disgusting, revolting and dumb book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie WAS WAY Better. The book...disapointment!","review":"This story lacked passion. The ball was dropped big time and was very disappointed. The movie is based off this story, but the movie writer made many changes that were not in the book... I think for good reason. Watch the movie and pass on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"different cover","review":"Everything okay. It is clean, but the cover is different from the image online. I expected the same cover, but the cover that I received was a photo of movie characters, and I don't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this book!!!","review":"this wonderful book is by far my favorite book i have ever read. it is heartwarming, emoional and will change you life forever. i highly recomend you reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful book but dont watch the movie first","review":"I was told to watch the movie by a friend I did and absolutely loved it so I picked up the book ,and while I really liked the book I was disappointed to find it completely different from the movie only a few things from the movie happened in the book, so just wanted to let everyone know cause the book is great on its own and so is the movie but to let everyone know they are pretty much two different things! I am now a fan of mr. sparks but i will read the book before I watch the other movies so I am not disappointed like that again ... don't get me wrong the book is amazing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blechh","review":"I hate these sappy tearjerking stories. Don't we have enough sadness in this world without adding more misery in the form of a book? When I read I want to be transported to a world of interesting and compelling situations. The story, although highly formulaic, was well written, and interesting and compelling, but for heaven's sake, the last thing I want is to be grieving and crying. YUCK! Can't stand Nicholas Sparks as an author. He is forever killing people or dogs that I have grown to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Remember","review":"Nicholas Sparks took me on a fabulous journey to discover the truth about love in uncommon places. His poise of writing amazes me as he so vividly describes to us the love between Landon and Jamie.Landon Carter was heading into trouble in his senior year. Until the night of the dance, when he doesn't have anyoune to go with, so he invites the reverend's daughter, good girl, Jamie Sullivan. Through a series of events, Landon finds himself in love with her. But, unknown to him, she has a secret that could affect his life forever. This book truly is a walk to remember. I would recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, due to Hollywood, some of Sparks' genius is not in the movie. Read this book and you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"A Walk to Remember is a spiritual moving story based on two main characters, a girl named Jamie Sullivan and a young man, Landon Carter. These two could not be more different. Jamie is a daughter of a pastor who has lead a very sheltered life. Landon is a rebelious bad boy, but has a soft sensetive side. These two charactors go to the same high school, but don't interact until the school play. They have to learn their lines together which eventually leads to love. Their love affair has both a happy and sad ending. This book is easy to read and understand and would be recommended for a girl. A Walk to Remember is rated a 4 because it is a joy to read but not especially thought provocating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection as a Mystery","review":"I loved A Walk To Remember. Anyone who has ever lived in a small town can relate to this book. The chemistry of Landon and Jamie is so very typical of any teenage relationship. The relationship Jamie has with God is a little radical for a teenager, but in my opinion the world needs more like that. This book is wonderfully written, and has a superlative plot. This book sparked deep emotions inside of me...I laughed on one page, and cried on the next. I would recommed this book to anyteenage girl, espcially those who live in a small town."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk to Remember- A WONDERFUL BOOK!","review":"A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, is a great novel!! Jamie is the preacher's daughter and she is nice to everyone. Landon is the kind of boy who is sort of a rebel. He meets Jamie and thinks that's she's kind of weird. but then he gets to know her after taking her to the homecoming dance. They become friends and soon fall in love. He also has a change in heart about life and basically everything. The ending is very surprising! You've GOT to read this book!!MDF"},{"rating":"2","title":"a walk to remember","review":"This book was one of the best books I have ever read. Though the first chapter was hard to get through due to the fact that it was boring, you find the most enchanting love story. This book will make you laugh and cry but most of all it will touch your soul in a way you will remember long after you are done reading it. I recommend reading this book instead of seeing the movie too. The movie was injustice for a book with so much power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good young adult story","review":"From reading the other reviews, it seems the readers who gave the book the highest marks were young teens. This makes sense; this book IS a young-adult story, and I would highly recommend it to those readers between the ages of 12 and 18. But to consider it as a mainstream novel, it leaves much to be desired. I love smaltzy, romantic stuff, but this was just too much to bear. Toward the end of the story, I just couldn't wait for Jaime to die and get it over with. Spark's The Rescue is a much better book on a more adult level."},{"rating":"1","title":"He has NOT done it again..","review":"I love the first two books, but this one was awful. No depth of characters, poorly written, dull voice, and extremely predictable are a few of the reasons. It seems he was writing this in a big hurry - perhaps to get on the BS list again, or he wrote it while in the seventh grade. Yes, Mr. Sparks, you know how to write a moving story, a love story from a male perspective. You just didn't do it this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but predictible","review":"Ever since I read the Notebook I have been a big fan of Nicholas Sparks. I enjoyed A Walk to Remember but predictibly, everyone didn't live through the book. I do wish Mr. Sparks would write a story where he didn't kill off one of his main characters. So far this has happened in every book he has written. I ready for a change, maybe even, dare I say it, a HEA."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of an amazing trio","review":"If you make a presumption that a book is truly great if it captures your mind and haunts you for days and maybe months after you have finished it, then Sparks and his novels are great. However, unlike the other two Sparks novels, this book made me laugh and chuckle at the tribulations and shallowness of being a teenager. And cry, sob, in some cases at the pain of being an adult. This book will live with me for days, and make me wonder about my own life. Thank you Mr. Sparks"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed in this book.","review":"Mr. Sparks latest book is not the quality of Message in a Bottle or The Notebook. I did not laugh or cry...and found the book predictable, no surprises. At least A Prayer For Owen Meany had suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk for All Ages","review":"I found this book entertaining and enlightening. I found it enjoyable for people of all ages. I think teens as well as adults would benefit from this novel. The book's complexity between the topics of God, forgiveness, spirituality, friendship, brotherhood, and kindness make this novel a good choice for the whole family. A Walk to Remember reads like a conversation. The main character tells us of how because of his relationship with this young girl during his senior year in high school, he grew to be a kinder, more mature, respectful, and compassionate human being by the time he graduated from high school. This book is a prime example of the unexpected twists and turns that life throws at us and makes us think of whether we are going to fold or roll with the punches."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was one of the best I've read yet.","review":"I've never read any of Nicolas Sparks books before, and wasn't to happy about having to read this one for a book report. But within no time I was drawn in by the witty character of Landon. Then with the love story that began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down. True, the story does have a sad ending, but it leaves you with a heart warming lessen in love and life that you will never forget. If I can give you one peace of advice, it would be to take the chance and read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk To Remember","review":"This book hit home with me. It was funny, warm, heartbreaking, and tearful. As with all of Nicholas Sparks books I could not lay it down until I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk To Remember","review":"A very emotional and moving story of love, and dedication to ones hearts' feelings. Never once losing the feeling of the North Carolina settings.I could not contain my emotions. This is a very powerful story of a love tested and tried, but never weakened. I have not had emotions brought out from a book such as this in many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Remember","review":"I am not someone who can say that I read a lot. I enjoy reading but rarely find a book that truly speaks to me. But I can honestly say that this book did just that. This is the best book I have ever read, and I have read several. I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book the day I bought it. It is well written, touching, riveting... I could go on and on. I recommend this book to all.. young and old. It speaks to the heart and you hear every word loud and clear. I love this book so much that I think I will read it again tomorrow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Ever Read..","review":"When I read this book I was a little skeptical.Then after I was reading the book for about a couple chapters I realized I couldn't put the book down.After I was finished with the book I cried because the story was so heart-felt and sad that's all u can do is cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most wonderful author known","review":"I have never read books by an author that I loved and related to so much as the ones by Nicholas Sparks. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as I did his others. Not one proves to be better than another. When I read his books, I am guaranteed to cry for hours on end. All I wish for when I am finished is for him to come out with another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sweet it makes your teeth hurt","review":"This totally unrealistic coming of age love story was trite, poorly writen and lacking in character development. The plot was predictable. Within the first 30 pages, I had figured out the fate of all the major characters, and was absolutely on target. This is NOT a book for anyone who enjoys beautiful language, character development, in-depth psychology, or an intriging plot as all these elements are missing.It might be a suitable and safe book for a 12 - 14 year old - particularly a romantically inclined but unsophisticated young girl. Not worth the time for a mature reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm trying to be nice","review":"I am on page 214 and am reticent to move on to 240. What a bunch of bunk! Is Nicholas Sparks the male Danielle Steel of this century? To say it was predictable would be superfluous. Nick, have you ever read a well written book?

It was good, but I'd recomend that you to read this wonderful book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet but predictable","review":"While I do love Nicholas Sparks writing, and yes even I was moved to tears (not easy to do) in this sweet story; I found A Walk to Remember predictable. If you a looking for a fast read and a cathartic cry this is the book for you. I found the protaganist to be placed on a pedestal so high that I could not relate even to the feelings the narrator has for her.Yes I cried, yes it was a quick read. I just expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember to Forget this One","review":"Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook was probably the best book I read last year. This book is a very pale imitation. The storytelling is enjoyable but by the end of the story you wonder what the whole point was. I felt that Landon would have done more with his life (like actually had one) if Jamie had actually had the impact on him that he claims throughout. The story is interesting and is one you can share with your children but not as deep as Sparks intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the book that will touch your heart.....","review":"I think my title say it all, this is one of the story that I will never forget........

Good story for persons who have loved and lost that first love by some form or reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Remember","review":"What a wonderful and compassionate novel! Once again Mr. Sparks, you have amazed me. The story line is very different from Mr. Sparks' other two novels, and yet, just as compelling.

Only to be read as a near substitute for soap operas."},{"rating":"1","title":"the one time the movie was better than the book..","review":"it was alrite but it got very boring as you got into it. it was too schmalzy and too focused on her sickness and the depressingness of the book.. towards the end all they do is read the bible together.. it gets just sooo stupid.the movie, however, was sweet. it moves faster and is just a nicer version of the story much less focused on religion and does not attempt constantly to make you cry to the point you want to rip it up.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring!","review":"I watched the movie first with that Mandy Moore girl and really liked the movie. It was cute and sweet. So I was excited to read the book. ... I've never came across a movie that was better then the book until now. This book was terrible. Badly written and (YAWN) boring! It went on and on and on. I finally had to put it down and read something else. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie is Better than the Book","review":"Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me. I usually prefer Sparks books over the movies, but I was the opposite on this one. I would recommend either one to someone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jumble of Emotions","review":"I haven't seen the movie, but I know that someone died. Even if I had this one big spoiler, I still wanted to read the book. Having read all but two (including this) of Nicholas Sparks' novels, I could somehow predict what would happen (other than the dying part). But knowing what was coming didn't rob me of the jumble of emotions I always feel when reading his works. A Walk To Remember evoked all kinds of emotion; it was funny and sad, promising and depressing, youthful and mature, all at the same time. The story flowed seamlessly like a reckless youth becoming a mature, stable and fulfilled adult.Here is my favorite line: \\"Jamie was more than just the woman I loved. In that year Jamie helped me become the man I am today.\\" I never knew what the title meant before, until the passages leading to its mention gave the meaning away...True to the title, this story will stay with me, and will always be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"once again nicholas sparks brought me to tears. this book grabed me from the very beginning! i loved every minute of it. nicholas sparks created an amazing character that made mebeleave true love does exst and it can brake any barriers.....this is a book that i will passfor all my friends to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So incredibly sweet!","review":"This book is a very quick read, only about three hours. It held me from the short sample downloaded to my kindle until the very end of the book, only stopping to refill my coffee cup. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan and this is definitely one of my favorites. I only wish it was longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take out the hanky","review":"This book was a very easy read. I enjoyed the way the author made us feel exactly how the characters felt. He really got me under their skins. So much so that I litterally had to put the book down a few times to get a hold of myself.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading","review":"This book was an easy read. I have never read a book in one sitting and I sat at home sick one day and read it from cover to cover... It's a nice story that should entertain you if not make you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy and True love","review":"I loved it! This was one of the first books I read by N. Sparks and I like the way he writes. The book had a great mix of comedy and romanace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book was awesome! I couldn't put it down for anything! It was such a good book and it was so cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Beautifully Moving Love Story","review":"This was my first Sparks book, and I enjoyed it so much I am looking to read them all. His writing style makes you \\"see\\" and \\"feel\\" the details of his story, and his tale takes you through the full gamut of emotions. The prologue of this book is important, and true to its word. A wonderful read for anyone who enjoys a good love story, and the meaning of real friendship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This book was truly one of my favorites.I am now reading another book by Nicholas Sparks and I think he is a great author. His books are filled with compassion and are very enjoyable...I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story not soon forgotten","review":"I reccomend this book to anyone who has ever loved someone else. Honestly, I thought it was a little too predictable, and in some ways it seemed like just another love story. However, it is one of the very few love stories that really touched my heart. It makes you more aware of how people treat each other, and, therefore, makes you take a closer look at yourself. Though short in length, this book contains numerous lessons to be learned, and ideas worth taking into consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The lack of substance in this book negated all \\"warm and fuzzy\\" feelings so typical of the author's other works. The characters were never developed enough to allow them to be believable. I generally find that authors make the best readers for audio books. Unfortunately, that was not the case with this one. If I weren't stuck with it, I would have returned this one after the first 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare us this sparks","review":"One of the editorial comments compared this book with A Prayer For Owen Meany. I am dumbfounded at the comparison - this book is almost smug in its unwritten assertion that it will evoke meaningful emotions from its readers. John Irving does elicit emotion because he gave some thought to what he was writing. I would be embarassed to be seen reading this book by anyone who reveres good fiction. I wasted my time on A Walk to Remember. I should have known after reading Message in a Bottle that Nicholas Sparks has given up the promise he showed in The Notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie's Review of A Walk To Remember","review":"I loved this book. A Walk To Remember is an intriging book that made me cry and jump for joy at the same time. After reading this book i watched the movie, although it was a good movie it could not match the writing in the book. This book helped me to realize that being on top is not what high school is all about. I think all people should read this because it gives you persective on life!!! I recommend this book very highly to all ages!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find!","review":"A Walk to Remember is a wonderful little book. Jamie Sullivan is a quiet loner, a teenage with few, if any friends. Along comes Landon Carter, the son of a congressman, and the most unlikely of partners for Jamie. However, through numerous twists of fate, and perhaps the power of prayer, Jamie and Landon come to find friendship and love in each other. Although I would wager to say that most men would find this book a little corny, I absolutely loved this story! It was sweet, easy to read, and entertaining. (The book was also ten times better than the movie, in case any of you are using that for comparison.) I highly recommend this book for a leisurely afternoon read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever","review":"This book is so wonderful! I saw the movie a couple times before reading the book and I really enjoyed it. And then a couple weeks ago at an airport I found the book and bought it right away. I had it finished two days later and it is simply one of the best books that I have ever read! Now I am very disappointed in the movie. I can't believe they had the nerve to make the movie but not even make it at all like the book. They are completely different and I would most definitely recommend the book over the movie anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"For any age","review":"What can i say about this book? it's incredibly beautiful. Not only is the story amazing, but Spark's style of writing is profound, poignant, timeless. I cried during this book. Sparks writes with such clarity that it's soo easy to see the scenery. I gave this book to my little sister and she loved it. It's for any age. I saw the movie after i read the book and was SOOO mad! The movie is beyond stupid. Please, get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book was good.This book was a romantic type and was truly compelling. It reminded me somewhat of Message in a Bottle, it had the romantic flar and charming chracteristics. Although this book did leave me with one question at the end, I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Question to the Ending","review":"I conducted a phone interview with Mr.Sparks some time ago, and he did say that the ending was meant to conclude that Jamie does die. Perhaps it wasnt conveyed to other readers as he meant.I did not like this book...it was way too shallow. I found it in the pages of my 5th grade sons book orders! Not for a mature adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"Very manipulative book. You can forsee where the author expects you to feel a certain way. That you do react in accordance is not due to the writer's skill but due to human weakness!Its a shame the author is so popular. It just shows that the populace has no discrimination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliness at best!","review":"This is surely a drivel for pimpy girls without boy friends (but dreaming of Tom Cruise)and bored housewives with doughs in their laps, who long ago left analysing, thinking and making any intelligent decision. If you are below 15 years old or your mentality age is around that you can like this...and it is ghastly that this book received so many five stars and many people cried for it. I could have cried a little only for the blandness of the nation.Oh well-someone still makes bucks and laughs all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed","review":"I am surprised at how many people gave this book such good ratings. I found the story to be boring, trite and predictable. The girl in the story really is too good to be true. Christian or no, just not someone most people can relate to. As for the boy's character, I have to say, I enjoyed his character development although his change of heart happens a little too quickly and with little explanation as to why.The ending of the story was so predictable it's really insulting to the reader's intelligence. Check it out from the library if you want an exceedingly unchallenging, \\"brain-candy\\" type of read. I wouldn't buy it and definitely wouldn't see Hollywood's version either."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"I must admit that this book was a page-turner, but I must also admit that I found it trite and schmaltzy. Sparks is a mediocre writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and immature","review":"After reading both Message in a Bottle and The Notebook, and loving them both, I couldn't wait for Nicholas Sparks' next book. This one seemed to be written by a seventh-grader in its content and characters. It was too predictable and goody-goody to keep me interested. Although I always read a book in its entirety, even if I don't like it, this was one book I would have put down after a couple of chapters, but since I bought it I needed to try to get my money's worth. After reading two-thirds of the book, something finally happened but not anything substantial. All the clues that something will happen, what a tease! Try again, Nicholas, and don't rush the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet, but not too deep","review":"This book is very sweet but is predictable and superficial. A nice story, but don't look to this for any deep life lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk to Forget","review":"Ok, if you haven't figured out the formula yet, here it is. Boy meets girl, some conflict exists between them. The conflict is resolved, they fall hopelessly in love. Something happens, one of them dies, the other is left alone (somewhat more reflective, having loved and lost) at the end of the story. The result is tons of tears and a trip up the best-seller lists.After Sparks stole the love-story genre with The Notebook, I thought more could be expected of him. Instead of challenging himself and the reader with the two books that followed (Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember), Sparks simply dusted off the old outline, changed the character names and resubmitted to the best-seller lists. Buried within this criticism is a nugget of praise for The Notebook which I felt was tightly crafted and a true love story. Although it is roughly the same size and written by the same author, A Walk to Remember is not in the same class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting Drivel","review":"I read this book. When I first picked it up, I honestly thought that I had mistakenly purchased a copy for those readers who are visually impaired! The type was so large and the margins on the page were huge! As I contined to read, I realized why: Nicholas Sparks has nothing to say. He is riding the wave of the Bridges of Madison County, \\"romance lite\\" books -- those kind of small, shallow books that is taking advantage of American readership these days. He knows our attention spans aren't what they used to be, that we're not really that bright and certainly don't like to be challenged intellectually, so he is laughing at us all the way to his bank while publishing this vapid fiction that passes off for books. This was the most revolting, insulting book I have ever read, and actually made me ashamed that I invested the time and money to read it. We can do better than this, American readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk To Remember","review":"I picked up the book hoping it would be yet another breathtaking novel from Nicholas Sparks-it was not...I dragged myself through this seemingly endless novel about young love interrupted by life...The plot itself is good (the preacher's daughter has cancer and is in love) but the delivery is completely wrong...There were so many cliches and boring metaphorical virtues in it that it was like going to church, and for once, I wished I was the one who had cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and predictable","review":"I have read Nicholas Sparks \\"Message in the Bottle\\" and \\"The Notebook\\" and thoroughly enjoyed them. When I picked up \\"A Walk to Remember\\" I was immediately intrigued. This time my version was the talking book type. I popped the cassette into my car stereo and after only a few minutes, the mood was set. I immediately began to dislike this book. Mistake number one was that it was read by the author, in monotone, who obviously has no professional broadcasting or acting training. I tried to get past that and really listened to the story. I couldn't believe how contrived and predictable it was. This is the sappiest book I have ever read. I took a sudden dislike to wimpy Landon Carter and the unbelievably geeky Jamie. There is so much wrong with this book that it makes me afraid to read the author's next novel. If I do get over the fact that this book was a waste of my time and venture to read any more of this man's work, I will be sure to proceed with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"Although this book was predictable, it was also very inspiring. The end was sad, but it also made you smile, because of all the heart-warming events that occured. I recomended this book to many of my friends, and hope you enjoy the book. It's fast to read, and very good. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, couldn't put it down.","review":"This is Spark's best of the three he's written. It's an easy read, I finished it in one sitting partially because it's easy reading and partially because I couldn't put it down. A Walk to Remember is heart warming and sensitive. The story is one in which everyone can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I read this for a book group, and we generally agreed that it was terrible. Not Sparks' best work, emotionally manipulative, and not even very well written. The foreshadowing was as subtle as a brick on a 3-layer chocolate cake. On a more personal note, I myself could do with a lot less god in a novel, and a whole lot less deus ex machina. If you're the kind of person who gleefully embraces the kind of emotional manipulation that characterizes both Hallmark TV Movies and Hallmark commercials, then this is right for you. Otherwise, it's a good one to skip entirely. I give it 1 star because you can read it in less than 3 hours if you're a fast reader, so at least the agony is over soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A highly predictable book","review":"This is the first book I read by Nicholas Spark, after hearing many good reviews, and many translation of his work to movie screen. I pick this as the first book because of its size, a bit longer than 200 pages, so that I can finish it in 2 days.I must say I am disappointed (not a bit, but quite a lot). Not only the plot was HIGHLY predictable, I don't think it is good on character development.In Hong Kong, such similar themes have been repeated in the movies in the 50-60s . About 10 years ago, we had a movie called \\"C'est La Vie Mon Cherie\\" with similar theme, but with a much much much moving plot, much much much better characters. The female lead earned a best female actress award in the HK Movie Acadamy Award.I know this review may piss some of the fans of the author, but I will keep on reading one or two more of his books to see whether I can change my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky sentimental ...!!!!","review":"This is one of the worst books i've had the misfortune of reading. It is your run of the mill oprah book club type books where two totally incompatible people fall in love against the odds, and then one dies of cancer. Could it be any more predictable. A truly original ending would have had Jaime turn out to be a cyborg. Just because a book is on the New York Times Bestseller list doesn't mean its a great literary work. Get a clue you Lemmings! Go read Hamlet, Pride and Prejudice is a romance novel but at it was well written. For a great novel that has romance, passion and tragedy try Anna Karenina! I only gave this book one star because zero wasn't an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is the Author such a SELL OUT","review":"I read the book first, wich took me three days. I then saw the movie right afterwards. The movie was very disappointing. It didn't potray the kind of relationship that Landon and Jamie really had together. It kept out all the things a christian would do. Like go to an orphanage, collect money and so on.... As for the movie I would have rather not have seen it. I was so upset on how they made the movie I cried in my car before actually going on with my day. I have never read a book so intense with feeling for another person before and for god... I have said my peace and I pray that next time Mr. Sparks writes another book that is possible for a movie write then he will not think of dollar signs and think of god and the others who actually enjoyed the story the way it was in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it better when it was called \\"Love Story.\\"","review":"It had the same plot as \\"Love Story\\" complete with the required boy-falls-in-love-with-girl-from-opposite-end-of-the-social-structure and the required resistance of someone's father and, of course, the required terminal illness. But other than different names, times, places and settings, it was the same book. And I'm wondering -- is this allowed? I think most of the readers of this books are too young to remember \\"Love Story\\" but now that the movie is out, won't the public catch on and blow the whistle about this obvious rewrite?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Story Revisited","review":"If there is a more sappy story out there, I would be surprised. This is definitely not a book for adult readers. Mr. Sparks obviously read that 70's tear-jerker, Love Story, added a dose of the South, sprinkled in a little nostalgia for the 50's and came up with pablum in book form. Yuk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to remember","review":"I am not sure any book has ever touched my heart soo deeply as this one did. Yes, the book seems predictable at times...but the author has done a splendid job in expressing emotions and relationships and its hard to put the book away until you finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is better","review":"Ok,the book is alright. But the Movie is way better,I fell in love with the characters in the movie but I couldn't get into the book. It was good but the movie is one of my very favorites and the book didn't even come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is going to be hard to top!","review":"I am not a romance reader. However, I could start getting in to romance novels if they were all written like this. Sparks does an excellent job portraying the life of a terminally ill person. He also develops a plot that allows two high school students to accurately reveal what love is all about. This book will motivate you to find the one that you love and tell her again how much that she means to you. Guys and Gals, you need this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparks Delivers!","review":"This is an amble you'll not soon forget. Often touching, sometimes deeply poignant, this book seemed to speak to my soul. The easy cadence of the words as Nicolas Sparks reminisced was captivating. The characters were well fleshed out in my minds eye as the story progressed and a boy grew into a man. This book may cause you to re-examine some of your own pre-conceptions about people who are \`different'. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin's \\"Walk To Remember,\\" View","review":"I had heard of this book, I rented the book on tape. Nicholas Sparks reads it. My view of this. I am not into sad,romance books but this book is sad. It's about Jamie who struggles meets Landon and teaches him new things. I would reccomend this great book and it will change you. I recently rented the DVD and Nicholas Sparks did a good job doing the commentary. I would suggest you read the book first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an unbelivable shift (cadeau inoubliable)","review":"When i receive this book for my birthday, i've never known this writer, i have read the story from beginning to the end, i 've cried but i'll never forgotten(oublier) each words of this love story the end is a beutifull act of love ! touch by touch the author descrive the most important moment of this life, when he was 17 years old, without regrets or sensiblery and tell us a hope (espoir) on the life (sorry for my english expression)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book you just have to read","review":"This book pulled you every which way when it came to emotions one moment your laughing but then you turn a page and your bawling.

I really would sugest that you read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Death","review":"A WALK TO REMEMBER is one of my favorite books. it tells a story of love and death, and that even though someone is about to die the love between the two people can still live. It tells a story about a helping person that soon becomes helpless to everything, life espeicially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Deep","review":"This book is a very sad, but also full of joy. It contains something that can never be able to express without even crying. This book written by Nicholas SParks is about a boy named Landon that is a senior in High School but does not know what he wants to do in the future. He does not have a care in the world for anyone, but his friends and family. During the beginning of the new year of his senior year, he notices the nice and plain Jamie Sullivan. ...I really enjoyed this book because I believe that it is not only a love story but it shows a lesson in life also. In these written pages the lesson is that there is always something more deeper and more beautiful than the outside of a human, and I believe that Landon learned this when he met Jamie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful...","review":"Very Very different from the movie. A real page turner, and every emotional. It makes you want to think twice about judging someone before you know them. I'm NOT going to tell you the ending...I suggest that everyone pick this book up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Until the End","review":"This was the first book I read by Nicholas Sparks. I thought it was very good. I read it on the reccomendation of a friend. This is something that I probably not have picked up without the reccomendation. At first, I thought the story moved very slow. I was ready to quit reading but my friend encouraged me to continue reading. I am so glad that I did. I thought it was awesome! Once you get passed the first few chapters, the action really picks up and you just want to keep reading. You feel like someone watching Landon and Jamie and feeling with them. I was drawn in to continue. The end was heartbreaking. It was a marvelous story. I love the way Sparks builds and shapes his characters. I have picked up many other books by him as a result of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book To Remember","review":"At first I thought the book was really boring, but after awhile I really got into it.Towards the end (in the last few chapters )the book really got to me. It is a love story where the female character discovers that she has cancer. At the end of the book, they get married and the girl dies. After the book I decided to see the movie,I discovered that the book is nothing like the movie.So if you want to see the movie A Walk To Remember, I Recommend reading the book first.(also if you have read the book see the movie)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A FAVORITE - bitter sweet love story","review":"I Loved a Walk to Remember the best book I think Nicholas Sparks has written.

Thank goodness it's not too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I typically don't like love stories (and generally I do not like Nicholas Sparks books), but I downloaded a free sample of this book and after reading the first 2 chapters I was hooked!

I would highly recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but different cover","review":"I really love this book and bought it again as a gift for a friend.

Other than that, still very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Remembering","review":"I did not care for this book - it wasn't the worst book I have ever read, but it didn't even come close to being \\"good\\". I cannot believe it got so many 5 star ratings. It was so predictable, I basically knew how it was going to end by the 4th chapter. I immediately caught onto the little \\"hints\\" the author was dropping that Jamie was not well.I felt like I was reading a novel written by a 16 year old. By the end of the book I was so sick of Landon saying \\"if you know what I mean\\" that I could scream! This story was supposed to be happening through the eyes of a 50 something year old man - how many older men do you know that says \\"if you know what I mean\\" after every other statement. Give me a break. It was torture to read that over and over...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears","review":"The ending really made me cry. I didn't think I would since I saw the movie many years ago and so I knew what was coming but it still made me cry.I recommend it to anyone who, like me, is a sucker for romance. :,)It's a very nice story and it really makes you think about life. It does talk a lot about God and Christianity so if that bothers you, I'd say, don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Great read. So exciting I could not put it down.

It's one of the most beautiful stories I have ever read. It had me laughing and crying the whole way through. You will instantly fall in love with Jamie Sullivan's charitor. I was so excited when it was made into a movie. I even went to see it with a friend the day after it was released. I was very disapointed, to say the leaste.

The setting is back in the 1950's when life was much more simple than now. Nicholas Sparks is a remarkable story teller. This love story certainly measures up to The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. Question: What is the miracle he is refering to in the last line of the book? Does he mean she lived? Anyone else wonder about that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"A Walk To Remeber is a sad love story, that touches your heart, and makes you want to live your life to the fufillest."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best book I've ever read!!","review":"Sparks touches every emotion of the human race in this touching novel. I recommend this book to all ages. Good wholesome writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching story of an innocent first love.","review":"Once I began reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Sparks has a wonderful way with words. He makes you want to keep reading to find out what will happen next. He kept saying things like, \\"You'll find out why later.\\" I wanted to know why!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!","review":"Ok let me get straight to it! This book was AWESOME! I do not like to read books and when I started reading it I could not stop! Nicholas Sparks is a fantastic author and his books are fantastic too! You can learn so much from this book! It teaches you how not to judge people by the way they look, you really need to get to know them! Take Jamie Sullivan (i can't spell) noone would talk to her because she was uncool! All they needed to do was give her a chance! I think EVERYONE needs to read this book! It it awesome and you will learn alot from it:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll make you cry","review":"Yes, it WILL make you cry. A short & sweet love story, one that tv shows & movies are made of. Inspite of the traditional & predictability of it, it's a good book. The characters are likable as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best novel ever read","review":"A Walk to Remember written by Nicholas Sparks had touched every single heart. With it's romance it had made me see my love ones more precious. I really like the way Nicholas Sparks had arranged the order of the story, which build me to cry again and again. Another special thing was that this story is unpredictable. I didn't know that Landon was going to change his life upon a woman he fell in love with. This book had changed me in many ways. I had become a girl who sees things in a better way more then before and I appreciate every moments of my life. The way Jamie had treated other and look at the world in a beautiful way had impressed me and motivated me to be a better person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ BOOK!!!","review":"\\"A Walk to Remember\\" tells a story of a 40 year old man looking back on his senior year of high school as well as his first true LOVE! Nicholas Sparks plays with your emotions and makes you want to keep on reading. There were many moments in the book where I didn't want to put the book down. I wanted to keep on reading until I found out what was going to happen next. This was somewhat of a simple book, but Nicholas Sparks has an interesting way of writing. I don't really like reading, but I enjoyed reading this novel. It took me into another world. A world that was much different from mine and a world that I could definitely learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book in satisfactory condition","review":"The book was not in as good of condition as the seller described, but satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read.

This book fails to give the reader/ game designer the conceptual info to fill in the blanks of their own personal issues with their own game ideas.I found the info in here to be scattered and poorly organized, and utterly useless in terms of \\"back-bone\\" game programming basics. I have taken game prototyping classes using Flash and this book was useless. Unless you plan to build the most basic games, exactly as they are presented in this book, you will find very little info in here to help you on your more creative and ambitious game projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution before buying","review":"This is a great book!

Most of them, even to Chino fans will be \\"new\\" even if they were recorded 2002-2003. The production is solid, and as always he shines lyrically. There are a few tracks on here that don't really move me, mostly due to the beats not fitting his spit. I can't front though, this album is quality as hell. Pain in a great song, the influence from Ras Kass's Interview With A Vampire is obvious, but it's not Chino biting. She Can't Change Me is another track that is crazy nice. But, Chino is a battle rapper first and formost. And as always he doesn't let us down with the punchlines.s!!t won't be pretty like India Arie - this one made me laugh, Chino can get wicked when he wants to. There are too many ill lines to quote so I'm going to end this review by telling y'all to pick this up! He recently signed with Sway & Tech's label so hopefully we'll see his next album before 2010!"},{"rating":"2","title":"finally, chino drops classic","review":"The long anticipated album from Chino, and he does not dissapoint. I have his other 2 albums which for one reason or the other have some errors that do not make them classics. However, on this album hes got very very strong production on almost every track. Chino makes songs in this album, rather then just kick sick punchlines. Chinos methapors are always disgusting, and no exeception on this one. But what takes this album up a notch is concepts and the production. Chino even stepped up his flow, although hes no Pun, its improved. But overall this is a 5/5 classic from Chino."},{"rating":"2","title":"um","review":"just like the reviewer said ... where is the tracklistings and samples. And a front cover , this album cany be found nowhere !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the bomb, pushed back to the end of January","review":"Yea it leaked out the way things do on the internet, but thats not stoppin me from buyin it which was preordered last week. Chino will revolutionize the rap game which has become polarized in the recent years. This albums worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Usual...","review":"This album was dropped a long time after it's expected release date simply because (as usual) the record label just dont know what to do with Untouchable legendary emcees(Rakim & Kool G Raps are 2 other examples) thankfully it was put out. Now the beats are well made but as usual it's Chino's lyrical skill and the colabos that make this album. My favorite track would be the one with Killah Priest, but the tracks with beatnutz & Proof(R.I.P.)are both dope. I'd say it's not as well produced as his last 2 records but still worth getting for a true Chino XL fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that wait for this?","review":"Boring. Messiah is an ok track but there's nothing really special about this album. Chino XL has mad skills but this album feels like a collection of randomly produced beats just thrown together and released as one cd rather than an actual complete album. Maybe that's because that's all this album is? Disapointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully, it's still coming","review":"I know this album should be out already but I think it has to do with Chino on a different label (Bolo Entertainment/Bungalo Records.)

You can really feel his music.Peace !!Shad Dawg"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Messiah","review":"I read a review that said Chino Xl is too much like Eminem and he took his style?

Belgium was blessed with a concert last night as part of the European UTF autumn tour.3 Hours - yes, 3 hours - of awesome musicianship during which UTF (obviously) has gotten lots of attention.Preferences are personal matters but regardless of that UTF is an incredible achievement. All members of the band are top notch musicians and the result of their individual and common abilities can be heard on this masterpiece.Given the fact that The Flower Kings make a new album every other year, the future does look bright indeed !Do not postpone your purchase, the limited edition comes with a bonustrack which is really good.Highly, very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"World's Best Band Comes Alive Again!","review":"I received an advance copy of \\"Unfold the Future\\" last week and over the weekend I was in Flower King Heaven! This CD is the best CD out there - hands down! It is their best work, equally as good as \\"Space Revolver\\" and beyond. Many favorite tracks include \\"The Navigator\\" followed by Vox Humana (absolutely excellent!), \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" \\"Man Overboard\\" \\"Solitary Shell\\" etc., etc. The whole album (over 2 hours) ROCKS!!!! There is nothing like this out there. Take my word for it. Nothing of this magnitude has been done in popular music for eons. Easily the best album of 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I've been a big fan of The Flower Kings since \\"Stardust We Are\\" and \\"Space Revolver\\" and this effort pales by comparison. Even their last, the uneven \\"The Rainmaker\\" was better. \\"Unfold The Future\\" is the perfect example of taking marginal material that would at best comprise one CD and expanding it with filler to make it a double CD. A much better prog choice would be the new Porcupine Tree \\"In Absentia\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but this CD is awful","review":"Being a King Crimson fan I read in a magazine about the new prog rockers such as the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, etc. I'm sorry folks but this CD is awful. I should have known that a Swedish prog rock group is an oxymoron. The music is not compelling, there are no melodies or lyrics that linger. These guys are not Yes, King Crimson, or Genesis. I've been critical of Transatlantic before, but the weakness of the Flower Kings makes Transatlantic prog rock gods. Maybe it is my age, or I'm too involved in the early prog rock movement to appreciate the modern prog rockers.

Jimmy Stewart plays a lonely old down-on-his-luck janitor who craves the company of others on Christmas Eve. A little girl caroler touches his heart and his thoughts wander to Temple Square, where, in his mind, he directs the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and then expresses his love for the Savior. This is a well-acted story and very touching - just the thing to add to the Christmas spirit of your family. You will also enjoy the other three short videos on this DVD - Norah's Christmas Gift, about a blind woman who is able to see the blessings in her life, The Story of the Other Wise Man, an animated short feature, and the beautifully-filmed story of The Nativity.

I have read Coach K's book and I found it to be the worst book I have ever read. The book repeats itself over and over again. Almost like he doesn't have anything really to say so he filled the book with filler. Nothing in the book made me go wow. Nothing was new to the coaching or leading world. Save your money and get a real book on Leadership.I do not know one Coach in the NCAA world that has not read this book. And I can say that the majority of people agree with me. The ones that don't are just big Coach K or Duke fans.I am not a UCLA fan in anyway. But I found that John Wooden's book to be more thoughtful and helpful.Skip this book and find books on Leadership in the business world. Coach K is a great coach, but he can't write a book. And lets be honest it is not hard to coach the 10 best College players like Duke has. It is harder to coach the 10 worst. And that is what we all are looking to get advice from."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can use your money better... by lighting it on fire","review":"I went into this book a huge fan of Coach K and the Duke program and emerged from it disillusioned to say the least. This book is a lesson in egotistical self-serving praise and it highlights the decline of the college game rather than the strategies of a great coach.The title should be changed to \\"How I Became the Greatest Coach in the Land and Why Noone Will Ever Be Like Me.\\"Surely, you can get a better book elsewhere with significantly more analysis and worthwhile philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock of jit","review":"Had I wanted 300 pages of Duke propagana, I would have purchased their basketball media guide.

Leadership is not generic, it is situational. Leadership is not about a person, it is an activity.This book was given to me as a gift. I liked the basketball anecdotes, being a fan, but as far as advising me on how to be a leader, it's drivel. This is right up there with Rick Pitino, John Calipari, and every other college coach whose ego is out of control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest book on Leadership Ever written","review":"Perhaps no other book will hit you where you are more than this one.

They are typically a can't-miss mixture of storied histories with timeless principles of leadership and perserverance. However, Coach K manages to mess it up in this book.He constantly comes off as pompous and as though he has no real idea what lead to the success that he has had. In fact, he seems to dwell in cliches to cover up the fact that this is a naked attempt to profit from his basketball team's success.If you want to read a good book on leadership, keep looking because this is not a book you should waste your time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call A Sanitation Crew, I've Found Garbage!","review":"My daughter recently graduated from Duke so over the past few years I have become acquainted with a program that I had previously paid little attention too. I won the book in a raffle at my church and was pretty excited to dive into something that I begun to understand over the past few years. Very quickly however, my enthusiasm turned to disgust as I was exposed to principles supporting an egotistical \\"win at the expense of others\\" attitude in life. I expected to read of a man grounded in principles higher than himself, but all I found was man grounded in nothing BUT himself. The book is a poor reflection on Duke University and those that associate themselves with the institution. It is unfortunate when because of our allegiances to a team or school we find ourselves cheering for a such a man. This book is ground breaking only for the light it casts on the darker side of college athletics today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"I went into this book with a rather neutral perspective on \\"Coach K\\" and the details of his life. However, when I finally emerged from what I found to be a thoroughly soporific experience, I concluded that rarely have I seen such egomania on display. The self-importance one must have to even contemplate writing an autobiography at this stage of their life is pretty bold to say the least. \\"Coach K\\" delivered on this promise of self-grandeur, and I almost felt pity for him the futher I read. All I can ask is that he realizes the error of his ways, and the literary world won't be subjected to a sequal of \\"Coach K's\\" wisdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coach K's Biggest Fan by Coach K","review":"I was appalled at this book. It was the most self-serving garbage I've ever read and I am a Duke grad. I am ashamed that he is viewed as a representative of our school.

Thanks, Coach, for giving Carolina fans another reason to view us as egomaniacs and assnecks."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Too Much","review":"I went in with a neutral attitude regarding \\"Coach K\\" and his life. However, once I finally emerged from this bastion of self-promotion, I could see what so many others have seen for years. \\"Coach K's\\" delusions of granduer are almost laughable, and his obvious need for attention is on full display. I guess he thinks being a college basketball coach (at Duke no less!) automatically qualifies him to dispense wisdom about business and life. I can only hope that the literary world is spared the torture of having to read a sequel which instructs us on the rest of life that he forgot in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical, dreamlike excursion into a tropical paradise","review":"I first listened to Scott Moulton's \\"Tropical Dreams\\" nearly 10 years ago and have listened to it dozens of times since then.

Finally I put my review in about 2 weeks ago, 1 star by the way, and now that I check and this book \\"hasn't been reviewed\\".Hmm...is it Amazon's policy to remove badly rated books reviews?So just in case the reviews are indeed gone, here's a quick synapsis: Don't waste your time. Eat raw if you want, I do, but this book is nothing but a catalog for the author's own store. Some of the food prep is good, but the workouts are a joke and would take about 3 hrs to complete, and the other \\"advice\\" he gives is to buy his friends books.

I have been eating raw foods for a year now, and there was a phase where I lost about 50 or 60 lbs of \\"muscle\\". My cooked bodyfat was about 6%, but my energy and stamina were horrible, and my anger and ego controlled my life. I switched to raw foods and became emaciated. When I read \\"Raw Power\\", I started adding more fats and greens and it made a world of difference. I was able to put on about 25 lbs. of muscle. My endurance is at an all time high, so is my energy. Now I'm not the least bit angry anymore. I'm currently 6'2\\", 188 lbs, 100% raw. My lifetime goal is 230 lbs. One day I'll achieve it.

The resulting mix of folk and pop suggested Joni Mitchell with a sense of humor, or a country music star without the pretense. (\\"Simply\\" could have as easily charted Country as it did Adult Contemporary.)Another highlight of \\"Equal Scary People\\" was Sara's cover of James Brown's \\"This is a Man's World.\\" She completely transforms the meaning of the song, and made her an artist to watch. Her career followed many of the same paths...mixing styles of music to folk while imprinting her personality on the songs themselves. \\"Equal Scary People\\" is just one of many excellent Sara Hickman albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!

I had heard good things about this book (\\"The Design of the UNIX Operating System\\") - in fact, I read somewhere that this was the book that taught Linus to write OS code. I put down the Linux book and picked up Maurice Bachs, which I found perfectly readable - it's abstract treatment of kernel algorithms made it easy to get the \\"big picture\\". Now, with Bach's complete treatment of the design philosophy under my belt, I'm going back to the linux kernel book, and I've found it to be a breeze... even the linux kernel source code itself now makes sense.

Bach's classic \\"The Design of the UNIX Operating System\\" is based on AT&T's System V (Release 2 and 3). To avoid legal issues he had to use pseudo code as well as algorithmic description for explaining a lot of the operating system's underpinnings.While some reader's might have preferred a glance at the related portions of the UNIX source code, others will be glad that MJB used this layer of abstraction to make the subject matter at hand easier accessible and understandable.Even though UNIX has progressed from this snapshot in time, the solid understanding of the internals and underlying concepts that can be gained from this easy to read text will prove helpfull for a better understanding of other UNIX derivatives, too.While this title is a \\"must read\\" for any advanced system administrator, as well as for system programmers, it's generally overkill for the average UNIX end user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of lube","review":"i did not like it as much as i thought i would, it doesnt taste good nore those it last very long even if you use alot still but its worth the money to just use if ure in need of lube for the price its cheap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay book","review":"This story line sounded interesting that is the reason I decided to buy this book. Sadly, the book was not that great.Jordan, needed to grow a spine, she had no backbone whatsoever in this story.Jordan, acts wishy-washy. She can't seem to make up her mind whether she wants to be with Mike or not. I do understand her concerns because he is 10 years younger than she is. But, after a while I wanted her to make up her mind once and for all.At times it seemed like Jordan and Mike had a father-daughter relationship, instead of two people in a romantic relationship.Also, there are too many different subplots in this book.The dialogue is weak. The love scenes are not spicy, and they also lack passion.By the middle of the book, I got really bored, also the rest of the story started to drag. I could not wait until I got to the end of the story.I doubt if I ever will read any books written by Karen White Owens again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A recommended read","review":"The old adage age is just a number has always come with a caveat: age is just a number unless you're an older woman.Most women will be able to identify with Jordan's ambivalence in starting a relationship with a younger man. The May-December romance between Jordan and Michael is very well written and readers get a chance to experience the old fashion art of a man pursuing a woman. Not only does this book give us a look at a heartwarming relationship, but it also guides the reader into the sometimes-harsh reality of today's educational system. Throughout all of the mayhem she deals with during a school day, Jordan has to make a decision that will affect her personal and professional life: does she follow her head or does she follow her heart? Her decision leads to the very essence of the title of the book: Love Changes Everything.

He explains the one to four page code chunks awkwardly in text before or after the code rather than provide useful comments in the code.

Although I think Crews made some accurate social commentary, I don't think he had to use so much sexual imagery to do it. Personally, I had to discipline myself to push through some of the \\"bathtub scenes\\" with Stump and with the \\"mop\\" just to complete the book.

I think if the book had of been longer, going deeper in character building, suspense, romance and all other aspects of the book it maybe could have been better; it just felt rushed and not interesting.I love Sherrilyn's books, always, but this was my least favorite by far. Not sure I'd waste my money on it again, maybe try to find it at the library first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puhleese!","review":"I like the author's style of writing and the wit.. but that is all that carried me through this book. The story line was way too hard to swallow in way too many places! I could write a novel on the inconsistancies in this book. I won't - all I will say is come on!! Shouldn't there be at least a little bit of reality here? Well. There isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"Soft, easy read. Can be finished in no time at all. The characters are far from being rounded and the topic is far fetched. Steele is a army sniper in jail for taking a shot at his superior officer. Syd works for a ghost governement agency that recruits him. What bothered me most about the book and caused me to give it so few stars is the nonchalant attitude about the taking of lives. You have people who are hired to kill, and it's all passed off for the greater good. Not to mention our hero doesn't seem to have a problem about going against his own father. That's just not right."},{"rating":"1","title":"good 'n bad","review":"As with all of Sherrilyn Kenyon's books \\"Bad Attitufe\\" was a great read. I love her characters. The story keeps your interest from the first page to the last, leaving you with a sense of almost loss when finished. I keep looking around for another of her books immediately after I am done reading one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor","review":"I Did Not Recive My Order I Will Never Buy From Amazon.com again THAKS FOR TAKING MY MONEY PAUL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mormonism Unmasked","review":"This is a great book and came to my house in perfect condition. I was really surprised at the condition of the book and the book is also a very good one to read to learn a deep understanding of mormonism. Though the book is a few years old, it still contains very good information."},{"rating":"1","title":"dum dum dum","review":"i think this book is absolutely ridiculous and the writer needs to spend his time doing something better with his life instead of bashing other peoples beliefs. He should focus on helping those of his own religion. He should take some lessons from the members of the church and see how they base their life on building a stronger relationship with jesus christ and heavenly father...what a loser. It seems to me that all those that actually believe this crap are too easily influenced and those members of the church that are swayed by this information are morons. If mormons are christian because they base all their beliefs on christs life and becoming more like him then who is chrisitan... i would truly like someone to tell me what a true christian is because i think this man is severely mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"get real people","review":"I think that those who actually want to learn about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints should read the Book of Mormon. Clearly the people who wrote this book have no idea what they are talking about. I mean, MORMONISM UNMASKED..its like we are involved in espionage or something. The Book of Mormon is not our \\"Bible\\". It is another testament of Jesus Christ. We believe in and love Christ, and we believe in the Bible. We love the lord. I mean, his name is in the official title of our church for crying out loud. This book is clearly based on opinion, and not on real facts. If you wish to learn about the LDS church, call our missionaries. Whoever wrote this book doesn't have a clue what he or she is talking about, and seems to be hell bent on convincing others that they are right and everyone else is wrong. And i don't even have to read the back cover to see that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Better Title: Anti-Mormonism Unmasked","review":"Having read hundreds of books on Mormonism, both by those who are \\"friendly\\" to the LDS faith, and those with an axe to grind, this is probably one of the most shoddy attempts at \\"exposing\\" the LDS church I have seen. Like most faiths, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has issues which one can legitimately question and disagree with. However, this book simply regurgitates the same tired, hackneyed, worn-out accusations which have been levied against the LDS Church since the mid-1800's. And, of course, it is done under the guise of \\"scholarly objectivity.\\"Dr. Roberts is profiting from a publication which seeks to denigrate millions of people whose desire apparently is to better know and understand Christ. That alone merits questioning his professional, ecclesiastical, and financial motives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author seems to have done his homework","review":"R. Philip Roberts gives a very comprehensive review of some of the beliefs of the Mormon church. As a witness to several mormons, I found this book very helpful in understanding the parts of mormonism that the missionaries will NOT tell you. This book is packed with information rather than persuasive arguments, and places an emphasis on witnessing to mormons, not proving them wrong. At the end of each chapter is a very helpful table called \\"Witnessing Points\\" which tells christians what issues to target when speaking to a mormon. Each chapter very clearly (using tables) contrasts the differences between christianity and mormon beliefs. Reading some of the other reviews, I have to clarify that this book was written for christians to understand the reasons why mormonism is a false religion(and definitely not christian!), so I wouldn't expect mormons to have a high opinion of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced, Well Documented","review":"This is a balanced, well-documented comparison between LDS doctrine and evangelical Christianity. It offers an evangelical critique of LDS history and beliefs. Mormons may find many of their assumptions about their history, scripture, and theology strongly challenged. Other readers will find it a helpful tool for talking with their LDS friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmasking the agenda","review":"An example of the tone and agenda of the book:Page 70 suggests that Mormons believe that God the Father had sexual relations with Mary to conceive Jesus. This is salacious, and absolutely incorrect, taken out of context from something a church leader said over 100 years ago in an attempt to paint the church in a sinister light.Mormons believe exactly what the New Testament says about the virgin birth - That Jesus is the Son of God conceived by the Holy Ghost.For those who would like an honest take on Mormon theology I recommendThe Biblical Roots of Mormonism - by Eric Shuster and Charles Sale-Brian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disingenuosness Unmasked","review":"R. Philip Roberts is either an extremely poor researcher, or he is outright dishonest. When I first started reading this book I was recording and correcting all the errors in fact and in logic that I noticed. After the first 20 pages of the book I found myself challenging almost every paragraph. I had wanted to put them in my review, but the amount of corrections would be tantamount to a whole new book, so I gave it up. I finished reading the portions available on Google books, and am convinced that this attack on good Christian Mormons is disingenuous to say the least.I found myself wishing I had the option of rating this book less than one star due to the obvious lack of consideration, by Roberts, for an honest balance of the facts. He is more interested in painting Mormons in as negative light as possible, than giving a true and sincere evaluation.Tisk tisk Mr. Roberts. A good Christian should hold himself to a higher standard than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Pornography for the Easy, Unwary Marks.","review":"The uninitiated lap up this pseudo-scholarship. Take any issue you find in this book, and conduct your own objective research, not aiming towards proving it true or false; and you will find every time with this author it is sometimes a gross perversion of truth, and other times it is a deliberate lie.If you want real scholarship, read Mormonism, by Edward Watson. 98% of his reference are from non-Mormon scholars."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RIGHT","review":"It saddens me to think that a lot of people tend to think of anti-mormon lit to be true, when in fact it is not. jesus christ did not speak against any person. people did to him. how can a person just read false doctrine, when in fact they should go to the actual church's website to find out more information. if a person was just to find out all about the LDS church, they will truly find out that it is the true church. People who write anti lit should be shamed, since a lot of things are not true. check out the church's website for all those who are interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such an un-christian book","review":"This is like reading a book about George Bush that John Kerry wrote. It is completley unprofessional and biased. It is extremley one sided. It should have views from active Mormons and the disgruntled ex-Mormons alike. It is just your basic run of the mill Anti-Mormon material. Nothing new here, just the same anti-mormon material that's been around for years.Instead of tearing down a church, the author should write a book on why his beliefs are so great and why we should be following him. This book would recieve a failing grade in any university for it's terrible one-sideness. If you are getting information from professors from \\"Christian\\" churches, then you should also get information from \\"Mormon\\" professors and leaders. Such an un-christian book to attack another faith like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mormonisim unmasked: confronting the Contradictions between","review":"This books begins as though the authors liked Mormons, but it gets worse. They wnat you to believe that they have a vast amount of contradictions, and that the bible dosen't. The bible is full of verses that are contradictory of each other. The typical response of people such as these authors is; The bible is true no matter what and you are taking things out of context. Somethings these authors do quite often"},{"rating":"2","title":"They've been Unmasked ... now what should we be doing ?","review":"This is another important book for those who have Mormon friends and/or family. These good people need to hear the truth, not just what their leaders have convinced them is the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"When 'Christians' act like this...","review":"As a student of Religious Studies, I think it is incredible that there are Christians who are shocked that there are actually people who don't believe in God or Jesus. When you see 'true Christians' write books like this- it is totally understandable. Oh well, Christianity has always had a history of intolerance, dating back to the fights between of the 'proto-orthodox' Christians and the 'gnostic' Christians of 100+ A.D. The Mormon Church's formal name is The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day Saints. Can you be anymore Christian?It's hard to convince atheists that you have something to offer when you squabble over who gets to be in the club. At least Mormons don't stoop so low to write books about why everyone else is absolutly wrong. (Don't believe me- try finding one here at Amazon!)When 'Christians' act like this, maybe it is the best interest of Mormons not to be included among them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought we were past this stuff","review":"In today's world of political correctness, it surprises me that people still get away with writing books bad-mouthing other religions. I doubt the PC crowd would allow \\"Judaism unmasked\\" or \\"Islam unmasked\\" to be published without labeling the authors anti-Semitic or narrow minded racists. It is truly sad that such hate be propagated in the name of Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Wolters","review":"Richard Wolters is on of my favorite Bird Dog trainers.

Mr Woltors is just about spot on with the timing of the the training. My dogs have seemed to progress just as he describes. If you want a hunting dog you can be proud of, it is the way to go. Let's put it this way, because of my dogs I have been invited to hunt at some nice clubs, including having other club members leaving their dogs home. Blow the whistle and the dog stops, yes right on top of a running bird. It is amazing to see and it works. I can assure you if you will follow the process, you too will achieve these results. I am in no way benefiting from this review, just giving you my honest feedback, from experience! Shock collars on a labrador or golden are for lazy people who are not willing to put in the time to socialize their dog. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic start for a puppy","review":"I liked this book to a cetain extent. I think this is a good book for someone who doesn't know a lot about a hunting dog. It's geared more towards starting with a puppy, but can be used with an older dog. I'd read it before I got the puppy so you know what to expect. It's a little light on specifics, but there are some there. Don't get too caught up with the time line because all dogs are different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working so far,pup 5 months old","review":"ongoing review bought book on advice off aqaintaince (w\\\\dog) she (dog) seems to be responding well to training regimen outlined in book, however do not be totally frusterated by lack of sucess tomorrow you may think your dog has turrned into Ren1010"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for those just starting out","review":"This book along with \\" Water Dog\\" will provide the beginnig trainer everything needed to have a good hunting dog for a finished product.

Robert Lawson's book is a documentary on success and a foundation for his accent as a national motivational speaker and featured resource in Black Enterprise Magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and boring","review":"After reading Dragonmaster, I was appalled to find this writer, Chris Bunch, had the audacity to write more than this one book. His characters are neither likable on unlikable, the writing over all is trite and lacking and disjointed. As to magic, it seems as though he threw it in as an afterthought as in, \\"oh yeah, I'm writing a fantasy novel. There should be magic!\\" His descriptions are simply not there from the character of the weather to the content of the battle grounds. In one scene, the main character sees an enemy soldier standing over three of his fellow soldiers and kills the enemy soldier. No description of the action, no reaction from the enemy soldier as if he's just standing there waiting to be killed by the main character. All in all, if you're thinking about buying this book, don't and move on to better fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe ok for YA, but disappointing","review":"I'd read some of Bunch's work before - mainly, his trilogy Seer King / Demon King / Warrior King - and it was pretty good, so I expected this to be at least on a similar level. Unfortunately, it's not. Maybe if you have only read children's books before taking this on, it would be a good read, but if you've read very much quality fantasy at all, this is a very trite read. As others have noted, characterization is thin, and the prose is competent but very pedestrian. It almost feels like an outline that with a little more imagination and flair would have been a pretty fun read. I actually didn't even expect this to be anything but a light and fun read going in, but it's not even that - it's just limp, and I had to force myself to finish. It's easy reading though, so at least it went fairly quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been...but wasn't nearly close enough..","review":"Well, what to say...I didn't last long with this book...put it down after page 30.I was expected to be transported into another world, to be introduced to an amazing character/s, and to travel with those characters through their trials and tribulations..

The author does a very poor job of making you care about what happens to the characters, the writing style is boring, and my god, I've never seen so many run-on, comma-filled sentences in my life. The first sentence of the book is an entire paragraph with something like 20 commas in it. Ridiculous.

The mixing is about the same. Every Second Counts does not compare to this album. This defines their sound and original composure. They kinda varied off into commonville with the release of Every Second counts, but this release, is distorted enough to not get annoying and crafted beautifully. The pop nature of Plain white t's is becoming popular and this album is one of the contenders in that category. And to set the record straight, there is only one acoustic number on here and it is Hey There Delilah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never gets old!","review":"I had never heard of the Plain Whites T's until I listened to \\"Take Me Away\\" on Fuse.

However, these headphones fall far short. First off, unless you have a small head, I don't see how they can fit a person properly (I'm a hat size 7 3/8, large, I know, but there are bigger). Even with the longest band, they pulled uncomfortably. The actual earpiece/over the ear loop isn't very flexible either. Then, the range (advertised at 10 METERS) is way overestimated. I could only get to about 8 FEET with constant sound. At 10 FEET, I got drop outs. The sound itself wasn't bad, although at soft moments, you could hear a slight hiss. Overall, if I could give this thing ZERO stars, I would.

If you like a diversity of music, you will enjoy this. The band members play Far East music on traditional instruments, most of which I had never seen or heard before. They are incredibly talented and fun to watch perform. Usually I am not fond of oriental music, but this DVD had me fascinated and glued to watching it. The cover alone is of interest, with them posing standing in shallow water with a chair behind playing their instruments - and other scenes of them in performance. They are incredible musicians!"},{"rating":"1","title":"busoni & his legacy","review":"While the music is great, the performer was great, I was very disappointed in the poorest of poor sound quality.

The amazing guitar work and the air that it brought was still very strong even after 10 years. I highly recommend it. And the comment about his work being \\"rural but not country\\" is very right.

We've tried a few other things that just didn't help much. I saw these caps in the past but thought 12 bucks (with shipping) was way too much to spend on a bit of plastic.

The presentation is perhaps that of an overdue term paper at three a.m., when the un-numbered pages have collapsed into a pile on the floor.The arrogant mannerisms, cliches and hackneyed phrases, ideosyncratic abbreviations, and lack of linear structure make it a book that, once you put it down, is hard to pick up again.I bought this book hoping to bring away from it some fresh perspectives on infinity, to benefit the calculus students I am teaching. I left it empty-handed."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a teacher I am vastly disappointed","review":"After seeing the rave reviews, I was planning on using this book in one of my courses. So I went out and bought a copy.The book performs a disservice to the field of mathematics, and it should be removed from the shelves. It takes beautiful concepts, layers them under long, convoluted sentences which obscure the majesty of the subject, and then poses as a scholarly work via the use of ludicrous, insincere footnotes. As I waded through the muck, I kept asking myself, \\"has culture really declined this far that people have no conscience?\\" I'm trying to teach my students the beauty of truth, and here an author, his editors, and the publisher are working against me. I might be outnumbered, but this book will not be used in my classroom.Who are the people writing the rave reviews? Do they have a financial stake in how well this book does? They must, as the only reason to try and sell this book would be money."},{"rating":"1","title":"(null set)","review":"If Wallace were only as smart as he thinks he is . . . I fear this attempt by \\"D.F.W.\\" at mathematics only highlights his ability to fog some of the readers with cute wordsmithing; to give still others the notion that \\"gee, aren't we smart - just look at the \\"math\\" we're doing here\\"; he doesn't shed much light on Cantor, or infinity. This is a topic that cannot be given a glossed-over treatment - I'm surprised Norton went ahead with it. So what's next from Wallace - a \\"puff - piece\\" on string theory?"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, awful, awful","review":"The author's worst tendencies are on display here. He takes a simple, elegant subject and reduces it to a disorganized mess. Practically unreadable, for both the layperson and mathematician alike.I could carve a better book out of a banana."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth Comes Out","review":"I was always perplexed by the rave reviews for mediocre books, but I recently read in THE NEW YORK TIMES that the author's friends have been writing them in order to help sell the lackluster tomes.This book is awful. It makes no sense. It rambles. Wallace is no mathematician, but rather than admitting his resounding ignorance, he hides it behind footnotes and cutesy gimmickery. There are hundreds, if not thousands of better math books such as Prime Obession and A New Kind of Science."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Sorry if this book is an affront to some \\"Harvard\\" scholars and \\"PhD physicists\\" (or those that pretend to be the above) but for people in the real word, alas I am a lowly engineer, this book is a lot of FUN TO READ. It could even encourage some readers to want to learn more about the topic. I don't understand why some math and science professionals are always insulted when non-science writers, especially one as talented as David Foster Wallace, try their hand at writing on math and science. Wallace doesn't pretend to be an \\"expert\\" but he knows how to keep us interested and, yes, sometimes inspire us. He provides a detailed bibiliography for those who want to learn more. Best popular math book I've read since Paul Hoffman's, The Man Who Loved Only Numbers and David Ruelle's, Chance and Chaos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, Bad Book","review":"When DFW isn't using undefined acronyms, or rubbing his absurdly large vocabulary in your face, the book achieves what I believe to be its goal, that is, to explain the origins and problems associated with infinity. The puzzles he uses are very interesting and provide a good look into the problems the notion of infinite can put forth.However, the book is unneccesarily complicated and the meaning of many words/phrases/ideas continue to be used throughout the book without explaination. The book attemps to be accessable to \\"readers who do not have pro-grade technical backgrounds\\" but fails (at least for me) considering I was often confused although I had taken calc 1 in high school a year before reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and with some serious error(s)","review":"I suppose this might just be his style of writing but I just can't stand it. Having read 9 other math related books over the past month, this was a huge disappointment. He uses all sorts of acronyms and idiosyncrasies that just go too far. I got half way through it and then decided to skim seeing if I could find anything that caught my eye. Thinking maybe his discussion of the Continuum Hypothesis should be good, I read that. Of course, he misstated it, confusing which equality was known and which was hypothesized. This doesn't seem huge, but its just silly that in a book about infinity, DFW states one of the most important undecidable hypotheses in all of math incorrectly and actually presents something that is easily provable (c=2^N0). Why not just one star? He did get me to read 100 pages..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unimpressive look at Infinity","review":"I was certainly looking forward to reading this book. While I haven't read any of the other books written by this author; his reputation preceeds him. Unfortunately, I was wholly unimpressed by his approach.I find the writing style very unnatural for mathematics. It can be difficult to follow the long, rambling sentences with his strange turns of phrase. While I can appreciate that this is modern writing, the style is inappropriate for the subject. Mathematics must be presented clearly and accurately. I left the book thinking that the author didn't understand the subject very well himself.It's an interesting topic and therefore there is something to be gained here. Sadly, there are much better alternatives to this one. If you have a mathematical background the book may irritate you with it's style. A pity though, it is a wonderfully rich and interesting subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Standard For Incompetent Pop-Sci Books","review":"This book is incomprehnesible, incomplete, and incoherent. I bought it, then returned it the next day. Never mind your pedigree; you will find that what this book lacks in substance it does not make up for with structure. It's as if David Foster Wallace went on a few hundred page journey regarding his misconceptions of infinity, and somebody decided to publish and promote it under the guise of a \\"pop-sci\\" book. This book does nothing to popularize science and math, and everything to desecrate the exalted fields. Truly, David Foster Wallace should stick to what he knows best; pomo ponzi schemes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Unacceptable","review":"As a librarian working in a Univeristy scince library, I had to return this book. I cannot let tax and tuition dollars support this dumbed-down farce propagated by greedy pomo publishers. I can remember the day when such books would never have made it past WWW Norton's editors, but alas, the new breed was raised on MTV.Infinity is infinity is infinity, and its glory remains untouched by this trifling, ludicrous, incompitent, meandering, and fundamentally dishonest effort. Visit your library, or my library, and read the books on mathematics penned by articulate mathematicians--there are plenty of them. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst science writing I've seen","review":"Wallace should enroll in a writing class, or read other works of science writing, such as Charles Siefe's \\"Zero: the biography of a dangerous idea,\\" which covers much of the same ground. This book does contain a lot of information, but you need a clothespin on your nose to wade through page after page of bad (insecure, tendentious, immature) writing. Why did the publisher even print this pathetic work of supposed \\"pop\\" science? I plan to ask Amazon to let me return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"Wallace's obsessively detailed and digressive style makes this book unreadable. His work in general to me has the tone of an obsessive-compulsive Richard Linklater. I suspect he did not choose his style (which is common to the few things of his I've read) as much as it chose him. Looking back on Wallace's work after his suicide, it is tempting to see his style as a symptom of a troubled mind, though that is pure speculation. In any event, this book obscures its topic rather than revealing it.

I don't have an extensive math background, while he (clearly) does, but I think we both liked it equally.The book is both theory and history and, through the use of footnotes allows you to tailor the information you're receiving to make it either more elite, more basic, or just more specific.

As a student, the number of Kodansha books that I can afford to keep on my shelves is quite limited; and in retrospect, this particular dictionary was a waste of money. The vocabulary is kept pretty small in order to make space for a more detailed description of each Kanji. This doesn't, however, present us with any real information that could not be obtained through other dicitonaries of a higher vocabulary. I would highly suggest instead the KODANSHA ESSENTIAL KANJI DICTIONARY, which I would personally not be able to live without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful book for the clueless","review":"I should state that I'm not learning Japanese.

It covers only the most common Kanji, no more than about 2200. So, if you're looking for a complete dictionary, you should definitely look somewhere else.If you're a student that has just started learning the language, anyway, this dictionary is nothing less than perfect. It covers every kanji you'll need to know, giving a good description of every kanji (common meanings, stroke order, etc.). The format is pretty good, too.What I love the most, anyway, it's the SKIP system. With it, you'll be able to find in no time any kanji, without even knowing its pronunciation!Overall, I strongly recommand the purchase of this dictionary to any beginner student of Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful!","review":"Good dictionary, just came in today^^.

It is quite easy to use, and the definitions are clear. My few nitpicking problems with the dictionary are: (1) I'm actually not a big fan of the \\"skip\\" system; while it is easy to use initially, I think that in the long run it is probably better to practice looking for radicals or counting strokes, so you can use other dictionaries. (2) Many kanji and compounds are missing (this is true of any small, or beginners', dictionary, though. (3) I wish that the readings were given in kana. As nearly all English kanji dictionaries give readings in romaji, I suspect that I am in a small minority here, though.Overall, a good dictionary for beginners (like me). You will certainly want a more comprehensive dictionary if you keep studying Japanese, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not intuitive search.","review":"From my point of view, this dictionary system of searching for a kanji -which is based on so called \\"kanji patterns\\"- is more arbitrary or less intuitive than the traditional system. For example, I miss a simple feature which is an index of kanji by number of strokes, which is the last resort and simplest way to look for a kanji when one does not find it other way, so that I think that any kanji dictionary would better have an index by number of strokes.

This novel is very wordy and (overly) researched and it takes a long time before you get into any of the action. As someone with very little experience/knowledge in the art business, I could not quite grasp the significance of the art in the novel nor could I really put myself into Harry's (the protagonist) situation.From what I've read, The Color of Night is a story of art dealer Harry Shroud and the scandal around the death of his wife, his new love Mara, and his art business.If you are in the art business or enjoy stories about art, perhaps you will enjoy this novel and it's depth. As for me, I could not get myself into this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is wordy and rambling in style.","review":"This book is laborious reading.

I bought it on a whim after reading the flap, and thought it would be enjoyable spy/thriller/mystery novel...I was wrong.This book was too wordy. It could have been 200 pages shorter, and still managed to tell the story sufficiently. What's more, when I bought the book I did not realize that a specific knowledge of fine art and European geography were prerequisists for comprehending (and enjoying) this book.It was my impression that Harry Strand, former US spy turned art dealer, would dabble with art as a \\"tickler\\" to keep the reader interested; however, what I came to realize was that a detailed knowledge of art was needed to simply follow along. I found myself rolling my eyes and losing my composure all too often.I agree with many of my fellow readers that \\"Color of Night\\" was a laborous read, and would caution people that this book may not be for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big step back","review":"Having read most of his earlier books, I was quite disappointed by this effort.

The author has no grasp of subtlety, grammar, nuance or vocabulary. The dating scenarios are, a few times, mildly amusing, but the writing stifles any potential humour. The advice (read: platitudes) is not only cliched, but regressive, although if you are looking for dating advice from a woman who handles her life the way the author claims she does in this book, you are getting what you deserve.

I found this one day while walking in Manhattan at a little unorganized and sparatic overflowed bookstore. It was a chance purchase I made in under a minute and for 99 cents! incredible! I found at first that I was so comforted by other peoples misfortune that not only reminded me of my own- but gave ma a little humor to my own fears of being too picky, unwilling, or too nervous to allow myself to love.This is a book about the different outlooks people have on what can give them love. It is a true heart tugger from the first page but it keeps you laughin every second. I promise you will not want to miss this book! I chose to ignore my finals for 3 days while I finished reading this book!! it was too good to put down and kept me inspired far past the last page... I have reread it three times since and I have been hopeful to find another book by the same author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I was excited to get this book. I thought it would be a funny cute look at matchmaking but it wasn't. It mainly showcased alot of insecure, desperate clients and a picky matchmaker who says up front she isn't going to be a matchmaker for unattractive awkward people who haven't had a date in years. She instead chooses wealthy, neurotic, superficial new yorkers who order dates from her the same way you'd order a pizza. I felt as though everyone in the book including the writer had no depth or personality and that their biggest problem wasn't not being able to find a mate. It was not understanding what life is really all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Bridget Jones Diary!","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book. The matchmaker, the main character is one of my favourite heroines of all time- she is funny, and sexy yet real and crazy all at once. She figured out how to balance making fun of people and herself with making people feel invited into her world. I thought the author would be the dater extraordinaire, she's not. She has foibles like everyone else. And she deals with her clients, the other characters in the book with such genuineness and love, its truly great! If you are looking for a plane read or a train read or a before bed read, this is it! It's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cartoon-Skimpy DVD","review":"I love Chowder. but this is too little content for the price.This DVD does not contain half of Season 1.

The description above says 10 episodes when it is actually ten cartoons. The widescreen picture is beautiful, and the cartoons are grouped into two cartoon episodes (just like on TV) so that you get to see all of the clever and funny openings and closing credits.

Ms Brashear's unique talent at creating troubled characters is showcased when Boone and Maddie struggle to learn that each is the other half of their whole.

I chatted with them a bunch and found out that they were releasing a new album (The Process of Endtime), so I picked it up. I thought it was a good release, but it was very lacking in serveral ways (the drums for instance/repetitiveness), but with what The Process of Endtime lacked For all our Sins made up for.

There are tracks whose lyrics feel sincere, not crafty, in their quirkiness, which makes her more interesting and less \\"delicate poetess-y\\" than similar-sounding artists, like Rachel Loshak maybe; and then there are other tracks that are straightforward and beautiful (e.g., \\"All My Stars Aligned\\" -- my favorite, for now). And she can sing. Which is often not something you get in this genre. Having been listening to Scout Niblett and Joanna Newsom for my feminine fare, St. Vincent is a welcome addition indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll pile on","review":"Dynamite for a first effort, she sounds like a mix of Tori Amos, Bjork and Joni Mitchell if I was forced to say something like that. Everything sounds great, she has a good ear and fine songwriting instincts to go along with her voice and musicianship. I don't like everything, she gets too cool chanteuse in places for my taste, like the first part of \\"Human\\" (which switches gears and gets neat at the end). \\"What Me Worry\\" edges into territory I don't like as well. I'll look forward to the next, kind of hopes she gets a little edgier and less jazzy, it would be really cool to hear what she sounded like with a techno edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Clark (St. Vincent) I want you to Marry Me (my name is John!)","review":"This album is my instant new favorite. All of the songs are like little scenes that play out in my head when I hear them. Her lyrics are smart and funny. Her voice is wonderful. And she uses all of her instruments (and voice) in clever ways...shows just how talented she is. I love how her voice just sort of calmly floats through the songs, which are often rather complex and energetic rhythms and melodies. Sometimes her voice is almost hip hopping through the song (without at all taking on a rap persona).The weird part for me is that after decades of buying records and CD's, this \\"album\\" is one of the first download-only purchases I have ever made. I MISS looking through art work, reading lyrics, and wondering who all of those people are that are being credited and thanked in the notes. iPods and Clouds are cool concepts but mp3's SUCK.

These youngsters didn't get the commercial success they deserved, but this was definately a ground breaking freshman effort.Their clever lyrics and infusion of comedy over racist samples, was as innovative as it gets.

If you are interested in learning about the IMAP protocol, this is the book, if you are interested in setting up Cyrus - save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light hearted view of the Kennedy sister-in-laws","review":"Jackie Ethel Joan is a light-hearted view of the three Kennedy sister-in-laws, their relationship with each other and the Kennedy family. The book also touches upon their roles in the political realm of the Kennedy world. This book is an entertaining read, but disappointing as a biography. The book is written in a very easy to understand and fun manner, yet the book has a slightly tabloid angle to it. While the book is titled \\"Jackie Ethel Joan\\" much more attention is focused toward Jackie than Ethel and Joan. Yet this is a good introduction to Ethel and Joan Kennedy's lives and their relationship to the rest of the Kennedy family. In all this book was an amusing and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Sad!","review":"I have read a lot about this book, and thought I knew what it was about --- basically, I did. But what I didn't know was that it was so very sad. I cried many times along the way: when JFK died, when Bobby died, Joan's miscarriage, Jackie's still-birth, Ethel's grief and on and on ... Such tragic lives these three had. Yet, at the end I was not the least bit depressed, but rather sort of uplifted by the whole experience, this journey the author took me on. It was wonderful to read the way these women survived it all, and the author brought it all home with just the last few lines of the book (which I won't give away here.) Love them or hate them, you have to respect the Kennedys. Love these kinds of historical/biography/show biz books, or hate them ... you won't be able to put this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"I found the insight into the Kennedy family dynamics interesting. They've been revered, deified, and maligned over the years and most of the talk has been about the men or Jackie. This book goes behind the scenes into the competition, jealousies and insecurities among the women who married into Camelot. It's a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Women as seen by the National Enquirer","review":"As these three women have been historical figures for more than 50 years, any material on them is of great interest to many. Taken in parts, \\"Jackie, Ethel and Joan: Women of Camelot\\" seems to provide a window into Kennedy personal lives. But the book is written with a degree of familiarity I doubt the author had in reality. I always question quoting long conversations from 40+ years ago, especially when the author wasn't there, and the people involved have died so can no longer rebut. His actual subject seems to be \\"famous women whose husbands cheat\\". While I found the book interesting, by the time I'd finished it, I questioned Taraborrelli's chosen slant. He concentrated on sleaze at the expense of history. These women lead very interesting lives, but relatively little of that is included here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"I think this was a good book and I'm only 11 years old and I liked it. The reason I chosed to read this book is because I like the Kennedy family and I want to learn alot about them. Next time in school if you have to do a report on a famouse family or person I will do them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a biography. It's fiction.","review":"Or maybe it's plagerism. I'm not quite sure which. But at any rate, Taraborelli has little integrity as a biographer. Yes, this book is entertaining. But it quotes detailed conversations neither the author nor his \\"sources\\" (many of whom are other tabloid writers or Kennedy hangers on) could have possibly known. Now for the theft -- I read Leamer's THE KENNEDY WOMEN, and recognized much of it here. So while this book is indeed a fun read, please don't take it seriously. I would have respected this entire endeavor more if it didn't pretend to be more than it was. Maybe, if it's ever reissued, the cover can be of Joan in a low bodice dress being ravaged by Teddy. Because that's all this book is -- a silly, fun, historical romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"more cheap bunk about the Kennedys.","review":"This book is a waste of time and money. The money I spent to buy it and the time wasted in reading this rehash of old stories and new made up episodes in the life of the Kennedys. Kitty Kelly does it better and kitty litter is all this one is good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of old, stale gossip with invented & banal dialogue","review":"This book is a tired and stale rehash of the Kennedy saga - filled with unsubstantiated gossip,trite (and ficticious) dialogue and little in the way of good writing, strong research or insight. This is cheesy fan magazine stuff.

Had writing on the inside. Not what I had really wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"This book is a complete rehash. So what if the author quotes a lot of sources? The number of pages devoted to sources doesn't matter if the sources he used were lame sources, and a lot of them were. My favorite: the discredited secret service agents. How could the author presume to know the precise dialog spoken in a private conversation between Jackie and Bobby? Rather than reading this fanciful compilation of other books, your time would be better spent reading the other books,especially those by John Davis, a relative of Jackie's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I Read It","review":"The biggest criticism about this book seems to be the dialogue between the characters. But anyone who reads modern day biography knows that this is a technique employed by writers these days, to have people conversing rather than have them just quoted as having said what one person said to another. I'm fine with it. I think it creates an intimacy that is interesting. I respect this author's research, and his history of books. So I think to dismiss this book is a mistake. I read it with an open mind and loved it. It's all so emotional and real. I couldn't believe what these women went through, and was so happy that they overcame it. The book was well-researched and thorough. I'm glad I read it, and I know I'll read the paperback edition just to have the experience once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here....","review":"I haven't read many books on the Kennedys, but there was little new and enlightening in this one. Aside from a few tidbits, much of this stuff has been rehashed in previous magazines, articles and books. This book was at its worst when the author tried to recreate conversations between the women and pass it off as actual truth. Some of the \\"supposed\\" conversations were almost laughable in their simplicity. A second-grader could have done a better job with the dialogue. Anyway, how does this author claim to know what happened during a private conversation between two people without any witnesses? Don't buy this book - if you really must read it, take it out of the library or borrow it from someone. It's much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and Overpriced","review":"I have read any number of biographies about the Kennedys'and I found that this book simply rehashes information already written about them. I also found many inaccuracies. Having read the author's biography of Diana Ross, which I enjoyed very much, I was quite disappointed with this book. A better read on the topic of the Kennedy women is Laurence Leamer's The Kennedy Women.\\" Wait for the paperback version if you really must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the book to get to second-hand book shops","review":"I saw this in our local bookstore for something like 399 Philippine pesos and I waited for five years to get it for a mere 20 pesos at a second-hand book shop. It was worth the wait because the book is a rehash of every other Kennedy biography. I have read plenty of Kennedy bios and when I read this book, I could practically identify from which book the information came from! The conversations Taraborrelli details here are so fake, so cloying. I find it unbearable when biographers \\"imagine\\" conversations. The only redeeming factor is that Jackie, Ethel and Joan are presented in a generally realistic light. Obviously the biographer tried to be unbiased. But other than that, this book is the cheapest way to go through other well-written Kennedy bios (such as the one by Collier and Horowitz)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting in a tabloid way","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book because I am fascinated by that time in our history and with Jackie Kennedy. I found this book to have an interesting point-of-view on all three Kennedy women. Ethel seemed to be easily envious or jealous but loyal and loving of her family. Jackie seemed to be snobby with a mind of her own, but again a deep loyalty for her family especially her immediate family. Joan seemed to be sad and a 'door mat' until she grew much older. She seemed to put up with the most crap and lost the most in return. I have no idea if any of what I read was accurate or not, but I liked reading it regardless. It was fun and fast in a very tabloid sort of way. If you're interested in the Kennedy women, then you'll probably like this book. The movie that was made based on this book is also pretty good, but naturally the book is by far better with more details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job!","review":"Saw this author on \\"Later Today\\" and liked him enough to go and buy a book about these women I really have admired. I haven't finished it yet, half way through, but can say, yes, this is a good job! I find it totally entertaining, and also historically relevant. I read the Source Notes first, as I do all bios, so that I can determine what kind of research went into what I am about to read. With this book, plenty of it... Joan Kennedy really steals your heart away in this book, and the author paints a sympathetic picture of Jackie and Ethel, too. I think there are plenty of reasons to buy this book and read it all the way through, not the least of which is that the subject of the wives has never been done before. And it's about time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Kennedy? HA, more like Jackie Collins or Susann.","review":"What a load of garbage this book is...reshashed gossip, unsubstantiated rumors, ficticious dialogue, etc. The author has literally made up dialogue that he could never have found sources for and passed it of as what...history? biography? pyscological insight? Fooey! It's like the worst type of bad fiction imaginable. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING","review":"I started this book not expecting much. But, before I knew it I was drawn in by the way the author brought these three women to life. They became real people, with real feelings and problems just like the rest of us; not just distant celebrities that you read about in magazines. I thought the author's use of a lot of details was absorbing--I felt as though I was there. I found I couldn't put the book down once I started. Reading this book has really re-sparked my interest in the entire Kennedy family, particulary, J.F.K. and his wife Jackie, and their children. His assassination is still a mystery, and I look foward to reading other books about this tragic period in our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Book","review":"There wasn't one moment when I was bored with this book. Anyone who thinks the author made up dialogue doesn't read very carefully. It's all clear to me where it came from. Try reading the Source Notes. Why does a book -- like the new David Geffen bio -- have to trash someone in order to be appreciated. The author here has given three respectful views of three wonderful women. How is that gossip? I would like to read more books like this one about people, books that are fair and honest and also interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"After reading many articles on the Kennedy's throughout the years I really found nothing new in this book.

However, especially with Jackie's oral history published, you can see how very historically inaccurate it is. If you want any semblance of facts, this isn't the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful insights!","review":"This book makes you FEEL the emotions of these three women. The jealosy and animosity, the heartaches they share, their husbands infidelities...I loved the photo's and only wished there were more!

J Randy Taraborrelli is an author that I enjoy reading and appears to be the majority, if not all, factual information that he provides. This book starts from the very beginning, prior to marriages and how they 'meshed' with one another. It also showed that no matter their conflicts at any given time, they were always there for each other and very supportive This group of sisters-n-laws had no choice but to be resilient and strong, and they were. I recommend to anyone who is interested in the Kennedy family, especially the women of Camelot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie, Ethel, Joan: Women of Camelot","review":"Prior to reading this book, I knew quite a bit about Jackie and Ethel.

I searched for some solo work by their guitar player, Ernie Isley, and found this CD. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it a lot except one song. It has the feel of the 1970s but still works today. There are plenty of guitar solos and Ernie, who does all the singing and instrumentation, did a great job. I would recommend if you like the style after listening to music samples for this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"solo spotlight","review":"Listening to the songs on this very impressive solo album, you get the feeling that Ernie was enjoying himself thoroughly; stepping out on his own and making music that he felt comfortable with. The openiing track, \\"Song for the Muses\\" still sounds fresh and vibrant two decades after it was recorded. I like Ernie's vocals on here, and the familiar sounds of his electric guitar still bring a smile. Ernie doesn't try and do anything radically different from what he was doing with the Isley Brothers, yet don't expect a funk workout either. Thankfully, he doesn't try to experiement and dabble into any heavy metal, blues, or country sounds, sticking to what he knows and does so well.

I sat down with a hot cup of coffee and a nice warm quilt and let this book take me to the inhospitable Antarctica where scientists and explorers endure incredible hardships while on their personal quests. The scientists just want to survive and to be able to share their discovery of what they found in a lake deep beneath the ice. The explorer wants the glory of completing his trek on foot across Antarctica, and he is willing to do anything and sacrifice everyone to finish his journey. I found it incredibably entertaining to the point I was up till the wee hours of the morning telling myself I'll just read one more chapter before going to bed, again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie Heaven","review":"The Zombies in True Stereo--what a treat!

James has some wonderful books available and while they don't always tell you actually how to do the specific training (there are books out there that actually do, by the way), you know, in a lot of ways, that's what shamanism is all about, working with the edge or periphery of things, in other words, figuring the levels of grayness out for youself. Most importantly, when reading any of his entertaining books, it's kind of neat to realize that his concepts are indeed accurate. So I say, read this book, enjoy it, let your mind wander, and who knows, with the right training, you just might find yourself in Shambhala someday.

The Tibetan monks in this tale talk a strange new age lingo invented by the author, who appears never to have encountered real Tibetans, Tibetan Buddhist teachings, or the Kalachakra Tantra which is the source of Shambhala teachings. I also doubt that he has ever encountered the Tibetan language, given the confusion he makes between transliteration and spoken Tibetan. If you would like to understand the relevance of Shambhala in our age, I would suggest starting with \\"Shambhala, the Sacred Path of the Warrior\\" by Trungpa.

It's been a while since I read the first two, and the vague references in this book to events which occurred in the first could not be recollected.Redfield's agenda was apparent throughout, and he beat a dead Dakini to death restating the ingredients of each \\"extension\\" with great frequency. The book lacked any depth of characters or descriptions, and responses to events were incredulous. . .

But having some experience with Shambala (note spelling), decided to give The Secret of Shambhala a try. Sorry, but it seems to me to be made up partly of some genuine worthwhile knowledge (which, however, is pretty common knowledge anyway)and partly--or mostly--of a humonguous bunch of buzzwords and buzz concepts--a lot of New Age-type stuff. A very thin read, and Redfield's style is basic English, which I suspect is used to facilitate quick translation in \\"the world's languages,\\" but which I find most offputting in what purports (I think) to be a serious work.

Both books recommend a common sense (and increasingly common) approach to investing that stresses the importance of long-term horizons, low expenses, and minimal turnover. The difference is that Bogle cloaks his \\"thesis\\" in so much jargon and gobbledy-gook that it often takes a couple readings just to figure out what he's trying to say. He's kidding himself if he thinks Main Street USA is going to get through this book. If his intent was to shake up American complacency a la Thomas Paine, I'm afraid he's failed miserably.By the way, the book's jacket and first few pages are loaded with hyperactive rave reviews from some Big Names in the investment field.

As a CPA and MBA and CFP to boot I have spent a fair amount of time and effort trying to \\"beat the market\\" only to learn that matching the market is the best strategy for the long haul. Had I simply invested according to his precepts I would have parlayed a lot more money with a lot less effort. It IS a hard book to read for those not used to technical terms.

Mr. Bogle's book reads like literature and as you absorb his thoughts it becomes clear he's speaking to you as a true friend and has your best interests at heart. I was thoroughly entertained just reading his chapter on bonds of all things. It caused me to jump out of my chair and check my accounts. I've been investing for 18 years and those 23 pages saved me $300/year immediately. Bogle slices and dices the market every which way and takes you to the clear conclusion that you're being scammed by much of the fund industry.

I'm just now breaking into the index fund's conceptual spawn, the ETF.One complaint: the book is indeed repetitive.

I agree with the person who said they thought the reviews were fake...no one in their right mind would say this was great, funny etc. If you're looking for something entertaining that's a great read pick up My Horizontal Life...it was written by a comedian about her sex life and is hilarious.

These 3 songs are worth the price of admission. The rest of the album isn't too bad, but pretty mediocre. And, of course, \\"Passion\\" is the hit single here, which is special in itself since it doesn't sound anything like Rod has ever done before or since. I still think that the album is VERY good.

The bluesy bridge says it all. Nine Houses is a 7 minute spiritual feast. It's Gonna Come Down On You has their trademark melancholy underpinning. The amusing Dust On My Saddle harkens back to Marty Robbins. Jessica is a sacharine wedding note. S&C's critics don't like sweet songs. S&C's critics don't like any soft rock.

The book was about a boy named Daniel whose father fought in the Revolutionary War and was granted soldiers notes which could be exchanged for cash and buy his family's freedom from slavery. But Daniel's father died and left the notes with Daniel and his mom. The book was about Daniel trying to get these notes to Congress and exchange these for money.

Now I am traveling with my family including two kids and IO thought I might want to go in a different direction. I was attracted to the DK guides because of the high quality glossy photos - thinking that this was a good way to have the whole family see what was ahead in order to make good decisions for everyone. On the plus side the driving maps were very good and quite helpful. But overall, for a family on the move the book was lacking. Yes, the photos are great and got everyone psyched about possible destinations, but in terms of actual information for museums, lodging, restaurants and the like, the book was severely lacking. Also the information given on any particular site was very basic and simplistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"angry","review":"I HAVE NOT RECEIVE IT YET ,THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU ASK FOR REVIEW ..HOW ON EARTH CAN I REVIEW A LOST SHIPPMENT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but useless","review":"This book is full of pretty pictures but is quite useless as a guide for independent travelers. It doesn't have any information on how to get from one place to another, the hours of operations of museums/buses/trains, or any price ranges. The maps are detailed in 2 block radius, but it's impossible to understand how to link the mini-maps to get a comprehensive picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"These books are nice to look at, but offer very little in terms of actual touring and travel knowledge. The are fiendishly constructed, listing little blurbs about the towns and then in the back of the book they have an index of hotels and restaurants. This is not a very efficient way to go about looking for accommodations etc.It seems that with these books they assume you will be renting a car. There is VERY LITTLE/NO INFO in terms of any information pertaining to bus or train travel. I think for a lot of people this would be very frustrating.With that said, there are some nice drawings (map drawings questionable) and good photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a history book :)","review":"I love the eyewitness travel guides, the beautiful pictures and history make them well worth the money.

It's really two books in one, as another reviewer said - a book about the author's search for the Yeti of myth, and a few chapters about an obscure kind of bear. Apparently the author thinks that the Yeti stories are basically Tibetan legens about the bear; that's a great theory, but I'm not sure it's worthy of the sensationalistic title/cover that this book has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad state of Oz","review":"There have been so many books on the Wizard of Oz. So many of them good and some not so good. This book falls in the uncategorized section.The Wizard of Oz is a fairy tale. To think that political and social subjects are within the scope of the story is to believe there is a Santa Clause. If something should be written then it would have to be racism within Munchinville, as its whole society was created with stature in mind (but that is neither here nor there).Much of the story is a fantasy--a bedtime story for kids. I'm sure the author sat down and thought, \\"Hmm...how can I put forth a story that would be a skillfully covert political statement in a children's story?\\" Exactly.So...the Wizard of Oz is just a story...not a statement, a case study, a historical treatment, an X-File...My rating is 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical seals","review":"I bought these seals to seal up access panels and doors in my house.

It is more like only 8-9 feet.I really don't get it though since the package stated it was 17 feet and it looked unopened...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and On Target","review":"This is a book I wish I had written. As a long-time Paris denizen -- now a dual-national with US and French citizenship -- I can attest that French Toast is on the mark when it comes to understanding a certain French world (there are as many, perhaps more, worlds here as there are in America). It's also funny and a delight to read. Harriet's humor and insight bubble up in every sentence, and I love the tidbits provided by her husband, Philippe. On sexiness: Give a French woman perfume, an American woman a bar of soap. This is classic stuff. I look forward to reading her next book on France! Encore, encore!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but very thin and lacking much insight","review":"I found some of her insights interesting, and a few caused me to chuckle. But this book really serves to reinforce French stereotypes, so it's not very illuminating. The writing isn't great, and in some places, it's just plain sloppy.I'd recommend \\"Almost French\\" by Sarah Turnbull over this book. It's more thoughtful, better written and more insightful. Her husband does not come off well in the book, as other reviewers have noted. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"an informative, quick read","review":"After years of misunderstanding my French sister-in-law, the mystery has been cleared up thanks to Harriet. I read this book in one sitting, laughed quite a bit and came to understand many things which have puzzled me over the years: differences in child rearing, eating habits and attitudes toward people, life, marriage and many other things. I even lent the book to my sister-in-law and she thought it was amusing and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing But Not Deep","review":"This book is not bad for light reading. The anecdotes are quite amusing but the author doesn't really provide deeper insights into French culture. Some of the author's interpretations of French behaviour are too simplistic - nothing you've never heard before. A better buy would be Polly Plat's French or Foe. It also appears that this book was written in haste - the jokes in dialogue format at the end of each chapter do not seem well integrated with the book. It seems like they were placed there because the author did not put in much thought as to how to insert them well into the chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well done job","review":"Harriet Welty Rochefort has done an excellent job in conveying the feelings of what it really is to be an American living in a foreign world, this world happens to be Paris and other points in France. One must take into consideration that she is married to a Frenchman so she isn't exaclty a stranger in a small world. This book was an excellent travel companion for my first trip to France and was thoroughly enjoyable. She describes everything from what goes into making a \\"french lunch,\\" no sandwhiches please, to the ins and outs of not getting ripped out at the local Boulangerie. I await more of Harriet's writing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Like It","review":"I love francophile literature written by anglophones. It often makes me chuckle and shake my head in agreement. I wanted to like this book but the writing is incredibly weak. She manages to backtrack and repeat herself, rewording the same sentiment, yet saying nothing at all insightful or giving any vivid stories to illustrate her point. I would expect this kind of writing from a student in a creative writing class, not in a professionally published book. I much prefer the skillful writings of Peter Mayle and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iowa vs. Paris--who won?","review":"This book does not contain many new insights into French culture, which is perplexing since the author has been married to a Frenchman and living in France for 20 years.

After traveling to France and now reading this book, it brought back some wonderful moments for me. The French have a wonderful attitude about food that we Americans should consider adopting. Food is our friend , not the enemy! The recipes were most easily to understand. Ruth has a way of transporting you to where she is at that moment. Excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this book","review":"I got this book in anticipation of my first trip to Paris and was very disappointed by it. It's not amusing, insightful, or well-written. Though some reviewers here seem to think that the author is criticizing French people, it was apparent to me that she is actually criticizing Americans. In doing so, she clings to stereotypes. Here's an excerpt from the book, as an example, \\"In some ways, Frenchwomen are much less on their guard around men than we Americans are. They do delicious things, such as laugh at off-color jokes, and don't yell sexual harassment when complimented on their hairdo. They can disagree with a man--and keep their cool. So refreshing.\\"Ugh!

The author also seems to wish that the French weren't so French, despite her claims to the contrary.In short, I would recommend getting this book from the library, not spending money on it. I agree with other reviewers who have recommended Peter Mayle or Polly Platt instead. I found them to be more sensitive to and appreciative of the peculiarities and idiosyncracies of French culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiner","review":"I usually love any book about Paris or the French but I found the author to be quite a whiner.

I dearly love my host family even though we spent a week together.

Excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing, realistic look at Parisian life","review":"Finally - a book about Paris that actually tells it like it is. As an 8-year resident of Paris, I've been disappointed with most books on the subject which give a starry-eyed, unrealistic account of life in the City of Lights. French Toast should be considered mandatory reading for anyone considering living in Paris.Ms. Rochefort is refreshingly honest about her experiences in France and I found myself nodding along after reading her anecdotes - they all rang true as I've encountered similar situations countless times. In addition, it was a real relief to realize that I'm not the only American female perplexed by Frenchwomen's behavior!Her straightforward American style infused with dry French humor is a perfect vehicle for her insightful commentary on Franco-American cultural differences. Anyone who wants a book about Paris that goes beyond the superficial should definitely pick up French Toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"Having recently returned from Paris, I was eager to keep my memories of this magical city fresh. Described by one reviewer as the Peter Mayle of Paris, this book sounded so good I purchased both this and \\"French Fried.\\"Ugh! It's the first time in my life I wanted to throw a book away. She is negative, humorless and a mediocre writer.She apparently moved to France and spends her days wishing the French were more like Iowans. She wallows in her ignorance and is proudly ill-mannered, unschooled and unable to cook. After 20 years in Paris, the best she can do is work her pressure cooker! Avoid this book if you like (or think you might ever like) Paris."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful reading will distress anyone who speaks French","review":"Why they couldn't find someone who can pronounce French words correctly--even people with American accents don't pronounce Rimbaud as if the first syllable rhymes with Rintintin--to impersonate an author who has lived in France for two decades and taught at some of the best schools there is a mystery to me--the reading is offensive and ruins the experience of the book, which might have been enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tres bien Harriet!","review":"For any American who's lived and loved in Paris, this book is a \\"must have.\\"The author takes us through her life as an expatriot-from buying bread to driving along the Champs-Elysees, Harriet delicately demystifies the French mentality and provides us humorous epistles that make us laugh and think, \\"Ah, oui. C'est ca.\\" (Ah yes, absolutely like that.)French Toast is both an adventure and a walk down memory lane as you relive your own life and memories in Paris. It's impossible to put down!It's almost as satisfying as being in Paris, and certainly cheaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless America","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, I enjoyed it.

Each in it's own way; Loyd's was an innovation and a classic in it's time,Dudeney's and Kordemsky's were very traditional with great variety. Moscovich gives us a whole new approach in types of puzzles and a huge leap in the incorporation of art and graphics into the world of puzzles.

The love or lust affair between the drifter and the wife is animalistic and turns to murder.This movie would have none of that. The Greek becomes a man named Smith, and the whory wife becomes Lana Turner with perfect blond hair, perfect makeup, very nice clothes. Ms. Turner supposedly said once that she would rather lose a valuable earring than be without her makeup in public. That fits. In 1946 Hollywood just couldn't present a female star looking other that glamorous. As an aside, I will admit that Ms. Turner looked fine.The greasy spoon diner becomes a rather fashionable looking restaurant. And the producer even felt the need to provide a lame explanation of how the title somehow fit with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a little...Overrated","review":"I bought this movie with the expectations of seeing a really good, intense movie, since the story was adapted form a James Cain novel, has great reviews, and a good cast. Instead, I saw a movie with a jumpy script that was dissatisfying. The basic plot is good, but has so many little twists that it is rather unbelievable and fake. Lana was good as the beautiful girl, and James Garfield was O.K. as a drifter that chases after women. The lawyers were excellent.

The damaged case was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad casting, bad sets, bad costumes","review":"So disappointing. Hardly a dark/noir film, in my opinion. Just a proper Hollywood murder mystery. And there's no sex, except brief kissing which Lana always cuts short! I'm a James M Cain fan, and this doesn't even try to be faithful to his great noir novel. Everyone's too decent. Cora (Lana) doesn't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body, and she's always costumed like a perfect fashion model, fingernail polish and all. Frank (Garfield)is never lustful, never mean, never desperate. Always polite and decent. Not a gas station (except for one pump that looks planted) not a single oil can or wrench. Not a greasy spoon or diner, Twin Oaks looks like a tidy clean beach cottage or B&B, fit for Donna Reed & family. The 80's Nicholson/Mammet version is much better in all these areas and actually dark. Much more faithful to Cain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as remake with Jack Nicholas","review":"My guess in this case was more creactivity used than original because of film era limiting sex sex scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dial M...

Lana Turner herself admitted that this is her career best, and she enjoyed doing this film. Director Tay Garnett fully exploited the youth and beauty of Lana Turner in presenting her to the viewers as young Cora Smith married to a middle aged cook stuck in a roadside diner. The movie revolves around young Cora who refuses to cheat on her husband; slowly but steadily she falls under the seductive influence of a young drifter, and very soon she will be plotting the murder of her husband with her lover. Part of the movie was set near beaches in Malibu, Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California. It is really enjoyable to see the unspoiled beauty of Southern California beaches of mid 1940s.

This one, in particularly, features four of the greatest suspense films ever made - two featuring the best of the best, BOGART! - but TCM really botched it by releasing all of their collections on easily-scratched two-sided disks.Anyone who buys these collections deserves what they get, you're much better off buying each film separately, even paying more. SHAME ON YOU, Turner Classic Movies, for taking the cheap way out and producing an inferior product when you claim to be all about the love and preservation of classic film!!

I won't be purchasing any more DVD's from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense!!","review":"This is Peter Moore Smith's first novel and a great one at that. It's the story of two brothers, one a brain surgeon the other a schizophrenic and the mysterious disappearance of their sister 20 years earlier. I couldn't put this book down. It kept twisting back and forth, unraveling and raveling. I truly enjoyed this debut novel and can't wait for Mr. Smith's next thriller! Superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely original","review":"Pilot Airie is losing his mind. The book explores the concept of raveling as opposed to unraveling. As Pilot struggles to understand what happened to his younger sister, Fiona, 20 years ago, who mysteriously disappeared at a family party, he slowly begins to see his family in a more real light. His brother Peter, a brilliant surgeon, gets involved with Pilot's therapist, Katherine DeQuincey-Joy. Is he getting involved with her to find out exactly what Pilot is telling her or are his motives more pure? This book is told from the point of view of Pilot, but we are also privy to the thoughts of others thru Pilot's mind. This is the part that was surreal for me. I didn't care about these characters at all, especially Pilot. The plot moved along slowly and seemed to take its time getting to the point, when we do finally arrive at the end, it is a letdown. Wait for the paperback, if you must read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Award-Deserving Debut","review":"As a mystery writer with my first novel in its initial release, I make numerous bookstore appearances promoting my book. At one of my early bookstore appearances, a noted bookseller drew my attention to Peter Moore Smith's RAVELING. The bookseller was correct. RAVELING is a extraordinary work. It deals with a disintegrating family. Pilot is the schizophrenic son. Pilot's older brother, Eric, is a prominent neurosurgeon. Twenty years earlier, Fiona, the little sister, disappeared. The novel deals with the relationship between the past and the present as well as Pilot's constantly fluctuating boundary between illusion and reality. It addresses cruelty and abuse and the complex relationships within the Airie family. RAVELING is truly a masterpiece, deserving of the recgonition it has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET MR SMITH A THESAURUS","review":"I first read about this book in the Denver Post where it received a favorable review. After I was finished, though, I was disappointed that I spent my time on this novel. The fact that the therapist was sharing private conversations from her sessions with Pilot indicated a lapse in the author's judgment. Very unbelieveable. And though I found the overall plot and ending to be creative and suspenseful, I was disappointed that the author found the need to use the F-word over and over and over in mulitple situations and conversations. Surely the mind that came up with this intriguing storyline (minus the therapist debacle) can come up with a better word. It added nothing to the book, but demeaned Mr. Smith's character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I rarely stop reading a book once I start it, but I was very tempted with this one. I found the book very slow moving with characters that were either thoroughly unlikable, pathetic, or both. The \\"surprise\\" ending was obvious before I was halfway through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raveling","review":"As a writer, I found many flaws in this book. The writer uses a poor simile on page 1 (blue-purple vein and trickling wine) and then uses it several times in the novel. When the mother is introduced we get the same description-the cancer and the vein. He gives characters odd behaviors (such as Kathrine always chewing the scabs on her fingers and knuckles--why does she have them?) but never explains why the characters do these things. He uses a cheap tactic to get around the limitations of first person POV and thinks the reader won't mind, and won't find it annoying and confusing. The plot is very compelling (like watching a train wreck) but that is the only good thing about the book. There are a few moments in the book that are well written, and show great talent, but the entire book reads like a promising first draft, and not a polished novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Novel I've Read Since \\"The Big Picture,\\" by Douglas Kennedy","review":"Note: Thanks for your \\"helpful votes,\\" and please remember that a short review is not a bad review if it leads you to a terrific novel.This is the best novel I've read since Douglas Kennedy's \\"The Big Picture.\\"A seven-year-old girl disappears, and twenty years later her mentally ill brother remembers what happened.Don't read the longer reviews until after you read the book because it might take the edge off the story. I loved this book. The story is told in the first person, but the author uses an ingenious device to get into the heads of the other characters.I couldn't stop reading.

You are in for a treat with either of these two novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly unreadable...","review":"The jumbled plot(what little there is) is very slow to get off the ground and seems artificially forced.

I have had so -so dealings with Gold N Hot in the past so I was a little nervous but I purchased this one anyway. So far, so good. It's surprisingly light (at least compared to my one inch ceramic tools curling iron). I usually let my hair air dry and use my curling irons to straighten my hair as I curl the ends (I'm black with a relaxer.) I have yet to do it with this one. Although I might try b/c it gets really hot. (I usually have it on around 20-25 out of 30)The only problem is that the ceramic can chip off (It happened with the first one I bought, but I returned it and got a new one that hasn't chipped so far) and it's so big that if you take your thumb off the spring grip, it can be hard to get it back on (I have huge hands too.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad disappointment concerning Gold and Hot Curling Iron","review":"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.

This is the best ceramic curling iron I've found for the price (I've neve spent more than $50). However, with this latest purchase (11/2007), I don't think the iron gets as hot as it used to...probably not a big deal for most, but my hair is coarse and naturally wavy so the heat is needed to make it smooth and soft. Note that irons that get extremely hot such as this last a maximum of a year (I use mine maybe 4-5 days/week). The gold does peel off under the clamp after a while. Better than any ceramic I've purchased at the drug store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Really disappointed in this product. I have been a Gold N Hot user for many years--love their products so I was looking forward to receiving this curling iron. I was looking for a good curling iron that offers some protection from the harsh heat of a regular curling iron. What I got was an iron that Does Not Curl! The temp settings allow you to go up to 400+ but no matter what the temp, this iron does not curl my hair. Granted, my hair is thick but unlike the other Gold N Hot curling irons, it barely makes a dent. Guess I'll continue to use my old standby Hot N Gold irons. My advice--Don't buy unless you have very thin hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid introduction to Linear Recursion","review":"I have found that it is difficult to find a text on Linear Recursion.

Might not always want to hear \\"Queenie, Wahine's Papaya\\" in the mode, but it's still a fun experience.Song titles, dates, locations, personnel, RCA correspondence, rare photos; even a section with Gold Singles and Albums; Billboard *and* Cashbox Chart positions - thank you; and a long list of rumoured recordings and projected releases.You think Elvis only *sang* on his sessions?

More entertaining and not nearly the same it sounds as the van gogh with only one reproduction.

Beautiful presentation. Fast delivery!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Different","review":"I picked up this watch because I thought it offered exceptional value for money considering its Swiss made. The yellow dial adds a touch of being different that the standard white/black/blue dials that are offered by most manufacturers. I have been happy with this buy... the dial size and thickness are generous. The date and crow at 4 o'clock position make interesting positioning. Victorinox engraved on the left hand case dia is unique and projects understated brand elegance. I have deducated one star because of the yellow strap that comes with the watch. It makes the watch look ordinary (rather cheap!). I have switched the strap to a blue coloured one which gives it a more sporty look. On the whole an excellent buy on the price:value equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mounts","review":"I got these for my mother to mount her sony satelite speakers.

Any Rameau fan who values the unique blend of grandeur and sprightly good humor that permeates so much of the French master's music will find this production patently offensive. Christie and his troops mistakenly equate vulgar buffoonery and the most absurd posturing with good humor and high spirits. That a conductor of Christie's stature endorses and participates in such revolting nonsense is (for me) a real eye-opener. Who woulda thought. Give it a wide berth--IF you love Rameau."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows","review":"Why can't I choose no stars? Perhaps the album deserves one star, I mean there is forming of somewhat cogent sentences, successfully mimicking a tune and it did just miss the perfect title by only one letter - if it had been called Blows, maybe it would have gotten a star for honesty. Vocals -boring tunes-boring at some points it sounds as if it was produced using one of those automatic beat tracks keyboards come programmed with. I hate writing bad reviews but buyer be warned this album is not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brokedown Palace","review":"This is perhaps one of the greatest songs ever written by a mere mortal. You will find very few comments on it. More than likely most people find it too seriously contemplating death, the finality of their existance. I ain't no intellectual. This song defines life, and illustrates what Hesse tried to convey in his greatest work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Grateful Dead","review":"This is an interesting album, with poetic, meaningful lyrics.

During the first listen (I won't specify the circumstances!), it left an indelible mark on my brain and led me to visit Haight-Ashbury years after that first listen. Box of Rain remains the most enigmatic song I've ever heard, though I understand Lesh's intent. Ripple was used as for the \\"bridal dance\\" at my middle daughter's wedding (very lavish formal wedding, I might add!).

However, it has some weaker spots such as \\"Operator\\" and \\"Till the Morning Comes\\", that keep me from giving it five stars.

The bluegrass influence in this album, which is really what Garcia desired to do in all the Dead's music, is strong and truly makes the album. The Dead were never really known for their vocals, it was more about the music. But this album has some great vocals. American Beauty finds the Grateful Dead running on all cylinders. My favorite tracks are the Dead standard Friend of the Devil as well as the rollicking Truckin'. If you want to get into a group that really personifies the spirit of American music, start with this album and get into the Grateful Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"very american, very beautiful","review":"They go back to their roots here, sound like a rough version of CSN (&Y) who taught them harmonies, and they actually write some good songs.Live, they would morph into altogether different beasts but this album stands out as one of their best (and un-GD) albums: concise, i.e. present the musical ideas, but not work out the myriad of different variations on the theme, as they would do live.

And so Classic is as classic does in Jerry Garcia's signature tune,\\"Ripple\\",among other notable tunes ,\\"Sugar Magnolia\\",\\"Operator\\",\\"Friend Of The Devil\\",\\"Box Of Rain\\". The tight instrumentation is subdued on this album leaving the vocals more room to stand out painting a visual in the listeners mind.

This makes it worthwhile for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would not be out of place on Alt-Country!","review":"First, a confession--I never was a Dead fan. That said, this is one fine album made better by DVD-Audio surround sound. The primarily acoustic instruments are well recorded (at the legendary Wally HEider studios in S.F.), and the layered vocal harmonies are gorgeous--a real surprise, given the Dead's lack of a standout lead vocalist.And there's absolutely no fat here--no noodling solos anywhere--indeed many songs don't even _have_ instrumental breaks. The focus here is squarely on songwriting--mostly by the team of Jerry Garcia/Robert Hunter, with standout turns by Phil Lesh, Bob Weir and Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan. \\"Truckin'\\" is the most famous tune of the bunch, but they are all good--and are made that much better by the 5.1 surround sound mix.Buy it--even if you don't have a DVD-Audio player, the DVD will play in dolby digital 5.1 sound on all normal DVD players--and it also sound very fine indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Dead at their best!","review":"No album catches the mood of the early 70s better than the Dead's \\"American Beauty\\". No album is more indicative of the Dead's greatness than this one. Few albums in rock history are so chock full of great songs as this one. There's one that's sure to hit even the most ardent anit-Dead listener's ears pleasingly. And the well renowned Dead harmonies have never been richer. This is the album that made me a Dead fan, albeit belatedly. And no Dead concert to come would ever be complete without one of the many \\"Beauty\\" cuts like \\"Ripple, Sugar Magnolia, Friend of the Devil, Truckin, Candyman, Operator,\\" or \\"Till the Morning Comes.\\" If one wants to lose themselve completely and get lost in another time and place, then turn off the lights, snuggle next to the fire place, and get together with your favorite beverage (!) and flip on American Beauty.

As if that wasn't bad enough, when the machine is on the scrubber setting, liquid sprays out of the vents. So you can imagine how disgusting that is when I'm cleaning up some animal mess and it is then sprayed out all over me. It is horrific. It is also big, heavy and awkward, so it does not get near walls or in tight spots. This machine is a terrible design and I'd give it negative stars if I could. I finally just threw it away after just using it a few times. Really the worst. I can't even say which is worse, the loudness of it or the spray back. Both are just awful. Don't do it.

If you want 2 bump on the floor \\"Not B Cauz of U\\", and \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\" can't miss.Unfortunately the group stopped recording from 1991 with explanation unknown. Eric Mcaine (Lead Singer) set up a studio in Atlanta and began writing and producing for Keith Sweat. I'm still hoping he'll release a solo album because he has a unique voice .

Weldon occassionally lets you know which movies he absolutely loves or hates, but he usually keeps his overall opinion to himself, choosing instead to describe the movies with neutrality (although frequently in a humourous manner). But it is the best reference book for learning about strange, weird, anti-establishment, etc., movies that usually only get one dismissive line of description in more commercial guides and will have you running back and forth to video stores. But WARNING: this book is a sequel to the Psychotronic Encyclopedia and only overlaps it when new information has come to light about a previously listed movie. So, for example, Psycho 2 and up are listed, but not the original (which is in the \\"Encyclopedia\\"). Also, it only covers movies up to approx. 1996.

You can't tell if the reviewer likes or hates the movie. And as for the blurbs on the front that tell you how funny it is, I don't see much humor in these reviews. They are short and stale.Plus there is a lot of filler reviews. Why review movies like Cape Fear, when it is reviewed in just about every mainstream video guide out there?Are these movies in here just to give weight to his definition of Psychotronic? I feel ripped off.I would recommend DVD Delirium. This book is much more fun and you can really get a feel for the movie. Plus the reviewers let you know if they liked the movie or not.

I think part of it is that it was shot in 1995 but she only gives you 2 chances to learn the steps and then it goes to tempo which is a very fast tempo. The thing I found most offensive is that the cameraman was constantly focusing on Paula's FACE rather than her FEET while you were trying to learn the steps. It is definitely a good cardio workout but I'll save my cardio on a better cued routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've loved it for years!","review":"I've been doing this dance vidio for about 6 years!

But this tape is for somebody who wants to improve and likes challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout, not a dance lesson","review":"This is a good dance-y workout, but you won't be using any of these steps on a dance floor these days! Very fast-paced (you can either stop and rewind to learn the steps, or just pick them up over a few days, as I did) and a lot of fun -- high energy, cheery, not annoying. You really will see results if you stick with it.

Not recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good music, too hard to follow for beginners...","review":"I will admit that Paula is inspirational BUT she doesn't give you enough time to \\"learn\\" the move before putting you in full gear.

Luckily I'm smart enough to check things out of the library before purchasing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Difficult","review":"I have two left feet anyways and this video was not helpful to me at all. There is no way someone like me can follow these steps because Paula doesn't really instruct you on each move. With all her and the dancers' \\"Oh, just stick with it...\\" tripe, you'd think they'd keep in mind that everyone using the workout isn't Wade Robson or Justin Timberlake. Gosh. Paula says the gazillion people in the video with her are \\"normal folks\\". Oh, please. I guess you can catch on to this tape after watching and rewinding a million times, even though I've had it six years and I still hate it and can't get through the warmup. I guess I could learn this tape if I really wanted to but I want to burn fat, not learn how to be Britney Spears. If you're one of those people who catches on easily Get Up And Dance may work for you. Maybe. But if you're looking for a good fat burning workout without all the hassel, I recommend Peak Fat Burning by Kathy Smith or something of the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but entertaining and fun","review":"I have suddenly become a workout video tape maniac and I need to keep alot of variety in my workout schedule.

There were too many camera angles and really no instruction. In the beginning there was something said about some of the people in the video have never danced before but everyone was well practiced and danced as if they were part of a dance troop. I found it hard to keep up with the tape. The end was rather silly with the \\"spontaneous\\" YMCA dance directed by a group of guys before the cool down. Thank god I found Donna Richardson workout tapes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To FAST... little instruction","review":"This tape was not good at all, for a beginner espeacially. I tried it twice and gave up, and I have taken dance lessons a lot when I was younger. Very little instruction was involved, the lighting was bad, and all the people in the tape were distracting. I would say this tape is good for someone that has MUCH experience in fast paced dance. I give it two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"the last Paula Abdul tape I'll ever get","review":"If you are a dancer/choreographer or with years and years experience with dancing, then this is the tape for you. But if you simply want a good aerobic workout, then believe me, you won't get it. Five to ten minutes into the video, you cannot follow anymore. I gave it a few more minutes, the more I got confused. The steps and choreography make it so difficult to have a real workout that you simply get frustrated since you cannot complete one sequence. Please, please, borrow from anyone before you buy your own and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"I love this! It is fantastic! I have so much fun doing it and it is a good cardio workout. Paula is a good instructer and she takes time to slow down the moves and explain what is being done.

But, now I have been working out for a year and still can't follow Paula. The music is good, but the steps don't make sense and on top of it all ... it sure doesn't feel like you are getting any kind of workout at all. The only good thing I can say is ... the warm up and cool down are all right. I've been known to just do those and do some other kind of exercise in between as I fast forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying And Complicated!","review":"This is the worst workout tape ever for a beginner. The fact that most people work out on carpet and cant do her moves on carpet make it difficult to start with, also they move so fast that its even more difficult to follow for a beginner or non-dancer. I did play the tape all of the way through and attempted a few times to do the workout. I couldnt listen to the whole thing (had to turn the volume off to keep from going insane) because the entire tapes dance music is her song \\"Promise of a new day\\" The ETERNAL REMIX FROM HELL!

I acutally gave it away after the first time I did it. I own a lot of aerobics videos, take aerobics classes, and took dance classes when I was younger. I know how to dance and can pick up on routines quickly. But this video is horrible. The moves are impossible to follow. Some of the moves involve so much fancy footwork that you're destined to twist your knee if you're trying to do the steps on a carpeted floor like I was. Anyway, do yourself a favor and find another video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok workout, if you can follow","review":"This video is definately not for beginners. It is hard to follow if you are not used to moving you body that quickly!!! After about several times of watching the same sequence over and you can finally begin to follow the moves. The warmup is pretty fun though. It is different than most warmups. The ab workout is also, not so bad. It is just the dance moves that are so complicated. If you can follow them, it is a good workout. If you have trouble following regular aerobics videos, dont buy this one. You find yourself getting more of a finger workout from rewinding so many times just to try and follow along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paula Abdul's Get Up and Dance is fun!","review":"I'm buying the video now, but I borrowed it earlier for ideas of dance steps. Paula is a fun person. I had a hard time picking up on the steps the first couple of times.I know that I can do the whole routine in time with devoted practice. I get a great workout and I feel terrific after. This is a keep-in-shape and have-fun-at-the-same-time type of video. I used to dance and exercise a lot when I was younger and was in great shape. I want to get back in shape and have fun doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult","review":"The moves in this are great, but I did this with several fairly coordinated family members and it was very difficult. I never have managed to master it. She makes a passing attempt at teaching you the moves, but a couple of times she actually completely skips teaching you the move and just does it at the speed of light and expects you to get it. It was freggin sadistic. I'd rather have an impossibly difficult video with good moves than an unbearably easy video, however, so it gets two stars. If you pick up stuff fast and easily, this would probably be a good investment. Also, the set and costumes made me laugh a lot, way too old. Fortunately, most of the moves survive the test of time and you won't look like a dork on the dance floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"New convert to old music....","review":"I was once and still am a rocker, Led Zep, Van Halen, Scorpions, you get the idea, all favorites of mine back in the day and to this very day.

Someone on Youtube suggested this David Munroe's CD and I am so glad he did! FASCINATING, complex, no plainsong here. From plaintive to pulsating this music inspires one to learn as well as listen.

This is the bestviolin bio since the one on Kreisler which came out 56 years ago. There are great anecdotes here about almost every famous musician of Zimbalist's time. It's too bad it wasn't written years ago when people still remembered who Zimbalist was. I fear that you will miss out on a great book if you don't get it right away. A special-interest book like this usually never comes back into print unless the artist is in recent memory. Even Zimbalist Jr. is 87 this year!

The construction is flimsy, particularly the lid and its attachment to the pitcher. I can see this breaking. The infuser insert slips out of its track easily, which is a minor annoyance but it just makes the thing feel cheap. The deal-breaker for me is that the infuser lets tons of tea leaves escape. I tried to brew green tea and there were so many tea leaves that escaped through the infuser that I had to pour it all out through a strainer into another container, totally defeating the purpose of this pitcher. It might work for you if you are infusing large sprigs of tea, herbs, etc. but it was useless for green tea leaves. Bodum typically makes great stuff. This is a disappointing exception. I'll think twice before buying anything plastic from Bodum in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest...","review":"I have had this pitcher for about a year.

She had fresh (decaf) green tea in it. It was DE-LISH & so refreshing! I'm not normally an iced tea drinker but it was so good and good for me too (green tea has loads of antioxidants!) - I decided to get one for myself. I had recently given up drinking sodas and was already getting tired of plain water - the 'discovery' of this iced tea maker came at just the right time. I do worry a bit that it might get broken - it's make of a rigid plastic, not a flexible plastic like a Rubbermaid or Tupperware pitcher which could take a bit more abuse. It is not flimsy at all, I'm probably worried for nothing. A plus to the rigid plastic is that it does not absorb odors.

The product immediately warped from the hot water to the point that the infusers would stick and jam when being inserted or removed, so I stopped using the infusers.The plastic also immediately stained from the iced tea, and no amount of scrubbing would clean them.Today, when pouring the hot water into one of them I heard a distinct \\"crack\\" sound, and looked down to see a crack along the side. The entire reason I bought a non-glass pitcher was so that it would survive being doused with boiling hot water.So, one of my two pitchers is dead, they do a workmanlike job as tea pitchers, but I'll look elsewhere for replacements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked and holes are too big for loose teas","review":"One use and the plastic cracked!I use loose teas and the holes are definately too big for that.Great idea though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Any pitcher with the infusion will do the same and is BPA free.

However when I pulled it out of the box I was a bit disappointed, though I kept it and do use it a lot. It is cheaply made platstic, but the real problem is with the filter. I like all kinds of loose tea, and some are very fine leaves. The filter on this product is terrible. Does not filter fine leaves, they end up in the main part of resevoir. I end up using a mesh metal coffee filter to pour the tea into glass or into another container. It works fine but ridiculous that Bodum put such a cheap filter in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other reviews were right on","review":"I received this last week and used it twice. I so desperately wanted the other reviews about the design flaws to be wrong but they weren't. The lid is flimsy. I am so afraid it is going to snap right off when I am making the tea or cleaning it. They should have just made the lid lift all the way off like the rubbermaid pitchers, duh. Instead it's attached by this little piece of cheesy plastic that sticks up and gets in the way. You can see it next to the handle in the picture. Also the loose tea leaves do seep right through the little holes in the filter.I just love the size of this. I couldn't find another one that brews loose tea in this size anywhere on the web. I am considering returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this last year at a Whole Foods store. It worked well for about two months and then sprang a leak on the seam where it was joined.

Because I drink iced tea all day when I can, I wanted a larger container. This really hits the spot. The top of the container is 1\\" taller than a 1/2 gallon carton of milk and it wedges in nicely in the fridge. The infuser can be fiddly to get in place because it is so tall and narrow, but it does fit perfectly once you find the spot. I've been brewing iced tea with hot, not boiling water and the results are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tea on the stove","review":"I ordered this item roughly 6 months ago.

It spring a leak spraying almost boiling water on my hand then all over the stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean","review":"I thought the infuser was a good idea and the large size would let me brew enough tea to last awhile. However, I didn't realize that the top is not removable, making dishwasher washing impractical. We couldn't keep it clean enough by hand. And, I realized that it was really too large - it was hard to handle with one hand when full and too tall to fit easily into the refrigerator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but lid broke after 8 months","review":"This has been a great pot for Lipton's Cold Brew even though it stains quickly.

I purchased the larger of the sizes offered and it just barely fits in the fridge....but it fits. It's handy since it's oblong shape. We are able to use loose tea and tea bags. However, loose tea isn't so readily available at regular grocery stores so tea bags will be the norm. Cutting up a whole orange or lemon and \\"fusing\\" that with the tea does make the tea taste yummy. It's not glass so not so heavy when filled to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Probably the best-written and most accessible one-volume history of The Reformation.

It would seem very hard to believe that another human could exist on the planet who knows as much about the Reformation as Mr. MacCulloch. But I did not find this to be a particularly illuminating book. I guess I would characterize it as a very detailed examination of the TREES at the sacrifice of a larger view of the FOREST. I eventually just became rather numb to the impressive, but somehow rather stupefying and unrelenting level of detail. I wished that I had come away from the book with a better understanding of the bigger picture. The fact that I did not probably says a lot more about me than the author or his book - but a bit broader focus, at least from time to time, would have made this work much more rewarding I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant book from a great author","review":"This book deservedly joins the classics by Euan Cameron and Owen Chadwick on the Reformation. It looks at it as it really happened - this is based on solid scholarship and years of careful research. Those wanting a more partisan history will not find it here (my own FIVE LEADING REFORMERS should be more to the tastes of those that do) but as an objective work, looking at the Reformation in the wider context of European, and later global,history, this book cannot be bettered. For those of us who loved this author's CRANMER and then his TUDOR CHURCH MILITANT, this is the big book from him for which we have all been waiting. Make sure your library has a copy, and that your professor and/or pastor have read it.

I found it to be comparable to milk in a locked refrigerator...you know its there...but its just not accessible. Mr. MacCulloch's research is exhaustive, however, his ability as a writer does not offer the reader any real discernment of either the forest or the trees. If your goal is understanding what happened in the 16th century, I suggest a much briefer history by Glenn S. Sunshine, who indeed, does present a much more enlightening work. Great scholarship, in the case of Mr. MacCulloch, is cloaked in the mediocrity of his writing skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashily done, sir!","review":"I was prompted to begin reading \\"The Reformation\\" by a number of laudatory reviews. Begin reading was all I could take. Within the first 25-30 pages Mr MacCulloch reveals that he is ignorant of the Catholic understanding of what the Eucharist is, believes that the doctrine of the Assumption states that the mother of Jesus did not die (sorry, dude, no one gets out of here alive), and has clearly never spoken with a Catholic religious or priest about his choice of celibacy (sorry, it's not a job requirement). While promising to guide his reader into the minds of European Christians of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, he shows little ability to get there himself, and insists on judging the people of that era by two of the preoccupations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, viz., political power and sexual abandon. I shuddered to think what further misinformation lay ahead, tore up the book, and tossed it into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantic Isles?","review":"A dull work. I couldn't get past the first few chapters. His silly kow-towing to political correctness by referring to the British Isles as the Atlantic Isles didn't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did this win an award ?","review":"Please explain to me why this book won a prestigious award ? It is a murky muddle with a silly claim to objectivity that is obviously a lie. Just because you do not hold to a belief system does not mean you are automatically objective about it. This guy dances all around important issues and pivotal historical characters precisely because he indeed does have a strong bias. If you want to read an excellent history of the Reformation avoid this book. There are a number of excellent studies already done by real historians that are readily obtained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, please try again!","review":"Long story short:Brilliant and illuminating introduction. Someone who knows this much could write a brilliant history of the Reformation. Alas, this is not written chronologically, even within paragraphs. I've read a lot of academic histories, but I was chronically lost; I finally gave up and just browsed specific subjects from the Index. Worse, the author is so sympathetic to the IDEAS, yet is viciously judgmental with respect to the PEOPLE; I wish he had let the reader be the judge, and I genuinely hope he tries again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with typographical errors","review":"I would highly recommend the book except that it is riddled with typographical errors through out. In most of the errors, whole words are broken up with a space in between the parts of the words. I am not sure whether it is the responsibility of the publisher or Amazon to have the book fixed and replace the currently flawed one. I personally feel that it is simply unacceptable to have this level of errors occurring in a book that is offered for sale. So in conclusion, get the printed book and avoid the ebook all together till it is fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but buy the hardcover edition","review":"I wasn't sure I would ever make it through this book, but it kept me interested through the three months it took me to read it. My only recommendation is to buy the hardcover, not the paperback as I did. First, it's a book worth keeping. Second, the small format and tiny print of the 700 page paperback was difficult to deal with. I would recommend this book to even casual readers of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well.","review":"I prefer the SanDisk memory as I've never ever had a SanDisk card go bad, but this one was a good deal.

If so, read Bah, Bah, Black Sheep, the story of a young man from a good family who became an outlaw in north Texas and south Oklahoma in the early 1900's. Using his well developed journalistic style, author Joe M. Leonard, Jr. chronicles the background and crime spree of Haney Liddell, whose black sheep life choices must have been a mystery and heartbreak to his otherwise upstanding family. The book is enhanced by numerous photos, maps and documents. As with television westerns, the law prevailed eventually, but the reality of Bah, Bah, Black Sheep is much more fascinating than any fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The easiest book to learn I Ching.","review":"I enjoyed this book.Its an easy book to understand and written in simple English.Simple instructions to learn I Ching.Printed in reasonable size print too.(I didnt need to wear my glasses).The authors method for a reading is simple too.I prefer their method.Overall,a good book with plenty of information make this book an ideal beginners book.You can learn to do an I Ching reading for yourself within minutes of starting to read this book.This is a good size book.Larger than most,and,good quality.Not a cheap book on cheap paper.Good value.This should be the first book you buy on I Ching.I also recommend these books:1)\\"I Ching:a new interpretation for modern times\\".By Sam Reifler.2)\\"Practical guide to the I Ching\\".By Kim-Anh Lim."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real tear jerker!","review":"This book was impossible to put down, again like the last of Nicholas Spark s' book I read it in just two days with the first night leaving only 54 pages to go.

However this book adds just as much emotion as the other books that i have read by him. Nicolas Sparks brings unreal situations to life. The way he depicts a single mother's life with an abnormal child very well for a man who does not live that life. At times however the story got a little slow but otherwise it is still a very good story written by a good author. After reading his other books however i expected more from Nicolas Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple and unsubstantial.","review":"I credit the author for pulling me in to the story up until the last 50 pages or so. It reads like a made for tv movie with short sentences and simple words. I kept reading though, simply wanting to know what Tyler's problem was. Then I decided I didn't really care and left it. The plot is oversimplified and the author counts on pulling the heartstrings of the reader through the circumstances of the characters, and idealistic ideas about romantic love rather than through meaty and intelligent writing. This book is fluffy beach reading. If that's what you're into you'll probably like it but if you want a book of real substance that doesn't insult your intelligence with it's simplified, formulaic style, pick up something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Spark's best","review":"As a diehard Sparks fan, I was truly disappointed in the \\"Danielle Steel\\" formulaic writing.

I am always totally amazed by the fact that these wonderful romance books have been written by a man.In the Rescue I was quickly drawn into the story of Taylor and Denise; two very lonely people who find each other on a stormy night because of a twist of fate. The centre of Denise's life is her son, Kyle. Unwed and raising a child with a learning disability, Denise has become a strong and independent woman. Taylor on the other hand jumps from relationship to relationship always avoiding that final commitment. Plagued by horrifying memories, Taylor is made to face yet more disaster in his life. The perfect meshing of two lives and true love.I look forward to Nicholas Spark's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book!","review":"Once again Nicholas Sparks writes an amazing book! This one is phenomenal. They need to make it into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and forced","review":"The primary value of entertainment that I received from this book was the amusement as I wondered how much more inane and contrived the dialogue between Denise and Taylor could get. The conflicts feel very forced... As when Denise is so upset when he chooses to eat at work as opposed to spending EVERY waking and sleeping moment with him. I also found some of the word choices poor \\"his mother looked at him with inexpressible sorrow\\"?? It was clearly expressible sorrow as he could see that it was SORROW. Irrepressible sorrow would have fit with his intent better.There was some redemption in the storyline between Taylor and Kyle. Certainly better than \\"True Believer\\" and \\"At First Sight\\" But overall, I would have been happier having not read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real life characters","review":"This is the second novel by Nicholas Sparks that I've read and I truly enjoyed it. I found the characters to be very real and the struggles that both main characters go through to be heart wrenching at times. The foreshadowing was a bit predictible and easily to spot, but overall I enjoyed how real the setting and the characters were.As someone else pointed out, Taylor's \\"fear of commitment\\" was a bit much. He seemed so mentally unstable that I found it hard to believe at times he was able to function as a human being. Although, I do make it sound worse than it really was. By the end I was sort of glad Denise had reacted the way she did, albeit a bit late.I did shed a tear or two by the end of the book, so I think Sparks did what he set out to do. As much as I enjoyed this book, \\"A Bend in the Road\\" is still my favorite thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy and formulaic","review":"I stuck with this book to the end hoping it would get better, but unfortunately, it never did. The characters are completely wooden with no eccentricities or any interesting qualities, and the plot is nonexistent. It's not a great love story, or even an ordinary, beautiful love story. It's just talking heads who carp about man/woman relationship cliches, and the resolutions are just as cliched.I know there are a lot of glowing testimonials here for this book, but if *you* think a great love story is something like that in The Thorn Birds or Prince of Tides, don't waste your time on this drivel...I hate to be this negative, but I kept hoping Hannibal Lector would come along and ... off some of the characters so the book would be a little more interesting or at least would end sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help Me Return this book!!","review":"Would have made a nice story if it was written so one could read it; the style was SO poor; I had to close it up & say farwell; I knew that if I went any further I'd be stuck in a really bad relationship!"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and sappy","review":"Had this book been written by a woman, it would never have been published.

Just be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas Does it Again","review":"The Rescue touches the heart as does all of Nicholas Sparks' books. The characters are believable - they could be anyone you know. The plot is believable - fireman meets single mom. The twist and turns in the book are what make it original. Sparks always seems to bring a tear to the readers' eyes whether in the beginning, middle, or end. This book is no different. Happy endings are wonderful, but Sparks' tear jerkers (The Notebook, A Walk to Remember) are a better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Love Story!","review":"Nicholas Sparks has once again written a great love story.

I thought it would be a little odd reading a book about the romance of an older couple, but the characters really came alive on the pages. Taylor and Denise's relationship wasn't \\"love at first sight\\", but it didn't take the whole book to get into the relationship either.The whole book was incredible, just the right length and amounts of emotion in the whole thing. The characters acted rationally, to me anyway.

Not understanding why he was acting like this she breaks up with him.This story is amazing and as it takes you into a world that only Sparks could have written.

It reads just like a Danielle Steele, so if you like her type then you should be happy. The only difference is the reader is spared the details of the lovemaking. But because this is written by a man there are lots of occasions for making love, even when the two aren't getting along otherwise they still end up in bed. Women don't write that way. What a total waste of time. But honestly everything he has written thus far reads this same way in my opinion! Everything here is so stinking predictable. Single mom living in small town meets single hunk and he saves her kid's live and guess what she falls in love,but he has serious emotional baggage from childhood and won't let anyone help."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAYS NOTHING NEW","review":"Single mom, learning-challenged toddler, marriage-scared boyfriend who loves mom and child. Good ideas turn into a soap opera as author goes wild with exclamations and italics throughout. In addition to being overdramatic, the writing is formulaic, repetitive, and five-hundred percent predictable. Except for Mitch's death, there are NO surprises.

Sparks has a wonderful ability to closely detail smalltown life and all it's charm, but the plot-line seemed like familiar territory. Still worth reading for the diehard fans of Sparks. Otherwise I suggest you check out his earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rescue","review":"VERY slow, VERY boring, VERY predictable. It was a painstaking process getting through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer in a duck-blind","review":"Easy for a writer to fill page after page with boring repetitions. I failed to see a romance here. I tried and tried to find an interesting development, but page after page I did not get out of the duck blind. My suspicion is that an industrious but dull-witted woman typed this book, not Nicholas but Nicole. It is a sad tragedy, but I stay away from books written by my own gender."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY","review":"Nicolas Sparks has taken a good idea for a story and turned it into a piece of boring, mundane ramblings. About halfway through, I was absolutely bored to death with the mindless rhetoric. This is the first novel I have read in a while that devoted page after page to talking about the weather. Save your money on this one, it is a \\"MUST NOT\\" read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book not in good condition","review":"I was expecting the book to be in a better condition as it was stated to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Disappointed","review":"Nicholas Sparks has a history of writing tender romance with twists of fate, unforgettable characters, and surprise endings. This book is formulaic, dull, and predictable. It's nothing more than a sweet romance, likeable on its own only if one is not expecting the quality of Sparks' previous offerings. I kept waiting for the surprise found in each of the author's previous books; in this one it never materialized. I hope he hasn't sold out to the idea of simply pumping out more fiction in a hurry; I would rather wait a few years for a novel of the quality Sparks gave us with his previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS AND YOU'LL NEED TO BE RESCUED!","review":"Did I miss something? After reading this book, it was hard to believe the same person who wrote other such wonderful romances like A Walk to Remember, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle penned this. I truly had a difficult time trying to finish it..yawn! Dwelling on Kyle's inability to communicate normally, got real tiresome. There were very few moments that were \\"exciting\\", like towards the end, other than that, this was not one of Nicholas Sparks better works. I'll still continue to read his books - I guess one can't have best sellers all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I've read enough of Nicholas Sparks to expect a romance but I've also come to expect an \\"extra\\" layer that redeems by offering a philosophy, point of view or poignancy that is surprising and unique.

Unfortunately, the epilogue was the most interesting and touching part of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rescue is not his best","review":"I have enjoyed reading N.

Denise is a young single mom with a 4-year old son, Kyle. He has some sort of learning disability that challenges their communication. This poses a particular problem when they are involved in an auto accident, and Kyle wanders off while Denise is unconscious. Taylor is the volunteer fireman who finds Denise and Kyle. They all begin to spend time together and seem to fit perfectly. Kyle even begins to improve his communication.

He is very detailed without being dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was was kind-of corny","review":"I would have liked it better if it did not focus so much on the little boy.

Nicholas Sparks is still a good story teller but this story missed the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"This was my second book I read by Sparks. It was wonderful. The characters seem so real and down to earth. I love how Sparks writes his characters. Denise and Kyle will touch your life in this novel.

This is a must read novel, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas does it again!","review":"What a wonderful story! I, like other reviewers, could not put this book down.

At one point, when Taylor took Denise on the date and then when they got back had strawberries and champagne and candlelight, I literally rolled my eyes.Because I am not a person who can stop reading a book, I read to the end but was I ever glad when it was over. It was lame. I'm glad I only paid a dollar for it on my Kindle. It was on sale at the time I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rescue","review":"As always, this was an awesome book by Nicholas Sparks. It was about a man, Taylor, who is a voluntary firefighter who rescues Denise Holton and your young son, Kyle. Both of them go where nobody has gone before, into Taylor's heart. Taylor harbors responsibility for his father's death and does not allow people to get too close. Will Denise be able to penetrate that wall that Taylor has built around his heart? Time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Forgiving","review":"A disturbing book about a woman, Denise, who falls in love with a man, Taylor, who has serious psychological issues from a dramatic childhood event. These issues reveal themselves in risky behavior, withdrawal and even violence. Though Denise pulls away after seeing these behaviors, she very quickly takes Taylor back, ultimately marrying and starting a family with him, based on his promise to work on these issues. Though it appears Taylor is on the road to recovery, it feels like Denise is rushing into a relationship that could blow up at any moment. The message sent is very unhealthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please","review":"Freakin ridiculous. Love is never THAT easy.

This is an amazing book and you won't be able to put it down. The suspense and anticipation of what is going to happen next is outstanding. The author Nicholas Sparks illustrates this book so you feel like you are there sharing the pain or the joy. I felt I actually knew these people and wanted to lend a hand. All the conflicts are things that happen in life that everyday you face like kids not wanting to cooperate. These problems help you relate to the characters even more. This is a great book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rescue","review":"The Rescue is a combination of romantic and adventure.

The book appealed to me because my older brother was very much like young Kyle (a child with language delay and communication problems) and I could totally relate to what his mother, Denise Holton, has been going through. Spark's style of writing is so readable and not cryptic in anyway. His characters are so captiviting and realistic that they motivate you to finish the book to the very end. I have never read any other Nicholas Sparks's works, and I plan on reading the rest of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This was my first book by Nicholas Sparks, and I must say that I am now looking for more to read.

After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels. After a slow start with \\"True Believer,\\" I was more satisfied with \\"The Rescue.\\" Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is one of my favorite books","review":"I just got done reading The Rescue last night. I just didn't like the part when Taylor blamed himself for his father's death. He had a right to be happy and live his life. The boy really likes Taylor. Denise was a sweet lady. I am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a Dad. You might want to read that book again. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. I have been his fan for 1 year and a month. I love all his stories, I will be looking forard to the next one in October."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointed","review":"I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me. It was a very very slow start. I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot. I had even considered quitting reading it at times. It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading. What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were. I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like \\"The Notebook\\" or \\"The Wedding\\" if you want a good romantic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will make you cry...but it's worth it!","review":"Man what a book! I have read this book over and over again and I still can't get it out of my mind. It is so beautifully written. It has everything I look for in a book. Yes, as only Nicholas Sparks can, it will make you cry...I found myself cry uncontrollably at times. But at the end you are just so glad to have read it you forget about the empty box of tissues beside you. This is by far my favorite Sparks books, for so many reasons. One being I feel like you get to know the characters so intimately that by the end you feel like you have known them your whole life. I feel this book tells the whole story and doesn't leave you hanging wondering what happens next. I love this book. I just can't say enough about this awesome piece of work. Please read if only for the reason to read a true love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rescue","review":"I have read Nicholas Sparks's prior 3 books. The Rescue is not as good as the other three. Don't get me wrong it is a good book, but there was no comparison to the others. For one it didn't make me cry like the rest. The story is about a young lady, Denise, who moves to her deceased mother's hometown to raise her son, Kyle. She is lonely and finally meets the man of her dreams. However, something happened when he was 9-years-old that he feels guilty about which holds him back from her and every other girl he has dated.In Sparks's previous books the ending was totally a surprise, but in this book the ending is very obvious. So, I was a bit disappointed. Over all the book was good. Now I am ready to read the next Sparks book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the sparks?","review":"Nicolas Sparks falls short of what I have come to enjoy in his previous novels. That is to say he has failed in creating a story to hold our interest because the ending is never in doubt. Rather one is never really caught up in the plot since there is a feeling we have been there before and we know almost precisely how we would write it and indeed Nicolas Sparks does exactly that. I am saddened and a bit ashamed for Mr. Sparks to have foisted this amateur novel upon us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Disappointed","review":"Sparks never disappoints us in his ability to work his way into our hearts and souls. The Rescue was no exception. As heartwrentching and soul bruising as his other stories before, this one will have you mesmerized in its characters, thinking about them for days after you put the book away.Denise Holden is a single mother living in a small, Southern town. Her son, 5 year old Kyle, has a vocabulary development problem, and Denise has put her life on hold to work tireless to improve it. Things in her life are measured in small steps, until the accident.

Though Jean Nidetch is no longer associated with the program, and Weight Watcher's has taken on a life of it's own, it's very interesting to see how the program started, what the original diet was, and what finally motivated one woman to change her life and how she impacted so many people. I know so many people who were members of Weight Watchers and said the original diet was the best. You get that in this book, along with a lot of motivation and incentive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for anyone who attends Weight Watchers!","review":"Reading the history of Jean Nidetch and the way WW began is a real treat! It is an inspiring story for anyone, whether fat or slim, but it is especially interesting for today's members of Weight Watchers to read how it all began and to compare the food requirements of the past to the present. No longer is liver required once a week as a strict \\"legal\\" food. But it was never the diet per se; it was Jean's enthusiasm that convinced a small group of fat women to adhere to it.

There seems to be an issue with either the AMD 761 or VIA 686 chipsets on my motherboard.

Nevertheless, this book motivated me to buy a better book and to eventually learn enough Hebrew to read some of the Tanakh in the original language.

I think that it is worth considering that Elton John also penned a song for that same occasion. Regardless of my opinion, this is still a nice collection of Tavener's music.

Worth pulled off plenty of other capers, and I'd like to read about those. What I don't want to read is the author's unsubstantiated speculation about Worth's psyche.If you're interested in the provenance of the \\"Duchess,\\" this book might be an interesting read.

Papaya gives sparkling eyes. Cucumbers are eaten by models. I have begun eating papaya and do notice a difference. MSM and Pumpkin seeds have become more interesting to me than they were before.There are no before and after photos but the Kirlian photos are worth it. I would have liked to see more Kirlian photos with various foods in the same shot. Because all foods are relative to each other. There is one shot in this book of olive oil and pig fat next to each other. The difference is obvious.

At a time when kids were rebelling against the genre of metal, this album comes out with a hair band sound that is more prominent than the last 2 albums (and that's saying something). It is very \\"produced and polished\\" sounding, meaning that there are keyboard instruments from wall to wall, often overshadowing the guitar. Yes there are the guitar solos, but it seems like someone was trying to restrict malmsteen's technique into only his \\"spotlight moment\\" while the rest of the song just sounds like bad hair metal. This album was a sad day for heavy metal and neoclassical guitar, unlike all the malmsteen albums before and most of the ones after, which are five star neo classical extraviganzas.

Malmsteen. Clearly wanting to return to his classical, Blackmore-influenced music, Yngwie still manages to throw in a few radio-friendly songs. Production quality is a bit too \\"bright\\", but it fits for the material here.The most commercial song on the disc is \\"Teaser\\", which could have been written by Joey Tempest's Europe. The vocal, especially the chorus, sounds so much like Europe's style that I'm surprised that Tempest never filed a copyright suit.The least commercial track, barring the instrumental works, is \\"Final Curtain\\". Complete with a HUGE orchestral rhythm section that doesn't sound a bit out of place here; the thunder at the end brings out the strength of the song.True, there's no \\"I'll See the Light Tonight\\" or \\"Soldier without Faith\\" here, but the Yngwie stamp is undeniable and definitely solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"get a regular checkers set","review":"My 5 3/4 year-old daughter, a big Dora fan, received this game for Christmas. While the playing pieces are cute (it's Dora vs. Swiper), I would definitely recommend using a regular checkers set instead. It is easy to knock a whole bunch of them down if you accidently bump one while reaching across the board. The crowns that are provided don't fit. Swiper's crowns will stay on with some readjusting, but the crowns cover up his eyes. Dora's crowns don't fit or stay on, even upside down, in our experience, no matter what you do. Also, playing checkers didn't hold my daughter's attention for an entire game. I assume that this is because of her age. Of course, as she gets older and more able to understand the planning, predicting and maneuvering that can make checkers fun, she's not going to have much interest in Dora and company any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not functional","review":"I had same experience as other reviewer. Crowns do not fit, no matter what. Checkers is a tough game for the age group that would be interested in Dora.

Morton, Ellington, Monk) and its improvisers (Armstrong, Young. Parker, Coltrane, Coleman); it also concentrates on formal changes in the music rather than offering cultural, sociological or biographical analysis. But this is still the most intelligent, instructive, readable and stimulating book on jazz from New Orleans to free jazz to date.

Managing it on the stovetop is pretty average, but the handles do get pretty hot after being on the burner for a while. But that's what they make hot pads for, right?I really like the pan overall. It holds heat pretty well. It cleans up easily. The lid fits well. It has a nice surface. The only thing I couldn't really figure out is if the lid is supposed to be oven-safe. It doesn't say that it is or isn't. I treat it as if it is oven-safe and haven't had any negative results so far.After I used mine for a couple weeks, I bought one for my dad for his birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Lightweight!","review":"I was surprised how lightweight this pan was. I should have known as the price was so low! I was replacing an Emeril 13\\" that I loved but abused and it was done. However, this little pan cooks perfectly, and is a joy to handle at clean up time (as it's not so heavy!). I know I must not overheat it...I'm trying to quickly turn it down as soon as it heats up, then I up and down the heat as needed to keep it right without overheating. That's the trick! Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"Arrived with the handle separated from the lid. After using it about four times on medium to medium high heat, the whole pan turned into a bowl! Could they possibly use thinner metal for the bottom of this pan?

I dont know what everyone is talking about!","review":"Wow.. where to begin.Well - i wont get into specifics, but lets just say im not lost in a kitchen and leave it at that.I bought this on a special sale amazon was having and it was a mistake.I started using this and noticed all the oil pooled in the center. i thought i was imagining things so i picked it up and noticed it was very bowed from looking at the bottom. First use after hand washing.. and its bowed before i can even really cook with it!!

The only downside is that the handles heat up slightly with extended use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you're money","review":"This is the worst nonstick hard anodized pan I've ever owned. I have an Analon Titanium 8 in. skillet and Calphalon 12 in. hard anodized skillet, which are much better. I've also had Silverstone that's better than this pan. This pan is very tinny and thin, over heats easily on even low-med heat on an electric stove, the handles are thin, the lid is ill-fitting and way too heavy for the weight of the pan, and the metal surrounding the lid is curved inward and hard to get clean. I own a Cuisinart Multiclad Pro stainless set, which is excellent, and I wanted to try this before I spent more on the Multiclad Pro nonstick skillets. I'm really surprised at the low quality. I'm glad I tried it, now I know it's junk. Cuisinart should be ashamed of themselves for putting their name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped","review":"We have a glass top stove and have the best luck with pans that an extra thick bottom. After reading the reviews, I thought this pan would work well for us. I was disappointed to find it had the regular rounded bottom that most cheap pans have, though I remained hopeful as the pan felt substantial and sturdy.I do like the handles and the lid, but after one use the pan warped horribly and now rocks on our glass top stove. It won't cook evenly and is a huge pain to use.We had much better luck with a Simply Calphalon pan that is no longer available here. I'm not sure what it is called, but the Calphalon pan we had previously had a thick, flat bottom that looked like a separate piece. Really nice and perfect for our stove."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 and 1/2 stars","review":"I bought this several months ago to supplement my 14-piece Cuisinart cookware set. I love it and use it often for cooking dishes in the oven, from Mahi-Mahi to macaroni and cheese.A few disappointed reviewers have commented on the unevenness of the nonstick coating. I have never had this problem with Cuisinart, but agree that the company should replace any bad-apple, defective items immediately. You deserve a chance to enjoy these pans....Mine has been super easy to clean (including getting melted cheese off the interior rivets) and I've experienced no scratching, flaking or bubbling of the Quantanium surface. None of my pans has warped, lost shape or anything similar. They look, feel and perform as solid, sophisticated cookware.The pan is large (12\\" across, worth noting if you use an electric coil stove top) and slightly shallow; ideally, I'd like the pan to be one inch smaller in diameter and one inch deeper. But it works great and I'd recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Durable Pan!","review":"I've owned this pan for 2 & 1/2 years and I use it almost daily. The non-stick coating is still in GREAT shape! It's so easy to clean: durable non-stick coating, light weight pan and it fits really well in the sink. I'm ordering another since sometimes I need 2 pans going... my other pans are all kind of junk pans and the coating is worn on them, so clean up is a pain. Would definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"working great since 2007","review":"When I purchased this I had a smaller than standard range so I wanted something without long handles. this pan has been great and is still working great. the only down side is the handles get quite hot. For some reason higher end pans all seem to have extra long handles which I don't care for. this one helps compensate for all the room they take up. I'm thinking of buying another because one of my other ones (different brand) died and everything was sticking to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbalanced","review":"I rated this only one-star because it didn't work for me. I'm not saying it's a bad product, just that it doesn't sit flat on a ceramic cooktop."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY versatile, works great, but feels a little cheap","review":"My other cookware is usually nicer than this, but I had a really hard time finding something of this form-factor. With limited space, I cannot afford to have a large pan-handle sticking out, so I like that this pan has small handles on the sides. Not only does this take up less space, it also makes it easier to carry. I am really glad I bought this. It is so versatile since it's very wide (like pans), and reasonably deep (like pots). It has replaced several different pots and pans for me. It will be the only pan/pot I use in 99% of cases now, and this is especially helpful since I don't have that much space in my kitchen. That said, it has its faults. It is light weight to the point of feeling a little cheap. The lid doesn't fit securely. None of this takes away from the utility, though, and that is what counts for me. I am looking forward to using this a lot. Let's see how it holds up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest pan I have ever owned","review":"I was looking for a non-stick large pan for my family of four, that could be used in the oven and on the stovetop. After doing some serious research I found this one, and I thought I would never say that: I am in love with this pan! Cooking in it is a pleasure: I can throw on chicken thighs, diced onions, potatoes and canned chickpeas, brown it a bit in olive oil, season and add a bit of water and rosemary, and voila, meal is done in like 30 min. Everything cooks faster in it. I really dislike cast iron and that was the only other oven and stovetop safe option I could find. This is very easy to clean!!! Just make sure to only use plastic or wooden utensils while cooking, it will serve your family well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great until it started sticking... disposable pan..","review":"This was my first Hard anodized piece as I had previously used non stick and stainless and occasional cast iron 12\\" skillet. When I first got the pan I loved it. The size is perfect for everything and the finish was really nice.. That was a little bit over 2 years ago. About 6 mohths ago food started sticking in the middle unless I used butter or a liquid something with it. I already have stainless skillets If I wanted that then I would have used those. I stopped using teflon years ago from several incidences of it coming off in food. I finally gave up and ordered a 15 inch cast iron skillet instead. It will do everything this one will do and isnt disposable and foods dont stick. Heavy, yes, but for 2 years vs a life time.. Ill go back to old fashioned cast iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pan!!!!","review":"received this item quickly and started using immediately. I especially love the idea of no no long handle sticking out over the rest of the stove top...and the two side handle bars really don't get too hot to move the pan around, unless of course you use the pan in the oven. Do use a pot holder when removing the lid though, as it does get hot. This pan is large and the no-stick coating is great and cleans easily (i do wash by hand as don't want dishwasher detergents to ruin the coating. The quailty is excellent!...will order more in the future for gifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What was I waiting for?","review":"The Cuisinart Chef's Classic Everyday Pan was my first, but certainly not my last, piece of non-stick cookware and I could not be more pleased with its performance and durability.

I recommend this pan without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite pan","review":"Wow, Where do I start? The Price! For (...) a non-stick anodized 12 pan! What a deal. many have spent 3 time as much or more. The quality?Amazing! I enjoy the weight of the pan, not too heavy. It heats up well with no cold spots. I use it to sautee, stir fry, omletts , grilled sandwiches, I always coat the pan with a little oil. (A force of habit)nothing to do with the quaility of the pan. I enjoy cooking with it clean up is a breeze. I like the handles, my cooking space is small and didn't want handles that stood out. It comes with a glass lid. Very nice. Buy this you won't regret it. Makes a great gift for someone just starting out. Oh and I forgot the pan works just fine in the oven.It's March 2008 and I still love this pan! It's March 2010 and the pan has starting sticking. Broiled salmon in it and it had to be pryed off. Oh well. Still love this pan. Oh well back to shopping list you must go. I am getting another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite skillet","review":"I use this more than any other pan in my cabinet. It's easy to clean, it stays in good condition, and it's big enough for most everything I need to cook. I cook eggs, sear meat, cook burgers, etc., in this. My sister bought this as a gift for me a few years ago. She got it at Macy's and I think she paid $60 or more for it. I love this pan, but I think it is more reasonably priced here on amazon for around $30+. Macy's overpriced it. But I'm getting good use out of this skillet. I am thinking of buying another one. If I do, it'll be from Amazon, as long as they're still selling it. I highly recommend this for your everyday use. I also like the side handles as opposed to the regular one handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"warped on arrival","review":"Just got the pan and its going back. The bottom was warped right out of the box. Between this experience and that of a few other reviews just not sure whether to ask for another and just get my money back. It is a pretty light gauge and I wonder how long it will take to warp if I should get one that's flat. Its just the type of pan I wanted and its a great value - but only if its flat!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom warped","review":"I've used this pan for about 2 years and am now searching for an alternative. It has gotten so warped that it no longer heats evenly across the bottom. We like to pan sear steaks and chops, and it's a real hassle when the pan does not heat evenly. We use an LG electric glass cooktop and have not seen this problem with other pots or pans. The warping began about 6 months in and has gotten progressively worse. I think that the problem is that the pan is the same thickness (or thinness) all over. That makes it very lightweight, but also keeps it from sitting flat on the stove. I hope one with a thicker bottom will work better and for longer. Sorry that I could not be more positive.p.s. When they say wash by hand, they mean it. The dishwasher leaves ugly spots all over the surface. Not a factor for us, but if you like pretty pots, something to consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Pan!","review":"I added this to my 12 piece Cuisinart set. I'm so glad I did! I do use this everyday! It's my go to pan. It's great for spaghetti sauces, poaching eggs, frying eggs, meats, burgers, bacon...The pan and lid are really good quality, solid but not too heavy. Easy to clean, just handwash to keep it nice. Nothing sticks, it doesn't chip. Buy it and you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish the pan had deeper sides","review":"I love the shape and design of this pan and have used it to cook just about everything.

It's non-stick- I've even friend/poached eggs with no oil, and they didn't stick. It also cooks very evenly, though I find this makes it more difficult to brown things (like sausage). The lid is very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pan Ever!","review":"I have always had the utmost regard for Cuisinart and their quality of products. That is until I purchased this pan. This pan is warped on the bottom. Does not sit flat and rocks constantly. It also does not distribute the heat evenly. Everytime I use it I am frustrated and disappointed. It is worse than the cheap set of Farberware I got when I first moved out on my own 14 years ago. Ridiculous. I HATE this pan. I have no idea why I hate this pan so much and so many seem to love it. I wish I had gotten something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last long","review":"I bought this pan 11 months ago. It was beautiful to look at when I got it. However, the bottom did not sit flat on my flat surface range top. It worked great initially except I do prefer a long handle. After 8 month or so, food started to stick. Now I cannot cook anything starchy with it. I called Cuisinart asking about the life-time warranty. I was given an order number and told to ship the pan in. I will have to pay shipping + $10 check. They will inspect the pan and decided if it is a defect. I decided not to bother with that. I will not buy Cuisinart in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pan","review":"I like this pan so much that I ordered one for each of my 7 kids. i have heard from most of them that they really like it too.

A great everyday pan that can be used for just about everything! So, why the low rating. First, the coating scratched way to easily. After several years it looked like it had been in use for a decade. Secondly, the pan warped. It no longer is flat on the bottom. Probably, due to high heat. Isn't a pan supposed to take the heat?

If you want one for many years, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"If you asked me a year ago, I would have said this was my favorite everyday pan - slippery non-stick coating, even heat, glass lid, oven proof, sturdy handles, but after two years use, the non-stick coating has worn almost completely away from the bottom of the pan even with hand-washing and wooden/plastic utensils. Just about anything now sticks horribly. Not too impressive for a pan that supposedly retails for $80.Yes, it comes with a \\"life-time warranty\\", but that means paying for shipping both ways which comes close to the original purchase price...assuming Cuisinart will replace it. I would not buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good multi-purpose pan","review":"This is a very good pan both in size and quality.

At this point I have only used it once, but from that use I am very happy with the results. I shoot alot of landscapes and waterfall type of shots. The filter was able to gain me at least one-stop to slow my shutter down and the vivid color, once rotating the filter correctly, is very rich and dynamic.I owned a polarizer of lesser quality at just under what I paid for this filter, and I will tell you that the quality difference is not even close. I shoot with the Canon 17-85 USM IS lens and with this filter I have no loss of quality and crispness to my shots. With the other filter I spoke of there would be noticeable quality loss. So, for the money you can't beat this circular polarizer in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy -falls apart","review":"Works fine when it works, but it fell apart into two pieces after just three uses.

So you will read one page and then skip over then next couple or you will be reading the same text twice and straining your eyes.

Our boys, 4.5 and 6.5, love the whole series. That said, none of us can ignore the dreadful Kindle formatting. Some pages are mysteriously duplicated. Some exist as images of whole pages from the original book, others as disembodied text without their context. The images are small and occupy only part of the screen, unless you zoom in on them, but then it is impossible to scroll to the next page without exiting zoom mode.

It's jam-packed with references to Christianity, including Bible quotes, and preaches that everyone's neighbors should be Christian! If not, Ellis urges the reader to organize a family proselytizing event so the neighbors can discover the error of their ways! Does Ellis have any clue that there are other religions, not to mention atheists and agnostics in the world? I think not! She actually opens her family holiday chapter with \\"Is there a man, woman, boy, or girl alive who does not love Christmas?\\"!! This is more than offensive!

W.E.B Griffin, it is not. The story line is thinly scattered throughout a jumble of facts - some dramatically wrong. For example, a map of Betio has the island running essentially North-South instead of more East-West. The M-1 is characterised as prone to jamming and inaccurate when hot due to barrel heat which would have been a surprise to MacArthur and Patton who praised it highly.

Once you have the book and get past the cover, it says it is purley fictional. The author then uses some facts from other accounts of the battle, often poorly retold.

Good mystery, characters and book I've passed along to friends and relatives. Good story with Christian values sprinkled in appropriately without preaching or straying from a good escape story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justifiable Means","review":"Another great story from Terri Blackstock. I tend to stick to Christian authors because I enjoy the content. This book was no different. Terri can shape the characters into anything she desires. This book is full of romance, suspense and intrigue. A who-done-it that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I have now read all the books in this series. I am waiting patiently for another one of her fantastic stories. Thanks Terri."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This book is one of the few that I rank five stars. It is the best Terri Blackstock book I've read thus far, and I highly recommend it. The characters are realistic and the plot well balanced with action and mystery to keep your heart and mind engaged. All her stories are suspenseful and intriguing, but this one is exceptionally well done. As all her books, it engages the reader in a dramatic, moral dilemma and provides inspirational, spiritual lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superhero with Human Problems","review":"This book starts off at the point where Hal Jordan, ex-Green Lantern of sector 2814, had decided to give up being a Green Lantern (GL). He decided that being a GL had severely affected his personal life, and thus decided to start a normal life. However, Guy Gardner, another GL, is sore that he is Earth's GL only because Hal gave up the responsibility. Thus he keeps disrupting Hal's new life, and refuses to leave Hal alone. Things take a turn for the worse when a crazy Guardian decided to start his own collection of cities from around the universe. The book focuses a lot on Hal's thoughts, about the choices he has made, and what he wants out of his life. I would not recommend this book, unless one is into heavy issues in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"an uninformed author","review":"Millions of unwanted cats are euthanized every year in the US and Dr. Morris insists that spaying and neutering are unnecessary and cruel operations.

I wasn't the only one at home who enjoyed it at home, which tells me that \\"Hypnotic Safari\\" has a very broad appeal. The guitar is very clean and crisp, and the tunes are snappy or relaxingly mellow. Very enjoyable, and the term \\"hypnotic\\" really did describe the feeling.If you are a fan of Ottmar Liebert, you'd probably also like this particular CD from Wayne Wesley Johnson and Ruben Romero. The sound is very polished, and the cuts blend from one to the next smoothly. I found I could play this CD from start to finish without having to skip over the bits I didn't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real winner!","review":"I have reviewed music before and the artist were of my choosing. When I was asked to review this album I wasn't sure of what to expect. After listening to the cd I must admit that there is real undiscovered talent in Wayne Wesley Johnson.This easy listening music extravaganza is simply some of the best music ever recorded and my only regret is that I did not get a chance to listen to it before. There is 60 minutes on 11 tracks that will both entertain and relax you at the same time.Simply amazing is all I can say about the way the music blend a Spanish mix with jazz and a little r&b. Johnson makes the music flow and before you know the 60 minutes is up and you'll find yourself replaying the cd over and over again.With a sound that is sure to please all lovers of music this album is first rate and loaded with the sounds that sooth. A sure fire winner and you have to hear it to believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazzawhat?","review":"With enough name-dropping for a few dozen records, the linernotes of this album describe Hypnotic Safari not as a safari of animalsbut of guitars. Not a great analogy, but for a guitar enthusiast this mightbe an intriguing album. Jazz guitarist Wayne Wesley Johnson hooks upwith New Age flamenco guitarist Ruben Romero to produce what Johnsoncalls \\"jazzamenco\\" - a name I hope he soon gives up on - but no matter,you get the picture. At its worst, this is good elevator music, and atits best, it's relaxing, jazzed-up flamenco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design Throughout","review":"Great set of games but the design is all wrong.

One area that I either missed or it was not covered was how to transistion a child from public school to homeschooling (mid-year). Homeschooling was not really an option at the beginning of the school year, but circumstances arose that lead to the decision not quite half way through the year (6th grade).I skipped around the book from section to section as I had questions and needed answers.I can't compare this book to any other on the subject because it is the only one I have read.

I want to homeschool or find an alternative form of education for my daughter because I don't like what's happening at my local public school district. Even though I am a Christian, this book made me feel like i was in a fringe group, that it wasn't addressed to me.It does have some good information in it, it also portrays the weird homeschooler stereotype that i think she's probably trying to avoid.Go somewhere else. go somewhere where each page doesn't drip with biases and heavily opinionated material masquerading as fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not for you if you actually have a mind and think for yourself","review":"I am new to homeschooling and thought by looking at the book that this would be a great scource for me.

I don't plan on my children living in a bubble and only being around others who think the same and do exactly the same. How boring is that?I also didn't realize when I purchased the book that she is a medical expert in the field of learning disabilities (ADD/ADHD). Wow! to be so smart as to know it all.ADD/ADHD doesn't exist according to this book.

When someone calls Earth Day celebrations at a public school \\"pagan\\" and something worrisome, well ... enough said.

While I was waiting for my order to arrive I checked out \\"The Homeschooling Book of Answers : The 88 Most Important Questions Answered by Homeschooling's Most Respected Voices\\" from my local library.

Keely definitely swings Basie-style, using his musical style to interpret timeless standards as \\"How High The Moon,\\" and \\"Mood Indigo.\\" The cd also includes swing versions of \\"How Sweet It Is\\" and \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You,\\" which captures and re-introduces the beautiful essence of the big-band Swing music era. Keely Smith began her career as the female singer in Louis Prima's band which recently inspired \\"The Gap\\" to use \\"Jump, Jive, and Wail\\" in one of their ad campaigns. I'm glad to see that Swing is back in swing, and this album is definitely a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can she sound so good!","review":"How is it possible for Keely Smith to sound better than ever? It's astounding that this woman, who unabashedly admits to being 74, has the voice of a singer in her prime. The voice is pure and rich, swinging when hot, longing when blue, bringing back memories of singers sadly gone. The only thing better than listening to this album is to see the great lady in person as I was lucky enough to do in Cerritos, CA recently. I promise, you'll leave the theatre to a chorus of patrons wondering how Keely could be so absolutely terrific! What a pleasure to have her around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Album ever made.","review":"I love this album, with a vengeance! The symphonic tone of guitar solos make me want to punch babies.

We decided the hassle of return outweighed our considerations for buying this type of product from Kitchenaid again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toronto Strings","review":"You can totally hear Toronto in Owen Pallet's strings. No wonder why Pallet has received most of the credits for Final Fantasy, his melodies are incredibly awsome. I must highlight the fact this is not an easy album, even though the melodies are friendly, it took me about four times listening to it to really get it. But after that, the results are great. \\"Has A Good Home\\" is a mix of the Indie Canadian Scene with some classic structures and instrumentation. Opening with \\"No one of you will ever see a penny\\" followed by \\"This is the dream of Win and Regine\\" is just like the opening of a movie or a play, those two tracks set the path for what's coming next. And if lyrics like \\"Montreal might eat it's young, but Montreal won't break us down\\" doesn't put you in the right Canadian mood, when you arrive to \\"The CN tower belongs the the dead\\" you are listening to Canada made into music.

And he talks about the \\"how\\" -- how to forgive those who've wronged you; how to maintain integrity in the business world; how to overcome loneliness; and how to deal with the doubts that pester everyone. His chapter on Jesus' most controversial claim -- that He's the one and only Son of God -- is worth the price of the book!

Yet, I felt when reading this book, if only heterosexual love could always be this fulfilling and deep. Todd and Jacob definitely got the idea of commitment and love RIGHT in this book. We should all do as well. While I (a heterosexual) have no bias whatsoever to the gay lifestyle, I hold optimism, through this book, that those struggling with acceptance of this issue will find their answers here. The only part of the book I didn't really care for was Summer's extremely long lasting confusion about Nicholas. I loved the quotes throughout the book.

Good job on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. I laughed, I cried, it was thought provoking.

The lady in the book, Cassandra, was a real person and was the daughter of my 7th great grandfather's brother Joshua. The story was true about many things. ie... family members, husband and the area and other persons in the story line, especially that she was captured and died at sea due to pirates, but the differing personalities are questionable as we cant know what they were really like. Some attributes to Joshua being such a harsh man, could actually be disputed as he was very much hailed as a staunch Methodist Christian.

The overall theme of this book is worship. Keller is in love with his God, and it is hard to go more than a paragraph before you find more words of praise for God and Jesus.Keller weaves the metaphor of the relationship between sheep and a shepherd like no one else could. He raised sheep for years, so he has exquisite knowledge of what it is like to raise sheep. Not only does he expound on what the psalm can mean to your spiritual life, he also gives interesting information on sheep and how to raise them.Some of Keller's comparisons of Jesus to a shepherd astonished me, and I was left with a feeling of comfort. I've always been familiar with this psalm, but Keller explaining the actual herding terms and how dependent sheep are on their shepherd made me stop and think. Excellent read. Definitely worth having on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Classic","review":"The 23rd Psalm is the most beloved psalm for many people, especially in the KJV or NKJV versions - 'yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. . .' (paraphrasing this deadens the impact of the King James english). Keller's wonderful and informative book about being a shepherd will enrich your reading of the psalm. He takes the 23rd Psalm line by line and explains it in terms of the experience of a good shepherd. The book is a jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"abridged too far","review":"This is an abridged version of what is already a short book. I bought it on Amazon by mistakte thinking it was the original.

It is as good as any devotional, always pointing back to the Savior and Shepherd of our souls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener on this famous Psalm","review":"If anyone ever wondered what the various phrases in Psalm 23 really meant, this book explains them, one by one, from the perspective of a man who actually worked as a shepherd. I was in a Bible Study, and was given this little book which was a tremendous blessing and eye opener for this Psalm which I have quoted many many times during lengthy medical procedures and tests. I really treasure the explanations. Thanks Mr. Keller, for writing this book. You made this Psalm come literally alive in my heart and mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Amazing!","review":"Philip Keller was the son of missionaries in E. Africa. Later, a sheep owner and rancher. And finally a lay pastor. His life experiences provide the expertise needed to unearth the rare gems buried within Psalm 23.

It made the 23d Psalm come alive with its many parallels between the shepherd and his sheep and Christ and his beloved redeemed.

In addition to that, he served as the lay pastor (shepherd) of a community church, spending time feeding and leading that flock of people for several months. Consequently, Phillip Keller is intimately acquainted through first hand experience with the life of a shepherd. This personal experience in shepherding manifests itself in his tremendous insights into the relationship between a shepherd and his sheep. This book definitely gave me an increased understanding of a Shepherd's work. This book gave me an even greater appreciation for my Shepherd and it encouraged me to an even greater faith in God's wisdom and ways. I highly recommend this book.Harlan D. Betz, author of \\"Setting the Stage for Eternity\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thoughts on the Good Shepherd!","review":"Keller has written a title that will always be considered a Christian classic.Keller writes with the unique perspective of being an actual shepherd and using his experiences to reflect on deeper meanings of the 23rd Psalm.Each chapter heading is titled with a portion of the 23rd Psalm. For example, Chapter 1 is entitled \\"The Lord is My Shepherd\\" while Chapter 12 is entitled \\"I Will Dwell in the House of the Lord For Ever\\".He balances his thoughts between the loving and gentle guidance of a caring shepherd with the hard actions a shepherd must sometimes take to keep the sheep together - a perfect illustration of how we Christians can sometimes act.Read and be encouraged in the Good Shepherd who loves His sheep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"A simple basic book at the inner knowledge of Psalm 23.

I am in the midst of reading A Layman Looks at The Lord's Prayer and am finding that it is equally illuminating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23","review":"I ordered this book to replace the first 2 I bought and gave away to others. The writer was indeed a shepherd and his words are exactly the key to greater understanding of the ideal way to pray. Living in the open outdoors and the solitude of a shepherds world, he helps we town and city dwellers appreciate the meaning of a shepherds love and dedication to his responsibility of caring for his sheep. We are sheep to our master, the parallels of being under his care, as the sheep is under the shepherds care, are rich with life lessons and truths. I am indeed thankful for this well stated book that helps me appreciate more the richness of God's love and care for me and to be thankful for his all knowing watchful care as I live. The final reward will be my security of an eternal home because I trust and give him praise and honor for how he has blessed and guided my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Mountain","review":"This book \\"found me\\" 30 years ago and I am still an enthusiastic reader, giving several copies a year to friends who are struggling with issues and faith.

WOW! what a wake up call. Now that I understand that He is continually seeking and searching for me, is my provider in all things, I am in awe.

I can usually get used to a written dialect (Hagrid in Harry Potter, everyone in Their Eyes Were Watching God), not so with this book.Also, the plot goes nowhere for 3/4 of the book. I'm sure there was a climax in there somewhere, but I never found it. The ending was a cliffhanger. It was a fittingly crappy ending for a crappy book.

If God changed your circumstance the way you wanted Him to, then this book is probably not for you. This book is for the person who has been struggling with a major life trial and has tried relentlessly to manipulate God and control the circumstance. For me, this book brought me to the \\"next level\\" with God because I was able to learn to stop needing to change my circumstance and relish the close relationship that God has offered me in this moment.

It is nice I guess, but you can get the same effect with a fork and a toaster or a sturno can and save $179.00. I have a fondue set and before we got this they would use the fondue forks over the sturno for the fondue and get the same effect. The little marshmallow toasting area is so small on these that you can really only toast one at a time even though it comes with 4 forks.

This was one of the misses. While Piper does have many good things to say throughout the text, it's thoroughly incoherent. I understand that, being a devotional text, it's bound to be somewhat incoherent, but there was no flow whatsoever - no connection from one essay to the next.Compounding that, many of the essays dealt with topics that I didn't find to be particularly appropriate for a devotional book such as abortion. While I agree with his views on such subjects, I didn't find them to be good starting points for meditation.In the end, if you're looking for a devotional book, I wouldn't recommend this.

Learning bird songs and calls is like learning a new language. I like that, in these CD's, the songs and calls are, for all intents and purposes, separated out from other birds. You can clearly hear the bird on which you are focusing. I also like that the songs and calls are repeated. The explanations and \\"handles\\" to \\"grab on to\\" to hold the particular songs and calls are helpful. (In my opinion, the narrator in these CD's is a bit off, tone-wise, when he imitates the bird with a \\"handle\\" phrase, but the phrase is still helpful.)I mainly listen to the CD's in the car, but in a perfect world, I would listen AND look at the bird I am hearing. I think that would help me learn better. Also, the birds are heard in groupings; I would love to be able to go to the song of a particular bird, rather than a grouping, but...still a great set of CD's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Source","review":"Excellent recordings and presentation make learning bird songs easy.

I liked those so much I tracked down this CD to hear more. I wasn't disappointed. This is an excellent CD set. The field recordings and production values are second to none. The sound quality is superb. Dick Walton helps us sort out all of these complex sounds and match them to the birds that sing them.

The casting of Gary Cooper is crucial - the former Western hero is now sick, mad, guilty, dangerous, demonised by a bureaucratic military.As a courtroom drama this is more intelligent than most, cleverly using the cliches for non-traditional ends. Preminger would go on to make THE great courtroom drama a few years later with 'Anatomy of a Murder', which had the benefit of a more entertaining script; but this one boasts a very disturbing portrait of browbeaten patriotism from Gary Cooper, and a rare Hollywood appearance from my childhood heroine, Samantha Stevens, known to mortals as Elizabeth Montgomery."},{"rating":"2","title":"ICourt-Martial of Billy Mitchell","review":"This is one of those older films that has to be approached with a forgiving eye remembering that special effects were not the polished and every-day products that we enjoy today.

So I put it in my player just to check it out. And what do I see? Some kind of letterbox image (about 1:2) far from the correct aspect ratio, but better than full screen. Alas, it is not enhanced for anamorphic playback, and the colors are washed out and fuzzy! So is the focus, and there is some kind of \\"net\\" pattern so obvious and distracting most of the time, that I finally decide to rate this DVD as unwatchable! Sad, indeed! Yet another disaster from Artisan, one of many DVD distributors that you cannot rely on. Sure, they have given us some pretty nice transfers, but most are far below acceptable standards. When will these people learn that quality means happy consumers, and happy consumers means better sales?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE! Outstanding film...Disastrous DVD transfer......","review":"BUYER BEWARE! This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and an outstanding story of someone who saw the future and confronted an intractable system stuck in the past. However the DVD transfer from Artisan entertainment is a disaster. The film looks as if it has been filtered through a pantyhose, forcing you to lower your screen resolution in order to watch the film, and even then the results are less than satisfactory. The performances of Gary Cooper, Ralph Bellamy and Rod Steiger are worth the price of admission, if only the DVD transfer could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Poor Transfer","review":"I can only agree with all the positive comments about the movie itself. From the vintage shots of the old Army and Navy Club building to the early performances by a lot of great actors, this movie is one of the must-haves! There is however, one acting dissapointment: doesn't Gary Cooper seem sort of wooden throughout the film? He never seems very comfortable in uniform, and still can't salute worth a damn.Sadly, the technical aspects of this transfer leave a lot to be desired. I last saw this movie about 30 years ago on the late-late show (or maybe it was the early-early show) on one of the old local UHF stations and this version looks worse. I think the crappy analog, broadcast version of this movie was superior to what we have here. At it's core, this is a very poorly done transfer that is fuzzy, washed out, bad audio, and wrong picture aspect as to what is on the box. Can't honestly recommend it in it's current version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty, functional, pricey","review":"This is a sturdy and attractive surge protector.

Two magnificent voices, whether or not you like their style! The music is powerfully hypnotic and the lyrics are a true prayer to God or to any higher power. It is a love song, classically written and executed, and yet as tender as a child's prayer. Everytime I hear this song, I get tears in my eyes and an ache in my heart for all the blessings in my life. May he sing forever, and you too, Celine - you are truly gifted.

I like the mouse on the left, while others like it on the right. Either way, it works with ease. Another feature of this Kensington model is that it has several anti-skid circles (for lack of a better term) on the base, so the whole device stays put while in use on a desk or other such surface.

But his words lend assurance to those of us who search Scripture for truth and for a guide to our faith journey -- a journey that tries to navigate between the contortions of literal readings and the iconoclasm of liberal theology. He is especially cogent when he proposes how the Lambeth Conference should have approached searching for meaning in Scripture -- a love-inspired, serious approach other denominations grappling with issues of the day could learn from. I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, and one of a kind study tool","review":"I have been using this Bible for 4 years for reference and study. Dr. Morris' notes have been a blessing through the years, especially the extensive notes in Genesis and the entire New Testament. This is the best specialty study Bible out there and I would recommend every Evangelical or Fundamentalist Christian who cares about the Bible, it's truths, and proofs for its truth add Dr. Morris'lifetime of passion for God and His Word to their study library.Plus it gets bonus points for only being available in the King James Bible.

When I finished reading his book, I cried because I now understood that what happened to me a long time ago was not my fault.

The crowd did not know who he was and they went nuclear on this cut. This is also the first CD that has all original material. His first CD \\"Howling Mercy\\" is tough to find, but is a little raw but excellent. This CD is more refined, but still has raw chops on it. Let me leave you with one great line from one of all great songs on this ass kicker. \\"When death comes for me, the preacher better be packing heat\\".....get the idea??

I should have taken my 13 dollars and ate it. This was a bad idea. The only difference in the versions is that one band is untalented. The singer DOES NOT sound at all like Geoff Tate of Queensryche or Geddy but more like someone from a bad 80's metal band. This is shameful and an utter waste of money.

I do not understand why everything thinks this novel is so tough. Stark's writing style is so dry it takes any excitement out of the action sequences. And the bit about Parker having strong hands is way too played out. Parker has strong hands, I get it. I won't even go into how many holes this plot had.

And the very worst of all is the ring which is the most horrible tinny sound!I bought it as a back up landline phone after the Sandy storm, as all other phones I have are cordless and require being plugged in to the electricity.

I can't find any covers to fit this massive book, and so it is just falling apart before my eyes. In addition, I do not agree with the commentary used in connection with this particular Bible; it is a bit too historically literal for my faith. I would recommend this translation, but not this particular production of it. The only reason it gets a star at all is due to the super margins, which leave tons of room for notes, personal commentary, and other writings one would care to enter."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice product","review":"ordered this as a gift. unlike the other review this did come packaged, in plastic, in the box, and with all the instructions and hardware. we have not installed it so i will leave that part out of the review, but it arrived in great shape, just as descried, without damage.

It can surely be no accident that cultural differences amongst the population on this planet rarely have any bearing on the \\"facts\\" surrounding the abduction phenomenon. I was not surprised to read what Jacobs had to say, but the methodical approach he has taken in researching the phenomenon adds a great deal of credence to the subject in general. The big question is if the reality of Alien abduction is nothing more than a fantasy, then why does Jacobs' research highlight similarities in many unconnected events so well. I couldn't put it down. It's an excellent book, which presents a very plausible argument for those wishing to understand WHY THEY are here."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book based on extensive research","review":"This book is about evaluating the pattern that emerges from the numerous abduction cases. The vast majority abductions repeatedly show certain characteristics that occur again and again.

According to \\"The Threat\\", aliens and their hybrid offspring are in the final stage of a genetic infiltration of humanity and will take over Earth after a soon-to-occur catastrophic event. And most horrifyingly, there appears to be nothing whatever we can to to prevent it. I've never seen a UFO and have generally regarded abduction reports as inherently incredible, but Dr. Jacobs has presented a well-researched and well-written book that must be read - and heeded. Although Dr. Jacobs knows that his theory will not be taken seriously and therefore believes it is too late to reverse The Threat, I cannot concur. If enough people do take heed, there may still be time to halt the apparently inveitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE most informative book on hybrid life","review":"I have read many, many books on this subject and this is the best book written so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk On The Darkside","review":"What disturbs me most about the Jacobs book is his single-minded pursuit of a single theory to explain all aspects of the alien abduction phenomenon. He glibly excludes the many reported descriptions of alien abductors collected worldwide which don't conform to his template model of what aliens are supposed to look like and act like. I kept hoping to read somewhere in this fear reactive tome about his own doubts concerning this thesis, as most balanced objective authors would include, but there was nothing like that, only his firm unshakeable faith in his own conclusions of gloom and doom.Try reading a book like COSMIC TEST TUBE, which traces the origins of all theories relating to alien visitation, and you will be able to view David Jacobs and his ideas in a historical context which makes his paranoia a logical outgrowth of 40 years worth of increasingly bizarre abduction reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too sensational and not all that scientific...","review":"Maybe I'm just not enough of a believer, but the claims made in this book seem a little too sensational and purely based on interpretation of past events, the reconstruction of which through hypnosis is widely debated (and often criticized). However, Dr. Jacobs is a respected academician, so perhaps he should be given the benefit of the doubt. Bottom line: interesting reading, but if you are looking for something convincing on the subject of alien abduction, I wouldn't be too quick to grab this treatment of the topic. P.S. Well written and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next Friday Soundtrack Is Not As Good As You Would Expect","review":"This much hyped about soundtrack is not what you would expect from Ice Cube and company. The key elements from this soundtrack are somehow missing. For example, the new N.W.A.'s song, \\"Chin Check,\\" is just not the same without the late Eazy-E. No one can replace Eazy-E's spot, and Snoop Dogg's attempt is a little too much to bare. However, some good songs, like Eminem's \\"Murder, Murder,\\" and unknown artist, Toni Estes's \\"Hot,\\" may provide a little enjoyment of this soundtrack.

I WOULD RECOMMEND THE CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not many bright spots","review":"Most of the tracks on this CD are forgettable, as is the case with most hip-hop soundtracks. The first Ice Cube track is disappointing, which only reaffirms my belief that he has fallen from grace. The N.W.A. track inspires the same feelings. Why are they even back together? The time for this kind of hip-hop has passed. Other big name tracks (Wyclef, Wu-Tang), are unimpressive. The bright spots on this CD come from the lesser known artists (Lil' Zane, Toni Estes). Overall I cannot recommend this CD. The soundtrack to the original Friday was good (if you don't have that one, definitely pick it up), and so was the movie. Unfortunately, this soundtrack is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILD OUT!","review":"This is a great one, Wu Tang didit again. Lil Strecth is ill. Wyclef who is the chick at the end.

But to tell the truth the only good tracks on the album are Ice Cube and Ms. Toi's \\"You Can Do It\\", Toni Estes' \\"Hot\\", and the BEST track of all, Aaliyah's \\"I Don't Wanna\\". I can already tell you that single will be HOT, and it's enough to buy the CD just for that song. But as a DIRTY SOUTH hotgirl, I was SOOOO disappointed in \\"Good Friday\\", the track with Big Tymers and Lil' Wayne. If you're still into Bone and NWA I guess you'd like the album.

They overplay the single \\"wasting my time\\" throught, but for an introduction to the band it is nice.If you like Nickeback, Theory of a Deadman, 3 Doors Down, or Shinedown, you will probably like this group.

It does have some nice notes but the US Gov't should demand that Ernst & Young pay royalties to them...that's us taxpayers. No wonder the Big Five is now the Big Four and if this is what is out there perhaps soon to be the Big Three. E&Y has shown us a very poor example of business ethics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in wide screen!","review":"A DVD, released in 2011, that's not in wide screen? I kept fiddling with the picture size but no, the package clearly states 1.37:1 The Amazon item description has it at 1.33:1. Either way it's ridiculous. There aren't that many square TVs anymore and even if you still have one that works you won't for long. It's almost the equivalent of buying something now on VHS. There won't be anything to play it on soon.I'm giving this one star based solely on the fact that it's not in wide (now = standard) format but I can't add anything good about the movie. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy an actual ticket when this thing was playing. I have no idea why the reviews were so good. If I had seen it in a theater at least I would have been bored to tears in its original wider format."},{"rating":"2","title":"....may seem to some like a film made up of deleted scenes....","review":"Definitely different....it seems to be nothing more than everyday life while traveling westward in mid-19th century America....but there is more to it if you care to look closely....there seems to be no resolution in the ending, but it's there if you care to see it....the visuals are fantastic on the blu-ray--the 5.1 surround is immersive....I can't fault the film maker for trying something different....may put some people to sleep....great film...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumped in the desert.","review":"This movie was very realistic and a lot of effort was spent on detail. The scenery and characters also were believable. The story never tried to be a typical western. By the time it was over, I was more drained and tired than the characters. The only interesting part was, what the Indian was up to. Was he setting a trap? Was he amusing himself, watching them suffer, and search for water? The ending explained nothing. There is never a beginning, or an ending. I wonder if the book ended that way too? Just dumped in the desert. One word will sum it up. Tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"I am a bit relieved that this wasn't one of those movies I didn't care for that got loads of great reviews. This was recommended by friends of ours. I agree with the overall rating from the reviewers on this one. The scenery is great, and would have been nice on the big screen. BUT, the movie is tedious. It starts slow, and part way in I have to put on the subtitles, because we just couldn't hear some of the dialogue. It got a bit more interesting in the middle, but about the time I was expecting a conclusion, the ending credits came on. As far as the cast, the one woman had a really irritating voice, and another melted down in a way that drove me up the wall. Michelle Williams was the highlight, and if the others we actually supposed to be that annoying, kudos to the casting crew. I looked at the screen at the end and thought that I just wasted almost 2 hours. If not for the scenery and a bit of the middle, it is a one-star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Once you get used to the lack of dialogue this really allows you to experience what life on the early Oregon Trail may have been like.Set over only a few days of travel it portrays the less exciting side of the trail as well as the conflict between parties within the small wagon train.To comment on the ending would be to create a spoiler, but it does leave you thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I consider this to be a very realist view of what the pioneers suffered. I think it's worth seeing and I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"This movie was very disappointing to me. I had read the book about Meek's cutoff and was looking forward to the movie. The sound was terrible-the whispering in the dark was barely audible. The faroff conversations among the men were sketchy and you could only catch a few words. The lighting in the night scenes was terrible. The ending was terrible. The native american's acting was terrible. Don't waste your time watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Plan 9 From Outer Space Look Like High Drama","review":"I have watched thousands of movies over the last 50+ years and this ranks as the worst I have ever wasted 2 hours of my life on. Without question the stupidest ending ever. No character development, pointless story that goes nowhere. DO NOT rent, buy, borrow or watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutoff After 35 Minutes!","review":"Well-meaning but painfully ponderous slice of hard-scrabble realism that I refused to waste any time watching. After 35 minutes, I hit the stop button. This is a film that tries so hard to immerse the viewers into the austere, sparse experience of pioneer life that its director forgot that certain cinematic conventions such lighting and sound need to be maintained so as not to distract. I'm only guessing but the other oddity of this misguided attempt is the 4x3 aspect ratio---was it employed to lend a reality-tv feel to the whole affair?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Boring Movie in 40 Yrs","review":"I screened this movie in anticipation of purchasing it for my Dad, who loves classic westerns like those starring Tom Selleck, Bob Duvall etc. Thank goodness I did. I'm annoyed enough from sitting through THE MOST BORING MOVIE IN 40 YEARS, IN ANY GENRE. If I paid actual money, I'd be furious.Here's the plot: Lost homesteaders wander around the desert. There - I just saved you 2 hrs. You're welcome! There are good stories about the Oregon Trail that would make terrific movies. Why they approved this thing for production is beyond me. It's a DOG!I sincerely hope moviemakers release a decent Western before Christmas, because otherwise I'm stuck for what to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You got to be kidding me!","review":"You have got to be kidding, is the exact words I uddered when this movie ended, wait when it stopped, because there was no ending. The reviewer who said they went nowhere to get nowhere was correct. I watched alot of it in fast forward, just to get to a place where something happens it never did.you can not hear some parts and can't see others. They gathered firewood 3 times and guess what Those were probably the most exciting parts in this movie. I still watched to the end thinking something has to come out of this, but no. The movie simply ends.If you are a laid back person with alot of time to waste you might gamble with this. Even then I would't recommend it. If your a western fan such as me, this will be a complete waste of your time. This is the second western DVD that I have traded in, I usally keep all westerns, unless they are awful. This one is aweful if you can even truly call it a western."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sit in the dark and do nothing!!!","review":"My title says what this movie does. It certainly must have cost nothing to make! How much time can a movie spend in the dark with only a lantern lit and absolutely no dialogue? Well, this movie gets the record. What I really want to know is, what is the point of this film? To make you sit in front of it for an hour and a half waiting for something to happen but nothing ever does? Three families wander across the Oregon desert for a whole movie, with no action whatsoever and almost no dialogue. The most exciting thing that happened during the whole film was watching a donkey bay and a bird squawk! Well folks, that's about it. And the ending? Nothing, absolutely nothing is concluded. Wow, what a waste. Why are more and more movies like this even made? I don't get it. Why don't you all spend your money supporting my art, that I've been trying to get produced for years?

Literally.SPOILER ALERT! Some Plot Elements Will Be Discussed!The film opens on the Oregon Trail. There is no background presented. The viewer is left to piece the story together.I rented it because I am very interested in The Lost Blue Bucket Mine. And the folks do find some gold nuggets. Which is more than I can say as a viewer.My biggest beef is nothing really happens. Eventually the film ends as it began - the journey hasn't ended.The photography is beautiful, which is why I gave it two stars. It is well acted, given the constraints of the script (ie, no real plot). Motion and action are not an adequate substitute for a story.It is very realistic. I liked Stephen Meeks' tall tales.But, bottom line, nothing much happens to these good people.

If not, you're in for a tedious, monotonous, characterless annoyance. Would have worked at 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"parched monotony","review":"Two hours in waiting for the plot to start, and randomly, the ending credits roll. Even more unforgiveable than the ending was the time spent filming conversations in pitch darkness. By the ending of the movie, I was just relieved a husband dropped instead of one of the oxen - who were far more engaging characters. Apparently the canary died off-screen, so even that bit of action was considered too disruptive of the intended parched monotony. And just what was being shoveled into the girl scout fire pit - is that when they buried the canary?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Western doesn't need cowboys","review":"A Western doesn't need cowboys. This is a very good film about ordinary folks (at least as ordinary as folks get who decide to cross a continent to find better lives) dealing with the trials of life on the trail. Many of those trials are born of man rather than nature which underpins the movie with constant tension. A somewhat more conventional ending would have probably been more satisfying, but the ending is very much in the style of Reichardt's other films and succeeds on its own terms.Great cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible waste of time and money","review":"This movie was awful.

I could go on and on about how pathetic this movie is but I'm still trying to get the old 70's western music and that one squeaky wagon wheel out of my head. They claim it won film festival awards. Well, the only way that could be was the director is related to someone in charge, they were all drunk or they never actually watched the movie. The best part of the movie was when the DVD froze up.

Quick Summary: The beginning was slow, the middle was slower---and the (predictable) ending took a nap. All the actors were mediocre at best. The dialog was clumsy and oftentimes non-sensible. (Were they adlibbing...or what?) The night scenes were horrendous! I've seen movies from the 30's and 40's with better lighting technique than this one had. Instead of the super fancy (albeit cumbersome) packaging done for their commercial-driven DVD...they should have used that money to pay for state-of-the-art lighting equipment. Lastly, I do hope the director was not trying to suggest that the \\"script-method\\" and the \\"three women\\" displayed in this movie even remotely compare to Robert Altman's movie of 3 Women.

Mainly the character of Ralph, who I found impetuous, hot-headed, and at times downright foolish. And there were certain plot and points and motivations that didn't really stand up to scrutiny. But I applaud Bram for writing intelligent gay fiction that deals with valid themes, an antidote to the campy fluff that characterizes so much gay writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing after father of frankenstein","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed Father of Frankenstein, but found this book difficult and unpleasant. Protagonist's voice was grating and clubby, assumming I was sympathetic and knowing of all his stereotypical positions. Treatment of politics was heavy handed and unsubtle. Didn't feel like an attempt to reach anyone other than people who already \\"think like him.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and insipid","review":"I've read most of Bram's books, and this was by far the most dissappointing. The idea of a liberal and conservative gay man falling in love should be rife with possibilities. Instead, the auther never truly examines the characters' motives. He offers conflicting views instead of character depth. And what begins as a potential love story, views wildly off course to become a murder mystery (who cares?) and a melodrama. I would hope that another auther will find this premise and truly explore it for all it's possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and Politics and Very Strange Bedfellows","review":"In Christopher Bram's Gossip, Ralph Eckhart pays the price of sleeping with the enemy (a closeted spokesman for the Chritian Coalition). He becomes deeply involved in scandal and murder resulting from his horny decision. The murder myster element is not strong but it is used more as catalyst for the narrator to explore all of his issues about sex, politics, and where and how one takes a personal stand in both arenas. It is not the author's best work but there is enough of interest to sustain the reader and small moments of insight and beauty. The quiet, unsettling ending was the set at the perfect pitch. An enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly entertaining.","review":"Somebody brought this over to watch, I had never even heard of it. I watched this with really low expectations, and came away with a decent story of 2 brothers (1 white/1 black), and their struggles with life.One struggles with drugs while the other simply struggles with himself, you don't really find out why immediately though. Deborah Cox did an excellent job as a side story about her life while playing one of the brother's girlfriend.All in all it was a really low budget movie with an entertaining cast and story that kept me interested (not easy to do) till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love GO AWAY!!!Please","review":"Alright now Larenz Tate is an excellent actor, but this movie is not worth applying towards his credits. The story line could have been good, but the way they unfolded this story line was boring!!!!!!Deborah Cox is an extraodinary singer and the little bits that you hear in this movie is the best part of the movie. Now this should have been a made for t.v. movie, because the little nude scenes could have been omitted and the few cuss words were not necessary either. I wish Larenz Tate had scrapped this movie and went back to the drawing board and started over. Sorry, not a good dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I only rented it ...","review":"I've never heard of this movie, but when I saw it at ...[the local video store], I just knew it was going to be good...NOT!... Larenz Tate was great to look at, and Deborah Cox, I could listen to her sing all day. But that movie was just dumb. What was the point to it? It was just no story line at all. First of all, I think they should have used a biracial child to play Larenz's part, because they were all off in that area. Maybe they should have had their friend play it. It would have been more believable. Oh well, don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"Well I saw this movie and I really didn't like it too much.

The songs on this groundbreaking album were written over many years, and are so diverse that most tracks sound like a new artist. Ballads, punk, acapella, odd time signatures, great guitar riffs, strange harmonies, unique voice.

After listening to it last night I must sadly report that I was disappointed. The quality of the performances by the New York production was very inferior to those of the Stratford Festival.

Mix the aforementioned bands with late '60s psychedelia, droning fuzz, and douse the whole thing in washes of reverb and you'll get an idea of what Loop is about. Their albums are enigmatic, hipnotic, repetitive, and yes, that is a recommendation. Spacemen 3, Ride, the Telescopes, all these fellow so called \\"shoegaze\\" groups truly pale in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still amazing 20 years later...","review":"Blissful feedback, hypnotic guitars and bass... this is a wonderful masterpiece I'm so happy I finally got my hands on a copy.

They can easily open the flexible flap but it stays closed with a magnet. So it works great for us.

I first heard this (before most of the US population) while visiting NYC. The music is what is says, street wise. It has a definite beat throughout the album, one that is easy to dance to.

Whoa! Heaven forbid it's not coporate or commercial music. I've lost my way. Okay, I'm just going to make this short and sweet. If you have doubts, at least give the artist a chance and there's nothing wrong with not liking a certain artists music because it's not your taste, but at least give the music a chance before you judge it.

Over-hyped. It is too self-conciously trying to be british street culture for its own good and forgetting the most important thing - the music.Anyone can produce an album like this - just carry a dictaphone around with you the pubs and clubs in london. Then recite in a clumsy way some of things you hear on play back to basement beats and rhyme now and again. Also, don't do it in time.The dilemma is that if he sang in a brummie accent it would even be more hilarious but he opts for mockney.Some of this is cringeworthy in the extreme.

It is only when an artists comes along with something truly new and different that rap becomes interesting again. Mike Skinner (a.k.a. The Streets) has done that. By rapping about the life and struggles of a Brittish working class citizen he creates images and relates ideas that have far more in common with most rap fans than Bling Bling and Hot Booty. On \\"Don't Mug Yourself\\" he raps about the dangers of falling too quickly for a young \\"bird\\" and the help his friends offer. On the single currently being featured on The Much Music USA Network, \\"Let's Push Things Forward\\", he asks why as music listeners, we keep settling and consuming the same old pop ..., and don't ask for something different and better. On Original Pirate Material, he provides just this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know one A+R guy who should lose his gig :)","review":"He tried something different. I'll always give points for that.

It isn't off beat.\\" A month later I downloaded the song and found myself listening to it over and over again. After previewing other songs too, it's a whole different breed of hip-hop, I'll tell you that much. The main rapper starts rapping in the middle of time signitures, which a lot of people aren't used to over in America, but it makes the songs sound interesting. There are such good beats on the album, but I think it would sound a lot better if the guy rapped faster and more on beat.

There are so many comparisons to Eminem, but other than the fact that he's white, I just can't see them. Eminem has rhythm. This guy just seems to talk.

Seems like the US critics are about 6 months to a year behind the UK, but can't seem to find much to rant about in the U.S. these days. Some editors at Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone and Spin have been brainwashed by group-think coolness well after the fact. This album is simply a Cockney-accented Eminem exaggerating the greatness of his \\"true street material\\" to some sound bite poetic rap that gets old and numbing after the first 2 songs. Surely, this novelty will fade into the bargain bins along with the \\"new garage bands\\" (i.e. Vines, Strokes, Hives) and we won't hear much about it in years to come.

The fact that he was talking, and doing so in a funny British accent saying stuff I barely understand made me really want to punch the radio and silence the streets. But the closer I listened to it, the more I listened to it, and the more I thought about it, I came to realize just how the Streets authentically captures the thoughts of British middle-aged \\"geezers\\", the pot-smoking, barely living over the poverty line, hanging out in bars and fighting, living in a confusing time. His poetry, mixed with garage beats and some nice singing, made for a truly unique sound. I recommend \\"Weak become Heros\\" and \\"Its too late\\", mellow songs with a real meaning, something very lacking in these confusing times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, an album that anyone 25 and under should listen to.","review":"I bought this album after I read a music magazine review that gave it four stars. They said that the guy rapping (Mike Skinner aka \\"Streets\\") is a UK Eminem. The only thing this guy has in common with Eminem is that he's anglo. That's it. However, he is as good as Eminem and paints an acurate picture of what it's like to be a twenty-something. The beats on this album are good. Some are \\"quad-step\\" I think, but some also have hip-hop appeal. Anyway he raps about lost love, smoking ... and chilling with friends, approaching girls at parties and just what it's like to be young. Combine great beats, an English accent, social views, and a great MC and you have one of the best albums of this year. Just get it, it so good and different that it's hard to even describe.

But the poetic eloquence here--the meaning behind these words--seems somehow to hit home.\\"Turn the page\\" is freakin brilliant, no matter what you call it; rap, poetry, music, whatever.I'm not saying every track is a masterpiece, but when something is obviously special it deserves special attenton."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very unique album","review":"While generally not a fan of hip hop and dance music, every now and then an album comes along which hits the spot for me.

The slang content is an education in itself, and the music uniquely blends bassed-and-blunted club tracks with classical instumentation.The first time I heard this album, I couldn't stand it. I thought it was a bunch of cheesy electronic big beats and some annoying brit going on about, well, nothing really. But somehow the disc hung around in my car and I found myself listening to it more and more -- and realized how bloody brilliant Mike Skinner - aka The Streets - is.And this album is only the beginning. His follow up album, \\"A Grand Don't Come For Free,\\" a masterpiece, culminates Skinner's knack for urban storytelling. \\"Pirate,\\" is where that album came from - and I recommend picking up both.

Rhymes are pretty solid, a mash up of rap/spoken word...kinda reminds me of Mos Def. i could see why its a hit with British fans; also why its could be a miss as some of the rhymes fall flat, and the beats aren't for everyone.Standout tracks: \\"Too much Brandy\\" and \\"Don't mug Yourself\\" for americans i would check these out first then go from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sardonic, Clever, Hip, Original","review":"I first discovered this record in early 2003 and was immediately impressed. The lyrics and arrangements ooze a sort of snarly confidence, and the wordplay is really clever and memorable.The Streets' two subsequent albums haven't lived up to the potential seen here on \\"Original Pirate Material,\\" as Skinner's lazy/arrogant outlook on life became more annoying than charming, and the music seemed less inspired overall. But this record stands alone as a modern classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This disc is sick","review":"I really enjoy this album. Although I thought that the newest album \\"a grand..\\" was far different a style and more about girls. Which made me dislike it some. But \\"Original pira...\\" has a real hip hop feeling, the feeling I got at old graf shows with heiro and Souls of Mischief. The beats are real underground and brought back a lot of memories from the writers meetings I used to go to. The lyrics are sick, and the english accent reminds me when I partied in London,. I liked that place so much I want to go back there and marry the girl that works at munchkins, a fish and chips place on Bloomsbury st. But that is besides the point. If youre into real hip hop and not all the mainstream club trip, than I gaurantee you will like this album.. Chur"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hip-hop, not spoken word, just disappointing","review":"I bought this expecting some British hip-hop with garage beats. The beats are ok, but the lyrics are boring. This is only spoken word in the literal sense; Saul Williams or Ken Nordine could annihilate Mike Skinner with a single sentence. Skinner also lacks any sort of charisma or mic personality. Was it Iriscience who said \\"MC's without a voice should write a book?\\"All in all, this was a disappointing purchase. If you're a fan of 2-step / garage / whatever, and are looking for some vocals, it might suite you. If you want British hip-hop, stick with Roots Manuva, Mark B & Blade, or Rodney P."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fall for it","review":"If you're looking for interesting British hip hop, this is not the best place to start. Some of the beats here are interesting and two tracks, \\"Let's Push Things Forward\\" and \\"Has It Come To This?\\" surprisingly really complement Mike Skinner's zero-flow aesthetic. But it's weird that critics seem to have latched onto this sub-par emcee with the awkward name (what, we're just supposed to breeze over the fact that your name is \\"The Streets\\"?), when there's so much better hip hop coming out of the UK. Try anything on Ninjatune subsidiary Big Dada, especially Roots Manuva's recent output. If you're just looking for a funny accent, try Tricky's \\"Juxtapose,\\" which features several tracks showcasing the hyper-fast (and most unintelligible) verbal antics of Maddog, a perfect counterpoint to Tricky's raspy, slow-as-cough-syrup murmurings."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain bad","review":"This album is amazingly bad. Wow. This album is so bad, that I decided to write my first ever Amazon review. This album made me give up my traditional role of reader. The rhymes aren't clever or interesting. Uh.

Second, it's not that witty--it sounds like rap music my friends would make as a joke.The biggest load of ... though is that this somehow represents the \\"alienated voice of the brittish youth.\\" No, it represents the bratty, untalented voice of one brittish youth, and those who swallow his ... with this justification are being pretentious, trite, and cliched, not to mention they have no knowledge or respect for rap as a genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beam me up, Scotty, there's no intelligent life down here!","review":"Not to be overtly critical, and I know writing isn't easy, but did this author ever actually read the Holmes cannon? As I have noted in other reviews, you can disguise the man, the voice, take an alias, change to some exotic locale, but you can never lose focus that this is Sherlock Holmes you are writing about, and that means observation and deduction. This book paints a pretty background, but the main character is very out of place in it. The Holmes of this book could have never visited forbidden Tibet, because his bumbling would have given him away. And that's not the Holmes I have grown to appreciate. If you want to read about Holmes in Tibet, I suggest The Mandala of Sherlock Holmes or its alternate hardcover Sherlock Holmes: The Missing Years. Better written, better book. Quoth the Raven..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly exotic","review":"For anyone interested in Gurkha fighters the east and Sherlock this is a very satisfying read.

The authors describe 11 personality traits and 9 interpersonal traits of unsafe people. As you are reading about these unsafe people traits, you also learn what safe people are like. The book has a section that explains how we got to be unsafe people. The reader is encouraged to take a look at himself to determine whether he has a \\"safety deficit\\". A very beneficial book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading","review":"Want to find out why some relationships never feel good?

Very clear and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think not","review":"I came across this book by mistake and read it because it seemed interesting as you might think so too, but it wasn't. The author describes his own experience which actually depicts him as a \\"stalker\\" and an annoying date that shows up without calling and he can't understand why a woman wouldn't be interested in him. He admits that he takes his dates to \\"Cheap\\" restaurants and also admitted that for fun, he and his date sit somewhere and make fun of the people that walk by. When his dates don't call him back, he writes them off as \\"unsafe\\". Lol. I wouldn't take advice from this person and neither should you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a religious text.","review":"I found it impossible to focus on the advice offered in the book, because it is buried beneath countless references to God, Jesus and the Bible.

What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I found this book hard to follow. Meaning I could not relate most of it.

The focus seemed to be on getting involved in groups and talking to people about your problems. And while you're meeting with the groups, you're supposed to be real by letting everyone know what about them bothers you. That means you're being a safe person. A lot of their examples just seemed like \\"whiney\\" people who need a lot of coddling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe People","review":"Someone recommended this book and with the title I was not sure what I was getting into. However, after reading it, I think it should be required reading for everyone.

This book is wonderfully written and will be a tremendous resource for our library. I am so grateful to Dr. Cloud and Dr. Townsend for the taking the time to write such helpful information. Their book Boundries has already become very popular and I am sure this one will as well. Practical, real and honest, they deal with matters of the heart that often trip so many of us up.

A very useful thing indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if you werent taught, this book will teach you","review":"I read this book a while ago, and I think I liked it so much I read it too fast :) But I see on here that there are some not so good reviews. I thought this book was fantastic! If you are familiar with Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend, you are familiar with their biblicaly backed up work. In this book, they explore what makes an unsafe person, how we attract unsafe people, and how to find safe people. Another \\"problem to solution\\" book of theirs. They give a solution after breaking down the problem. After reading this book, I realized that some of the realationships in my life were unsafe and why. This book gave me courage to let go of these unsafe relationships or challenge them. To some people, determining safe people comes easy, but it doesnt always come easy to me. I may have an internal inkling that something isnt right, but I dont know why or how to solve it. This book is helpful in that regard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember the Beatles...","review":"I have a copy of \\"Hailstone Holiday\\" and \\"Of Moons and Fools...\\" that I can compare to this CD. A little more mellow overall than Hoehn's historical compilation \\"Moons and Fools\\", but full of great vocal and lyrical surprises. Catchy (often quirky) lyrics with hooks that remind one of the Beatles. \\"King of the Moon\\" is a really cool tune. You're not going to hear it on mainstream radio today, but \\"who cares if you like good power pop.\\" This one will please you. This is one CD you really need to give a complete run through to get the overall concept, but wait for the title cut closer: very upbeat poppish tune, lyrically well done and well performed. The song is reminiscent of one of the Monkee's hits. Hoehn's vocals are always a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome product but a very steep learning curve","review":"Without a doubt Quick Verse is the most advanced Bible study software available to the public today.

Courtland is wonderful and a real manly man that no women could resist!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and interesting highlander novel","review":"This is a unique highlander novel that I am happy I picked up. Started slow, but became interesting very quickly. Cool plot, nice details, and easy to follow. Hero is perfectly savage, heroine is gracefully solid, and all the characters are steadfast. The intimate scenes (and those leading up to) were well-written. Fabulous light read. I usually prefer my novels with a lot of suspense and action, but as a strictly \\"romance\\" novel, it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEXY, SCOTTISH LOVE STORY - WORTH THE READ!!","review":"I purchased the entire MacCarrick Brothers Trilogy at once and enjoyed all three of them. I love all things Scottish so I knew the brothers' brogue and warrior, \\"caveman\\" ways would be a fun read. This and the other two in the series are about men who like to take charge. VERY SEXY & STEAMY!! Of course each brother believes that he has a curse on him so they have lived as mercenaries and without wives or children. They fight falling in love with the women they ultimately fall in love with. I won't reveal the entire story line, but I totally recommend \\"If You Dare\\", and the other two books in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacCarrick Stories","review":"I just finished reading book 1 in the MacCarrick brothers trilogy. I actually read them in reverse order (3-2-1) which is probably not a great idea, but didn't set me back too much. Once I figured out who was who in book 3, it made me want to read books 1 and 2. It was just coincidence that I read book 2 then book 1. I really enjoyed this book and all the characters in it, although it seemed to me that Anna took an awfully long time to realize that Courtland was a good guy and not a bad guy. That being said, I recommend the trilogy (in order). My only dissapointment at this point, is that there seems to be no story for Aleix and Olivia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy! Who doesn't want their very own highlander!!","review":"Wow. I read If you Desire a while back and I thought it was pretty good. Lately, I've been reading a lot of Christine Feehan and so I decided to come back to this trilogy and oh my, I definitely liked this even more than If you Desire. Courtland is a super hot Scot and I love the way Kresley Cole tells a sexy romantic story! Can't wait to check out If you Deceive. I hope Ethan is just as hot as his brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Love Hate Relationship!","review":"No need to reproduce plot so here's the skinny...this book is hot! Annalia is a bit sassy to say the least and Court MacCarrick is the sexy man/beast of a Scot. Basically she saves him, he's a little put out by that since he's a \\"manly man\\" and then they fight a great deal. She thinks he's hot but is repressing her sexuality because she basically thinks her mother left her as a child because of her \\"passions\\" for another man so she denies those feelings. Court is also denying his feelings because of some family curse which makes him think he's basically a death wish to Anna. The characters were so funny, they really reminded me of a husband and wife with the way they fought. Can't wait for Hugh's story! I'm ordering it for my library tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bedroom...","review":"To be honest, this is the first book in my whole life that I didn't even finish.I couldn't find a real story here...this was all about her in a bedroom or how to get her into one.I expected more."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT","review":"Kresley Cole is one of my all time favs! She is one of the greats! I usually stick to paranormal romance & this wasnt that so much but I will read anything she writes because it was still awesome.

Love, love."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Absolute Favorites from Kresley Cole!","review":"Didn't think anything could top her paranormal series, Immortals After Dark, but the three MacCarrick brothers books and her other two books, The Captain of All Pleasures and The Price of Pleasure, I loved even more! Just finished all of them, and I am so sad there aren't anymore like them. If you love English and Scottish books set in the \\"olden\\" times, you will love these books too. I rate all Kresley Cole's books at 5 stars and would rate them higher if possible. If Ms. Cole reads these reviews, I would want her to know that I would love to read more of each of her genres, but especially the English and Scottish historical fictions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earlier KC work","review":"While I enjoy her Immortals After Dark series the best, Cole's writing is still great in this earlier work. My only complaint is that Cole does such a great job building the dislike between heroine and hero that it seems a bit forced at the end when they are united.I give props to Cole for this unique twist on history. There are no soft edges to this hero as he is baffled by a princess. Will probably go back to reread when I get a historical craving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, sexy, sexy!","review":"If You Dare was one of the best romances I've read in a long time.

Overall, I highly recommend it and can't wait for the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"This hero had only one thing on his mind. The heroine was quite strong but the overpowering and lustful sex ruined a potentially good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot believe this rubbish is getting good reviews","review":"I usually like Kresley Cole's writing but this is really bad! The heroine is completely unlikeable and there's zero chemistry with the leading man. The story is stupid & the ending predictable. This is a huge disappointment for a good writer. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I thought Kresley Cole's Immortals After Dark series was good, but I very much enjoyed reading this historical of hers. Court was perfect. He was rough and ready, reminding me of Cade from her paranormal series. Anna and Court's relationship is slow to build in typical Cole fashion, but I felt connected to these two characters throughout the whole book.I'm not a huge historical romance reader. I dislike the formal English setting, with the balls and precise manners. But I love historicals with fierce Scottish men and this book delivers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Fooled By The Cover","review":"This is no ordinary steamy romance novel. For Kresely Cole is no ordinary writer. She is witty, and sharp. Her books pop with fun and are highlighted by the sort of sex scenes you bookmark to read over and over. She is charming and her characters are even more so. She doesn't write the cardboard cut outs so popular in romance novels the genrea over. In If You Dare the characters act and react as complex humans and not a man and a woman standing in to seeing a story from point a to point sex. Kresley Cole is an amazing new writer and If You Dare is an amazing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Sexual Tension, No Story","review":"Plenty of sexual longing and consummation if that's what you want, but not have enough story or character development to keep it interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"WoW","review":"The product came in no good.

I wanted to be convinced that I should read some of his books. I was disappointed... Instead we hear about his over-sized sweaters, baggy pants, and short-lived romances. Why do I care what clothes he wore or who he had sex with? Why do 20 different \\"family friends\\" need to tell us about his personal life?The entire DVD is just anecdotes from friends/family spliced with a single interview on \\"Firing Line\\".Apparently he was a poet, anarchist, psychologist, pacifist, and openly gay.

It shows Shari was very flexible), \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" (not the way you think. It is very hip and it demonstrates Shari as a wonderful dancer (like I said above)); but there are several that are right up there with them: \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" (the way she told it to the monkey was so adorable, but she never faltered with her voices either), \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" (\\"Every time you clap your hands together, I black out!\\"), \\"Pied Piper of Hamlin\\" (This story never fails to impress me, no matter what Shari does with it.)All in all, a wonderful video, and definitely one to watch with your family.

First of all the author is a Biblical Literalist and assumes every word to be a historical fact. That is unfortunate because he lacks the vision to see how the early church editorialized the life of this first century Jewish person into the \\"mystical, magical, offspring of God\\" character that we learn about in flannel-graph presentations in Sunday School. The person seriously looking into the life of the Jewish Person of Christ would be better served by reading The Rt. Rev. John S. Spong's book This Hebrew Lord.With the \\"millennium\\" on our doorstep it is likely that more books of this type will be published.

Jesus Christ is God who is revealed in the Word of God in history. He doesn't emphasize this fact. Yancey should read portions about how Jews persecuted Christ. This is a fact and truth of the Gospel, but Yancey is on a political correctness trip and want to protect Jews. His pro-Jewish position dishonors Christ. St. Stephen wasn't pro-Jewish. He directly blamed the Jews for Christ's murder. Read the book of Acts, Yancey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yancey Does Not Know the Jesus of the Bible","review":"Jesus Christ is Yahweh. Yancey doesn't understand that. God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow. God NEVER changes. God is Holy Trinity. God in the Old Testament is Holy Trinity. God in the New Testament is Holy Trinity. God now is Holy Trinity. When Jesus Christ comes back, God will be Holy Trinity. God will be Holy Trinity forever as He was before the Creation of the World. Thus, Jesus Christ who is God the Son is Yahweh of the Old Testament. Anyone who teaches otherwise is going to HELL because he doesn't know Christ personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Everyman's introduction to the real Jesus","review":"I found this book so very down to earth, geared toward a general audience in an honest, loving manner.

Jesus was more of an idea, a paper-doll-like figure, than a real emotion beset human. Philip Yancey got my frequently misty eyes to see a truly devine, but fully human man that I can understand and willingly follow, or, at least, attempt to follow. I will read more Yancey....soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The audio version is watered down. READ THE BOOK!","review":"A wonderful job by Yancey. You can't help feeling closer to Jesus. A careful magnification of the humanity and spirituality of the God-Man in a way that doesn't disturb scripture. You will be taken back to that historic time frame as an observer. The author brings to light many truthsthat diplay the feelings and the incredible Love of Jesus, that will leave you wanting to love him back all the more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truer perspective of Jesus' life","review":"Having grown up in a Protestant home, it seemed at times that the Old Testament was almost off limits. However, remember that when Jesus walked the earth, the Tenauch (Old Testament) was the entirety of the word of God. Yancey does a nice job exploring the reality of Jesus' life, including rituals, customs and culture. This contrasts with the more typical rose-colored view of the blond hair, blue-eyed Jesus of many 20th century Christians. I walked away from the book wondering why Christians do not continue to celebrate biblically commanded festivals like Passover, Purim, etc. This is a well thought-out book written by a Gentile believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I NEVER BELIEVED JESUS WAS GOD UNTIL READING THIS BOOK","review":"I thought this book was going to go off the beaten path, such as looking at Him as a Revolutionary or a Magicial being of some sort.......it really brings the human & the God in Him out!!! i love this author, check out What's so Amazing about Grace, one the best books i've ever read :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassette is abridged, not as insightful as the book.","review":"I heard the book read over the radio and it said much more than the audio cassette.

I did read a Yancey book about 10 years ago about suffering and it was really good. He wrote as one who knows. So I was a bit surprised that I didn't connect with this book, too. It just seemed to me that the tone leaned more toward clinical and not personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-healing for the Agnostic","review":"I found this book full of surprises, relevant to the secular-religious debate and an entertaining, thoughtful read.

Consequently, like him, I discovered I really didn't know Jesus. However, the author points us to Jesus' life as a \\"dissection\\" of God's character. In other words, Jesus' life reveals what God is like in detail.THE JESUS I NEVER KNEW, covers many topics, such as, The Beatitudes, the role of women, miracles, signs, faith even when rejected, power vs. love, and many more. Again, this book augmented my own journey to know Jesus more intimately!While reading this book, I found many quotable quotes. It, too, is a \\"keeper\\". Because of this I found myself marking passages and writing their page numbers in the back of the book. It kept me busy!THE JESUS I NEVER KNEW provides an excellent check for my own knowledge of Jesus as I seek for a closer relationship with Him. Here's another gem from Yancey's pen.Betty L. Sheldon, author of OMNIPIECE"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Phillip Yancy always writes from the heart. This book is wonderfully insightful into the mind of Mary and into the minds of the somewhat blundering Apostles. Sometimes people forget that the apostles were just fishermen, farmers, husbands, and tax collectors and that Mary was just a Jewish teenager trying to do the right thing. Yancy really puts things in a wonderfully down to earth, understandable way, and yet the Spirit shines through him and gives the words power.

He starts building a foundation and by the end he has you wishing there was more book. Analogies are outstanding and the insight into possible reasons for Jesus' actions are intriguing. This is the third book I have read by Phillip Yancy, and I really enjoy his expanded view he gives on a subject. I read this book after his title \\"What so amazing about Grace\\".

It was Crowley who raised astrology from obscurity. And he knows well that which reimplemented into western culture.A beautiful book which describes -as its title pronounces- the general principles of astrology. No other astrology book I have yet seen that does that so well. All planets and signs are described very basic and yet rich in information. Relievingly absent is the psychologized approach toward astrology that saturates the content of the contemporary books.There are almost 200 charts of well-known people which he interprets throughout the book.

Naturally there's a deranged killer in a clow suit wandering around killing everybody. And then there's a bunch of ghosts thrown in...Stupid and boring. For one thing all these actors are way over college age...and look it. For another the acting is abysmal. There's not one good acting job here. The script is hopeless--full of bad jokes and terrible dialogue. The killings are largely bloodless and not even remotely scary. The only remotely interesting part of this is a cute guy who has a nude scene at the beginning (back view only)...but that's hardly enough to recommend the movie. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"UTTER GARBAGE","review":"Truly the most boring and brainless film in a long time. Terrible script.

The movie fails to be a comedy horror and fails to be a scary horror movie- it just fails all the way around. The acting is really bad and the movie doesn't really go anywhere. The direction is not good either. It's very slow moving and near the end you will find yourself fast forwarding to get through the rest of it.

If you know the Bible at all, like I do, you will get frustrated at first that the author doesn't use more imagination in delving into the lives of the Old Testament characters.

My test was specifically for transmission to a Panasonic Boom box, used while on vacation.

While I'd tend to agree that this album lacks some of the standards of old, I can't claim it's not up to standard. Turn off all other sources of white noise in your listening area - some of the sound changeups are superbly subtle, even in the high BPM cuts like Call the Ships to Port. Of the lot, the song I become most absorbed in has got to be Bullet. Voice and sound form music here so supremely balanced, I'm momentarily startled when the song is over.I'll keep going back to older albums, especially focusing on songs like 2D, Helicopter, and Norman Bates (I can't breathe!), where the focus is perhaps tighter - but the sound, I'd swear instrument feeds are being used to modify vocals and vice versa.

There's perhaps only two good tracks, and those have been so overplayed at clubs they aren't even listenable any more. The rest of the CD is just filler noise.

Alot more moody and dark than 'united states of mind' and a step up in production as well. A must for any Covenant fan, and a must for anyone who is into the darker side of electro-pop. Bullet is a freight train; solid, heavy, you wont be able to get out of the way fast enough. All the other songs on the album are just as good, some may say filler, but how often does filler enhance the stand out tracks on the album? Hmm? Answer me that!

This is pure pop music - and bad pop at that!

I think that's a shame, because this is possibly one of Covenant's best works in years. Sure, there are a few clunkers (Winter Comes, Scared), but for the most part, this album is solid. The band has always been known for its literate lyrics and soild dance beats, but one senses a certain development and 'maturity' to these tracks that has evaded the band in the past. The tracks all seem much more layered and detailed than their previous, more minimalist work. Perhaps this is the influence of working with an outside producer for the first time (they used Rammstein's producer for this one), but whatever it is, I hope it continues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Solid Album","review":"This is a solid album from beginning to end. It has almost no filler. Be warned: it has to grow on you a little. This album doesn't jump out and grab you on the first listen like United States of Mind did.

All the characters are terribly stereo-typed, the racist military pilot, the inscrutable Chinese \\"taikonaut\\" and the honour-obsessed Japanese. None of these characters ring true and the others are equally over the top cliches. Everything that can go wrong goes wrong to the nth degree until it all becomes absurd and stupid.

ModernSF seems to extrapolate the way things are going and often winds upsome place I'd rather not be.Still, End in Fire is worth reading, for the warning of a possiblefuture, for the hands-on jury rigging of tin cans to get home, and fora decent stab at handling various personalities and nationalitiesthrown together in situations that weren't in the training manual.Ultimately, people will look back at this as a bit of a sidestep inMitchell's development as a SF writer.

The Hope brothers and their compatriots are perfectly drawn, and Barnes exercises her usual poet's touch with the Idaho countryside. Even the animals are well-realized (I love that so much in a book, when a writer gets animals right). Irene, however, remains a boy's fantasy object, overly sexualized and under-explored, and the plot is a recursive muddle. How many circles can a reader be asked to trace in one book? The tragedy at the center remains unresolved, in my opinion, and Irene's actions are melodramatic and unbelievable. I enjoyed the book, even so, and fans of Barnes' memoirs will want to read it for the pure pleasure of her prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not disappointed in Windsong CD","review":"While I was laid up for 7 weeks with a broken foot I ordered this to play on my Kindle, it was so beautiful and relaxing that I also ordered a CD.

Co-author Joni Eareckson Tada, a quadriplegic after an accident has \\"been there\\" when it comes to the seeking of healing and understanding, and writes in an empathetic, anecdotal style interspersed with scripture in a way that's natural, not pedantic. The appendices list verses that proclaim God's sovereign control over trials, and helpfully categorizes them by type of suffering. The scriptural case presented in this book is so solid, that one is left firmly convinced that there is meaning to be found in the hard times, that God is present, that good will prevail."},{"rating":"2","title":"She doesn't let God off the hook!","review":"This tape 2 tape cassette series is intimate and powerful. The conversation covers questions, objections and conundrums about suffering. Joni weaves in her experience as a quadriplegic, and her work for the past two decades for folks who suffer. Joni has earned the right to explain and teach about suffering; her experiences dramatically form her penetrating questions, \\"How come, God?\\" She does not let God off the hook - using His own words to frame the hard answers. But these answers build a sure foundation from which she encourages those who stagger under their trials, reproves those who doubt God cares, and exhorts any who are on life's sidelines to get involved and help bear their brothers' burdens. This resource is a good conversation starter, or a good comforter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Altered my view somewhat....","review":"This book altered my view of God's role in \\"bad things\\" happening to us. I lost my wife and 2 year old daughter in a boat wreck last summer and was given this book by a friend. I think the author does a very good job of explaining her belief that God does control events in our lives and she uses scriptures that quite frankly used to scare and/or worry me, to back up her logic. I have always known that I am not immune to these tragedies and came to this book without anger toward God which some readers may have. I can understand that some will disagree with the message of this book. However after 47 years of life's events and actively seeking God for most of that time, I can only agree with the author. Of course, if you know her story you understand she does have experience with suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"When God Weeps\\" changed how I view suffering.","review":"As an able-bodied person, I have never had an appreciation for the suffering of others. In fact, suffering was something I preferred not to think about. But, out of curiosity, I decided to read Joni's book. I cried when she described the real-life struggles of friends, and I cried even more when she revealed to me God's loving use of suffering. I recommend \\"When God Weeps\\" to anyone who wants to gain insight on why bad things happen to good people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"This is an excellent book dealing with the subject of suffering and where God is in the midst of our suffering.

I would give this a 0 but you have to pick 1-5"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is depressing and awful.","review":"Only read this book if you want to be depressed and feel hopeless. I threw this book in the garbage after I read it so that no other unsuspecting person would read it. Tada's writing is usually uplifting, so I find it hard to believe that her editors allowed her to write such a downer of a book. If you are going through difficult times and want to read something uplifting, read The Gift of Peace by Cardinal Bernadin. You will feel better immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing and hard to read","review":"I found this book to be very disturbing. The authors spend a great deal of time describing different examples of suffering in very vivid details. I also have a problem with some of the theology in the book.

I definitely would not suggest this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle edition needs to be spell checked","review":"Great book, bad edition: I am not much of a copy editor, but even I could find typos in every chapter (sometimes multiple pages).

At that time the special effects astounded me, and the acting wasn't all important. This is definitely a good pick if you have a sense of humor and can appreciate the special effects for the genre and time of making. It's a fast moving plot, plenty of great effects, neat traps and good levels of suspense. Probably a decent movie for those of you who enjoyed playing Dungeons & Dragons.Probably not a movie your wife would enjoy, though.For those of you taking this movie so seriously in your reviews... lighten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"People need help","review":"To those who gave this movie more than two stars or found it remotely interested: GET PROFESSIONAL HELP!

The book is short and concise, however, very detailed and well written. KK explains what clutter is, why we have it and why is not good for us. She identifies clutter in various areas of the house/office and suggests innovative ways of ditching it for good! In addition, for those who know about Feng Shui, she recommends decluttering based on the Bagua map. Very good book indeed and happy clearing!By Thei Zervaki..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read","review":"I was disappointed because I was looking for a little more detail about the philosophy behind Feng Shui. Also, this book is poorly written and I think some of the beliefs espoused in it are just downright offensive (all overweight people are messy? -- now is that nice?).

Now I am going to look for another more detailed book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, very useful tips, great gift too.","review":"The book is simple, easy to read, has many useful tips and a great outline that pretty much covers everything about clutter.

Karen's concepts make sense. There is the usual placement-directions-colors you find in all Feng Shui books, but this book helped me most where she writes about WHY certain clutter isn't helpful, and made me think about what I really want in my home. Why was I hanging on to things that no longer inspire me, and in fact, might even keep reminding me of that which is long in the past and not relevant to my life today -- and the kind of life I want going forward?The result is a home that holds the things I love, displayed in a manner that feels pleasing to be around.This is the one book I would not be without. It's small, inexpensive, and my \\"bible\\" when I need inspiration to clear out what's in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaking of clutter clearing...","review":"The editor should have cleared a little clutter when publishing this book. I had to read through 7 chapters of the author puffing herself up with examples of her \\"successes\\" and telling us a bunch of stuff we already know (clutter is oppressive, reasons why we collect clutter, etc. DUH! I know that stuff and/or I don't care. I bought the book to find out what to _do_ about it!). Anyway, chapters 8 and 9 almost give some information on clutter in feng shui, chapters 16 and 17 actually suggest how to approach the decluttering task, and the rest is fluff. Beware - there is very little actual feng shui in this book, and only slightly more useful information on how to clear your clutter. There are even bonus chapters completely unrelated to either feng shui or clutter; instead they're on clearing out your colon and the like. In all, I found roughly 37 pages of the 166 actually useful. Talk about clutter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last clutter book you'll have to buy","review":"If this book doesn't cure you of clutter, give it up...nothing will!Seriously, Ms. Kingston hits on every very good reason (and some harsh realities) for getting the clutter out. Her Feng Shui approach makes it that much simpler, and less overwhelming. (It's especially powerful in combination with \\"Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life,\\" by K. R. Carter, and \\"Let Go of Clutter\\" by Schechter.)This is one of the most motivating book I've ever read about clutter, and in just one week, it's made a h-u-g-e difference in my life. Highly recommended if you've been trying to get control of clutter for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book!","review":"I heard about this book by word of mouth. Everyone I know who has read it loves it! As I look around my house, I am amazed at how many possessions I have that I don't use - everything from old clothes to makeup to cleaning products. Karen Kingston is right that clearing the clutter frees up energy and that you can feel the difference in the room. Karen suggests doing small projects if all the clutter is overwhelming and it's the perfect way to get things done. I try to do a small declutter project every day and I'm gradually getting my house cleared out. The ironic thing is that the more I give things away, the more I realize that I don't need so many possessions. I'm actually saving money by not buying things. Either I use up what I've got or I realize I don't need it. Clear your clutter - It's so energizing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quick, easy, informative read that leaves you inspired and ready to change your life","review":"I devoured this book in one sitting and happily set off on my decluttering. She gives some advice on feng shui and the bagua, but as another reviewer indicated, if you're looking for an in-depth look at feng shui, this is not the book for you. A quick note, I bought her first book in hopes that would go much deeper into those topics, but it only had one section dedicated to the art and the majority of that book is on space clearing, which is great to learn and do, but not what I'd been looking for. In the clutter book the author frequently refers to her first book, but once you're decluttered, if you're looking for a book that focuses solely on feng shui, I'd recommend finding another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clutter = emotional baggage","review":"For several years now I'd been joking with my friends that I \\"feng shui-ed\\" my garage or my house by cleaning it. Turns out that decluttering and cleaning does create an energetic reaction and this simple, short, easy-to-read and interesting book tells why. The explanations for the emotional weight that keeping old things that have out-lived their purposes, for having clutter here, there and everywhere or just somewhere are fascinating. Practice what this book written by a self-claimed Feng Shui pioneer writes and you, the reader, will see and feel the difference. There's some superfluous information and some of it repetitive, but over all, this is a good primer on the subject of Feng Shui and the definition connection that clutter has to our emotional and physical psyche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Motivating!","review":"You don't have to believe in Feng Shui to get your moneys worth out of this book. It had me wanting to get up early in the morning to begin the process of clearing the clutter. Within a week I had completely revamped my large home office and reorganized all my kitchen cabinets. What a feeling!I could have done without the parts near the end of the book that took the concept to areas other than my humble abode. But, just skip over them if you're like me and the book is still worth the time and money you spend. I now have an understanding of why so much collects in my house as well as why it is so hard for me to let go of some things. Very enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GOOD BOOK!","review":"This book was the best gift I ever gave myself.

It's pretty over-the-top. I just ignored those parts of the book.But where I think Karen gets it right is in her insights into why we have a clutter problem and why we should do something about it. Those that pan the book comment that it is too simplistic. Well, heck, it's not rocket-science that we shouldn't have too much stuff for our space and that things should have a place and we should put them there after we use them. Hello! It's motivation we need. And, yes, perhaps some practical tips.For me, Karen nailed the movtivation.

Much bunk has been written about this ancient \`art,' but this book pares it down to one simple aspect of the process: getting rid of clutter.

I'm not even sure I subscribe to Feng Shui or space clearing (which this book discusses), but this is a must-have book for the person who needs a push to declutter their home. Ms. Kingston has a wonderfully refreshing style of writing, and this well-organized book offers clear and concise advice regarding various types of clutter (from how to declutter a kitchen to letting go of unnecessary letters and photos). She also touches upon how to stay on top of future clutter and how to organize, and how it is just as important to clean your mind and body. I can't count the number of times I have opened this book just to soak up a few pages of inspiration. I have seen another \\"declutter expert\\" on Oprah, and I have scanned other declutter books, but I sincerely feel nothing comes close to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great until she got to the bottom of things","review":"She does a good job of defining the differences among clutter, junk, useful stuff, and so on. It is very practical about how to get rid of clutter and ways to think about it.Then she ruins it in the last chapter by going off on a tangent about how your average person has a colon full of things from years past, has a ridiculous drawing of a wiggly colon and insists that the reader rush off to an herbalist for a colon cleanse to get rid of all these accretions from days of yore.I have an acquaintance who is an herbalist, who said it was total nonsense and said that a sigmoidoscopy is going to reveal a smooth, pink interior to one's plumbing and not accretions and agreed it was all very strange.I would suggest Ms. Kingston keep to what she is good at and keep her crackpot theories to herself.

The whole book. So I bought it. Then I bought a second, loaner copy, and gave away both, and bought another. Whenever I need motivation to clear out any kind of clutter in my life, I go back to this book. After buying and giving away half a dozen, I realized people won't use it unless they are themselves inspired to read it, so now I just throw out quotes a lot. It's a great book. My favorite idea is that if the item reminds you of something unpleasant every time you look at it, it doesn't matter if it's useful, it's bringing you down and it needs to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean Up Your Clutter","review":"This is a very small book. Sometimes there is just so much to say about an issue and it doesn't take a lot of room. That is what happened here.As I worked through the book I realized that I had cluttered up my life, and my home, with things that belonged to interests that I no longer was interested in. Some of those things have been easy to get rid of; some are taking longer. But I am doing the work.I probably don't have as much of this stuff as some people my age because we moved across the country several times and you tend to be forced to cull out things you should not be keeping when you do that, but I was surprised at how much there still was. There are a couple of things that I have given away that resulted in a huge release once they were out of the house.

It is utter, utter drivel. It is a combination of wishful thinking (sort of like The Secret), unreadably poor writing, and worthless advice. Please consider whether you yourself are a practical, sensible person who is not prone to believing that removing a dead plant will somehow bring money and good health into your house. I am not deriding Feng Shui, but I am deriding Karen Kingston's version of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchasing this book will add clutter to your life","review":"Karen Kingston has written a book cluttered with nonsense. The conclusions she draws about clutter and those who have it, are questionable at best, but often downright untrue. She places much importance on symbolism. Only the mentally and spiritually weak would buy into such superstitious foolishness. There is little written about how to remove clutter from your environment. If you want a book that provides information on clearing clutter to improve your time management, and create a healthy and beautiful environments to live and work in, this is not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-Feng Shui Nonsense!","review":"Bottom line: clearing clutter has very little to do with feng shui. The only link between clutter and the ancient art and science is that it inhibits the flow of qi, the physical and meta-phyical nourishing force at the heart of everything and everyone. Qi is only one principle of feng shui. There's also the study of the 8 trigrams, the 5 phases, landforms and your environment. However, feng shui is really about the study of time and space. About determining how you are compatible with your home by analyzing the year you were born into (time) to the time your home was built and its magnetic direction (space). Feng shui is not a quick fix or an easy study. Can you learn and practice acupuncture in a weekend? Surely not. By not including all of feng shui's components Ms. Kingston denies the reader an accurate understanding of what feng shui really it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive Cover Page but not very well contents !","review":"The book has very nice Cover Page ! unfortunately that about it..and nothing else ! the contents is not very good, there almost no illustration, no picture, no example...just word after word like a Romantic novel while the reader is searching for the Feng Shui solution.I don't like it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"They've Come To Their Senses","review":"I'm glad to see that Unilever finally released an Axe fragrance that's not nuclear-powered.

AxeLab is close to \\"Touch\\" in scent, but with a slightly stronger top note of watermelon. You'd be much better off with a fragrance of Creed's caliber, but for the price, and relief that you won't force everyone else to smell you wearing it, this is a decent effort by Axe to move into the Eau de Toilette market.

I didn't know the title, and it was hard to tell out of all the titles at the end of the movie, which one it was. It was the second last song played in the movie, and I was able to obtain a copy of it through (...). It's 10 minutes long, which only feels like half that time, with it's changes and variances, and overall slammin' groove! The soundtrack for \\"Groove\\" has an edited version which sounds different, the CD single is the same as in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic","review":"Very similar to John Digweed's own Spider-Man theme tune (why oh why is this not on CD yet?!), Heaven Scent is an absolute masterwork of trance.Beginning with a progressive and infectuous beat you are already totally in the groove of this track BEFORE the main melody explodes to life like a firework blazing across the night sky.Fusing a dozen different atmospheres and moods, Heaven Scent is a must have for anyone who loves trance music. Also included on this CD is a rather disposable 'evolution dub' mix that develops upon the beat rather than the main melody (which is totally absent)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretchedly Poor DVD Transfer","review":"This Alpha Video DVD release of an impressively moody and generally underrated Italian horror yarn is a wretched, unwatchable mess. The image is blurred and smeary, and appears to have been taken from a murky fourth-generation bootleg videotape transfer. The horribly garbled sound renders nearly all of the dialogue unintelligible, and absolutely ruins Aldo Piga's score. This is one of the absolute worst legitimate DVD releases I've ever seen, easily on par with Madacy's hideous TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE/NIGHTMARE CASTLE combo.

They all have the same jaw-dropping, \\"I can't believe they did this\\", humor; very edgy and crude.Now the second title in the series just tries too hard to recreate the humor of the first one. Between skits the writers add commentary and pointless banter from themselves. I found nothing in the commentary funny and it was pretty stupid. Some skits are funny and downright hilarious (i.e. I can't believe they did that!) and others just come off as boring. I'd say they were 50/50.

It depicts a journey from the pre-Willow (Son City) days continuing through the mega-church mid-1990's, to the movement known as the Willow Creek Association. It tells the story of people fervently pursuing their vision of God's dream for the church.The second half of the book, written by Senior Pastor Bill Hybels, uncovers the mission, philosophy and methods employed by the church.

It's largely musique concrete, consisting of hundreds of samples woven together, very rhythmic, and very German.About half the songs have lyrics - some sung in English, and some in German. I don't understand German, but the English lyrics are bizarrely Dadaesque. There's a definite undercurrent of silliness, but also a darker thread running through the album, making the whole experience something like watching a Rube Goldberg machine while on acid.Trust me - you've never heard anything remotely like this.

The words are screamed and howled, and there truly is anger in them, as it should be with any self-respecting punk band. Wall-of-noise bass and guitar mesh well with phenom drummer boy's bombastic spasms. Great sound-bites are liberally peppered between the tracks, and there's even some bonus songs by the legendary Canadian band, Red Tide (Ken Jensen, Gus's producer, if I am not mistaken, was in that band, and those bonus tracks appear on this disc as a tribute to Ken and his sad and untimely death).Buy this disc while there are still copies to be had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book and a fair start for Benson","review":"Ian Fleming is one of the greatest writers ever and I think after a few novels Benson will be just as good with his Bond novels.

You feel as if Bond is a dumb man, going from location to location being told the story as you read it. Most of Fleming and Gardner's works are 100 times better than this yarn. It ranks with \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\" as one of the worst novels I beleive I've ever read. Two stars: one because I can't give less than 1 star and the second, just because it's 007...well...it's kinda 007."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bond","review":"This is a good Bond Adventure. This being his first Bond book, I thought that there were some -small- things that needed tweeking. Very Small things. I suggest -highly- suggest his second Bond book \\"The Facts of Death\\". That's an -excellent- read. The small thing were fixed, and I loved that book. This book isn't bad, don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome return to style after Gardner's last few.","review":"Benson's first Bond novel is a welcome return to the character and style familiar to readers of Ian Fleming's original novels. This approach had been abandoned by John Gardner in his last several 007 books, which were mediocre at best. Gardner seemed bored with the character. Benson is just the opposite. He obviously cares deeply about James Bond, and treats him with the reverence he deserves. Zero Minus Ten is a fun, fast-moving adventure with a complex Bond, in the spirit of From Russia With Love or Casino Royale. Highlights include a very Flemingesque gambling sequence and a thrilling shoot-out at a Chinese military installation. Bond fans who gave up on the character during Gardner's tenure should DEFINITELY check out Benson's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Past its Prime","review":"There are certain faint stylistic echoes, in the mise-en-scene of various chapters, of the Fleming manner in its crisper mode, but otherwise absolutely nothing, not even token appearances by M and Miss Moneypenny, a shower with a girl named Stephanie or a more than nodding acquaintance with the rules of mahjong, can convince us that this epigonic lay-figure, mixed up with Triad rituals, aborigine walkabouts, a cargo of heroin in Portsmouth harbour and a Chinese general called Wong, is the genuine Taittinger-swigging 007. Leave the old boy alone, or, still better, turn him into what he really is, the hero of a lavish costume movie. Merchant-Ivory doing James Bond? May I live to see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...a license to kill.....","review":"What can be said about Zero Minus Ten? Benson's prose style is weak, the plot is transparent and lacking in suspense, and betrays a misunderstanding of Bond, his motivations, and interests. Bond worrying himself over the fate of the Hong Kong people, abstractly, like a political scientist? Bond reveling in a dangerous gunfight? Bond startled by what he sees and hears while spying on a secret ceremony? Not bloody likely. Raymond Benson may be a fan of Ian Fleming's Bond, but Zero Minus Ten doesn't even approach the sophistication of the films much less the elegant savagery of the original novels. It seems fitting that as the films have become more universal, relying on impersonal action and giving only the slightest nod to traditional Bondian themes, Benson should be composing drivel like Zero Minus Ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted to read a movie script, I would go to Hollywood!","review":"I am sorry, but I do not like Bensen's books at all. It is like reading the movie script. Bensen writes his book just like the movies and it was Boring! He tried to sound like Flemming but came off as a second rate hack! He spent too much time describing the surroundings and not enough on the action and real plot. Most say that Bensen is great and following in Flemmings footsteps but for me I feel bad for the REAL James Bond fans who want more than just a movie script in hardcover form. Benson, stick to writing bedside companions and leave the real writing to the pro's."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Bond titles ever!","review":"This book marks the decent of the literary Bond into the fool hardy sex machine that the screen incarnations of Bond love to portray. You'll find that the original plot line has merit but the ensuing adventure falls into a pattern of ludicrous action scenes followed by gratuitous sex. Are we to believe the sophisticated Bond that Ian Flemming created is lurking in Hong Kong cathouses getting lap dances? Must we endure phrases like ,\\"Any normal man would die doing this but James Bond is a master of...\\", (fill in whatever Benson has Bond doing at the time)every time Bond does something? Flemming provided us with a much more \\"human\\" character than this. Any true fan will save themselves the heartache of reading this and stick to what Flemming, Amis, and Gardner left us with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me, Mr.Bond? Please come back.","review":"Sorry Mr.Benson I have all of the Flemming \\"Bonds\\" 5 in hardbound. I have all of the Gardner \\"Bonds\\" in Hardbound AND paperback.

After reading \\"Zero\\" I'm not shaken, I'm not stirred... Just Bored...James Bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Zero in the Title Refers to Raymond Benson","review":"Raymond Benson is the worst when it comes to picking up where Ian Fleming and John Gardner left off. As a die hard Bond fan, it simply stuns me that he got the nod to become the official \\"Bond\\" scribe.First of all, his writing style is for 5-year-olds. Second, he smacks readers over the head with too much sex. Fleming did not go into lurid details, neither did Gardner. As a result Benson throws the class and style of the previous books out the window.In a horrible short 007 story Benson wrote for Playboy, he brings back Irma Bunt of Spectre. Terrible. The character was not his to mess with. It's almost as rediculous as brining Goldfinger back from the dead 40 years on.I urge fans to give Benson a wide berth and to stick with the Fleming and Gardner books. The poor quality of his books just show that he is a fanboy with poor literary talent.Bond would never settle for second best, why should you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of old, and a bit of new. But regardless, Bond is back","review":"This book is a good read. Any fan of James Bond will enjoy Raymond Benson's classic take on 007. He merges the best of Ian Fleming's style, with a bit of John Gardner's plotting, and adding his own take, he creates a good read which is much better both plot-wise and character wise than compared to the last few clunkers from Garnder. Plotting is fairly good, with a few twists and turns along the way. All in all a very good first effort from Benson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Minus Ten....stars","review":"Raymond Benson has no experience writing, period. It shows all too much in this book.

The new lead single for his next album-\\"Jimmy Mathis/Deliverance\\" (2003) is one of the nicest songs I have come across this year, beat, chorus (Timbaland)and bubba's lyrics are all impressive. Sparxxx drops lines like \\"Then they start to question whether you a true talent Or just a redneck substance abuse addict So then you hide away just to try to find your way And now they back to callin you 200 times a day I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it And 10 million sold in the name of my deliverance\\".

Neither would have set off the emergency sequence. I'm not sure what he would do in a real (panic) emergency, but I don't want to find out. There is an LED that flashes when it is set off, but he would never get to that point if he just keep pushing the button over and over.This is a really dumb design. I'd rather put up with some false alarms than have a button you could cancel.

Several of these books are excellent: Greenberg's and Moncrieff's books stand out, and Whitaker's, Watters' and some of Healy's critiques are also well worth reading. But Jackson's book is in a class by itself. There is a lot of technical medical and pharmacological detail in the book, but it is, in general, well presented and broadly comprehensible even to (attentive) readers who do NOT have specialist medical training. The narrative is also clear and well presented, and the overall argument is cogently framed.

It is indeed an expression of the Laodicean Age's religiosity and teeters on heresy. Too strong? I don't expect nonChristians to understand Christian terminology, concepts, precepts, etc., any more than someone studying accounting for the first time understands accounting terminology. The true accounting however will come from the expressed expectations given to the Church to teach new believers proper dogma and appropriate spiritual behaviors. No wonder the Church in the Laodicean Age has become so pathetically weak and ineffective unless applying business principles of sales, marketing, and management techniques. Nothing new under the sun. I've heard this nonsense before. And the consequences follow the victims forever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Church Growth Saddleback Style","review":"I enjoyed reading Rick Warren's book, but a closer reading suggests that it suffers from the same problem that plagues much church-growth literature: a faulty assumption. \\"A healthy church will grow,\\" is the fundamental assumption underlying Warren's book. But what theological warrant do we have for this assumption? In John 6, Jesus speaks to a large crowd about their need to \\"eat his flesh and drink his blood.\\" This truth-telling (i.e. seeker-oriented?) approach to ministry actually led many of Jesus' followers to abandon him (John 6:66). The pressing question for the church-growth movement in America is whether it believes that the church's misson to be a truth-telling people will of necessity lead to an increase in numerical growth. I, for one, am skeptical. Further, there is a continuing need for reflection on the theology of worship and theology of preaching underlying Warren's book. Such a task is beyond the scope of this present review."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought we weren't supposed to conform to the world???","review":"I wish I could give this book a minus star because its set a terrible example and is causing many sheep to starve. Rick Warren encourages pastors to run their church like a corporation using statistics and surveys to determine what message to preach and what music to play, etc.. This is so sad and is an example of the state of the church(in the USA) right now. The whole seeker friendly movement is causing much damage to the Body of Christ.PASTORS, if you want your church to grow then start praying, fasting and seeking God's face again!! Don't run to Egypt!Stop robbing the people, Pastors. If you want to be a CEO resign from your church and go secular. Otherwise come back to preaching the Cross!Preach Christ and Him crucified!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's beginning to Scare Me","review":"At first, I was enamored by the \\"Purpose Driven Church.\\" But, to my shame I didn't look deeper into the poor Bible translations used. I was caught uo in the hype. Qouting Robert Schuller as an example of successful ministry is bordering on heresy! Charging $4.00 a sermon on his (Rick Warren's)website is fleecing the flock. If you are a millionaire due to the success of the \\"Purpose Driven\\" books, why keep on raking in the bucks? Something doesn't sound right. Most churches are buying into the hype, line, hook, and sinker. It's all starting to scare me. Remember,the serpent in the garden mixed some truth into his lies. Is all this part of the great apostacy? We need to fast and pray for God to bring revival and church growth, the way the apostles and the great men of prayer (Mueller, Luther, Spurgeon, etc.) did! Look up! Your redemption is drawing near!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biblical principles for reaching an increasingly pagan world","review":"This book goes beyond \\"contemporary versus traditional\\" worship issues and addresses the greater question: how can we reach a lost world that is increasingly pagan and diverse? Warren uses the Bible as a reference point, rather than the traditions of the 1900's church models, to build a ministry model capable of communicating the gospel to a modern day world whose decadence and world view is becoming more and more like that of the pagan nations that surrounded the early Christians of the first century."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Purpose is to make people feel good and join.","review":"The Purpose Driven, or seeker friendly movement makes the gospel secondary to a friendly, enjoyable church experience. the tragedy is that people will think they are saved when they are not.

The purpose of *evangelism* is to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ: that the Way of the Cross is in fact the Truth and the Life. It is not surprising that no cross \\"obstructs the view\\" at Saddleback \\"Church.\\" Sacrifice, voluntary suffering, and solidarity with the poor in the struggle for justice don't make it in the door at this megachurch.I give this book two stars because there are some useful pointers in how to lift up a vision that will motivate a congregation to take risks in faith for the sake of those who have not heard the gospel. For the *content* of that gospel, run, do not walk, towards writers who understand that it is the Lamb who was slain that we follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"When Rick Warren writes a book, read it!

Without the cross there is no blood, without the blood there is no remission of sins. Several things mentioned in this book that go 100% against the word of God.

And they are all looking more to this book than the actual Bible, which should be the real insperation for church building."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Drippy Spiritual, But unfortunately not Biblical","review":"There are some very good insights in this book for pastors. However, if Scripture is your authority, this is not the book for you. Most Scripture quotations are taken out of context or are misquoted. The Theology in this book violates basic Hermenutical prnicples, and is overall poor. My question to the author is: Are you viewing Scripture through the eyes of your expirience, or viewing your expirience through the eyes of Scripture? The author has made the Bible say what he wants it to say. But, DO NOT take my word for it. Just look up all the Scripture References."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible Driven Church","review":"Dr. John MacArthur's new book, The Bible Driven Church, reminds us that it's not new programs or styles that makes for a successful church, but adherence to the preaching and teaching of the pure word of God.

Well... this book proves that! This is a great book, if you are into \\"feeling good\\" about yourself and if your focus is to build a huge church. However, if you are looking for actual and real change in your life through the power of the Holy Spirit... forget this atrocity! Sorry Mr. Warren, but the tickling of the ears is NOT what Christian teaching is supposed to be about, but you would know that if you'd actually teach the Bible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Principles - but not to copycat","review":"This is a great book because it attempts to get back to the five basic purposes of the book. Much of the book describes how these purposes are played out in Saddleback Church in Orange County, CA. Warren is quick to point out that this is not a blueprint to be copied, but too many people have used it that way. While sometimes overly pragmatic and lacking in theological context, the book is helpful in getting readers to examine exactly why they do what they do in church."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to read a history of Saddleback....","review":"There may be some valid, useful points in this book, however, to find them you have to wade through the history of Saddleback. While Saddleback may be a very good example of a growing church, and a very good example of successful redemption of non-believers, there are very few, if any, examples given of things that didn't work and why they didn't work. Reading this book it makes it look like Saddleback has never had any failures, that the way that Saddleback has been organized and is operated is the best way to operate a church today. There are few examples of options of doing things other than the way Saddleback has developed. If you would like to have yet another Saddleback clone, read this book and follow the programming suggestions. If you would like to grow your own church, take the information given in the book, adapt it to your purposes and create your own programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"apostasy","review":"This book is apostasy.

Success always draws criticism and those who would find their purpose in creating controversy.This book is an excellent model for building a church that focuses on what is important about building a church. There is good practical advice that will help you be successful in building a church that can not only be self-sufficient, but focus on its purpose - to fulfill the Great Commission and live the Great Commandment.It is not the Gospel, nor was it intended to be, nor does it need to be.

This stuff is just LOUSY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultism at its finest","review":"Rick Warren has managed to create a craze that is based on man's own desires rather than God's will. He encourages the watering-down of the gospel to appeal to his \\"Saddleback Sam\\" model of mankind. He encourages getting rid of church members who get in the way of \\"progress\\". He has attempted to push worldly culture into the church (1 John 2:16 and 4:5). This book only represents man's will, but pastors are starting to rely this worldly book as much as they are the Bible. The book is an interesting read, if you are interested in using Madison Avenue \\"marketing\\" techniques to \\"sell\\" the church. Do not sell yourself on this man's philosophies; use the Bible only as your guide to what the church is and should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"As I heard before, this book is one of the best written on the topic of church.

There is no room for silence or getting to know anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right way to think on growing a church","review":"Many of the negative critiques I've read of this book show that the author of the critique didn't read it very well. Rick's first statement is that the Gospel cannot be comprimised. Everything else is fair game. For those who don't believe this, I assume then that your church services are preached in hebrew, aramic and ancient greek as it was written? Cultures change and the method for spreading the word must as well. The purpose driven church is a road map for your church to execute powerfully the great commision.Rick's book gives a powerful, refreshing insight into how to build a healthy, loving church and fulfill the great commision and execute the two greatest commandments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Church Health","review":"This is the standard text of church growth in our day. Like it or not, churches that are growing and changing lives use some form of the ideas in this book as their template. The ideas are not new, they are biblical and taught with Warren's great talent to make the difficult into something we all can understand.Anyone that cares at all about fulfilling the Great Commission of Christ and changing the world in which we live should read this. The first time I read it I agreed with many of the other reviewers here; a few years later when I reread the book I was shocked at how much of it had become a part of my ministry. After 15 years, this is the single most important read (next to the Bible of course) in my ministry. I couldn't have done what I have done without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"McDonald's theology!!!","review":"So now we're reduced to mega-church marketing strategies, and spiffy songs with not much meaning, and \\"big is better\\" ideas. What have we come to? Oh, sure, Mr. Warren is in big demand, and maybe he has a great vision, but does his methodology work in other countries, or just in this vast consumer ocean called the United States?Maybe we ought to really look at what he is asking for, and really ask the question about whether his methods are really biblical or business oriented. Madison Avenue doesn't run the church nor does \\"feel good\\" theology stand the test of time. There is a Scripture verse which states to beware when men think highly of you. Maybe Rick should heed this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is church GROWTH?","review":"Is it a numbers game to get the biggest \\"crowd\\" possible? I've experienced a number of Purpose-Driven churches, and though Warren's claim is that there is no need to water-down the gospel, it seems that this in fact is what I've seen happen. Though not explicitly encouraged, there is a distinct undertone running through this book recommending that churches must be made palatable and inoffensive to the unbeliever. Also, for those who've grown to love the direct and intimate exchange between yours and the Father's heart during the music/singing/praising portion of the worship service, you'll find the principles and methods for worship unacceptable -- it seems to teach that it's all right to let your congregation drink from a thimble in spite of the tidal wave God is ready to pour out on us. Let's be driven by Spirit and Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic song will now be a classic picture book too","review":"What a super smart interpretation of a favorite old folk song!

This book misses the mark on (what I took to be) it's intended audience, badly. Hardly a book for a beginner to learn the subject, it's just a rehash of reference material available elsewhere. Why, oh why, does Amazon not have a rating of 0 stars for these reviews? END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This book is a real waste of money.

This is just too bad, since there are no other books currently on the market that cover VC++ OLE-DB development."},{"rating":"1","title":"I concur -","review":"I must agree with the first two reviewers that this book is extremely disappointing. The majority of the book is a simple catalog of interfaces and methods. There is absolutely no meaningful analysis or instruction. I too had trouble getting the code to work.

It's a book that is supposed to help you learn OLE DB in Visual C++, but it's hardly more than a reference manual for OLE DB with buggy code examples that the author insists is your fault. (\\"The code is correct, and has been debugged extensively\\"). There is no mention the framework of any of the subjects involved (COM+, ATL, OLE DB) and what each of the classes means. The code examples don't seem to have much aim to them, except maybe just to fill something in the book before the publishing deadline. I don't know why anyone would write a book like this... it's not educating.Please don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OLE DB Development With Visual C++","review":"This book was a big disappointment. The First three chapters are brief descriptions of COM, ATL, and MFC. But these chapters are far to brief to be of any use. This is fair enough given that this book to supposed to be about OLE DB. But Chapter Four buries the reader in all the details of OLE DB. I already have the MSDN Library, so I didn't need an inferior explanation of the all the intricacies of OLE DB. What I was looking for was a higher level explaination of the relationships between the Interfaces of OLE DB. I guess I will continue my search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"I can't think of a single positive about this book. Not only does it fail to teach anything about OLE DB development, the code presented simply does not work. (The author, however, claims that it will.) It actually gets worse, though. If you attempt to try to find any sort of updates, as mentioned by website in the book's introduction, you'll find that the relevant webpages don't exist!So, what you get is:-Reference information you can somewhere else (and more cheaply),-Nothing to learn,-Buggy code, and-No way to update itDo NOT buy this book for ANY reason, as the other reviewers have indicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song of the Cuckoo Bird","review":"I just finished reading this book and just had to write a review.

Add to this the songs of these people's Children and grandchildren and/or their friends and/or their relatives and visitors to the ashram.

For example, when Danielle beans the prince with an apple and she sees his face for the first time, her reaction is \\"how beautiful\\" he was--gimme a break! OK, so we get a few more details of why, how, and where things happened to fill in the blanks of the movie but honestly, it's hard to believe how the author could turn the wonderful storyline and characterizations so magically rendered by the movie into such one dimensional drivel.

Probably deserves a B+ for the well created mood though for some reason it feels weak throughout. Weakness is probably due to the modern story line that spends too much time patronizing modern political views of characters making an otherwise great idea continually weak as characters take off in different directions to be politically correct. It won't matter your political view - the drive of the movie suffers from the skitso-frenetic modern political characterizations that hurt the story build as they jump off in odd directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Genealogical info--Wonderful Book","review":"This book is a great compilation of chancery court records covering the years 1830-1866. I liked the way that the authors included a summary of the vital records abstracted from the court records. I would have liked for it to have contained a full name index as the surnames I'm researching are fairly common surnames. I do feel though, that this should be a minimal concern because this book contains a vast amount of insite into the lives of those who lived in Bedford Co. TN during that time.

Idylic days in the countryside transform into 3rd Reich madness and then a lifetime of nightmarish memories interwoven with daily survival. A movie that operates on different levels remains effective in running the gamult of emotions tinged with sadness and longing.

After reading and seeing two films based on experiences of the Holocust, Shindler's List and The Boy in Stripped Pajamas got me on my search again. As I said \\"THE PAWNBROKER\\" is a very heart wrenching story of the cruel nature of the \\"Nazi's\\".I applaud and give my deepest respect to those individuals who survived such cruelty.

Rod Steiger, the most underrated artist alive, in my opinion, plays a Jewish pawnbroker who struggles with memories of the war, loss of his family and the apathetic shell his life has become. When he finally realizes that the people around him need his concern and without it, they can't survive, it's too late. A young Quincy Jones composed the tremendous Jazz score that gives every scene depth and punch. The film is in black and white which makes the characters seem more shady, sad and poignant. It is filmed on location in Hell's kitchen, at that time, a derelict New York neighborhood. This gives the film an atmosphere of desperation, fear, foreboding and regret. It is a sensitive, complex film that stirs the emotions on so many levels.

After playing several guitars in the $200-300 price range this one sounded the best by far. It is some serious eye candy as well. It has rich bass & clear highs and sounds great for a laminate top guitar. It's sound does not compare to a quality solid spruce top guitar, but it is several hundred dollars less expensive than a solid top guitar. Playability is nice out of the box and it has stayed in tune with no issues. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice sounding, well built, new guitar for less than $300."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This game, I chose to wait and play until now because of the bad reviews that this game had gotten. I figured, there are other games that could be better for me to play, so I'll wait. Now that I finally played this game, I really think that this game is getting much less credit than it deserves. Sure, the game is glitchy, yes the controls are imperfect, but I still find enough enjoyment to keep playing this game. And if there are two things that I can say are perfect in this game, it's the music and the graphics. If you're a Sonic fan, I say it's at least worth giving a shot. Don't let everything the reviews say make you think that a game is bad, I learned the hard way that the only person who can say whether you like or hate a game, is you."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAWLZ","review":"This. is. the. worst. game. ever. handsdownif you like this.. youre under 10 years old, or you have a mental handicap.this game promotes beastiality with the relationship of sonic and a human. as well as lacks any fun or gameplay.+ the camera is horrible.why sega, why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh god why.","review":"Easily one of the worst games of all time, not to mention the worst 3d sonic game.

I'm amazed that this title would pass quality control.

It is by far the worst 360 game I've played. The most annoying feature is lack of configurable controls. The X-axis camera is inverted from what you'd typically find in a FPS game, and you can't change it. The camera gets blocked at the presence of any walls, as it doesn't move toward the character when encountering obstacles.Definately do not buy this for kids. The game will only frustrate them. It has too many glitches, too many opportunities to accidently lose lives, and too many usability problems, taking away any chance of this game being remotely fun.Thoroughly disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"there are very few video games which lack at least one good thing to mention. This is one of them. This game is a total waste of time and money. The graphics are cheesy, the characters movements are choppy and erratic and at times they get stuck in a corner, the load time between scenes is extremely long. What irritates me most is that when starting a town mission, there is often a load screen, then a 5 second cutscene, and then another long load screen.

I hope you are not expecting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Horrible","review":"This was my first Sonic game on the 360 and it is really bad. The graphics are not much. But that's not the worst part. The game really proceeds slowly. I think there are many unnecessary loads. For example, when doing a little mini-game to get something you have to wait for 20 seconds until it loads, then some guy explains what you must do and I usually press A to skip, at once another 20 second load starts. The mini-game takes about a minute and another 20 second load. If you fail, the whole load thing starts again. The controls are messed up too as well a camera angles. Save the money and buy something else. I got so bored with this game that I just quit after couple of levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing..","review":"I was very excited to get this game when it first came out. I must say that the excitement wore off pretty quickly as I played through the game. It's definitely got it's high points, but the camera angles, the scattered storylines, awkward controls, and extremely long load times kill the potential.Sonic really hasn't been the same since the Sonic Adventure games on Dreamcast, and also since the days of the Genesis..I'm hoping that the upcoming Sonic & The Secret Rings will help Sega redeem themselves.This game's definitely fun to play, but there's too many flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the good old Sonic!","review":"I was a huge Sonic fan back when I had a Genesis. I havent played much Sonic in between, but I have a Xbox 360 and thought this game would be fun and nostalgic. The graphics are great and the cut scenes are entertaining, but overall this game is a huge dissapointment. I found myself frustrated and angry to say the least at the lack of save options, glitchy gameplay and unbearable load times. Repeating entire stretches of levels over and over becuase I cant save after one level- I have to wait until I complete 3! Well that just sucks the fun out of it. I think I need anger management classes after playing this.

I'm happy for them. I tried, I really tried. To be frank, I hated it. I didn't get too far into the game, and it wasn't due to a lack of skill. It was simply because I found myself regretting any time I wasted playing, and I was honestly bored, though that is putting it mildly.

HUGE amount of glitches that ruin the enjoyment. Poor level design that make this completely frusterating, and Sonic seems to move slower then he did in past games.I would trust game reviewers when they say a game is bad, especially now, I have NEVER hated ANY Sonic game from the start until I play this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major speed bump","review":"For anyone planning on buying this game, forewarning: Make sure you are a major fan. Even then, a rental is advised. It is a shame that the series has plummeted to this level when it has so much more to offer. Everything from a shoddy camera, boring sidequests, cheap deaths, and repetitive characters make this one of the most disapointing titles in the series. Sure, the game isn't unplayable and even has a handful of decent moments, but even they aren't enough to save this from being a sub-par title. Make sure you are well prepared. For the fans: maybe. Everyone else: stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break out your old sega version","review":"If you have this in your hands in a store drop it. Definately not worth the money.

The graphics in the game are excellent, though they do take some time to get used to the sensitive controls, as, in many games, you must adjust.As a collector, this is one of my favourite Sonic the Hedgehog games (aside from Shadow the Hedgehog's game). The disc was in excellent condition, and I trust Amazon, and the sellers in this community, to all of my buying needs. The prices here are the BEST (Example of my personal experience -- I found a $180.00 sterling silver ring for only $14.00, and I LOVE it!!!

For instance, when Silver shouts \\"It's no use!\\", he launches an unavoidable psychic attack which kills you even with some rings on hand.Sure, I'll give Sega credit for making games challenging to play, but if you make it too challenging, this is what you get! Glitches that cause trouble for the player who merely wants to scroll through the storyline.Plus, I don't like the new look on Dr. Eggman. I mean he looks a bit younger.Next time, Sega, don't be rushed to release the game if you're not done with it yet. I hope you're doing a remake of Sonic 2006 for 2011 which would be Sonic's 20th anniversary.Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mediocre offering from Sega.","review":"I purchased this game just to give it a fair go.Unfortunately, the issues that plague this game are, as expected, enough to drag down my opinion of the game.The largest annoyances for me are the voice acting (I have to listen to this?!) and the camera (I am perfectly capable of wielding the camera on my own).The voice acting for this game is nerve-grating at best. One thing I noticed is that I couldn't find an option to switch to the Japanese voice acting, which would have made it a little more bearable at least for a couple of minutes.The camera is agitating -- it likes to snap around and change on its own after you finally get it into a comfortable position to run along and do things. Even better are scenes that LOCK the camera after moving it to the worst angle possible.I finished a couple of stages, and just found the game too aggravating to continue.Pass on this one. Not even for a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, period.","review":"I had high hopes for this game. I guess I should have read some reviews before buying it. Simply put, the quality of this game is the worst I've seen for the XBox 360. The graphics look pretty good when its not glitching. Load times are long for such short levels. The camera angles are my biggest complaint. Seriously, I couldnt see where I was going more than 60% of the time. I suppose I'll read reviews before buying another Sega game for the 360. -Scott"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music,Nothing much else","review":"Its a shame.

In the meantime, he gains valuable insight about himself. The dates are interesting and funny, with Yoba playing off the performances of the widely-varying temperments and personalities of the women he meets. If you missed this one in the theater, rent or buy it, an additional treat being a performance by Jim Gaffigan of the TV series \\"Welcome to New York\\" as an everyman waiter who sees Yoba, on his many dates, as a Don Juan to be revered, not knowing the true chaos going on in the man's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"bbbbllllaaaahhhhhzzzzzeeeeyyyy","review":"This was so tired as a film and a story.

The Tadpoles celebrate their heroes, paying sonic homage to such luminaries as Pink Floyd, Spacemen3 and My Bloody Valentine, while sounding entirely fresh and unique. David Max's crisp, occasionally skeletal bass lines propel these mystical grooves, often drenched in feedback and psychosis.If you want to do your friends a great service, ply them with their intoxicant of choice and put this little gem in the spinner.Note: Pity neither of my personal faves, \`Feel Like a Freak' nor \`Clea', are available as samples, as they are the standout tracks of the two principle songwriters, revealing the powerpop sensibilities of Todd Parker (Freak) and the more long-form lyricism of Nick Kramer (Clea). Still, any of the available snippets would make for a tempting taster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heating and Cooling","review":"This book explains the basics of heating and cooling very well.

There is little, if any romantic scenes, NO love scenes, and no passion at all. This book is a book about a marriage of convienence, a ill bred albeit wealthy woman and a titled but poor man. IMO, his family behaves terribly to Susannah after she saves their lousy hides, they have no problem of pointing out that she is base born while happily spending her money. The husband acts not much better.While this behavior is certainly more accurate than most passionate regencies I'm used to-I guess I'd rather enjoy the fiction than be perturbed by reality.

The four large set buttons are exposed in such a way as to be inadvertently bumped and changing the function which happens all the time.

I wore this watch a couple of times and I'd look at the watch to check for time and it is showing me some mess about degrees of the sun, tides or moon!

The window for the date is right below the \\"12\\", but it is SO small that I can barely read it.

It's as big as any man's I have seen, and the black rubber strap is purely functional, this will never fall off. I tested it extensively diving in the waters of Hawaii over two weeks, it looks brand new despite rugged conditions. I bought it primarily for the tide keeper function, as a shallow water sailor that matters a LOT to me, and for that funtion it is perfect, the dial is easy to read, understand, and use.

Unfortunately, she fails to establish a character in her performance, and all one can hear is a good soprano gliding through Strauss's vocal lines instead of being treated to the presence of Helen. Tanner is similarly two-dimensional as Menalaus, and his voice becomes harsh in quite a few places. The best sung performance comes from Shafer's Aithra, while the performances in the other roles are merely of mediocre quality.Botstein's conducting fails to please, as it is too hard-driven and lacking in subtlety. While the sound is generally good, the orchestral textures aren't made very clear. As a result, the opera comes across as rather charmless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad casting and indifferent conducting","review":"I had high hopes for this new recording, but I was severely disappointed. Voigt doesn't do as well as expected in the title part, her voice sounding not at all gorgeous and her interpretation wooden. The other cast members are even less satisfactory. Botstein conducting lacks imagination and Straussian heft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary performance","review":"I found the performance here to be very ordinary in quality. It is not good enough to make a strong case for this musically sumptuous and dramatically problematic opera.

This series is an easy fun read that is great for your summer reading list. If you love mystrey novels with a some personal drama thrown in for flair this book is a read. This series Mardi Gras Mambo, Jackson Square Jazz and Bourbon Street Blues are center around the PI, Scotty Bradley.Scotty tends to get himself in to some of the most interesting situations personally and professionally. I would recommend reading these in order so that you can grow with the character of Scotty. I am glad to hear that Greg is not done with Scott Bradley but only took a break from him for awhile.

I found the exact wheels at sears, they were rated for 50lb load. while that may make sense (4 wheels each with a 50lb load rate ==200lb load) that only works with an even load.

Elvis is a million miles away from Memphis (at least in his mind) and he could do so much better. His voice is as good as ever, and he is learning to stretch it to get even more from it. His choice of material is weak though.Suspicion heads the list here, and we go downhill quickly. Night Rider and That's Someone you'll never forget are at least passable. But the rest of the material is forgettable, you will have no desire to repeatedly listen to it.Buy this if you have to have everything Elvis ever did, or if it has some significance to your personal past.

Usually the food is underspiced, overcooked, or just a terrible mix of ingredients. The few recipes in this book that have worked, like the Couscous stuffed Squash, are marred by typos.

I was surprised that, despite all the exotic spices, this is some of the blandest food I have ever tasted. I haven't tried all the recipes yet (I haven't had time for most of them), but I'm losing faith in the odds of finding something I'll be willing to eat more than once.I wouldn't recommend this book for a beginner or part-time vegetarian. It's not very easy to use, and not much worth the trouble. (And if you don't live near a health-food or ethnic food store, you will have trouble finding some of the required ingredients.)Also, the nutritional information in the beginning is not completely accurate.

My Palm V is about a year old and has NO scratches on the screen because I've always used these sheets. This is even more amazing when you consider that my 8 year-old son plays games on my Palm all the time. Most games require tapping and moving the stylus on the screen, not on the writing area. Without these sheets, I wouldn't let him use it; with the sheets, it's no problem.But there are tradeoffs. The clarity of the screen is diminished a little. And, it takes some care to apply them without bubbles -- but you can do it. Also, after using a sheet for a while (about 1-2 months for me) they become uneven and handwriting is a little harder.So, if screen protection is what you want (whether it's kids or a harsh operating environment) then you can deal with the tradeoffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Protection for the Palm Vx","review":"I noticed that the screen of my Palm Vx showed fingerprints and dirt very easily, and I was looking for something that would go on and come off very easily, without leaving any sort of residue or tack on the screen. This product is just that, it has a light texture that allows easier pickup from the stylus, which is an excellent feature. The textured surface also acts as a filter for the screen, it is hard to view it at longer distances, which could be a great feature for privacy reasons, but I found that using it as close as I have before, I have no problem reading the screen, if not easier on the eyes. Personally, I thought the product was a bit pricey at first, but it contains enough protectors for an entire year! Its well worth the cost to protect a valued investment. If you have purchased a Palm V(x) or you are purchasing one, be sure to pick up this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and annoying","review":"While they may protect the screen they are very difficult to apply without getting air bubbles.

I have serious misgivings about its claims. The only one that I would not have a quarrel is that it protects your screen. As for the others they are not what they claim. One the claims are that it helps improve handwriting recognition. I did not notice any difference in accuracy. The other is that it helps prevent glare. This I found completely unfounded. The plastic sheet reduces the sharpness of the display and does nothing to improve glare. The other issue was that the sticky plastic sheets are very hard to place on the display and frequently takes many attempts in order to get it in the correct position.

When I first saw it at seven, I thought the scene where Phyllis Kirk goes up to the figure of Marie Antoinette and lifts the wig to reveal human hair beneath (it's her murdered friend played by Carolyn Jones) was scary as HELL (Price is sitting right in a wheelchair and sez \\"You shouldn't have done that, my dear\\"!)

As other people have said, it is definitely not very original. It's good if you are really into that whole vampire thing, but otherwise, I'd get it from the library instead of buying it. I bought the hardcover version, read it in one night, and haven't touched it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it less if I could","review":"All right. We know that the author is young-I myself am 14, and I write too. True, my works haven't been published-and for one good reason: I know not to try. What was this girl thinking, that people over the age of say, eight or nine, would be even slightly interested in this dry and empty tale? It's not truly an all-bad piece of work-but it's nothing that deserves even ONE star. Amelia, I hope you read this and realize your limitations-SOON."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new vampire writer to review this work","review":"While I have hunted down this book with high expectations, thinking to myself \\"OMG! a teen writer?\\" However, from the first page I was skeptical. The present tense is terrible. The chapters are barely one page in NORMAL book fonting! Characters pop in, get named, and leave. There's very little devlopement, Risika seems too powerful for her time (and too outspoken! dear lord!) Aubrey is annoying, just as Armand was annoying. Ather is cool, though. Ather was the only one with any developement. I think Ms. Atwater-Rhodes needs to not worry about focusing on a million characters and focus on working with a few and a distinct mythology, storyline, etc. Bouncing back and forth between two tiem periods coudl have been done in a different way.I say we all wait before calling her the vampire queen, the next Anne Rice, and so forth! I have it in good knowledge that there's going to be someone new in the night and they'll be the next Bram Stoker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Writer's Fresh; The Material Is anything But","review":"The author being 14 is just about as interesting the book goes. I must say it's quite an impressive debut for a book, especially for someone of her age. You can read about characters like these in any other novel out there, not to mention how the whole vampire theme has been overblown. Aside from that, the setting was well put. Yet, there is much room for improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"product of a creative writing project for class","review":"I know that this book was written when the author was 13 years old, but from all the rave reviews and stuff, I was expecting a little more....more plot, more character building.....more substance. But it lacked so much I just wanted to get it over with. Thankfully the book is short. Too bad I spent 6 bucks on it. If you are looking for something with more of the vampire lore, some suspense, keep looking. This book did not do it for me, but if you wish to try her out, check it out at the library instead.Perhaps this author has grown and has since published better works, but I am turned off. At least she can at least say she's a published author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overral good book","review":"This book is certainly not one of her best. i would prefer to read Hawksong , which is better.This is a good book anyway in the fact that it is interesting and has alternating time settings.It's like a new ,fresh from of vampire breed due that Risiks(the main character)turns into a hawk and another thing I won't say...read the book.you should take a look at it. garanteed good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not nearly what the hype makes it up to be.","review":"...I am completely disenchanted with Ms. Atwater-Rhodes.It's wonderful that she's written a novel at her age.Hurrah.But there is a REASON that so many young writers are not yet published professionally.She doesn't have the experience. The plot is rather uninspired, the tone is overly pretentious, and the writing is not only needlessly wordy, but also very vague at some points.It took me an afternoon to read, after which I honestly couldn't pick out a standout part of the narrative. I couldn't remember enough of it to do so.While her accomplishment is wonderful, her writing has yet to stand up to the challenge of being anything beyond mediocre.It does give me hope for my self-publishing plans, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre book with mediocre feeling...","review":"If anything, the only thing that this book lacked was emotion. You have the tortured heroine, the crafty (and slightly alluring) villian, the tearing of the main character's very being... But no substance. Miss Rhodes does show promise, but so far all I'm seeing is potential. The follow up to 'In the Forests of the Night', 'Demon in My View' is much better, I'd say. In the time between the two books she really honed her skills and came out with a suprisingly well done book. In this book, the characters seem forced and stereotypical, arrogant and dull. Don't get me wrong, I'd still say it was worth a read, but allow yourself the dissapointment only once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires? I think not.","review":"First of all, aren't vampires supposedly SCARY? Keep-you-up-at-night, shivering-in-fear scary? Well, reviews claim this is a \\"vampire\\" book, but it is seriously lacking in scariness.You may pick up this book from your library, (or, in my unfortunate case, BUY it,) and you do that because you LIKE vampire stories and WANT to be scared, not played with!This book is seriously lacking good description-actually ANY description other than description of hair, eyes, skin, and-wait, that's it. That's not characterization. Characterization is mainly how a character reacts to situations and what they say or do. The characterization for Risika, the main character in the Forests of the Night, was mainly that she was a vampire holding a grudge against the vampire who had killed her brother. That's not bad, but she holds the grudge for 300 YEARS.That's a long time. Very long.Very very.Basically, this book could easily be classified as childish.Duh.It was written by a 13 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unbiased Point of View","review":"Ok. let me explain my rating. it was not an AWFUL book. But I did not particularly like it. the way the author went from from past to present was confusing at times. And she over used a few \\"big\\" words to the point that it was extremely annoying. I found the main character to be bland and boring. The story itself needed a lot more life. Overall, if you're a fan of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes (which i am) then, read it and form your own opinin. but if you're not a fan of hers or just starting to read her books, do NOT read this one first. It is not very good. ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"I sincerly hope that she becomes better...","review":"...because she does have skills but this book was an embarrassment. The book was short and the main character, Rachel a.k.a Risika supposedly had centuries of a past of which, for the most part, were absent in the book. And for Risika to be hundreds of years old, she seems to have gained nearly no wisdom or greater knowledge than when she was a teenager in the 1700's. She may be immortal and her physical appearance to be the same as that she had years ago, but her mind has to have developed in some way. On the other hand, the style Amelia Atwater-Rhodes uses is poetic and very easy to follow. Also, the dark atmosphere was well constructed. I liked Aubrey as a character and the fight scenes between him and Risika were okay, though short. So there's the two stars-for her style of writing and some action between two okay characters. Go read it and think about it anyway you want. Luckily, the paperback version is out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars. One for her Age. One for Getting Published.","review":"Well, kudos to the young author for writing a novel at her age. She is an inspiration. And deserves all the publicity she received. And way to go in even getting taken seriously by an agent and a publishing company. Those are her two stars! What an amazing accomplishment.But alas, it's a real world out there. There's not much in this slim volume to get excited over. You never get a sense of why the main character is so bitter and has held a grudge for 300 years. And why now after all this time does she decide it's time to act upon it? What was the spark that led the events of this story to take place? And please remember, you can't wrap it all up with a surprise in one page at the end.Reading about vampires is always fun to me. But a book has to come from somewhere and lead you somewhere.Admirable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifts beyond her years!","review":"A wonderful first novel from a gifted young writer from Concord. Her use of flashback and flashforward techniques are impeccable. Her style is thickly gothic and atmospheric, and her use of her artistic gifts and senses amazed me for one so young. She has gifts beyond her years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant first novel by a teenage girl.","review":"This book would be excellant even if the author hadn't written it when she was just thirteen. Risika/Rachel was a great character; forced to make agonizing moral choices as a 300-year-old vampire while at the same time hunting the vampire she believes killed her brother in the late 1600s. She must face who she is and the fact she is partly responsible, and learn the truth about revenge and what really happened 300 years ago when she was turned. A wonderful first effort; I can't wait for Ms. Atwater-Rhodes's second novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the forests of the night","review":"A good teen vampire fiction novel. Different from many in that the main character(Risika) is the vampire not a girl in love with a vampire. We get to see things from a vampire's point of view. Risika is 300 years old and is out to avenge the death of her twin brother Alexander whom she thinks was killed by Aubrey, a vampire and her arch enemy.Risika doubts her strength and powers and only challenges Aubrey after receiving a black rose similar to the one he gave her 300 years ago.It was a very fast read that has a suprising ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about vampires and personal demons","review":"In the forests of the night is one of the best books I have ever read! Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, the author, wrote it in her early teens and it is awesome! Its about a girl who lives in the 1700's and becomes immortal as a vampire. The book flips between the 1700's and the present, telling a story of a young girl who has to stand up, not only to her fiercest enemies, but to her own problems in life. Or I should say, her death..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better","review":"I HATE horror books, but his one was differnet it had a hidden meaning and swept me away........they next books she wrote are much better watch out these aren't fariy tales I when you read the books you truly believe in vapires and every thing inbetween!! but it truely is wonderful my I hope that you will read the others because they are page turners!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a young author!","review":"I read this book in one sitting, and was very entertained by the plot as well as the intense good vs. evil development of the characters. Since I, too, am an aspiring teenage author, I was very inspired to even see a book by someone so young on the shelf, much less think so highly of it. The whole book, especially the fight scene at the end, builds on a strong moral rivalry between Risika and Aubrey/Ather. I found the ending a bit of a let down, but the quality of the novel as a whole made up for that. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially other teenage writers. Congratulations, Amelia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Read","review":"This book was very good but a little too short. I'm taking that into the account that the author is only 14 years old and people her age rarely write books not to metion get published. This book is easily in the top 50 out of 750 I've read in the past three years (I'm only 13 myself). I'd recomend this book along with my favorite book ever Companions of the Night by Vivian Vande Velde. Anyone can e-mail me at MegsTamika@webtv.net to share recomendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for \\"In the Forests of the Night\\"","review":"I thought this book was amazing! I've always been fascinated my vampires and such folklore, and this book has made me want to learn as much as I can! I also found it very inspirational, because I am a 14-year-old aspiring author, and just the fact that someone my age can finally receive recognition and respect as a writer gives me the courage to go after my dream! Keep it up, Amelia! I can't wait to read your future work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised that this was written by a 14 year old!","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend, and I was a little skeptical. A book written by a fourteen year old girl? Her writing skills are very advanced for her age, but still needs improvement. It shows that a teenager did write this book by poor dialogue in places. The book is short and very straight to the point (bad, in my opinion, for a novel) and needed more description and to be longer. A good book altogether, made for a younger crowd, but a nice afternoon book. Probably, get it from the library first and if you like it, then buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was a great start for someone so young. Though I hated the book length this story was stylish. I thought she destroyed the Vampire lore by making them be able to survive the daylight though since Vampires are \\"night creatures\\". It was great so I'll give her five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little plot, unoriginal....nice style","review":"The ONLY credit I'll give this book, is that the author has a cool writing style. It's poetic. I'll give it that. However, style doesn't make up for an unoriginal plot, undeveloped characters, and not enough description. In things like vampire novels and fantasy books, it's vital that there is plenty of description so that the reader comes to understand what this world is like. This book doesn't give enough. Also, it seems that the author tries to force themes. I don't think that these problems in the book have anything to do with the author's age, you're never too young to start writing, but she needs to start working on her plots. There are plenty of better books than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mmmmmm.....","review":"Well...the book was okay, but...the characters weren't developed enough. Not enough depth throughout the book. I wonder if her next book will be better... I anticipated LOTS of action, but, then too, I am a loyal V.C. Andrews fan, and may I add that Andrews is the best writer in history. Not enough action for me, nothing at all. It was a good try, I have to admit, despite the lack of action and depth. Perhaps her next book will be better. No offense to those of you who thought it was great, but just because she's so young doesn't mean she's any good. Maybe the only reason she was published was because of her age...I mean, a friend of mine is trying to get her book published, but she isn't having any luck and she's fifteen years old. Hopefully my friend can get her book published [It's 220 pages] and have the luck that this girl had. I expect Miss Atwater-Rhodes to possibly improve with her next books. Sorry, you tried, but it just wasn't any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, rovoting, a twisting plot!","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes did a fair job of this book. I would like to point out a few mistakes of the reviewers however: 1. Amelia is no longer 14. She is actually 16, almost 17. 2. She said clearly in the book that Risika did not know anything about her name, and did not care to find out, at the current moment.On with the rewiew! In The Forests of the Night is a book about vampiress Risika. Talking about her past of how she was changed against her will into a vampire, she is one of the strongest in the world. She discusses her relationship with Aubrey-her blood brother, only by vampire means, and the war they have been waging. I found this book interesting, because I would like to become an author one day, nearly completing my first book. This book is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping story!","review":"Although I tend to prefer Amelia's other book, Demon in MyView, this book is definetly gripping and haunting. it tells thestory of a three-hundred year old vampire, risika, though her own eyes. Going back in flashbacks to her mortal life. the feelings and conflicts in the book are almost too real. She is definetly an excellent author and I would recomend her book to most age groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"....Spoilers below!","review":"I'm sorry, I hate to be negitive but what was the point of this book? I kept reading thinking that my question would be answered, but it never was. The main character is heart broken when her brother is killed and she is turned into a vampire, but when she has the opportunity to avenge her and her brothers death, she doesn't? Then she finds out her brother is alive and then turns her back on him? What is the point? Ugh, if this book wasn't only 147 pages long I would have stopped reading it. I had high hopes the story would turn around and have a purpose but it just falls flat. I am very grateful I checked this book out at the library instead of wasting my hard earned $7.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"This reads like a 16 year old wrote it...","review":"...which is a compliment, I suppose, considering she was 13 when it was penned. It's actually quite impressive for such a young woman, but the sheer wall of angst, the repetitive use of such overdone terms as good, evil and innocence, not to mention 300 year old creatures who react like high school students when approached with conflict...well, suffice it to say that the high rating this novel has received overall leaves me baffled. The tone, conflict and resolution call out the author's adolescence. I suspect in time, as she gets more life experience, she will be quite good at the craft, but for now? Not so much.If you are in high school yourself, this might be a good read. Otherwise, skip it. There's plenty of YA lit of high enough caliber to appeal to adult sensibilities. On the plus side, this is an extremely short book, so you won't waste too much of your life if you feel the need to actually complete it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! great stuff for any age writer","review":"The smooth flowing fast moving text kept me entranced... I couldn't put it down. What I find most interesting in this vampire teen fiction novel is that the main character is a 300 year old female vampire. In other teen fiction vampire novels I've read (The Silver Kiss; and Look for me by Moonlight) the main characters are girls who fall in love with vampires.Risika (formerly Rachel) is a 300 year old vampire whom is trying to avenge the death of her twin brother Alexander over 300 years ago. Risika tries to keep morals she was brought up with as a girl in the late 1600s and early 1700s. This is almost impossible for her to do however now that she must kill humans to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nicely Done!","review":"This book is both poetic and intriguing, one of the best first-time authors there are. The poem in the beginning is a nice touch (and yes, I do realize she didn't write it). The flashbacks only add to the book's deep plot as a vampire, Risika, deals with human mortality issues. As Aubrey, another vampire, enters the scene, he threatens everything she believes and her one love: a tiger called Tora. This book will keep you reading until the breathtaking climax and deeply felt conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the next will be better","review":"Was it just me or did anyone see that this book lacked a lot? First off, the length of the book was way to short for the story. It seemed to be rushed and simplified. The style of writing was nothing that can stand out in the Young Adult genre (very similiar to Anne Rice's over dramatized style). And the story was the same old vampire-point-of-view tale. I don't really want to start on plot holes, but I will. I lost count after about page 70 on how many times I fell into one of the many plot holes. On a final note, I would like to say that Rhodes will hopefully mature and become more creative over the years. And I am looking forward to see what she has in store for the next novel and will read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and gimmicky","review":"In the Forests of the Night is disappointing on many levels, not the least of which is the fact that any attention commanded by this poorly executed and hackneyed first effort stems solely from the fact of its author's tender age. This serves not only as a gimmicky lapel-grabber (\\"Wow, she's good _for her age_!\\"), but also to deflect criticism of the story (\\"Well, so it's not that great. But she's good _for her age_\\").I don't doubt that young people can write just as well as older authors, but this smacks of a publicity stunt (particularly since this \\"Carol Sutch\\" is listed as co-author). Plaster her face in Seventeen and Teen People and watch the borderline-illiterate teenyboppers come a-runnin'. I pity Ms. Atwater-Rhodes; like teen idols of popular music, she will now never be allowed to grow artistically. Her credibility is shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I so love this book!","review":"I liked how it did the flash backs and explained how Rachel/Risika became a vampire. I also liked how Amelia explained in the book that her vampires were not allergic to sunlight, ect. I loved the ending. We find out what happens to Risika's twin brother Alexander. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Things That Bump In The Night","review":"I thought that this was a well written book.The chapters are short,yes.

Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great!","review":"It is like all the other vampire books out there and it kinda wasn't that great. I think the only reason everyone is reading it, is because of the author's age. The book wasn't original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A solid first effort, but more potential than skill","review":"This book is a good first effort for any author, but it does have some weak points that may disappoint avid vampire readers. Focusing on the usual topics of transformation and the nature of evil, the story is simple and the characters somewhat shallow. Overall, the story feels like a good introduction to these characters and their world, but it doesn't provide enough depth in characters or plot to be very satisfying. Although the plot is quickly and tightly paced, I would have enjoyed a little more time spent exploring this book's characters and themes--the story felt too sparse (almost rushed-through) in some areas. The author does show a very good amount of potential in her writing, but one has to wonder if this book was published solely because of the story's merits, or because of the public relations novelty of a fourteen-year-old writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish in the Extreme","review":"If you want a self-published piece of garbage, go ahead and buy it.

I don't usually read this type of horror story and yet I still couldn't put it down. I read this book out of curiosity because of the author's young age.

This book was possibly one of the most childishly written books I have read since I was decided to read Spy X: The Code (also not a good idea to read)! It took me about an hour to read it and it sucked. Alot. You couldn't really get what was going on until the middle of the book. I mean REALLY, who would think that a book could be written so poorly. Not only was it not straight out scary, but it wasns't even vaguely creepy. DULL, just dull. I wanted to rate this well because it was written by a thirteen-year-old who hadn't ever published anything before, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"This was THE WORST book I have ever read in my entire life. First of all, it was way to short for me. I read it in a little over an hour. I felt as If I had just read on of those 3rd grade reading level books. Second of all, this is the most UNORIGINAL book I ever read! Its like the author read a few vampire novels and rewrote them in her own words, which arenot that great. I swear there is not one original idea in this entire story! Third, the story is not that great at all. Many parts are just well, dumb. There is maybe 1, possibly 2 interesting parts in the book. Trust me, this book is not worth buying or getting out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"double check","review":"In the Forest of the Night is as easy to follow as seeing in the pitch-black night.

They try and act like spies, although there is not much action. They try and try to free the tiger, and when they reach success it feels so good but they feel guilty because they took the tiger from the other people. This book is a two star book.

Though she hunts and kills, she remembers a life in the 1700s which was filled with a close family (including a twin brother) and a fear of the damned. Unfortunately for Risika, she is one of the damed now. In the Forests of the Night jumps back and forth between present day and the 1700s in order to weave a tale of how Rachel became Risika. She has a deadly rivalry against Aubrey, the vampire who killed her brother and beat her in a fight. She refuses to be weak in Aubrey's eyes and enters his territory even after repeated warnings not to. Finally, she decides to challenge him. What will be the outcome?A good book. Amazingly written for a 13 year old. I liked Demon In My View better though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Okay Start...","review":"I've already read three of Amelia's books and this one is my least favorite. I still think its good though. It's the most depressing of the three. The main character is Risikia, a human who is changed into a vampire against her will by Ather. She soon becomes enemies with Aubrey, the male vampire that hangs out with Ather( I wonder about Ather, did she change Aubrey too?)The book tries to make you hate Aubrey(Actually, the more bad stuff he did, the more I started to like him) and I don't know what happened (maybe its just me?) but in the end I end up sympathising with Aubrey and being mad at Risikia. Is this Amelia's fault or is it just me? Either way, if you want to get seriousy depressed(I like these kinds of books...weird, huh?) then I suggest you read it. But if your like my friend(who I won't name here, but she's really sensitive-into \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" type stuff) I wouldn't recommend it to you.(..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly the work of an amateur","review":"Frankly, if I had not known anything about this girl, I still would have known that this was written by a kid. Just by reading it you can tell because traces of her immaturity tend to show up in her writing. For example, too many of her similes are unnecessary and certain aspects were not believable. She leaves certain points in her book unresolved, which makes the ending a little confusing. I was a little dissapointed by the fact that her main character's angry vengeance was in vain and only a simple misunderstanding. These are mistakes no true professional would have made. I was appalled by the fact that many of her reviewers were giving her book five stars. For goodness sakes, don't lie to the poor girl! If everyone tells her that she is a great writer then there will be no room for improvement, something that is much needed. Although she has alot of potential,she still has a long way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"There just wasn't much to it.","review":"I read this book with high hopes, but it left me feeling flat. There simply wasn't much substance to this book, and I found myself disappointed. The plot was light, the characters not particularly well developed, and the story was inconsistent. But, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and some people obviously enjoyed it. ;)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An admirable start, but...","review":"I don't read vampires at all, so I can't really consider myself very well qualified to judge this book. However I am an avid reader and an aspiring writer myself, so here goes. The plot was good, a bit clichéd, but well done clichés at the least. The characters were very original and I believe what carries the book. The actual writing, however, I wasn't very happy with. There wasn't really any \\"meat\\" to the story; I read it in five hours from cover to cover. It felt very sparse. I was disappointed, I have to admit, but I'm not discouraged. I'm going to buy her next book, I swear it, and her next after that because at fourteen she is a mature and obviously very skillfull writer and I can tell you honestly... in the future, she is going to be *darn* good. (I'll become familiar with vampire lore yet...) One annoying thing about the story, though: she contradicts herself. The cover is pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The book was okay for a freshman book, could of been better. There's just no depth really there.

I am tempted to say that it was very good--for her first book, like many other people have, but I know that if Amelia Atwater-Rhodes was an adult, no one would say that. Being 13 myself though, I know I could never do what she did. I found that this book, although I could't put it down, did not really have the suspense I've found in the few other vampire novels I've read. It was gripping, but it did not really frighten or thrill me.

The brim shape (turned down all the way across the front and turned up in back) and the crease are permanently set, although if you didn't care for it, you might be able to take it to a hat shop, and they might be able to re-do it for you. It's quite nice as it is, however. It does not come with a hat band, but this wouldn't stop you from supplying your own and changing them as the mood strikes you.The shipping was very fast, and the hat came packed well. A plastic dome was set inside the hat so that it wouldn't get crushed in transit.

But hell, it's Marky! And to my surprise the songs aren't even all that bad, some of them are really great and the rest are good (but I've got to admit that this CD is better than just about every new \\"rock\\" band out there put together), and the four Ramones cover songs that come as a bonus are really good. Of course Marky delivers an awesome sound on the drums, and Nick Cooper's (the lead singer) voice doesn't have that damn whiney sound that a lot of other bands do! Halleluja!

Failing.This album could be easily described as \\"Holy Diver part 67\\". But worse.

RJD has retained the sevice of bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Simon Wright, and found yet another \\"unknown\\" smokin' guitarist in Doug Aldrich.

The bonus tracks are well recorded live tracks with Dio singing as guest performer at a Deep Purple concert. The limited edition comes with the music video to Push, and its great. I'll just tell you that it has Tenacious D in it and that makes it oh so much better. I love how Dio got them to be in the music video after they came out with the \\"Ballad to Dio\\" song. A must. CD case also comes in a cool slip jacket, much like the the slip cases the new Iron Maiden CD's come in.

I'm glad I gave it a chance. It's apparent that some reviewers certainly didn't. The first song \\"Killing the Dragon\\" is classic Dio. Sounds like it could have come from anything he did in the '80s. The pace of the entire album is a bit slower than what he did in the '80s in general, but still faster than some of his later work. I prefer a nice fast pace with a solid riff. This is definitely simpler than his last outting, the concept album \\"Magica\\", but simpler isn't necesarily a bad thing. This cd rocks almost all the way through. The only song I really didn't care for is \\"Rock and Roll\\". I think it's just too cliched to be included with the rest of these solid tunes, but I assure you that the rest of the cd more than makes up for it.

The level of detail is impressive, and it's incredibly informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL -- Don't Buy It!","review":"After seeing all the five star ratings, I bought this dvd only to be sorely disappointed. Made on the cheap, it is presented by re-enactments that show only unfocused faces and lots of feet walking, running, etc. There is so much information out there about Victoria and the British Empire but this documentary hardly explores any of it - it fails to deliver. Truly, truly awful, fit for ages 5 -7."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a Broad Overview than a Lesson","review":"I bought this tape expecting the \\"listen and learn\\" method of better speech that was promised.

I wish they would have taken more time to give concrete help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain AWFUL!","review":"I hate to be so negative, but do not waste your time or money on this item. It delivers nothing that it promises, in fact, it doesn't even seem to have a genuine purpose at all. Several 'professional' speakers crack endless lame jokes about contemporary speech and hold a painfully stinted scripted conversation about the vital importance of speaking well, patting themselves on the back about how accomplished they all are in that area while imparting nothing in the way of instruction. In fact, I found two of the speakers miserable to listen to! The female was much too loud and excessively animated while one of the males was so nasal that you could hear the air running through the back of his sinuses as he talked, clicking epiglottis and all - things that they cautioned the listeners against doing themselves!I couldn't finish this set, after the first CD, the speaker's voices were like nails on a chalkboard and I dropped it back off at the library the first chance I got."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"I got this camcorder only a few weeks ago, but I am in love!

Unfortunately, the battery on this model is different. The product is very user-friendly. I mainly use it for home use: ballet, gymnastics, outdoor play, life, etc. It works well for our family.

And you can almost picture Riker naked at the Betazoid wedding,just kidding, no seriously this book is very good it has a good plot and you can't beleive the ending I mean it is enexpected. I truely liked this book. It tells you all about Will's and Deanna's past and how it will be in the future. This book is exactly wonderful. If you've ever wondered what happened on Betazed the first time Will and Deanna met this book tells all. And then Riker has to go against Data and then Data goes after Will.

For anyone interested in finding out what would have happened with the Riker / Troi relationship, had it been different, this is the perfect book for you... Stunning scenes can be created in one's mind while reading this incredible book, scenes to make one drool, and others to make one cry... Believe me, this is one book that you would love to read more than once... and if you are like me... I would also recommend the audio tape of Imzadi, featuring Jonathan Frakes as the narrator... I could listen to that voice for hours... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story","review":"This is not only an action packed adventure, but a tale of romance and courage at it's best. The plot will knock you off your feet and the characters will sweep you away. It tells of some of the history of Deanna and Will before The Next Generation and continues into a possible future. It also provides interesting insight into the \\"Gatekeeper\\" who lives(or exists?) outside of time. This is an excellent book for all ages"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, sad, sexy, funny, exciting","review":"Imzadi is the one of the best STTNG books I have read. Peter David (my favorite Star Trek author) really brought the relationship of Will and Deanna to life: how their relationship started, how it changed them both, what split them apart, and how, in spite of all that was in the past, their relationship endured, even beyond death. It even explains what the word Imzadi means. What more could you want from a book! If you have any love of Star Trek the Next Generation, you should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the reason paper shredders were created...","review":"This book has got to be absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read. Riker is a womanizing creep who can't keep his pants on for one night, and this book proves it. There should ba a warning on the side - \\"Do not let innocent unsuspecting people read this trash!\\". This was the only Star Trek book that never made the NYT bestseller list in paperback, and it's obvious why. It's sad, really, that Peter David can write so many good books and then this one. It's a stain on his record."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of, if not the most pathetic Star Trek book in history!","review":"This book is the sappiest book I've ever read! It is horrible!

The only other bands that equal In Dark Purity's musicianship are Suffocation, Nile, Cryptopsy, and Morbid Angel. You won't find any three-chord songs here. The guitars on The Angel's Venom are awe-inspiring. Being a guitarist myself, I can really appreciate the talent these guys have.

After several checks, I found out that the cable was the problem, so I went out and bought a new one!Now I have the sound, so I started to tune it up and had the second surprise: Some of the strings do not give the correct sounds. For instance, when I tune the first string to E and then press on the first fret to get an F sound, I get something between F and F#! I don't know if it's the frets or the strings.

I pump around 3-4 oz. on average and I actually pumped 5 oz. last night! If I stop taking them I have noticed I pump quite a bit less. I have not noticed any side effects. I would definitely recommend this product to a first time Mom. I'm super excited that Amazon has them for much less than what we paid at the hospital! Also, if you have an FSA, they may cover the cost. Mine did :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try other things first...","review":"I hear wonderful reviews about this product, but it simply did not work for me. If you are having supply issues due to a medical problem this will likely not work for you. I've tried it all, short of prescription drugs to get my supply up, which is my next step. I would suggest trying fenugreek (which is cheap- $7@Walmart), drinking lots of water, eating oatmeal, pumping after every feeding-and more, I also hear a (dark) beer a day can help, to try to get your supply up (also contacting a lactation consultant) before spending a lot of money on products like this or Gaia lactate support (similar product I've also tried-same results). I hope this was helpful.*in no way, shape, or form am I a medical professional/ licensed lactation consultant, this is simply my opinion and suggestions I have received from others during my attempt to get my milk supply up.

I took 2/3 of the dose for a few days in a row and thought I saw some improvement but then noticed my 5 month old was a bit gassy. I stopped (based on some of the reviews) and the gas went away. Started taking them again and it did not start up so this wasn't the cause. I still cannot tell if this makes a true difference in my milk supply or not but it doesn't seem to hurt.

You want to make sure the device keeps working before it becomes obsolete. Your first hardware purchase should be for a good case. Your second purchase (preferably simultaneous with the case) should be Writeright.

Your PDA will do the same for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced plastic","review":"I used a coupon to purchase this and only paid $3.00; I still feel like I got ripped off.

Find something better, or do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for what it does, but with big time limitations","review":"These are great for one purpose only: protecting your screen for scratches. Yes, this is what they are intended for. However, the limitations on the visibility of the screen are extremely serious. The screen looks like a completely different device with and without these writerights. I didn't like the idea of cutting them to fit the graffitti area since I have gotten scratches from dragging things in the viewing area.The biggest drawback of this product is the price. The recommend changing the screen protector once a month but they charge in excess of $30 for a package of 12. What a rip off! For a basically a clear and textured sticker, you're paying a couple of dollars a piece. Seems way overpriced! Especially if you change them at the recommended times. Unfortunately, there are no competitors that I've seen. I'd probably give this 4 stars if the price was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writeright Wrong For Me","review":"I bought a Handspring Prism earlier in the week and decided that I would skip the extra 25.00 for 12 sheets of plastic. Then I reconsidered and went back today and bought them against my initial judgement. My honest reaction-YUCK! Why can't they make them clear so that they don't interfere with the display. I am not worried about glare. I had a basic Visor before the Prism and it was hard enough to see the screen as it is. Why can't the background on these be standard PDA's be WHITE not GREEN.

I haven't experienced this problem but I also replace mine regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for color","review":"I thought I'd try this out on my Prism, since the screen *so very easily* picks up fingerprints, scratches, and other marks.

I would love to get something like that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could see the screen","review":"I figured I'de buy these to protect the screen after a friend recommended them. I recieved them yesterday and applied them as instructed. The display is so hard to read now, it ruins any anti-glare/protection value. If you don't mind holding your visor to your nose to read it, then by all means, buy these, but if the idea of a translucent matte finished pad obscuring your handsprings screen sounds unappealing, save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, they protect - but you can't see anything","review":"Alright - I'm afraid of scratches on my expensive Palm III, but I'm willing to brave the risk of scratches, rather than use Writerights.I purchased a package for my Palm IIIxe, and I put it on. I figured the cloudy view was just the way the Palm was, as I put on the Writerights directly after I took my Palm out of the box. I went to the store and I compared my screen's visibility to the naked display model's screen, and I was appalled at how much easier a naked screen was to read than my \\"protected\\" one! The package says they reduce glare and increase visibility - Hah, right. I think these are an awful product, but I still have to admit that they do what they're made for - protect the screen. And a tip to those of you out there - don't buy these. If you're really worried about scratches, something to tide you over is to put invisibile scotch tape over the graffiti area. You can cover the entire screen, if you don't mind the lines. Have fun. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this unless you're extremely careless","review":"I bought this item and stopped using it because it reduces the clarity of the screen image. It also seems to make the screen less sensitive for writing. As for protection, I've used my Palm for 3 months without using the protectors and have not scratched the surface. I don't believe you can scratch the surface with the stylus unless you're extremely careless.I do keep the plastic cover on the unit, and I have bought the case made out of wetsuit material. Any scratches are likely to come from something other than the stylus, in my opinion, so the cover and a case are important items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writeright wrong for me","review":"I bought a Handspring Prism earlier in the week and decided that I would skip the extra 25.00 for 12 sheets of plastic.

I used it on my first PDA because I didn't know any better. The protector distorts the image on the screen and makes images appear less bright and clear. I'm reminded I have a screen protector on my screen every time I have to look at my PDA; as opposed my other screen protector made by Palm, which I don't notice unless I'm looking for it.Also, this screen protector comes in one small precut size, which suits some people just fine.

So when you finally get the film onto your device it now has a lovely freaking air bubble surrounding the spec of dust.I received a screenshield for free with my casemate holder for my iphone and it worked great. It was a softer film and not as crystal clear but that thing resists oil, did not suffer from static electricity which is what these WRITERIGHT pieces of crap do.I used WRITERIGHT on my wife's nano (got 2 bubbles that you can't squeegee out), on my canon digital rebelxsi (that hardly went on right), and my two Garmin 530hcx GPS handheld radios...I tell you the money I spent on my electronics I should have avoided these cheap things!Spend the extra money and get a better product!

I wanted to keep the screen pristine and all. I just returned them today. Here's why: 1. They reduced visibility greatly. When I took the first one off I was shocked by how much better the screen looked without it on. 2. No matter how I tried, I could not apply them without trapping bubbles, etc. 3. They produce a moire pattern on the screen. 4. They were a little too small. 5. Expensive. $2 a shot for a tiny little sheet of plastic. Enough said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I have used these in the past when a friend gave me a couple. Though I used them for a couple of months, I finally realized that the degradation in readability just wasn't worth it (IMHO). However, the graffiti writing area does eventually start to scratch without it - so I was reluctantly ordering some more for my trusty current PP, intending to cut a strip for the writing area only.I just tried the suggestion of a previous reviewer to use a piece of \\"scotch tape\\" over the graffiti area. It works great! Recognition is even better than it was with the Writerights, IMO.These are useful only if protecting your PP is higher on your list than using it effectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protect your Handspring or Palm","review":"Touch to get it stick on your Handspring. You would need a good pair of steady hands to do the job. But once you get it on, it'd turn your with your Handspring around.If you put it nice on your Handspring screen and also remove all the bubbles, it does reduce glare on your monochrome Handspring. Though it may not work very well with color model because you would need the color version for that. It also gives you a good resistance when you write and drags your stylus across the screen. I would call it paper-like writing (in Graffiti). It also make you feel safe because no mather what you use to write on the screen, finger, toothpick, chopsticks, fingernails, etc, your Handspring will be safe.I rated this to 4 out of 5, because its deficulty to apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for color","review":"This isn't good for color units.

My hair gets tangled/caught on the \\"stand\\", so it was ripping my hair out, whenever I could get my hair to stay wrapped around the iron. My hair curls better with a blow dryer and a round brush. GOING BACK ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorted out after 2 months of light use","review":"This curling iron worked well for my thick, fine textured, very long hair until it shorted out only TWO MONTHS after buying it. I used it maybe twice a week at most. Also, the dial for the temperature changed easily when I was using it because my hand was constantly bumping it. Last but not least, the cord tangled horribly.

No matter what I try I can not get this curler to leave me with a decent curl! I am convinced that it is the ceramic plate that prevents me from this effect.

The three stories presented here are a nice break from the main storyline. The first one, in which Yuji and Shana swithc places is my favorite of the three. It is also the one which has the most humor in it as the other two are done rather seriously. The second story is about Shanas appreciation of Wilhelmina and the third recounts the events immediately preceding the start of the first season.

Also, this book would serve anyone well who is interested in the general history or contributions of the Navajo nation to the US war effort. In my opinion, the code talkers as well as the Navajo nation exemplify the Corps' motto of \\"Semper Fidelis - Always Faithful\\" by not only serving as Marines in a critical operation during combat but, also supporting a nation and government that had previously alienated and uprooted them from their homes and livelihood. This book skillfully depicts the history, situation, training, and critical operations of the Navajo Code Talkers during the U.S. Marine Corps' Pacific campaign in World War 2.

For a wiggley four month old this won't do. She hates the tub as well. She screams and screams when I put her in it. She loves taking bathes in her original tub. This may be because it's her first bathtub or because in this one she slides everywhere and can't get comfy. When the other reviewiers say their babies slide over the middle bump, it's very true! This was a total waste of money since I can't use it. To goodwill it goes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good- one complaint","review":"For newborns- the tub is great using the mesh net. But they're not infants for long. I think I got about 4 months out of it.For infants (about 4 mos and up), it's pretty good for the most part. My complaint is this: my 7 mo old who is quite chunky keeps sliding down in it. Her [...] won't stay in the grooved part where they're supposed to keep it. She twists and turns and it gets slippery and she starts to slide down. Consequently, I have to keep one hand holding her crotch area to prevent her from slipping under the water. This doesn't make for easy washing w/ only one hand left to use. For that reason, I don't think it's the best.EDITED:I've owned this tub for 3 1/2 years. Used it with my first son and then with my daughter. It wasn't until about 4-5 mos after daughter's birth that I realized that I could sit my child straight up on the \\"toddler\\" side and then I don't have the slipping problem! Ugh. So much for my fancy college and graduate degrees!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tub, great price!","review":"This tub works very well for us.

My husband and I were so excited to finally use it when our baby's cord stump fell off. We didn't use the hammock part, we just put him in the infant seat in the tub so he would be warmer. He loves the bath and I feel secure using it. He fits in it perfectly and I don't worry about him slipping around in it. The tub has little places to put your soap and wash clothes. It also has a little plug on the side to drain the tub, although, honestly, I just flip the thing over and dump it out in the bathtub. We set it in our master bathroom bathtub and I sit in the empty space left over. I don't worry about splashes or filling it. I highly recommend this tub to all new moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst baby tub ever!","review":"I've had many styles of baby tubs, and several hard tubs similar to this one. This is the worst, and the main reason is the ledge is too short, one kick and he goes right over the top which makes him fall into the water. He's 5 weeks, and though I can see maybe this would work for an older baby, it does not work for a younger baby. It is also much deeper than our previous tubs, and when he goes over the ledge his head goes under the water. I end up only filling it half way. I also don't like the hard shell much for this age, as when he startles he hits his head and cries. We're changing over to a tub sling instead.

TFTE 9-10 was actually released in March of 1995.As for these CDs, the first is a snapshot of some of the bands of that time. The second is a retro CD of bands from Dallas that date in the mid 1980's. Notable on the first CD is the Nixons, a band that did make a splash in that time. Later on, their lead singer, Zac Malloy, would go on to have success in his own solo career.Notable on the second CD is the New Bohemians, a.k.a. Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians. Additionally, there's Three on a Hill, whose lead singer, Peter Schmitt, went on to a band named Funland. Oddly enough, I've heard a lot of TOA songs, and this one is probably the worst of them all.Overall, the CD is enjoyable if you like local stuff. Otherwise, you'd be turned off.Since this CD was in very limited release only in Dallas in 1995, copies are very hard to find these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine Bates","review":"I'm pretty sure this film isn't forin (foreign even).

I challenge anyone reading this review who doesn't work for MSR to get a replacement tube for this bag. Apparently it can't be done. So if any part of the fails you buying a whole new bag. That isn't reasonable in my opinion. Sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A sturdy hydration bladder...","review":"I hesitated in buying this because it is quite a bit more expensive than comparable bladders. However, the bladder is made of nylon fabric that seems to be EXTREMELY sturdy. I've filled it up several times now almost to 3/4 full and frozen it. The cap does freeze shut so I take it out about 10 minutes prior to filling it the rest of the way with water. Now I have cold water for at least 12 miles into a run. That's very nice.The drawbacks:The mouthpiece does take some getting used to as the flow is lower than other bags.The tubing at the bottom cannot be removed without water escaping from the bag (if this is what you're looking for, the Hydrapak reversible has this feature.I'm definitely going to switch to this bag since the material will withstand more abuse than plastic only bladders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough hydration bladder","review":"I ordered two of these and they both leaked under pressure (in a full pack) or when laid flat. I was very dissapointed in that.Updated 8/30/2012 Increased from two to four stars - After discovering they were leaking I threw them in a bin of junk. last month I ran across them again and called MSR. They paid shipping to have me return the bladders to them and they sent me out two new ones after looking them over. I never received an explanation as to why they leaked but the new ones didn't. They are good quality bladders. I now prefer CamelBak's Omega bladders but wouldn't hesitate to use these if I had to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for burning discs","review":"Glad to see that Memorex is stocking the dual layers in 50 packs finally.
