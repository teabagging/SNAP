This book is a hint of dogs ,frendship and a little caring for othersThis book is about a girl named India Opal. It was in the produce section when the manager was screaming, \\"Get that dog out of here!\\" Call the pound! At that moment Opal said, \\"Wait a minute!\\" Thats my dog and said I'll name you Winn-Dixie. From that day Opal took great care of the dog. She would tell Winn-Dixie anything even about her mother who left Opal when she was three. With Winn-Dixie along she makes friends in a flash, but these friends are very odd....In conclusion, this book was great and I think that anybody who would read it would think it was an exciting novel. I would especially reccomend this book to people who like adventures and love dogs cause this book is all about that"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book EVER","review":"I choose this rating because Kate DiCamillo made me feel like I was Opal with Winn-Dixie.

It's a real page-turner. The best thing about Winn-Dixie is when we read it. It's almost like we take the character's place. We think this becasue the author describes in detail how the characters look and feel. You will learn a lot about friendship and other things that are helpful. You'll learn that you have to let go of the things that left your life and hold on to the things you have. The one aspect we dislike is the fact that Opal doesn't have a mom, because it makes us feel dispirited and worried for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far one of the best read alouds for kids","review":"I am a second grade teacher.

There's a lot of focus on the theme of abandonment, and a lot of value placed on the emotion of sadness. Still, there's an optimistic spirit echoing in the background throughout the entire story. Kind of deep for a kid's novel, but that's probably why it's so loved.On a personal note, I loved The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane enough to read it twice, but I probably won't read Because of Winn Dixie again.

I enjoyed both the book and the movie, and I was happy that the movie's plot did not stray far from the book. However, there were some differences in how the characters are portayed in each. For example, in the movie the landlord plays a much more prominent role; he does not want to allow Opal to keep Winn-Dixie and forces her to post signs around Naomi. Also, in the book, the pound was never called to Opal's house to take Winn-Dixie from her. The pet owner, Otis, is portrayed as quiet and brooding in the movie, while in the book I interpreted his character as a more simple and shy man. While I enjoyed theh book more than the movie, I found the movie to be entertaining as well as it gave a better insight into the area and town where the story of Opal and Winn-Dixie takes place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Because of Winn Dixie","review":"It's the greatest book you'll ever read.

I mean hello, you can't make 12 friends in a day! You can't help everyone! I think this book was supposed to be read to a 4-6 year old by their mother or father. It was boring and a way to easy read!

When I saw the TV Ads for the new movie, I decided to check out the book at my local library, as I enjoy reading better than watching a movie. It was cleverly written, and quite humorous at times. The little girl is darling, and the dogs is wonderful! The other supporting characters were also good. All ages can enjoy this book. I highly recommend it. I was pleasently suprised at the plot, which was all about \\"Kindness to thy neighbor\\". It's a good example on how young ones can befriend the elderly, and enjoy a wholesome friendship. Winn-Dixie is much like my dog in the manner he acts when thunderstorms occur. But don't let me spoil it for you.

It is not a book based on someone's real life, but it certainly could be because it is practically just a normal person's everyday life. Because of Winn-Dixie is also a book that you just cannot put down. It is a very quick read and that shows that you really like the book and you want to what is going to happen next.

The songs do not tell the story, rather they stand as separate disparate elements. The choice of having an anonymous cast of animals serve as the chorus does not hold the listener's interest and Townshend's singing the role of Hogarth does not give you a true feel for the character. Johnny Lee Hooker as the Iron Man and Nina Simone as the wicked Space Dragon are the only stand out performances. A valiant effort, but the film better captures the essence, if not the plot, of the original book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sh** Man....","review":"....Okay, Spinal Tap joke made, I move on.

Townshend attempted to turn a popular children's story into a rock opera with results considerably less satisfying that \\"Tommy.\\" There are no good songs on this album and the guest appearances, including other members of The Who, amount to nothing. As a fan it pains me to say that while Townshend has done some great solo work, this ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Townshend's Travesty","review":"After listening to this album, I can only conclude that Pete Townshend bit off more than he can chew. To this day, Townshend is still obsessed with topping The Who's overrated \\"Tommy\\" and in this case, he fails miserably. There's not a decent track on this album and even the semi-Who remake of the Arthur Brown classic, \\"Fire\\" falls short.Ever since \\"Empty Glass,\\" the caliber of Townshend's work has diminished significantly. While \\"The Iron Man\\" certainly isn't the low point of Townshend's musical career, it can be argued that it is the first of many lackluster and disappointing solo projects. \\"The Iron Man\\" is rusty. Scrap it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh...","review":"This marks the point where Pete Townshend gets to old to write decent music. The Iron Man reminds me of the soundtrack to a to a beer comercial and is closer to Andrew Loyd Webber than Live at Leeds. I think Pete should record an album on an 8 track using nothing more than an acoustic guitar and one mic. And lets be honest, those who disagree with me are probably all nostalgic, middle aged men who've been blinded by Townshends past brilliance or Eddie Vedder.

I still have not received the hardware to correct the seat we have. I will never purchase a Britax product again and am looking for a good seat for my second child now. I understand Graco is highly rated for safety and comfort and is significantly less expensive. I recommend looking for alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"This booster seat was worth the money.

Worth the money knowing the ease & safety our son is in!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This seat is not safe for a toddler!!!!","review":"I bought this seat and was so excited. I used it for three months and then realized that my son 27 months can reach the crotch adjuster and losen his straps just by lifting up. I called Britax and complained they agreed that this was a FLAW in the seat but there was nothing that they would or could do for me. Basically to sew up the velcro and get over it. For 249.99 and the safety of my child I would and am not getting over it. This could happen with any toddler. I do not understand why this adjuster is so close at hand and so easy to use if it was a push down then he would never be able to do this. I returned the seat to BRU (they are great) and bought an different seat. note all other brands did not have the crotch adjuster close at hand. I am disgusted with how Britax handled this!!!

This should be a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Car Seat around","review":"The Marathon Racer is an incredible car seat. Large enough for comfort, a 5 point safety harness, and the ability to hold him until he is 65 pounds made this car seat worth the money.

This is definitely the Mercedes of car seats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britax - the best of the best!","review":"When it comes to car seats, I'd pay anything to know that my child is riding in the best seat. You can't go wrong with a Britax. This seat is HUGE, but I'm glad to know my son has lots of time to use it. He's almost 5 months old and will be switching to this seat very soon. (He's almost outgrown his Snugride infant carrier). This seat is expensive, however, you can find it much cheaper if you search on \\"froogle.\\" I bought mine (w/ shipping) for $199 and I have friends who bought theirs brand new even cheaper. Do some price shopping. If this is the car seat you want, don't let the price stop you. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this car seat!!!!!","review":"I bought this car seat for my son when he was 4 months old because he had outgrown his carrier. My son is fairly large for his size and I wanted a car sear that would last us a while. I had read reviews on this site, and had actually gone to the store to buy another seat but found out my son was too large for it. After looking at other seats for an hour I decided to go with the Marathon. It is a little large, but fits in my small SUV fine, and also fits in my husband's small car fine. I couldn't imagine having another seat. This one is so easy to use and install. We drive from Arizona to California A LOT!!! It is a 15 hour car trip that my son who is now almost two handles very well in this seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!","review":"My 2 year old boy is still in his Marathon Racer, so I have to buy another one for my new son once he is out of his infant seat. I wouldn't buy any other seat than this one. We live in AZ so it gets HOT here. This chair is not a sweaty one, compared to the others. Plus it is so durable. My 2yr old is extremely active and he is no match for this chair. He can't hurt it. It is very easy to install and remove with the latch system. I did a lot of research online for safety before choosing a car seat. This one is, by far, the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kitten loves this carrier!","review":"I recently bought this carrier because I will be traveling on a plane with my 8 month old kitten.

I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very strong","review":"I bought this item from Amazon to use for my Bichon Frise as a car travel case, While we frequently take him with us, we used the case only a few times to contain him in a safe area. Last evening we brought the Bichon to a small gathering and I put him in the carrier so that I could eat my dinner while he was safe as well as out of the reach of the group. Within 5 minutes I watched as my 7.5 pound dog walked freely among the gathering. He had ripped the screening in one area of the case and ripped out a three cornered piece, gaining his freedom. Fortunately this was a very safe place but I cannot imagine the havoc that could have happened should this have happened anywhere else. It is too late to return the product, all packaging is gone as is the shipping information. The problem has nothing to do with Amazon, I will continue my relationship with them! But I will not purchase anything else from the manufacturer and would advise everyone else to avoid a purchase of this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cats travel in luxury class!","review":"I take my cats to Spain for the summer. Two flights and a total of 18 hours in their travel bags. The size is airline acceptable. This is a comfortable, (so it appears to me!) padded carrier. The removable soft flooring keeps Anthony cozy. The mesh windows allow me to look in on him on the floor at my feet. I periodically unzip the top hatch a little to stick my reassuring hand in for a head pat. Both cats hold their needs until destination, then run for the cat box. Oh, yes, and I had custom designed travel jackets made for the boyz by a woman in Vancouver--harnasses with velcro closures, matching leads for that moment during security check when cat comes out of the bag and could bolt. Sherpa bag is great. Traveling with your cat--PRICELESS!!!

My normal size is an 8.5. My heel comes right to the edge on these. I probably should have ordered a 9. I have not worn them outside to see how they will work for lots of walking.

For my taste, this is one of his most successful creations. Stage design is quite simple but very effective. Costumes are colorful. Dessay is a wonderful Manon. Her rendition of the \`table aria' is maybe the most beautiful I have heard. Villazon sounds a bit strained in places (like his act III aria \`Ah! fuyez, douce image' - this was the last production he participated before his half year break) but in general his singing is beautiful, like the outstanding rendering of his act II aria \`En fermant les yeux'. They are both excellent actors. All the other singers are very good, with the exception of Sam Ramey whose vibrato is quite painful to my ears (but luckily his role is short).Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Massenet/Manon --- Liceu --- Dessay, Villazon","review":"This DVD was a great disappointment! I only rated it as \\"one star\\" because there was no lower option.The principals sang reasonably well, but the setting was terrible (background looked like a bull ring), camera work and staging were poor, and it was much too long ... requiring two discs because of the overly long \\"bonus\\".. There are better Manons available so dont waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"je suis encore toute étourdie","review":"Dessay is simply delightful in voice, acting, diction, and voice, voice, voice, voice. Villazon is definitely just as good. Even his diction is not bad, far better than Domingo any day. Alas, Ramey is worse than a disappointment. Production is bizarre - in an arena???? Sets are scanty but effective.Definitely recommend this Manon. Dessay and Villazon make this an excellent Manon."},{"rating":"1","title":"as if it were second rate Mascagni (imagine that)","review":"The production works against the score. That said, I like the production, but I prefer the score. Dessay is a very fine actress, but lacks the control and finesse in the voice-- less voice, more silver. And Villazon is just a disaster! To roar out Ah, fuyez.... is to make a mockery of great French music and great French singing. He belts as if he were a Mongolian shepherd. To have heard the style from Thill or even Villazon's Spanish compatriot, Aragall on the Myto recording.. would put Villazon to shame. I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed - not much substance at all","review":"This book was disappointing. The author would barely touch on a subject but not go into any real depth at all with it.I have the impression it was a series of articles that he had previously written and thrown together just for the sake of having a book.

From the immediacy of that sweeping hook, they take themselves into sounds that begin to start moving through the sky. Like an instrumental early 4AD record you always imagined in your head. Their ability to slow down and change time creates a space where you can wander with intensity. They let you look at that one thing for so long and with so much devotion you begin to start seeing the bigger picture just by the magnification of one sound, one idea, one deep focus. Landing want to see how close they can get to the sky -- they feel wind shake them -- sun blast them -- air refresh them.

Hoglund's description of the Finnish experience in America is thorough, covering topics such as work, setting up communities, setting up organizations, the Church's role in Finnish American life, romance, leisure, and obviously a favorite topic of the author's - Finnish literature and periodicals. He paints a fairly clear portrait of why Finns came to America, and how they assimilated themselves in spite of significant language barriers.

It doesn't look like a very \\"authentic\\" cinderella costume at all in person. The puffy things on the hips fall too low (I am 5'4) and the whole dress needs to be altered professionally to fit me approporiatly. The ONLY positive thing I have to say about this dress is that the underskirt is thick and provides a nice volume to the dress.

What I like most about \\"Preso\\" is that the record features more of a liquid-y sense of groove than previous Rush records. The tunes tend to be shorter but are all very listenable. In some ways, I think Neil Peart wrote some of his most engaging lyrics on \\"Anagram\\" - playing with the words in an anagram-like fashion while still making some points. This album doesn't feature the heaviest lead playing you've ever heard from Alex, but he plays some great parts. And Geddy is in fine shape vocally and provides some spot-on bass parts. I really like this record and think it's a good buy for anyone even a little interested in Rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transitional","review":"Presto is an album that marked a change in Rush's sound from the keyboard-rich releases (Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire) to a harder-edged sound that fans were yearning for. This album sort of meets half way; it has robust guitars, but still retains an early to mid-eighties feel. Rush went about this album in hybrid fashion, which appeals to the fans of their 80's stuff as well as fans of their 70's material. Besides SHOW DON'T TELL, many people like the title track as well as THE PASS. Neil's lyrics have never been better than on this album, but the music isn't even close to their best. Still, this was an important release that closed the 80's and transitioned them into a harder sound for the 90's and beyond. This album also features some great acoustic guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer album here!","review":"Although Counterparts is my favorite album, Presto has my favorite song, \\"Available Light\\". The rest of the album rocks as well, it's one of those albums I could listen to for months without getting tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great re-issue of one of Rush's best","review":"This album is another in a great line of releases from Rush. Great addition to my collection. I have listened to it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Rush's inevitable slide into mediocrity was evident from 1982 on. Unlike Hold Your Fire, ad Power Windows this album is not drawn out in synthesizers. Alex Lifeson's guitar is not buried deep in the mix like it had been for a while, but this album is not an improvement. Neil Peart's lyrics are repetitive, as well as Geddy Lee's vocals. Gone is the shrieking, and instead his voice is low (at least for his range) and it sounds generic. The songs on this album aren't that memorable, for pretty much, if you have heard one song you've heard the whole album. The musicianship of the band is still tight, and their skills are still virtuosic, especially on the complex time signature changes on \\"Chain Lightning\\" and \\"Superconductor,\\" but even that cannot save this album from blandness. Don't be fooled by the title; Presto is not a magical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"No other Rush album like it","review":"There isn't much I can add to what's already been said. This was my first Rush studio album, but I had expectations of what it would sound like, having been aware of the band for 10 years at that point. when I first listened to it, I was awestruck. It doesn't have the \\"in your face\\" sound of hard rock-- rather, it sounds like they're playing from very far away (this was also when Geddy's voice dropped, so..)Still, though, the production is so affecting, and the music more adventrous than any done before or since by the boys. With most Rush albums, you can sense a logical progression from album to album.But this transitional album stands alone among all rock albums as a masterpiece, and a backhand slap to anyone who thinks \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is all they ever did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush's Most Lyrically Powerful Album","review":"Rush's 13th studio album and its most powerful from a lyrical perspective. Drummer Neil Peart continues to showcase his flexibility as both an accomplished percussionist as well as a truly inspiring lyricist. From the anti-suicide message delivered in \\"The Pass\\" to the beautiful metaphor describing the nature of weather on \\"Chain Lightning\\", and the issue of environmental awareness on \\"Red Tide\\", Presto is simply another great album of the many in Rush's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Decline Starts Here","review":"\\" Hold Your Fire\\" culminated the 80's Rush, building on the innovations brought forth on \\" Power Windows\\". I anxiously awaited this; the start of a new decade, with a new label and a different producer from the last two records. What a dissappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"From time of order to recieving product, was as discribed. CD and case are flawless. sound is dead on. ALL GOOD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album","review":"Lots of wordplay in the lyrics, but that is what RUSH is all about. Not a bad moment here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"after dark and synthetic experiments from eigthies this phenomenal trio recorded a bit simplier,more polished but definitly Rock album.there are no noisy synths,the sound is crystal clear and Geddy's bass and voice are simply irresistible.all song are wonderfull - \\"Presto\\",\\"Anagram\\",\\"Red tide\\" and my favourite funky rocker \\"Hand over fist\\".these are the best songs that band wrote since \\"moving pictures\\"get \\"Presto\\" out now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return to Greatness","review":"Some would say that Rush hit their apex with \\"Moving Pictures.\\" Certainly their next two albums after that were good, but they were far from \\"Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Hemispheres.\\" The only problem was that music and Rush was still evolving, and some of the loyal Rush listeners did not take to kindly to this evolution. However, Rush showed that a band could change and still be great. From start to finish, this album is superb. Geddy's unique and outstanding vocals, Alex's incredible guitar playing and Mr. Peart's thundering drums. The lyrics reflect a more mature Peart and the CD closes with one of Rush's most beautiful and inspiring songs. A great album by one of the greatest bands ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, but sterile production","review":"\\"Presto\\" was released in late 1989 and marks a \\"rebirth\\" of sorts for Rush - a moving away from keyboards and a return to the \\"power trio\\" sound that made them popular.The songs on \\"Presto\\" are all superb. Every one of them. Stand-outs (for me anyway) are \\"Chain Lightning\\" and the sublime \\"Available Light\\" (featuring Geddy Lee's best vocal performance EVER).However, Rupert Hine's production takes the hard edge off the songs too much. The songs sound a little too \\"white, clean, and neat\\" for this listener. Too English, too polite; almost STERILE sounding. And that's really too bad; this is a great collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"My personal pick for best Rush album","review":"After the quartet of albums that featured heavy emphasis on synths during the 80's, Rush finally seemed to rediscover the balance of synths and guitar that they did on Moving Pictures. The synth work on here is very good, but they are simply a way to add atmosphere to the song, instead of being a main element. Alex's guitar finally starts to return here, which is a good thing. The lyrics are some of the best Peart has written, especially on songs like The Pass, which is about suicide, and my personal favorite, Anagram (For Mongo). This is also much more groove to the songs than in the past, mostly evident in the songs Scars and Superconductor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more things change.....","review":"Purists will not embrace this effort simply because it has more sophistication than previous works. If you don't like this album upon first listen, listen again and again until you know the tunes. This one is a sleeper. Recommended tracks for AOR AIrplay: Chain Lightning, The Pass, Superconductor, Show Don't Tell... No bad tracks, but War Paint could have been developed a little more or put towards the end of the album as is.. Presto ain't my favorite Rush, but I do Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Effort","review":"The musicianship on Presto is as good as any Rush album you will find. Not outstanding from start to finish, but it's worth the price just to get The Pass, Scars, and Presto. There is essential Rush material on Presto that should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't think so...","review":"Anyone who puts Presto among Rush's greatest albums is obviously not a Rush fan. This CD just plain stinks. Show don't tell is the only good song on the album. I can't believe that this is the same band that made Hemispheres, A Farewell to Kings, Signals, Permanent Waves, and 2112. Avoid this and Roll the Bones like the plague, they are pure garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not there Best by far.....","review":"Mediocre at best, I liked \\"Hold Your Fire\\" better than this CD.\\"Show and Tell\\" is boring and I really didnt care for this CD, nothing stuck out and grabbed me like there other CDs have..... There next effort \\"Counterparts\\" was much better. wouldnt recommend...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring, as someone else said, Presto is \\"slobbery\\". the only song that's cool is Show don't tell.

Highly recommended.even my late teen sons are getting into the goove"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly overlooked","review":"After the orchestral sound of the previous two albums, the band goes for a more stripped-down, organic sound. The keyboards are still there but take a less prominent role and the power trio sound begins its gradual return to center stage. Alex Lifeson uses the acoustic more frequently and adopts a more assertive, riff-oriented style on the electric. Some of the songs aren't that great (\\"Superconductor\\", \\"War Paint\\", etc.) but they're outnumbered by quality material. \\"Show Don't Tell\\", \\"The Pass\\", \\"Hand Over Fist\\", and \\"Available Light\\" are outstanding; \\"Red Tide\\", \\"Presto\\", and \\"Anagram\\" are close behind. This transitional album may appeal to those who think Rush suffocated in synths during the 80s even though the music here is far mellower than the 70s albums. This overlooked album belongs in every Rush fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"There just isn't music made like this anymore","review":"There is so much texture and complexity on this Rush album, it's hard to find a place to start. In my opinion, the band has given up since this album. Not that post-Presto Rush albums are bad, they just do not have the masterful song writing and lyrics that Presto has. There are 3 stand-out tracks, \\"The Pass\\" is one of the best Rush songs of all time. \\"Available light\\" is the sleeper on the album, a pure gem buried as the as the track on the album (ala \\"Between the Wheels\\") and \\"Hand Over Fist\\" a powerful, well crafted song. I didn't even mention Show don't tell, which has one of the most amazing bass lines of any Rush song. A true classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered version is not essential","review":"**Note that this refers to the 2004 remaster of Presto, and not the original 1989 album.Presto is one of my favorite Rush albums and easily gets a five-star rating from me. And while the album's sound is quite tinny and flat, no amount of remastering is going to fix that.The sound quality on the remastered CD is better and clearer, I guess, but not much. Soon after I bought this, in fact, I mixed up the original CD and the remaster and could not tell which was which (the CD itself, artwork and packaging are exactly the same as in the original, with no mention of the remastering). I had to figure out the remaster from the original just by listening to the sound quality, and it was not easy to tell the two apart.I think I was eventually successful, but the fact that I couldn't really tell which version was which speaks volumes about how essential this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush Out Of Their Low Point.","review":"Presto isn't their best but it's an improvement over their electronic era. Which isn't bad but it's my least favorite Rush era. Presto takes Rush back to their guitar based sound, it's still lighter and more adult contemporary though. They omitted most of the synthesizer and there's a less mainstream sound. Presto is one of the most underrated albums ever. Don't get all the hate about it. Just because it isn't hard rock doesn't make it bad, the band just matured a lot considering their first album was from '74. There are some great songs like \\"Show Don't Tell\\", \\"The Pass\\", \\"Presto\\", \\"Superconductor\\" and my personal favorite \\"Chain Lightning\\". Presto is a sign of things to come which would be achieved later on Roll The Bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Central Theme","review":"I notice a central theme running through this thread. I, like other post, did not like this album when I first bought it (yes, I bought the album when it came out. I now have the cd).However, I downloaded my Rush music to my iPhone and decided to listen to all of it and noticed Presto was missing. Before I listened to it I read Presto reviews and couldn't believe the overwhelming excitement over this compilation, that is until I gave it a listen.I don't know what I was thinking when Presto first came out but I LOVE this cd! The thing is, I must have listened to it an awful lot because I remember all the songs. The whole is grand. Available Light is my favorite tune on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy! No Difference from 1984 Recording!","review":"I just wasted $9 on the so-called remastered version download of Presto. I love Presto and am a very picky musician, so I know what I am talking about.The remasters of the oldest of the catalog are definitely worth it. For example, I purchased 2112, Exit Stage Left, Hemispheres, Hold Your Fire and Signals and Vapor Trails. All were worthy of repurchase. The two \\"Presto\\" cuts that are on the 2009 Retrospective CD sound great and are what this \\"re-Issue\\" should sound like! Presto reissue is not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY GOOD FOR MANY BANDS, BAD FOR RUSH","review":"Let's face it, anyone who is a Rush fan realizes that this is their weakest cd ever. The overall sound is too polite and the band has obviously soured on it as well, considering that on their last tour, they did not play a single song off this cd. Granted \\"Scars\\" is a very good song and there are other songs that could have been really good had the sound not been so weak. The bass is very soft-sounding and the guitar is way too sparkly at times. I'm giving this cd 1 star only because Rush is capable of so much more, as they have proven since with \\"Roll The Bones\\"(3 stars), \\"Counterparts\\"(5 stars) and even \\"Test For Echo\\"(2 stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!

Wilcox obviously has talent, and is a fine craftsman. Unfortunately, he loses aim and in doing so, shoots his own foot. This is one of those unfortunate books that is almost great, but... not. In his defense, Wilcox covers the major elements of Tyndale's life and often explores the heart of the translator which he does skillfully. And this alone kept me from returning the book out of pure annoyance. But however lucid and accurate Wilcox was, he spoiled it by continually comparing the life of William Tyndale with Joseph Smith. However important I thought this book might have or could have been, Wilcox deflated it with these forced and ill-fitting comparisons. I don't respond well to stealth evangelism, and neither does the book. Joseph Smith? For the Mormon audience I'm sure Wilcox will get that delicious applause, a lot of warm head nods, and the occasional Amen. Just give me the history I paid for.

On one hand, the colors are different from those in the pictured item: the cover is not gray but whitish (destined to become very dirty soon) and the trim isn't white but blue (in my case, it doesn't match anything). On the other hand, perhaps pretending to be \\"universal\\", it is too large: the width is 19 inches, too much for a 17-inch lcd; the sides are slanted, from 5 to 10 inches (I could fit 2 lcd's there!). The material is nice, though a bit too synthetic; I'd prefer a fabric that could breathe. All in all, unsatisfied.

This week I read \\"Holly Bloom's Garden\\" to ten second and third grade classes with the gratifying results that keep volunteers energized. The students enjoyed the delightful story as Holly created a garden of beautiful paper flowers.They enthused over the brilliant illustrations and told me that Holly's facial expressions and body positions, as when she struggles with the heavy watering can, made the story more interesting. The teachers were pleased with the rapt attention and the stream of comments and questions about the book.

Sure this movie starts out with a few funny scenes, but it just gets more and more depressing as it goes along. Mental illness, and familial abuse,is just not amusing for a two hour movie. And for cat lovers don't watch this video ! there is a cat rape scene and the cat is realy suffering in this scene, it doesn't look faked. The cat is panting and terrified. But, the boy in the film is very sensative and overly intelligent for his mentally ill family.

One by one we see the children losing touch with reality as their only coping mechanism.For the duration of the movie, we are hoping that our hero Leolo will beat the odds.This movie is best seen by professionals in the fields of psychiatry and psychology and too strong for sensitive people who are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie","review":"This film, about a boy in French-Canada growing up in a family with twisted chromosomes, is stunning. The writing is beautiful, and the cinematography is both original and extraordinary. The movie's use of the soundtrack is both inventive and emotionally effective. I usually get offended by the use of emotional cue music, but in this case I'm feeling too much to notice. I have watched this movie at least 30 times, and I am still catching elements that I missed.

But this collection makes it seem that French women cannot sing the blues! The strongest tracks here come from (American) Abbey Lincoln and Nina Simone; the others are the sort of wispy, breathy fluff that I imagine French parents listened to in the 1960s the way mine listened to Mantovani and Doris Day.

Also, I had just watched Body Heat, starring Kathleen Turner, for maybe the 10th time, Turner's signature film. Unfortunately the content is weak, lacks drama, conclusion is telegraphed miles in advance and Turner tries to hard to be the tough \\"ballsy\\" cop with a heart of gold. Compared to her best work, this one is a limp noodle and not worth the feminist attention it has received. If you're looking for a good female cop movie, try Silence of the Lambs or Black Widow.

This movie purports to be a feminist movie and constantly manifests that men are vastly inferior to women. Yet the movie includes gratuitous closeup after closeup of Turner's legs. They wouldn't have made this film if Turner had to wear pants. This movie suggests that men are led by their libido and consider women to be sex objects, yet the film itself treats Turner as nothing more than a sex object."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing product","review":"Couvre really helped hide severe propecia issue.

Couvre is great to cover up the skin that shows through the hair and is water proof so I can use my hair gels,grease, and oils. So what I do is pull the hair away from the bald spot and cover the bare skin with couvre. Then I use my hair products and brush/comb to style the hair. Then I go ahead and use my toppik hair fibers to make it natural. And after that I spray over it with hairspray to keep in place. I have very thin edges and have not been able to wear my hair straight back in a ponytail in years. Now I am confident and bald spots are gone.

This is a well-fitted leather case for the Sony Cybershot DSC-R1. It fits as well as any leather camera case I've had over the years. The camera's odd shape (compared with the traditional 35mm SLR shape) makes this one a tad harder to close up than the 35mm cases, but not too bad.I like having the protection for my new camera, as I've been carrying it around with me almost everywhere.The manual for the case (!) reccommends that the LCD panel be turned face down. This probably protects it against being scratched by the inside of the case, if it gets dusty, but I use the LCD for waist level shooting, so this is slightly inconvenient. Overall, a required accessory IMHO!Guy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It is a pain in the neck to use! Many times it would turn my camera's switch ON when placing the camera back into the carrying case. Takes a lot of time and patience to take the camera out and to put it back into the leather carrying case. The strap is uncomfortable on the neck, too narrow. I wound up buying a regular soft sided Tamrac camera case that also provides room for the filter lenses, extra memory and lens cleaning stuff. Junked the Leather Carrying case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case, but...","review":"Excellent quality and fit. I like the tripod socket screw that securely holds the case to the camera. Reminds me of the design of the old 35mm SLR cases. What I don't care for is the two wing flaps under the lense that makes putting the case over the camera a bit cumbersome. Often, I would accidently turn the camera on or worse yet, switch the autofocus setting to manual. It seems like that was the only way the designers could get the case over such a long lense. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistaken identity","review":"I saw the stage play of Shockheaded Peter and its really terrific, with amazing staging and fantastic puppets.

Hunting With The Moon has some clear messages.How much longer can we tolerate the shooting of prime adult male lions for sport?For every male lion shot,effectively between 5 and 14 lions actually die.I personally think this is terrible,and I am glad people such as Dereck and Beverly Joubert make it their business to do something about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent photograpy and exciting descriptions","review":"This book is a companion piece to the National Geographic Wild documentary entitled \\"Eternal Enemies-Lions and Hyenas\\". The televised documentary touched upon the interactions between a clan of hyenas and a pride of lions.This book goes into much greater detail and with the vivid photographs and descriptions, it's almost like you are there!Of special interest is a slight smaller male lion named Entwadumela who is magnificent as you shall soon see. The book describes in detail his extreme hatred for the hyenas. His name, given to him by Dereck and Beverly Joubert, means \\"He who greets with fire\\".I recommend this book without reservation.

I went into it ...backwards, I liked Greyboy's later stuff, so I figured I'd check out this band. I was disappointed. This is really groovy and the musicians aren't bad, but it's like one of those Jam band things. I don't mind jam bands, but their sound is too loosely wrought for me.

But if you are buying this for Greyboy, don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more!","review":"This is by far one of my all time favorite albums. I bought it several months ago and I enjoy it still more each time I listen to it. Certainly it grows on you. Every track on the cd is captivating. It's so funky you cannot keep still while the improvisational exhibition stimulates your mind.Live was the first Greyboy Allstars album I bought. Their live performance captured here shines. I bought A Town Called Earth afterwards and was a tad disappointed to hear their studio makes of the outstanding \\"Happy Friends\\" and \\"Tenor Man\\". They pale in comparison to the live counterparts that boasts an enormous energy, especially the rich solos of Karl Denson. The Allstars is a talented bunch indeed.Living in Denmark, I may sadly never experience Greyboy Allstars live. I guess this brilliant album somewhat makes up for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"Wasn't quite sure what to expect from this one.

This was recorded in their earlier days of touring(1999) and the group has evolved alot since then (What Happened to TV? is a whole new feel). This is also not an entire set list, just some select (often cover) tunes. The tight ryhthm section and Karl Denson's smashing horn lines are amazing. Being a sax player myself, this music appeals more to the jazz/fusion musicians out there, not your ordinary listener. The solos don't get old as they trade nicely between Elgin Park on guitar, Robert Walter on keys, and Denson on alto/tenor/flute. The CD is high energy the whole way. The only way to truly experience GBA is to see them live. They are keeping the funk/soul/groove sound alive. Go see them at Jazzfest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ti Lung vs Chen Kuan Ti","review":"This film costars my favorite martial art actor Chen Kuan Ti in this film he plays the role of a villian, Ti Lung plays a martial arts master who is addicted to opuim and along the way it begins to effect his fighting skills. Theres a scene in the film where Chen fights Ti using double short spears that is a classic, the reason I don't give this film 5 stars is because there are not a lot of fighting in this movie.

Unfortunately, the Gunpowder Plot did nothing but hurt their cause. Still, they were very brave men who died horribly for their God. As a Shakespeare buff, it is intriguing to know how many of the plotters came from Shakespeare's home area, Warwickshire and Oxfordshire, and how he must have known some or even most of them. The Plot, together with Shakespeare's desire to flatter James I, helped inspire Macbeth. (Macbeth can be read, in part, as Shakespeare's attempt to distance himself from the plotters). Several of Shakespeare's relatives died for their Catcholic faith. This book provides insight into the Roman Catholic community of the day, the treacherous political skills of the Cecils, and the mixture of pigheadedness and glory that seems to constitute human bravery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good hair dryer","review":"We have had three of these in our family over the years and about to buy another one thru Amazon.

These were images I had taken weeks ago.My second disk has one of my best photos now showing a gray bar half way on it. And when I shoot a picture, the image will not transfer to my Mac.

Not only did it satisfy viewers with plots from the book and original movie, it gave us a killer cliff-hanger.When season two debuted I was somewhat dissapointed. The premier wasn't that great of an episode, and I heard ratings were low. But by the time the first 6-7 episodes had aired, I knew this season was going to be the best. Some of the episodes hit you hard, like \\"Playing God\\", where no matter what Johnny does, he must choose the life of one of two friends. There is no winner. The \\"Sexy Summer Seven\\", including the originally deleted episode, \\"The Hunt\\", were also some of my favorites. The season finale of season two not only surpassed season one's, it set up the plot for season three. You can't deny Johnny is going to be different next season.If Lion's Gate gives the same effort into this set as they did with season one's, it is a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far","review":"I am a Dead Zone fan and by far this DVD collection of the second season is the best.

I followed another users suggestion to glue glass vials in place. They just pop into glued rubber grommets on frame. That was moot.

I have two other smaller Marchioro cages also and they are great. They are made in Italy and the quality is very good, especially the plastic they use for the pans. The quality is way better than anything else I've seen or used. It's heavier and has a slick texture that makes cleaning easy. The colors are nice too, neutral gray pan with dark green wire. I also ordered two Marchioro corner litter pans that are great! The color matches the cage pan and the again, the plastic is very superior to others so it cleans up nicely. My only complaint is that due to the fact that the cage is so long, it's not quite as sturdy as the smaller ones. More vertical bars in the design would have helped. All in all, for the price it's a great cage. I don't think you could do better. My bunny is very happy in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is my marchioro cage?","review":"I would love to review this product that I ordered on Nov 27, but as of today Dec 30 I have not received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no instructions!","review":"We bought this cage because of it's size.

They also lasted several months without ever going stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to my expectations","review":"I got this as a christmas present, and was sorely disappointed. Avid music listener as I am, I immediately plugged my iPod in to the iMode. I was disappointed to find that the sound quality lacked depth and fullness. In fact, I have an aged set of speakers from Altec Lansing (which I bought for maybe $10 at a garage sale) and their sound quality is exponentially better than the iMode's. And when I play my music loudly, the iMode makes a rattling noise, because apparently one of the buttons is a bit loose. Oh, and I set the alarm this morning, and I have no idea what happened, but it didn't go off. If you're looking for an alarm clock for your ipod with good sound quality, look elsewhere. My friend has the iPlace (I think), and it sounds much better than mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"My daughter was given an iMODE docking station for Christmas and it is already broken.

Believe, me, I was excited when I pulled this out of the box. Alas, that excitement was short lived. The FM reception was terrible. Some stations I can easily receive on other radios in the house would not come in. Other stations bled over a wide frequency range. So I docked my iPod. That was fine until I started playing music. Very poor sound quality. It had a tinny sound, lacked any serious bass. Not worth near the money it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking!","review":"Really...Keep looking. You don't want this...not even as an alarm clock. It's terribly hard to set the time or the alarm and the sound quality is horrendous! Spend a few extra bucks and get something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissatisfied","review":"Was very excited to have an inexpensive docking station for my iPod, but it is very poor quality. I can forgive the mediocre speaker quality, afterall it is a clock radio, but the alarms are so hard to set!!! The radio reception is awful. I can't even get the strongest FM station in town to come in clearly. The worst part is the blue background display. To sleep, I have to turn the display toward the wall to keep a blue glow from projecting accross the room. Heaven help if I actually want to see what time it is in the middle of the night. It takes a while for my eyes to adjust to the display in the dark, and usually looking at the thing in the dark wakes me up more consistently than the alarms do! It stays unplugged more than not, and I usually have to get out the owners manual again because the time is hard to set.

With a gender ratio all out of wack, Califia's Daughters -- the women of what was once California -- struggle to farm the land, feed and protect their communities, and above all protect the fragilest flowers of them all, the males of the species who have trouble surviving to reproductive adulthood.Leigh Richards is a pseudonym the author's note tells us for Laurie R. King, author of several award winning mysteries. It's no mystery why the writing and plotting here are smooth, engaging, and a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing world - hope for a sequel!","review":"Laurie King writes wonderful mysteries, so I shouldn't be surprised that she can write an excellent SF book -- though there's a much bigger challenge to the world building in SF. I found her post-apocalyptic world richly imagined and believable. She drops enough clues that it was easy to envision, without falling into any \\"As you know, Bob, ...\\" blobs of explanation. The character of Dian is vivid and interesting, and the people around her feel real and complex in their own right. I found it suspenseful -- I lost sleep!I desperately want to read more books in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice read","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I really enjoyed it. Not a particularly deep read, and less about sexual stereotypes than you might think. It's a densely plotted adventure story, about a woman who pushes herself to physical, emotional, and moral extremes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissapointed","review":"It started out well with a good premise and interesting characters, then switched gears halfway through focusing on just one character. The plot wandered and died as though the author ran out of inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of service - not book content","review":"The paperback version( a new, not used book) of Califia's Daughters was unreadable. The type on every left hand page was so light as to be impossible to read with any kind of flow. Add to this, it took 3 weeks to arrive - I was not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fall of civilization novel","review":"I picked this one up by chance, because I liked the cover. I was pleasantly surprised! The book was well paced, and held my interest throughout. There were some sketchy details that I wished she had filled in better--how the fall came about, more detail on the badlands, etc., as well as little more depth on a few of the characters--but overall, very satisfying. The last page was a bit confusing, but that just may have been poor editing.She left the end wide open for a sequel, and I can hardly wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for a sequel","review":"Others have given the salient details for the plot line and expressed their opinions pro and con so I'll just say that I really liked the story and the author's way with words, well enough that I look forward to a sequel. The ending leads me to believe that one may have been planned and I hope it's not too long in coming. I'm anxious to see what Queen Bess and Captain Breaker do about Dian's escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crushed","review":"I should have known better than to buy a first book written under a pseudonym when they tell you that it is written under pseudonym in the author bio. Although the book had its moments, it was mostly flat and unimaginative. The premise seemed to offer so much, but I was let down. Actually, I had a hard time finishing it, which is rare for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"This book reads as though two different people wrote it - the first having more skill and discipline than the second. For 180 pages the author adequately sets up her post apocolyptic world, fleshes out the main character, and presents the dynamic situation that the main character is responsible to resolve. Then the meandering begins. At this point I felt as though I was riding with someone who had lost track of her destination. The all-important secret that motivates the main character's dangerous journey is unimaginative and disappointing. And the end of the story is so superficial and disjointed that it feels as though the author's deadline was moved up and she had to rush to finish.I felt as though this was an author's first attempt and that some professional guidance and much more time would have resulted in a story that actually has something to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"egads","review":"JUNK..!!!

And most of the girls have average to small sized boobs. The only t*****s I enjoyed were the one bar girl with gigantic ones. The girls here are supposed to have gigantic monsterous breasts. But they don't. But the biggest flaw is there are only like 2 girls in the whole movie that show their vaginas. What is the deal with that? Only two girls take down their panties. And they don't even get in explicit positions. They don't even spread their legs and show us the good stuff! I mean one of them touches herself but it is just OK, she doesn't get dirty enough. The other GGW films are much better. The vagina is the essence of a female, you have to show her privates. Buy this if you want some inoccent topless fun but if you want to see real hot girls get nude (meaning vagina exposed) get one of the other releases by GGW."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Doggy dropped something on the lawn","review":"Well, leave it to Snoop to ruin the successful and fun GGW formula by walking through this like an imbecile and actually making a GGW tape that is boring. Looking more clueless and dumb than hip and bad, Snoop hogs waaay too much of this and when he does, he can at best mumble \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" a few too many times while he stands around draggin' on a cigar.

What do you get for your extra $20? All the deleted scenes from Anchorman put into a coherent new movie. But these aren't scenes that were deleted for timing, these were deleted because they NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY THE PUBLIC. Wake Up has, maybe, two funny scenes. It's not worth $2 more, let alone $20. Buy Anchorman without Wake Up and be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will finally made an un-funny movie","review":"I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell. The man can walk into a room, saying nothing but wearing a wig, and I laugh. And yet this movie is not funny. One or two smirks, but not a single laugh. Elf was hilarious. Loved him in Zoolander. But this was lame.I'm not sure what the problem is -- maybe its the fact that instead of being totally ridiculous, they're trying to sneak some kind of moral or something into the story, but it just doesn't work. And I think the lewdness gets to be a hindrance of just about every buildup to a joke.Oh wait, there is the scene where he eats the cat poop. I liked that part. And the jazz flute. Ok, the club scenes were alright. And Jack Black punting the dog. Loved that. But that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all","review":"What a piece of crap. I have loved Will in the past, but this movie just isn't funny. The only saving grace is that Christina Applegate is gorgeous and has to carry the movie.

Who in the hell greenlighted this lame thing? Probably a coked-up producer.The title name is not funny, the idea is not funny, Will Ferrell is NOT funny, not pretty to look at (white, fat, flabby, hairy, eyes too close together!)and the movie is nothing more than one very long sexual harrassment joke from the 70's. Having worked in that era and constantly being groped and dirty joked by co-workers who were stuntedly developed as horny 14 year olds, why would I want to relive that? I tried to watch it on HBO, but after 10 minutes, there was nothing new to see. This is just one more reason Hollywood box office receipts are taking a huge hit this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad but jab at Bush at end lowers it a star","review":"This is a pretty funny movie that succeeds because it seems to fly in the face of political correctness. I thought \\"wow, he must be getting feminists really angry with this film\\" and it was nice to think of Ferrell as being free from the Hollywood requirement to think alike. Then he throws in a useless and cliched jab at President Bush at the end (I am no fan of Bush) and I lost all respect for him. It was like he did not have the guts to fully carry out this assault on political correctness and let his fans down in the end in order to kowtow to the very people he mocks the whole movie.

The debate is still with us today, whether Jesus is Jehovah, for there is almost no topic of greater import than the deity of Jesus Christ. The written witness to this question is the Holy Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments. If we simply let the Bible speak for itself, then we can hear the answer, and it is to this best testimony that Humber turns, over and over again pointing the reader to the proof.

In fact, the only song I've heard by them is the now infamous MMM MMM song. But the local record store was playing this cd the other day over the speakers and my attention was caught. I felt myself kind of dancing around to the groovy (literally) tunes. This cd has some really great songs, but it does seem like CTD tries to mimic some really good artists like Madonna and Annie Lennox. Yet, even though the cd is similar to other artists, it is really original in the \\"feel.\\" No other cd of this type of music has spoken to me in quite the way this one does. Don't just go out and buy this cd though. Do yourself a favor and listen to it first. You'll either really love it or hate it. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it is over!","review":"I have been a serious CTD fan for many years travelling out of state to catch their shows. Over the years this band evolved their unique and exciting sound through 3 great albums. Yet, with this new release the Dummies chose to completely change into another dreary techno band. Each song on the disc drones on to the next sleeper. Where the band's previous lyrics were full of wit these lyrics are just childish. The slow repetitive drum beats in every song are a waste of musical talent and creativity. This is by far the most boring CD I have ever heard and I really wanted to like it! It is not just a worthless CD from the Dummies but a worthless CD in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst one","review":"i was really disoponted about this one hope they come out with some thing better next time you guys are not the red hot chillie peppers you are much better than that maybe next time this will be one album ill be glad not to buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one if you are on a budget","review":"This CD came with a warning label to the effect that this is not your usual CTD recording. What an understatement! Unlike A Worm's Life, which I came to like after a second listening, this recording contains only a few tracks that I can listen to in their entirety. If you like street-language rap, graceless sexual references, songs which rely on a heavy beat to mask their lack of musicality and message, and are prepared for CTD lyrics to deliver a numbing lack of profundity, this CD is you.P.S. I am sure the band had fun recording this one; it's just not much fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid achievement","review":"This is bright record in my collection, one of the kind that longer you look at, more you like it. I would suppose artists had possibility to do what they want on this one. Therefore, if you have respect for what real CTD are, you cannot dislike it. Certainly it is very different from their radio-hit, as it is more contemporary and more complicated. But this one is RECORD. Actually, we have been dancing to it with great pleasure, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Tequila in the morning...","review":"What can I say...for those of us who worshipped at Brad Roberts feet after \\"God shuffled...\\" are ready to throw up on his feet after \\"Give yourself a Hand\\".

For shame, CTD, you should have stayed with your original, slick style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Departure","review":"When I first bought this CD (Without hearing anything from it, I might add), I really didn't take to it much. I had just gotten \\"A Worm's Life\\" the week before, and liked it quite a bit. After a couple listenings, I began catching onto the satirical wit and heavy beats on this CD, though, and now it's in heavy rotation in my car. I like all kinds of music, and that probably had a part in my being able to tolerate the Dummies' new style. If all you like is guitar / folk rock, then don't get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip, happenin', satircal...and quite entertaining.","review":"To know the story behind Brad Robert's brief stay in a friend's apartment in Harlem is to know what really lies behind the melodies of this great CD. While the lyrics are not for the lighthearted, Robert's use of satire and his newly found falsetto are quite intriguing. Yes, it is different than the Dummies' previous releases...but who wants the cookie cutter approach to music? This music gets played and played again, with joy and a smile on my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can you not LOVE this excellent recording?","review":"My only question is why did the CTDs wait until now to unleash this side of them? \\"Give Yourself A Hand\\" is an excellent, whip-smart record, with some funk in the truck, too.I'm enjoying reading all the negative reviews from dated old folkies who only like the band's first couple of records. Folks (pardon the pun), wake the hell up! It's 1999 - this obviously didn't go unnoticed by Brad Roberts, and my hat is off to him for expressing himself in this new and very appealing way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your hand to throw this out the window.","review":"That's exactly what I did after trying diligently to find something I liked about this CD. I found one track mildly interesting but it wasn't worth the price of listening to the rest of the garbage. My only regret is that I didn't order through Amazon and listen to some of the tracks first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Round of Applause.","review":"I'm a Crash Test Dummies fan with an open mind. I don't know who their fans are, but listening to each of their four cds it's apparent that the band changes with each disc. I like that. Why stagnate? I think Give Yourself A Hand is the best thing since God Shuffled His Feet. A Worm's Life (1996) was dull and uninspired musically. Give Yourself A Hand puts the Dummies back on track. Clever, original, humorous, and mercifully short. All these ingredients make this one of the best cds of 1999. True, upon repeated listenings the album begins to wear thin, but the cd is still a notch above A Worm's Life. This, and 1993's God Shuffled His Feet are must haves for any rock collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"A good band gone bad.

And \\"I want to Par-Tay\\", thats sound like something BECK would do. Crash Test Dummies isnt Beck.

I thought the earlier stuff was trivial pop-schlock, but this apparent experiment does justice to its soul/funk/trip-hop influences with its interesting and fun arrangements. Most bands get bland and gooey as they get popular and age, but in my opinion CTD is to be congratulated on growing as musicians and taking a risk even though they must have known they'd alienate some of their older fans. But perhaps they'll gain a few new fans by doing so. Regardless, I'm sure they had a blast creating this CD and I'm having a blast listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, yeah, okay...","review":"I'm wondering what hideously tragic accident Brad Roberts was in, as his voice has shifted up about 100 octaves. Although I love Elen Reid's additions to this album (perhaps she should embark on a solo project!), I'm afraid it was just a bit too different for my tastes. Not the CTD I've come to love over the years. Though it may grow on me in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake","review":"This CD was the worst pile of cacophony that I've experienced in a long time.

Do not waste your $13. If you are a fan of CTD you will be sorely disappointed with this effort. It is dumbed down techno pop, I guess trying to get mass appeal. My only hope is that my CD will biodegrade fast in whatever landfill it deservedly ended up at. I'd hate for future archeologists to find it and think this was the best our era had to offer in music. I repeat, do not waste your money on this album it is crap!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Drop in the Electronica Bucket","review":"I hope the Dummies aren't out of ideas. I hope this is an experiment. Do they not know that their strength lies in lush instrumentation and Brad R.'s amazing voice? Crash Test Dummies, you are not the Chili Peppers, nor are you the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Anyone can appreciate an artist trying new things, but this fails on too many levels. If you loved \\"Ghosts\\" and \\"God\\", you'll find but 1 or 2 songs listenable on this album. Please, Dummies, if you want dabble in trip-hop and still make memorable, indisposable music like you have in the past, at least throw on a Morcheeba CD before you try this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened? These guys used to be good!!","review":"These guys were my favorite band until they released their last album, which was still okay. Now, however it doesn't even sound like Brad is singing anymore. The only good song that the woman sings is on the Dumb and Dumber soundtrack. I am so happy that I did not buy this CD. This is one of those cd's that you buy and then wish you could return. I have supported this band from the beginning, which spans over eight years. I can't support music that isn't in anyway enlightening or worth listening to at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad to See a Love Affair End","review":"I've loved CTD for their lyrics wrapped around a memorable tune.

But sometimes a band will try too hard to be different, to be something that they are not. That's the case with our Canadian friends latest release, Give Yourself a Hand. Sorry, boys (and Ellen), but the urban, semi-rap, psuedo soul rubbish misses the mark badly. With God Shuffled His Feet and A Worm's Life the Dummies had earned the highest compliment I can give a band -- purchasing a new release before even hearing one note of music. No longer -- credibility has been lost for good. I have one suggestion, Brad Roberts and company, give yourself a kick instead of a hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"If you liked the last two Crash Test Dummies offerings, it's very likely you'll hate this one. What were they thinking?

I've been a fan since the God Shuffled His Feet days, The Ghosts That Haunt Me was awesome, and I loved A Worm's Life, as the Dummies took their trademark sound in a more lyrically whimsical direction. After having read others' reviews of this \\"departure,\\" I have little to add other to their well-placed criticism except for my two cents: this album is boring. I might even go so far as to call it worthless. The tunes are slower, far less intruiging, and all around a much lower quality than i have come to expect from a great band. I went out and bought it the week it was released, even after I heard \\"Keep a Lid on THings\\" on the radio (to the ridicule of my friends, to whom I snidely replied, 'I'm a loyal fan, and I know the Dummies won't let me down...'), but I'm sorry to say, the Dummies have let me down with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Err...","review":"Looks like the Crash Test Dummies got lost in god's shuffle. With the exception of Keep a Lid on Things, the first nine songs are totally repetitive and forgettable. It's only on the second half of the album that the songs begin to make musical sense. Fittingly, these are also the songs that are reminiscent of earlier Dummies songs such as Aching To Sneeze and I Love Your Goo. Overall, kind of disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened on the way to the studio?","review":"i will make this short and to the point. i have been a CTD fan for years now and can honestly say that this is a terrible work that they have released. every element that makes the Dummies a great band who write great pop songs were completely ignored. if you are a new fan, then buy their first disc so you can properly judge the CTD's real talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This One","review":"This album, when compared to their previous albums, is a complete let down.

Chief Dummy Brad Roberts, known for his unusually resonant baritone voice, has discovered a strangely affecting falsetto to go with it. By playing one register off against the other he produces an intriguing Yin and Yang effect between verse and chorus on several songs, especially the powerful rap-funk rumble A Cigarette is All You Get and the moody, trip hop groove of Just Shoot Me, Baby. Keyboard player Ellen Reid takes the lead vocals on three songs. With a clear, frosty tone somewhere between Beth Gibbons and Beth Orton, she lends a further dimension of mystery and melancholy, most tellingly on Just Chillin'. Wonderfully produced by Greg Wells, this is an album of rare wit and vitality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped the ball big-time...","review":"Man, what were CTD thinking when they recorded this? After the relative failure of their last album, AWL, they must've had a knee jerk reaction to their music. Big mistake. AWL was brilliant but under-marketed -- that's the label's fault. People won't buy an album in droves if they don't hear it on the radio. GYAH is just flat-out bad and doesn't deserve to make it on radio. Their first three albums were brilliant, varied works.

Behr gives enough information on supporting characters, but not enough to confuse the reader. An overall great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Numbing","review":"I must start off by saying that when I first read this book I had very little knowledge of Hirohito or his involvement in WWII. However, after reading Behind the Myth, as well as learning a bit more, I now feel safe saying that the book is quite good, if not a little flawed. In all fairness the author was doing what was unheard of at the time the book was written, and that call just dead emperor of Japan a criminal of war. He made some rather broad generalizations and assumptions, but he managed to plant the seed of doubt in my mind. Granted, if you want to convince someone that Hirohito was guilty of starting the war, or that he should have even been tried, this book won't provide you with that information, however it is a good start. He won't convince you, but he will numb your mind and make it ready to accept the possibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Opinion that Skirts the Facts","review":"Writing my term paper on Hirohito, I decided I wanted to have as many sources as possible to insure the validity of my work. Reading several books, I came to realise that although the supposed all-powerful leader of Japan, the military got out of Hirohito's power. A pacifist himself, he did not wish such war for Japan. Edward Behr would have us believe he was a conniving war-lord, hidden all this time by his 'image-makers'. There is one thing I'd like to see: what Behr, or any of us would have done in the same situation. A good book should give us a non-biased description of what happened, and help us to see what the situation was really like for those involved. It's frankly a waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talking Heads talk about Cartoons","review":"What a complete letdown.

It's format is basically a countdown of the top 40 scorers for Arsenal in the modern era (read: since games were televised or recorded regularly). They generally show about half a dozen goals from guys towards the bottom of the list with more for guys who rank higher.From a fan's perspective, it is a great education for a recent fan since you'll see great and historic goals from guys like Charlie George and Liam Brady but also a whole host of others like McClintock, Sunderland, Ball, Radford, etc... Also, the best thing about the video is that it's almost 3 hours long!!!! Many nights I just skip to some random point in the video and fall asleep to it... eventually.The quality of the footage is widely varied but not due to the production.

This book is inspiring, uplifting, spiritual, humorous, realistic, and adventurous.

This story is told in intimate day-to-day detail; a diary of people and events, terrors and joys experienced and survived by an Army nurse in Desert Storm. The charm of this book is that you feel very close to its author because she writes in the hurried emotional and sensitive language of a woman as she experienced her events. And Loretta shows her sense of humor (wisdom, too). I am still pondering how a wounded soldier could have chopped a hole in his buttocks by sitting on a bandanna. And the Iraqi (Muslim) soldier who received his \\"Last Rites\\" from an Army Chaplain (I doubt that Allah was confused by this). And then we have her fears regarding the contraband Iraqi sand!

Loretta is a very descriptive writer and her narrative draws you in, making you feel as if you were there with her amongst all her experiences.

Testament is not a band to rest on its laurels rather, they seek to grow and experiment with great success on each continuing album. This CD is no exception. The tracks, \\"Malpractice\\" & \\"Seven Days Of May\\" are 2 of the standouts. Both posess rythmic complexities alongside brutal, straightforward crunching riffs. And the background vocals are superb! Sheesh!! Testament shows its more subtle side with the track \\"The Legacy\\", which really showcases Chuck Billy's incredible vocals, as well as the rest of the band's stellar musicianship.

I mean, nobody REALLY wants to see the serious side of what goes on behind bars --- it's mostly dull and uninteresting, right? So when I rented this video, I expected the fun stuff --- the mean, bitchy guards and their cold, dykey warden, preying on their pretty little helpless female prisoners. This should include at least two or three shower scenes, and at least one nocturnal visit between barely clad cellmates! But this movie had NONE OF THIS!

The bad news is that there is surprisingly little airborne footage in this, and nothing much happens for several chapters. The good news is that the serial wakes up later on, with plenty of action and well-staged stunt work by David Sharpe. And for those who enjoy the peculiar lapses of logic found only in Columbia serials, there are a few uninentional laughs (two pilots bail out of an airplane and shut the door BEHIND them). This video will appeal most to fans of Kirk Alyn and to kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLACKHAWK","review":"Loved the old comic book hero, hated the serial. It was like two hours in a dentist chair having a root canal. I approached this dub with high expectations. They were dashed.

Kidnapped and held captive by Geirwolf Valkraad, Peggy is forced to face the harsh reality that she can never escape him. She might be more distraught if she didn't desire him so much.Jaid Black is very good a creating highly sexual worlds that just cross over the line of taboo. While forced seduction plays a huge role in Besieged, there is also a very strong element of romance in it as well. While it's true that Peggy is forced into her circumstances and she experiences a few frightening moments, there is a very happily ever after in Besieged. Wolf wears his heart on his sleeve when it comes to Peggy and Peggy fights him every step of the way. Besieged should be an unimaginable nightmare, but with Jaid Black's twist, it becomes a hot fantasy instead.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be ur cup of tea if..... but for me it was too disturbing to finish...","review":"Look i like to keep an open mind on things especially erotic novels and I have enjoyed Ms. Black's work in the past but this was a bit too disturbing for meNow IF you like forced sex or forced sexual situations and IF you enjoy forced humiliation -- then this might be a book for you.I like to go with the flow and see how things play out generally in a book. This book was good at first keeping the reader on their toes with the suspense and I kept reading through some of the forced sexual situations myself feeling increasingly uncomfortable however it got to the point that I felt too uncomfortable and just couldn't relate enough to the female lead to continue going. I recognize the fact that I really don't like degradation of females and in this story it just kept sinking worse and worse into more awful and horrifically degrading scenes.

In all other respects it's a fine, professional effort that shows the band in good form - the playing and singing are first-rate. The songwriting is strong, though stylistically it reflects a lot more of Barry Tashian's post-Remains country career.If you know the band's earlier work, this is a must-have. If you don't, you'll think this is a pretty fair band. The only thing wrong with Movin' On is that it's not the great album that should have been recorded in 1966 and released on Capitol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everything boils down to seratonin","review":"Dr. Pawlak adds basic info on brain structure and hormones, exercise, blah blah blah. It probably is very helpful for a slice of the population, but just like ANY program, it is not the answer for all, despite what she says. I found her writing to be very critical and arrogant. She completely dismisses other bodies of data, insisting her way is the only way, and yet doesn't even mention issues such as food allergies or their impact on weight. She also over-complicates the topic of weight, making it more psychological, about addiction - as though the brain and seratonin levels are completely at fault. I would only recommend this if I thought someone needed to read about the relationship between eating and seratonin, or if they maybe needed kindling and ran out of twigs and newspaper. Also, I agree with one of the other reviewers, she has everything double-spaced and stretched out with \\"extra paragraphs\\" so it easily takes up four times as much space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memories","review":"I saw this cast in Los Angeles.

I'm not sure if they are from a different part of the country (I know the author is from California, I live in Pennsylvania) or if we just have a poorly stocked grocery store (Price Chopper, which isn't in the book) It might be nice to see a review of how well some of these products work, particularly the cleaning ones, in a future edition.

Everything you buy supports the practices of whatever company you purchase from, be them good or bad. Human and animal suffering, wastefulness, and deceitfulness can be eliminated if we all chip in the extra pennies to buy products from honest and innovative companies. The ultimate lesson I took from this book: the smaller (and more local) the company, the more likely they are to be supportive of charities, and the less likely they are to be involved in things such as child labor, animal testing, and wastefulness. Favorite companies like Kraft, Coca Cola, Wal-Mart, and Microsoft are huge corporate villains, only looking out for themselves, and just because they say something might be organic or whatnot, that doesn't mean that it is labor or cruelty free.

The games biggest shortcoming is that the developers have no concept of real world car handling. The game has an assortment of front wheel, all wheel, and rear wheel drive cars. All of the rear wheel drive cars behave as if you were driving around with your right foot on the floor in the rain. I realize that probably very few young programmers in Europe have ever driven a rear wheel drive sports car, but come on. In this game, they ALL oversteer wildly with the slightest steering input at any speed. From the base models to exotic Lemans Prototype class cars. Even the '66 Shelby Cobra, known to have very nice neutral handling, is a disgrace. Some of the cars and racing are fun briefly, like everyone racing in identical Alfa's or Mini Coopers, but the fun fades away quickly. Maybe a future version will be worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The game is not what I expected and I just return it to Ebgames. Sorry I would love to by a race game.

I think F1 from EA is what best get close on physics and damage engine for a race game. But lacks of creativity.

The author makes an attempt of foreshadowing but doesn't do much with it. I am still confused why the Japanese and American babies were mentioned as much as they were and in the end the author did virtually nothing with them. He attempted to introduce romance in the novel but the romantic references were appropriate for even a 2nd grader to read...not much passion there!

Hell Below / Stars Above opens with a deadly riff-heavy \\"Plane Crash,\\" boldly announcing that \\"we know what you really want.\\" They deliver ten-fold, thanks to the tight production of Rothrock and Schnapf and the devilishly catchy rock. Tour-tested hits include \\"Push the Hand,\\" \\"Heel\\" & \\"Sweetness,\\" each of them maintaining their live appeal. Tracks like \\"Pressed Against the Sky\\" and \\"Dollskin\\" are powerful enough to become the next cult hits, much like \\"Tyler\\" & \\"Away\\" did from Rubberneck.

I saw them in concert in the late 1990's and they were awesome. Years went by with no other news about the Toadies, and for a moment I thought they had broken up. Then I bought this album and was very disapointed. Maybe my expectations were high, but I was hoping to be floored with more original sounds and songs, and instead felt like I bought a run-on sentance of a song. I found nothing original nor did anything stand out to me. Their music is still good as well as their voices, but I felt the album was overall weak. Maybe the next one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Contrived","review":"I have really tried to like this album, but unlike Rubberneck, it seems forced, insincere, and even exploitive. The songs are semi-passable for the now ubiquitous alternative radio fodder, but they are punctuated by long stretches of overdone bombast married to sensationalized drivel.

Ghost mist -- looked like a bad 1950s matte job, complete w/ pixelated edges. (And since when do suction cups work on wallpaper?)I love these kinds of movies.

In my experience 2 hour cable or DTV movies that SyFy has a hand in - well suck. There is an occasional surprise - even a very unusual gem.Acting was stiff, artificial, contrived and apparently used to fill out the 2 hours. The dialog was poorly constructed and delivery was worse.Why oh why, do an ever increasing number of movies (also on the rise tv shows) shoot 50-80% in the dark - even when views out the semi-frosted windows show daylight? My take - lower production costs and much easier to conceal bargain priced fx and background/site costs.This had me reading the newspaper, editing photos and doing research on unrelated topics on the internet - all before the 1st commercial break."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only ok","review":"I order this to fit a 3.5\\" drive in a 5.25\\" slot, it worked as stated but the screw holes were a bit off in size and I had to force them in.

I can make my mocha in about 7 or 8 minutes, although it's a giveaway when the smell wafts down the hall and people notice it.

We took it on a 10-day trip to Florida to be able to make our coffee in the morning (I am Italian).

I use Bustelo coffee, up to now no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful inexpensive espresso","review":"If you are looking for a morning espresso without breaking the bank, I discovered this way while living in the UK, a place (at least outside of London) devoid of morning coffee bars. I looked around for a simple way to get a morning jolt, and found Delonghi electric coffee makers. It's an easy way to do a single cup of great coffee. My routine is to heat about two shots of milk in a microwave for 30 seconds, put two TB of ground coffee into the Delonghi and go put some toast on while waiting. If it's too bitter, add a spoon of sugar. But this is way easier than making a pot of coffee that goes to waste. A great design, foolproof and elegant. Produces great output. What more can you ask for? Lately I had to spend an extended period living away from home, so bought this second unit for the other place. There is nothing to really wear out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Excellent coffee maker - the best feature is the half-pot divider in the coffee ground reservoir in case you want to make less than a full pot.

It was a design flaw that I worried about from the beginning but decided to give it a chance nonetheless. I was a little better off in that mine made it a year and two weeks before doing so. Of course, the warranty is good for a year...The product doesn't get one star because I did like the ability to make coffee in my office without a burner. I also liked the ability to remove the coffee maker from the power base and leave the cord behind. My recommendation, though, is to wait until a company with better engineering skills offers a product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Moka Espresso Maker","review":"I just received this product and have been using for the last week.

So, if you want it for the short term, ok... just don't have any long term expectations.It does the job well, the coffee is hot and tasty, it is easy to clean but the looks can be improved.

I've been using it for about a month and can report that the coffee is very, very good and the unit is easy to clean. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't shut itself off when the coffee is ready. I HATE overcooked coffee (which is one reason I like espresso so much - it never gets close to the heating element) and I bought this hoping I wouldn't have to stand around to turn it off, like I do with my stove-top espresso maker. But it doesn't shut itself off, so I do have to stick around. A very nice surprise is that, so long as the unit is in place on the base, you can set the button to \\"on\\" and it stays set, even if unplugged.

The only problem I have had is that I did lose (or more like my mother when she was helping cleaning it) the extra piece to make the half a pot. No biggie...I'm not a half a pot type of gal. I do enjoy the electric part since I can just hit the switch and walk off to do other things around the house.

I respect the authors efforts and respect the ordeals he went through to create this piece of work, but do not trust it.

The author pretends to know something about native languages but, in fact, knows very little. I supplied him with certain words from the Mohican language but he misquotes me in every case. Chapter 15 on the Mohicans comes close to being an insult to that tribe and the rest of the book manages to dehumanize Algonquians in general. The book's endnotes are virtually useless and provide the reader with no sources for the outlandish statements the author makes. The publisher of this work should be ashamed of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linguistic Information is Wrong","review":"I can't personally speak to the historical accuracy of this book, but the purportedly Lenape and Mohican words in this book are not.

Some supposedly Lenape words bear no resemblance to the Lenape language at all, and I suspect that they are actually corruptions of southern Algonquian words (i.e. Indian tribes in Virginia and South Carolina).You won't learn anything correct about the original languages of New York from this book, in other words.

Nothing will grab you like \\"Sussudio\\", one of the lesser songs from \\"No Jacket Required\\". \\"Hang In Long Enough\\" is the only track with an edge, but it's undercut by a melody that sounds scotch-taped together.Of the \\"socially conscious\\" lyrics, only \\"Another Day In Paradise\\" has anything original to say.

I particularly like 'that's just the way it is', very nice harmony vocals by Crosby, and 'colours' has a beautiful opening section and a memorable next part, one of the best songs of his career, that is really long, but doesn't feel like that.'Another day in paradise' is a fantastic, meaningful song with touching lyrics and a good harmony vocal again from Crosby. 'Father and son' is a touching ballad, one of the best songs he has done.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovable CD - But Seriously!","review":"But Seriously, Another Day in Paradise was the only track I heard on the televion show and watched the video of Phil there.

Something happened on the way to heaven is a good number with a tempo beat and I wish it would rain has a lively luv song notes sung by phil, soft and cheery. Colors bring in a different mood n is a classic song. Find a way to my heart has clear voice of Phil though I feel its a bit slow. A good pick for a change, a retro pick - Another day in Paradise!

Just turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to the fact that this movie was mega-crap!!! People are just saying this movie is good because TI is in it. Thats not a good enough reason!! Sorry, the plot, premise and acting was horrific. The dialogue downright ridiculous. You would have to have a billion dead braincells to enjoy this film!!! TI needs to stick to rappin'.

When I first read all of the positive reviews I thought maybe this was a movie worth watching. But, I was sorely disappointed when I did get a chance to watch the DVD. What really was the purpose of making this movie? And I don't think that anybody is jealous or player hating on T.I., they're just being honest about this crappy movie. Goodness, I had to skip through to the end, it was so boring and just...I can't even think of words to describe it. And what was so cute about Evan Ross saying that he had gotten some cuttie? Is that supposed to inspire other young black boys to do the same cute thing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"You'll get a lot of good belly laughs from this coming-of-age movie set in ATL.

First, the directing was awful. Scenes are cut short before they get a chance to even develop. Second, whoever wrote the script seem like they never graduated from junior high school. The characters all have one line dialogues with each other. Where is the creativity in that? What little the characters say, you can just about predict what the sentence (if any) may be. I totally disagree with anyone who gives this movie a rating above 1 star.The only reason I didn't give this movie a fat zero is because I could bop my head to the music. The soundtrack is the best thing about this movie, which is all the reason why the director should stick to filming videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT IS ABOUT","review":"The movie ATL is not a movie about T.I.'s life. This movie is about a young man (Rashad), that grows up in a Atlanta neighborhood trying to do the right thing. Growing up in Atlanta I can relate to the movie because on Sunday nights we went to the skating rink like other cities yes we have the hood but damn we do have other positive things to do than get in trouble with the rest of the crowd and that is what he and his friend are trying to avoid. This movie was not supposed to be another gangsta movie like Boyz N The Hood or Juice. And as far as the comment on T.I. being in his 20's, yes he is but other actors/actresses play younger parts than their actual age. I hope this review will help someone out. I think that T.I. did a good job by this being his first role in a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This is one great movie that no one can miss!

Rock Hudson was the sexiest man on screen to a whole generation,but Rock could act. Ellen isn't an actress, she is a comedian. While Pullman's character initially comes off as suave and sophisticated before degenerating into complete idiocy, Ellen does little more than smile at him as if she were a 12 year old girl out with daddy. The scene where they tear their clothes off to have sex seems completely out of place. It is silly but not really funny. Here her goofy smile just doesn't work. Pullman does a good job with this very shallow role, but he can't make the script work or Ellen seem desirable and sexy enough to be worth the obsession he develops for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen at her best!","review":"This movie is so funny.

So why is she making a movie about liking a guy(the super actor Bill Pullman)that goes psycho. I knew she dated Anne Hench who I guess went psycho on her in real life. Hench also did a movie where she liked a guy. Please, I'm not very smart so make movies that I can understand. If you like girls so be it, in fact I'm totally cool with it, but don't pretend to fall for the great Bull Pillman if you don't like guys anyway.

My daughter didn't want me to send it back for a new one because she didn't want to wait so we just used black tape to put the ear back on but I have to redo the tape every two or three times she wears it. I would not purchase this brand ever again. I usually buy Kidorable brand rain coats and boots and get a few years out of them. I purchased the WC one because of the pattern and ordered my son a Kidorable one. They both arrived within a few days of each other and this WC dalmation coat is so much flimsier feeling that the Kidorable one. Despite the fact that it is flimsier it was actually more expensive than the other one. No bargain here.

His books share with JG BALLARD a fascination for post-apocalyptic settings but are also psychological character studies about how people change to fit their environments. This book is perhaps Christopher at his starkest and most frightening. A man simply tries to take his family safely out of London to his brother's farm in the North after a genetically engineered bio-weapon gets out of control and wipes out the world's food supply, causing anarchy and chaos to erupt all over the globe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic digital watch","review":"I needed a replacement digital watch that needed to be water resistant.

Without trying he makes a case for the necessity of hunting, not to eat but to have one's spirit filled.Much of the story takes place in the land of my own journeying, and I followed the story on my topographical maps. After reading I felt a tremendous urge to go there, to see the land Lundrigan writes about. I didn't. The journey outlined is not one of the physical, but of the spirit, impossible to recreate, but totally able to be experienced within one's soul on a brisk fall day.This is absolutely the best book I have read on the spirit of the hunt. I recommend it to absolutley anyone who has experienced the thrill of flushing a covey and not known how to explain it; Lundrigan explains it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The autobiography of an excellent grouse hunter","review":"Straight from the heart. Ted Lundrigan's \\"Hunting the Sun\\" is a passionate autobiography of his grouse hunting days. Chapter by chapter, Ted talks you through one of his many hunting trips. The man is clearly an authority on grouse but also on life.

That \\"deathseat\\" thing goes back to when no one wore seat belts and so if you were in the middle of the backseat and got in a car accident, you would be likely to go through the windshield. That doesn't apply to the carseat issue, and hopefully people are wearing their seatbelts back there now. Anyhow, as i said--good carseat."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy - - - - - - NOT SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This seat looks nice and my 20 month old son is comfortable in it. However, last week as we were driving he reached down between his legs, lifted up the lever and lossened the shoulder straps. He is not a genius - any 20 month old child can do the same. I can't believe that BRITAX has not recalled this car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"not have yet","review":"I have intentions of purchasinfg this seat ina week or two so I cannot give an accurate review.I just wanted to reiterate what the other reviews said....THE MIDDLE IS THE SAFEST PLACE FOR THE CARSEAT.

The seat does'nt even move one milimeter. Excellent head and side support and the adjustment belt is super easy to use. I love the fact that when the seat will be forward facing, that my child will be able to stay in the same seat up to 65lbs. I bought my seat at Traveling Tikes whom is offering the Britax Marathon with shipping for a very low price. GREAT SEAT! GREAT PRICE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"We have had the Britax Marathon for three years now and it has been great! The only problem is that the cover has become worn and we have been searching for a new one (the reason I am on this site now). The versatility for securing the seat has been wonderful when transporting from one vehicle to another, regardless of type. It can be heavy and cumbersome when going through the airport, but I wouldn't trade it for my daughter's safety. I have been tremendously happy and if necessary, would buy another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"This seat is fabulous! The fabric is very soft and there is a lot of padding so it's a comfy seat. It sort of reminds me of a lazy-boy. I did have some difficulty understanding the manual. I tried to have my seat professionally installed, but had no luck so when I finally figured out how to install the seat, it was a cinch. Another note to mention, although I knew that the seat was quite large, I had not anticipated that it would block the bottom portion of my rear view mirror (which is really not a big deal) and my right blind spot. Every time I look over my right shoulder to change lanes, the seat surprises me and catches me off gaurd. Other than that, I have no complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of current French Music","review":"This CD is awesome!!! I listen to it almost every day.

What we've got here is Peter Gabriel meets Bruce Springsteen meets the Billy Joel you're embarrassed to admit you like.\\"Ghost Train\\" is great, as is \\"True Companion,\\" \\"Silver Thunderbird,\\" and all the rest. It's really an unobtrusive, reliable album that can't disappoint -- if you like anything you've heard off of it, if you like Peter Gabriel, if you like Greg Brown, if you like any man who knows his way around a guitar and a piano, you're pretty much okay.

Just on the tail end of unexpected news of the death of a friend the day before, the songs made me cry. Bad timing. But three weeks after, I bought the CD and listened to it through again. It brought back some good memories, and not only because I knew my friend would have liked it. It's insightful, well-crafted and has a lyrical, haunting quality much like short ballads that stick with you for a while. Worth discovering."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real favourite","review":"Decided to listen to this because of Silver Thunderbird and Walking in Memphis... and stumbled on a real masterpiece. The album is completely full of very good songs, some of immediate appeal and others take a little longer to get to know, some lighter and some very moving, poignant and beautiful (okay, there is one, 29 Ways, that I sometimes skip). It gets a lot of listening-to and even though it can happily be played as background it would be on my shortlist for best album.

I was on my second, six month deployment, but this time I was engaged to be married. One of my four roommates had the CD and played it one day. When \\"True Companion\\" started playing, I listened with interest to the words and began crying my eyes out. This, I knew, would be our first dance song. I played the song for my betrothed, and he, too, got all misty eyed and told me, \\"Sweetie, I think you've found our first dance song.\\" I hadn't even mentioned that to him, just offered to play a really cool song for him. The entire album is awesome, from track one to eleven. It is a must listen.

Words like \\"soulful\\" and \\"heartfelt\\" I'm sure would be used to describe Marc Cohn, but let's just keep it simple...The songs on this album are not complex. They are simply and precisly arranged, and they are beautiful in that simplicity.His lyrics are clever and meaningful. This album is definately his best work. Marc Cohn's voice fits his lyrics. Sit on a pier and watch the seagulls pick little fish from between the waves of long island sound. You'll hear Marc Cohn singing in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"God is NOT so unknowable","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. For the countless believers who long to know the invisible God this book offers little help. The invisible God that Yancey writes about is NO so 'unknowable'. For believers who long for intimacy with God and who like Moses yearn for more of His glory I recommend \\"Revival\\" by Lloyd-Jones, \\"Holiness\\" by J.C. Ryle, \\"The Glory of Christ\\" by John Owen, \\"Why Revival Tarries\\" by Ravenhill or anything by A.W. Tozer, Jonathan Edwards, or Richard Sibbes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystical","review":"I would like to use this forum to personally thank Yancey for another great and challenging book that left me asking more questions when I was done reading it than when I started. Bravo, Phillip! Christian authors continually bombard us with ways to live a better life, three easy steps, or prayers, and here is Phillip Yancey telling us that the stages of development in a life as a follower of Christ get more difficult as you mature to the point where God will leave you on your own to help your faith grow.I read this book during a time of immense personal trial. This book taught me to have ambidextrous faith, able to take the good with the bad, equally. I cannot say that I have mastered this concept, or if I ever will, but thanks again to the author for challenging me to do so.I look forward to the next book by Yancey, it is always a good and challenging read for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the recommendations posted to this site. I cannot believe the high ratings this book received. Its premises can be summarized in about two sentences. You may as well have faith in spite of pain, suffering and the injustices in the world because that beats not having faith. Secondly, as it becomes more and more difficult to justify your faith as you get older, that should be viewed in a positive, invigorating way. Give me a break. There is almost nothing here regarding an even elementary philosophical basis for the author's position. It's pretty much \\"This is how I deal with faith in a world filled with pain and suffering and an invisible God that appears not to respond to anyone's prayers.\\" Where is this author coming from? Look elsewhere for even a beginning scholarly discussion of these difficult issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I honestly felt like this book was boring and didnt do much more that talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. I was hoping for alot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title not appropriate","review":"I have not read the book, but I have a problem with the title. How many people on this planet think that God is visible? Perhaps 0.1%. Why go for such an obvious title?It's a bit like saying, 'Communicating with the Solid Earth'. 99.9% of people on this planet think that Earth is solid, therefore it is not necessary to add the word 'solid'. Sorry, but I, for one, am not tempted to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Committed Christians Who Are Struggling Should Read This Book","review":"If you sometimes feel like holding onto your faith seems impossible at times because the world just doesn't seem to show God's presence. If you feel that you are losing your hold on what you believe, this is a great book to read. It reaffirms your faith, not by chastisting you for your unbelief, but by showing you that you are not alone in your doubts. That other, even notable Christians, have struggled in the same way. I enjoyed the scholarly, yet emotional tone, and I feel it was well-written. The author took a problem-based approach, and by the end of the book, you realize that your issues with doubt are not the huge boulder on your back that you thought. Instead, you will realize that it is just an integral part of your walk as a Christian in this world. Highly recommended for the searching, new Christian, longtime Christian, and the struggling Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, Direct, and Encouraging","review":"This book is not for the timid! Yancy again writes a book which says what so many of us think. He writes about the doubts, the questions, and the soul searching which is part of any relationship. What is remarkable about this book is that while he addresses honestly the ups and downs of a relationship with God, it is written in such a way as to be encouraging and helpful. Like a friend who listens, supports and challenges without being judgemental, Yancy has illustrated a maturity lacking in most \\"Christians\\" who sell quick fixes and leave the daily realities of faith under wraps. If you are a Christian, this book will challenge the way you think about your faith, and be encouraging in the process. If you are not a Christian, this book will help illustrate what its all about in a way that is open, honest, and never \\"preachy\\". An excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book filled with insight","review":"Yancey continues to deliver with outstanding and insightful prose that both carefully asks the questions and then answers them. Of course the answers are merely thoughts from the human perspective, but the questions are universal and Yancey has a way of helping me (a dense headed but trying Christian) see the answers and God Himself in a a clearer light. I can't recommend this and other books by him enough. I am currently in the middle of my second time through this one, I consider his books a great bargin, they all get read more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemingly Perfect","review":"The authors have combined technical information along with interesting case studies to make this textbook seemingly perfect.

Remastered and compiled by Page himself, the sound quality is phenomenal. He was such a great producer in the first place that with modern remastering, the songs sound like they were recorded now. And the song selection and ordering is just right. A die hard Zep fan would want some more, but theres enough here to get all but one radio hit, and help broaden ones focus to some of the better album tracks.

From \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" to \\"Kashmir\\" to \\"Over the hills and Far Away\\" to \\"whole Lotta Love\\" to... you get the point. they have so many great songs it's hard to list them all.this box set shows how they took over the world and appealed to almost everyone in the country. my friends are hardcore rap fans(i don't know how, rap sucks), but they love Zeppelin. that shows how much appeal they have.

To call them a rock band, or a heavy metal band is to over-simplify things. They were true innovators!

Who better to play a smarmy anchorman than Will Ferrell, but sadly this movie was so badly scripted, dawdling over its many raunchy one-liners, like a 9-year proud of his first dirty joke. Outside of cutting a striking figure in a white jumpsuit, Christina Applegate failed to create the sexual tension this movie badly needed to keep it afloat. The jokes and gags may have looked good on paper but failed to materialize on the screen. Even the big fight between rival news gangs failed to deliver, despite bringing out Hollywood heavy-hitters like Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller. All in all, this movie was a sad disappointment. Will Ferrell can do much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only mildly amusing","review":"Will Ferrell stars as shallow, dense, and sexist San Diego anchorman Ron Burgundy with Applegate as his new female competition. Burgundy comes off like a genius compared to his moronic team of sportscaster, weatherman, and featured reporter. The movie comes off as more of a satire on late 1970s big hair newscasts than a laugh out loud comedy. Only Applegate really shines. Just a so-so movie in the 2 to 2.5 star range."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"this movie is lame at times annoying poor plot. the acting is usually poor. you may laugh yet more likely you will forget to as you're wondering why you wasted your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"like burns said, it had alot of potential","review":"I waited, finally saw it and it was not as good as it could have been.

And it also had Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate whom could've been ALOT better in this. And who else is sick of Ben Stiller?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anchorman for old anchor days","review":"Will Ferrell, a particularly humorous person in my opinion, has created the partially witty but mostly overt throwback to those old days of anchoring. When men were men, and they thought women were too. Now, that is not true. It is interesting however that, although portrayed in a comedic manner, gender segregation was a component of early broadcasting. History aside, Anchorman was creative, albeit not the wittiest piece of work in film. Enjoyable, maybe if only for the first viewing, this film still has some shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable comedy","review":"If you are looking for a good laugh, go see 'Anchorman'.

On an entertainment level, this film had the potential of being very funny. It was very spotty as far as laughs. However, the script comes off prety lame.

There is much to poke fun at about the seventies, but this movie didn't do it. It seems as though nobody associated with this movie was trying very hard.Somebody already mentioned the missed opportunity for a running gag about Ron reading whatever is on the teleprompter. The scene where Corningstone and Burgandy trade insults over the credits, while very good initially, ran much too long and would have been more effective as a running gag.At one point, there is a \\"rumble\\" between news teams of competing stations. Initially, it was fun, but dragged on way too long.There were perhaps half a dozen good scenes.

I smiled at some of the jokes, while the rest of the crowd at the theater HOWLED with laughter at every single joke, seemingly just to laugh. This is one of those stupid-humor movies like \\"Scary Movie\\", but not as extreme. And like \\"Scary Movie\\", \\"Anchorman\\" gets old fast, and therefore gets very boring.

Will Ferrell is deadpan as Ron Burgundy, a TV newscaster on top of the world with his news team (including Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and the Daily Show's Steve Carell), and soon finds himself at odds with a tenacious female newscaster (Christina Applegate) who is looking to make it big, even if it comes at Ron's expense. While some of the gags fall flat at times, the film for the most part is a joy, and the viewer is able to tell that the cast is having great fun which makes this even more enjoyable. Anchorman for the most part is a surprisingly funny mainstream flick that fans of Ferrell will no doubt enjoy, and cameo roles from Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller will have you grinning from ear to ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest of the Summer","review":"Anchorman is full of hilarious one-liners that will have you on the floor laughing. The combination of Steve Carell and Will Ferrell created non-stop laughter throughout the whole theater. It is by far the best movie of the summer and will surly remain that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea for a spoof, shallow script. Poor female lead.","review":"I wanted to like this film, I enjoy Will ferrell's work, but-----this film just doesn't cut it. Paul Rudd as the macho Geraldo like reporter is very good, (talking about how he was \\"in love\\") and Ron Burgendy says: \\"I don't think that's love.\\" etc..... so there are some good moments in the movie. Christina Applegate was a big drag on the film for me. She did not have the sexual chrisma that shows up on camera. She's pretty enough, but she does not have what it takes for the big screen. All in all, now worth any more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Good Laughs, But Was It Worth It?","review":"Overall, I didn't think the movie was very funny.

At the least, this movie is worth a rental if you haven't seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good sketch does not a good movie make.","review":"I had heard the negative reviews, but I went into this with an open mind and no expectations. I guess if I had to review it in one sentence it would be:I didn't laugh once.I'm not even all that sure why it wasn't funny. It had Will Ferrell, a potentially funny story, and lots of good supporting actors and cameos. And yet, not even a chuckle.*flush*What was that? Christina Applegate's \\"illustrious\\" career going down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Up Ron Burgandy","review":"It's kinda wierd to make a whole other movie from the outtakes of a bad film. It is even stranger that the movie made up of those outtakes is a better film than the original. Such is the case here. They should have released Wake Up Ron Burgandy as the theatrical version. Much funnier than Anchorman itself. Not that this is saying much however. Anybody else agree with me on this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"I watched Anchorman with my wife last night for the first time and we both thought the movie was one of the worst movies either of us had seen in years. It was simply not funny. We had both been looking forward to it a lot as we're both fans of his SNL stuff as well as the other movies of his we had seen (Elf, Roxbury, etc.). This movie was plain and simply stupid. It reminded me of my 4 year old who says \\"poop\\" and thinks its funny.Simply, and sadly, a terrible movie. This is easily in the bottom 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Will\\" not be buying it!!!","review":"I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a waste of money. I'm usually a big fan of Will Ferrell, but this movie was very weak for the most part. There were some funny parts, like when Ron Burgundy was talking to his dog (as another reviewer said) but that was about it. It's been a while since I saw this movie in the theatre, so I can't remember a lot of specifics. I do remember being annoyed and bored throughout a good portion of the movie. One part that just topped on the annoyance scale, were the appearances of Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson. It was like the cast of Old School reunited (another movie I was not thrilled with). These actors need to expand their horizons and try working with different people. If anyone is looking for a good Will Ferrell movie, go with A Night At the Roxbury."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comedy that could have been funny, but isn't.","review":"When i caught this on HBO the other day, i was thinking it was going to be halarious. That is, until i was about five minutes into it and was already annoyed. Its weird because this is a movie that has all the funny actors in it, and the jokes are so lame and stupid that it ends up being a big waste of talent for all of them. Unless you are into stupid movies like Bio-Dome..don't waste your time on this hideous comedy. You'll be thanking me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"a couple of laughs at best","review":"I know, we can have Jack Black with road-rage kick the poor sap's dog off a bridge, that would be hil-arious....not.

There is not one good thing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"At A Loss for Words","review":"Except for the word \\"stupid\\". This movie was mind-numbing stupid!! Several reviewers have commented on Ferrell's style of \\"humor\\", but they could have pulled some passing schmuck from his car to do this script, and that schmuck would have done better than Ferrell. There were maybe 4 scenes which pulled a passing chuckle, but the rest of the movie was a black hole. Now, Jim Carrey might have been able to rescue this film's sucky plot, but not Mr. Ferrell; the poor dude came off looking like an absolute moron. This DVD will be useful only for target practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Pauly Shore movies look like Oscar winners","review":"This movie so bad. Will Ferrell should have stayed on SNL. His decision to leave SNL to do movies was as wise as Shelley Long leaving Cheers to do movies.'Anchorman' is almost totally void of any enertainment value for anyone with an IQ above 10. It is a bad, worthless and inane movie. I had to give it one star because Amazon does not allow zero or negative stars.The movie has three very brief redeeming bits... the Indian food in a diaper comment, Christina Applegate in an apron, and the Avengers theme during a fight. That is it.Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson should fire their agents or leave Hollywood for good. Until they learn how to pick a good movie, I will not see anymore movies with either of those three idiots.For your own sake, do not waste any money by renting or buying this amazingly bad movie. Look for this movie to sweep The Razzies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad, even for Will Ferrell","review":"This is so bad I don't want to even waste time trashing it.

Don't think I am some dumb humor snob either, because I found Dodgeball to be hilarious.

I thought it was great, I thought Ferrell was great I thought the cast was great....I didn't think the plot was great but what comedy plot is great, the comedy should cover the fact that it has a week plot and this movie did that for me.

Even if it is cameos (Only one member missing, mr. owen wilson.) Absolute 10 in entertainment value. From the frivolous littering to the \\"yogging\\", the whole experience is worth watching it twice. I belly laughed my way through much of the film with heavy silent heaves toward the massive fight scene. Vince Vaughn makes a glorious appearence as a rival newscaster with is seedy glances and heavily satirical lines \\"did your mommy tell you it was special and different from everyone elses?\\" I feel a lot of well earned ad lib. Ferrell and Rudd really make the newsteam click. As well as applegate in a shiny new role as a comedian. So happy to see her move up the ladder. I hardly ever think of her as a \\"bundy\\". Fabulous. Cant wait for the whole outtake bonus reel on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Funny Funny","review":"I walked out of the theater thinking, \\"wow that was a really funny movie.\\" My two friends I went with even thought it was funnier than I did. I'll just say this... it's not the greatest movie. The storyline is just ok, but this is a COMEDY and it does make you laugh. Will Ferrell is just plain funny, and knows how to make people laugh. You should get this movie, or atleast check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"'He said heine!'","review":"i enjoyed will ferrel's 'anchorman' to a certain extent so i will begin to review it. Burgundy was always hilarious, if at times a little weird - take the scene where he was speaking to baxter, his dog, for proof on that statement. there were also a few notable quotes in this movie, and the guy who kept getting his arms chopped off was a good gag. anyone who watched the movie knows that the gag before him & veronica before they went out was hilarious (but I won't mention what it is because amazon may edit it.) and brick's idiocy was also funny.\\"where'd you get those, the, toilet store?\\"however the fight between veronica and ron was a bit too long; and everything seemed just fine between them right after that. however i hope you enjoy this. here's hoping. (is it just me or is that catchprase getting old fast?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the Top","review":"There are some gags that are hilariously funny, but the plot doesn't hang together. There are too many over-the-top scenes. This strategy works for Mel Brooks, but here Ferrel takes potshots at everything and pretty much misses everything. For example, there is a voice over at the end for a character that is never seen in the movie. Was that intentional and not funny? Or was it unintentional and sloppy editing? The language is bad in spots. Furthermore, there is a lot of yelling in the movie by different characters. I am not sure why that is funny.The good points were the dog was cute, Steve Carrel as Brick was funny, and some of the cameos were funny. I won't spoil the cameos, because who they got to play which character is part of the fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the scene was not as funny.The movie just doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Movie, A Lousy DVD","review":"I wish I bought the regular version. This \\"unrated version\\" was not as good as the theatrical release, but the DVD commentary was rude, crude, and nothing to do with the movie.

It was insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre comedy!","review":"definitely not Will Ferrell's best effort.

The \\"boy's club\\" mantality of the all-male anchor desk is done in humor that would make a 12 year old boy proud, and never really gets beyond it. There is little plot, instead relying on a series of sight gags and weird plot devices (like a gang rumble between the guys from every anchor desk in San Diego). The best line in the whole movie was at the very end when the narrator gave the \\"this is where they are now\\" speech. Brick, the 50 I.Q. weather man was a top advisor in the Bush Administration. It was the best line in the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commentary","review":"This is a good movie and the transfer looks great, but by default it starts with the commentary track running.

I'll agree with sum other reviewers that it is very stupid but thats what makes it funny. The guy that plays Bric is also the star of the 40 year old virgin. Is it a coincedence that he plays a loser in both movies or is he an actual loser in real life? I don't know, but what I do know is you simply need to buy this movie. It's the best there ever was.

Cheap laughs, nothing really original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost all respect for Will Ferrell","review":"I just saw this movie expecting to see the Will Ferrell who was funny in Old School, but instead I saw a movie that actually appeared to be written by a small child in school. The type of humor in this movie was quite infantile. Will Ferrell wasn't remotely funny in this movie and for the most part he was down right annoying. The way Will Ferrell was acting in this movie reminded me of Pluto Nash when you could see in Eddie Murphy's eyes the he knew the movie was stupid. Save your money and go buy some beer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over...","review":"I keep waiting for a movie starring Will Ferrell that makes me laugh but I haven't found it yet. I think he is perhaps one of the most overrated comedic actors of this time. I figured I'd give this movie a try because it was on HBO and there was nothing else on. Boy, am I glad I didn't waste 8 bucks at the theater. Alright, I admit I laughed at a few scenes but I don't think Will Ferrell was even in those scenes.

I thought that the anchorman character and Will Ferrell fit like a glove...Instead it fit like OJ's glove.This movie stinks. The humor was left out along with, plot, style and basic entertainment. I cannot remember being so bored during a comedy movie, and especially during a movie with Will Ferrell. Usually all this guy has to do is talk and I'm smiling. Not the case in this movie.I'm not going to get into the plot of this movie, because I don't think it would persuade anyone to watch the movie. That is also not my intent in writing this review. I want people to lower their expectations of this movie. Maybe that will give it a chance. I will admit, I had high expectations and I fell on my face with this one.Ferrell fans..regardless of what I say, you will watch this movie.Anyone else...rent \\"Elf\\" instead.

It's boring and stupid and rarely draws a laugh. But even the idle laughter ended when Jack Black punted Will Ferrell's dog off a bridge. Yeah, hilarious stuff. Animal cruelty is always a real knee slapper. Bet people will be lining up to see that.I guess that the dog comes back alive in the end is supposed to redeem it, but kicking a dog off a bridge is never going to be funny. I hope every animal lover even tempted to see this movie avoids this movie like the plague.The scene was very shocking and I guess that's how it was supposed to derive the laugh, but a few weeks ago People magazine ran an article about some kid who kicked his neighbor's dog like a football and is facing deserved criminal charges for animal cruelty. So I'm sure another idiot kid somewhere will see this movie and go out imitating it for a joke. Ha, ha. Nice going guys.Minus that scene, this movie is still terrible.

The only thing that shocks me more than the fact someone actually approved the making of this movie is that there are reviewers on Amazon that actually liked it!

Save your money and your time - trust me on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully unfunny","review":"It's strange to see how other people thought this move was hilarious when I considered it a waste of time (and rental fee) to watch.

Why don't you go do something useful in your life and stop human cruelty before defending stuffed animals.This movie has so many 1 liners, it's insanely funny.

It's made up of 30 second \\"jokes\\" that are very predictable and old. I haven't seen alot of Will Farrell movies, but if this is his best work I don't want to see any others. It's not even good enough to insult my intelligence. It's just plain dumb.

But even without that it is still pretty funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing - Not Funny at All","review":"I love Will Ferrell, Steve Carrell and all of the others in this movie. These are people who can be funny just standing around. On top of it all, it sounded like a great premise with plenty of opportunity for big laughs. Unfortunately, this movie produced no more than 3 mild chuckles from me. We watched every minute of the movie, including the bloopers just hoping for one actual laugh ... only to be completely denied. I am not a difficult person to please when it comes to comedy and I have to say it was the worst movie I have ever seen. DO NOT waste your money on buying this movie. If you insist on seeing it for yourself rent it or borrow it from a friend, but you will regret spending money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful movie","review":"I thought this movie was awful. I've heard lots of people say it was great. The reviews on here are mixed. One quarter of the way through the movie and I started watching it at 1.4x speed. Half way through I turned it off. I joked around that on my next scuba diving trip I would leave this movie at the bottom of the ocean and take pictures of it as I swam away. But, I don't litter in the sea so I sent it to my brother. He probably hates me for it. I still love Will Farrell and will watch his other movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Poor","review":"Like some other readers here, I'm amazed at the dichotomy of those who absolutely love this movie and those who can't stand it. Put me in the latter category. This truly is sketch comedy at its worst, extended to feature length and including as many diversions and distractions as the director and writers could conjure. Don't label me a fuddy-duddy for not falling for this garbage. And obviously, when you make 1000 attempts at a joke, one or two of them will succeed on some level. There were some chuckles, but no big screaming laughs here.This movie scraped the bottom of the barrel, and shows yet again indeed how hard it is to make a funny movie. It's certainly more than pasting ideas together and crossing your fingers, like the crew did here. I DID find the out-takes funny; but then again, I always enjoy them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this movie for real??","review":"I did not enjoy this movie at all.

Its sidesplitting funny from start to finish. Will Ferrell is in top form, Christina Applegate is equally as funny, and the whole supporting cast is funnier than 4 seasons of SNL and MadTV combined. Ron is like a younger Ted Baxter (you know, from the Mary Tyler Moore show) but on acid. Good ole Ted certainly couldn't have gotten away with things as Ron did. Great cameos flesh out the movie and are numberous. This is one dern good movie. Now, fair warnng: IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO LAUGH THEN THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU. More comedies should be this funny.

I am not a prude, but in the context of this movie, the blue language and references were not necessary. The dialog was as stilted as I have heard in any \\"B\\" movie.

A very amatuerish screenplay where none of the jokes work. Many of his friends from Old School join him but it doesn't help. A fantasy fight scene including Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Jerry Stiller and Tim Robbins is so contrived it's painful. And a talking dog to help through the terrible plot? The only bright spot is a very attractive Christina Applegate who never looked better.Trust me, I'm saving you money. Wait for it to come on TV.

The jokes are mostly groaners. Some people obviously liked this movie.

Pretty much just dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth renting","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell and Christina Appelgate but they just werent thinking when they made this movie.

It was one of the worst movies we have seen. Was not funny, jokes were lame and bad, and the story just dragged on, making those 7 minutes seem like an hour. We ended up spending more money (and it was worth it) to see another movie. We would not recommend this show to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANCHORMAN Tells A Weak Story","review":"It stars the hilarious Will Ferrell, is co-anchored by the gorgeous Christina Applegate, features cameos by buddies Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson, and the story is about the television profession, in which I've worked for many years. Yet, somehow, the lead story never hooked me. As it is often the case with news promos, it stands true for the trailer: The story sounds riveting until you see the final piece. The moments of adlib are quite funny, but too much of the film strays away from its original point. Had the script continued to focus more on the job and less on the love connection, I think the film makers would have had better results. I am, however, glad to see the lovely Miss Applegate in a role that proves she has more talent than her \\"dumb blonde\\" typecast.

I don't care if it looks dumb or it's not very smart, all I care about is that this film definintely makes me laugh. Carell steals the show as the mildly retarded Brick (\\"Fantastic!\\"), while Ferrel and Applegate make an interesting onscreen duo.

This movie also has many hilarious scenes in it. Will Farrell does a great job in his part of acting as Ron Burgundy. I've been watching this movie for some time now and in no way is that depressing.

The gags are geared to a six-year old. Too obvious for an adult. It reminds me of Late Night with David Letterman. He has a brain-fart & it falls falt. He thinks it will become funny if he repeats it three or four times, then explains the joke. No. Only his fool, Paul Schaefer laughs. Anchorman gives you escapist fare & you'll find yourself predicting what will happen next. Will Farrell sharpened his acting skills since then, but not much. The gang fight with all the local news teams is the funniest scene. That's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Farrell fanatics only","review":"Will Farrell plays a sexist 70s news anchorman. Christina Applegate his competition. Sounds funny. Has some laughs. But it's really not one of his best.

How else to explain my negative reaction to this hilarious (NOT!) movie. On the other hand, if I was in a bad mood, shouldn't a good comedy have cheered me up? The answer to this seeming contraction is, of course, that ANCHORMAN may be a stupid, inane, badly-written film. On the other hand, maybe I'm just not the type of guy who enjoys farce that much. That would quite possibly put me in the category of an up-tight someone who needs to chill out. Or, again, it could be that ANCHORMAN is simply a stinker of a movie. Maybe these things come down to taste. However, for me, the bottom line is I just didn't think ANCHORMAN or Will Ferrell was funny.

For the same reason, I am definitely not a Glenn Gould fan. If you enjoy listening to Sokolov, get this album. If you want to listen to Bach wiithout having the persona and eccentricity of the pianist intrude on what you're listening to, look elsewhere. The staccato style of his playing is not in the least bit interesting -- it's simply distracting and annoying. At times I'm not sure if I'm listening to Bach or to Count Basie. This is a wondrously deep and profound piece of music. Sokolov makes it sound silly. A waste of an obviously great talent and a very good quality recording. (I love Count Basie by the way, but not as interpreter of Bach!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never get borded watching it...","review":"I have several Cirque du Soleil performances on video (DVD and tape), and this one is my favorite. Unfortunately, I've never seen a Cirque performance live, but I will the next chance I get.Quidam is phenomenal in so many ways. The performances are amazing. Audrey's singing is amazing, forget that she's only 12. The embedded storyline is intriguing. And the music is the best I've heard from Benoit Jutras (Audrey's father for those keeping score at home).The only disappointment is that the disc cover and tech specs on the disc (...) say that the subtitles are in English and French. What they don't tell you is the subtitles are limited to the 30 seconds of words that appear in the beginning, and nothing more. I would like to have seen a translation of what she's singing, but subtitles get to be distracting anyway.Bottom line- it's spectacular!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weird audio","review":"i dont know what they did to the dvd because the VHS tape (which i no longer have right now) sounds normal. the dvd on the other hand sounds slower, and low pitched. so i don't know exactly what happened in the converting room to making this a dvd but someone messed up. i am not pleased with my purchase, this sounds nothing like the VHS or the soundtrack. it should not be this low or this slow......."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Cirque Experience!!","review":"After my parents having gone to Treasure Island to see Mystere, I knew I would really enjoy a Cirque performance, based on their reactions to the show. I ordered a package through Columbia House, with Quidam and Dralion both. Quidam has a storyline that is more elaborate, and developed (in my opinion) than Dralion. After watching it repeatidly, I am still amazed at how many nuances I can pick out that I had never noticed before. Without going into specifics I would say that the theatrics and acts are coordinated beautifully, juxtaposed to the weaker story of Dralion, which seems to focus mainly on the acts. Surely Quidam is a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Cirques","review":"The show is very entertaining from start to finish, and I find myself watching it over and over. The music and acts blend very well together along with the costumes. John Gilkey is quite possibly the best clown in all the Cirques I have watched. Quidam is worth the purchase just to see him perform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal!","review":"Cirque du Soleil is by far the most unique and beautifully twisted, surreal experience available. Quidam is another example of why no one compares to them. The production is masterful, the sound wonderful, and camera work superb. I just wish that there was more behind the scenes info and footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cirque Du SoleiL's Quidam Show","review":"As I have heard so much about the Cirque Du Soleil shows from my sister who has seen them in Vegas three times, I decided to purchase a DVD. After reading several good reviews about Quidam, I sent for it. I received the DVD very quickly but was majorly disappointed in the show. It was very slow and repetitive and I didn't even bother watching the whole thing. Maybe it was because it was an older show, but I really wasted my money--I plan to send it to my sister and get her opinion on how it compares to the ones that she has seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Personal Opinion of Quidam","review":"I will try to make this relatively short. I have seen a few performances of Cirque du Soleil on DVDs and TV. Quidam was filmed in Amsterdam and it shows more of an artsy performance then one I figured I would get with Cirque du Soleil. Also, the performance is subtitled in English (and a variety of other languages) which makes it more difficult to follow and watch. Overall, I did not like it too much. I labored through much of the performance wanting it to be over. The other few DVDs and shows I have seen had much more comedy and breaks in the performance. Quidam showed a very different view of Cirque du Soleil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly entertaining, but not a rush...","review":"I'm a great fan of CdS, and most of their DVDs are outstanding. But IMHO Quidam rates 4/10. Any other CdS DVD I've ever watched, any other, is substantially better, some are 10/10. But this isn't their best production by any stretch, again, IMHO. Smoke it if you've got it but don't go out of your way for this installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"After seeing Mystere, Vareka and Dralion I was truly dissapointed in the performance of Quidam.Artistically the music, the theme was dark and gloomy and it lacked tremendously the pizzazz of the other shows.The performance were nothing spectacular and I was little baffled from the wonderful reviews it received from the others.I am not saying this was the worst show I have ever seen but compared to the others it truly was a disappointment.I would highly recommend to check the other three before you venture into Quidam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better in person but still fantastic","review":"Having seen the show live twice I was thrilled to see the DVD version of quidam. Like all of Cirque Du Soleil's videos the technical production is fabulous. I was slightly bummed to see that the act involving the pair using the weighted red balls was not included but this in no way diminished the package. Overall I found the DVD stunning and I'm impressed by how well it was adapted from the big top to the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG","review":"This is amazing.

It demonstrates the wide variety of services available in Tucson and even without fancy colour photos makes the city sound attractive.

The item is flimsy and did not effectively process canned whole tomatoes. After about 20 minutes of struggle, my wife walked in and said \\"oh, I have an old one of those from my grandmother\\". She dug out of the garage an ancient Moulinex metal food mill that must have been at least 40 years old and it worked beautifully. Sadly, these appear to no longer be available, but I can't recommend this model at all. I'll give it a shot for applesauce or mashed potatoes, but am not optimistic. It gets two stars primarily because it was relatively inexpensive. For what it's worth, I've made several purchases based on Cooks Illustrated recommendations and this is the first one that I haven't been happy with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mill, good value","review":"I was a little hesitant to buy this food mill, particularly since it is plastic and much less expensive than the other food mills available. But, I decided to go for it and I'm glad I did. My son and I read the lovely bookApplesauce Seasonand were inspired to make applesauce - that's why I bought this food mill.I popped the apples in my slow cooker (using an incredibly easy recipe fromNot Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook), peels, seeds and all, and a few hours later ran the cooked apples through this food mill. The sauce was delicious, way better than sauce we'd made earlier with peeled apples. The mill was perfectly easy to use, firm in the hand, yet completely easy to operate.I'm absolutely delighted with the purchase and looking forward to finding other ways to use my new food mill.UPDATE: 2 years later the food mill is still going strong, no sign of wear despite regular use. Great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!!!","review":"I had such a hard time using my old metal food mill that I got rid of it.

It's really a terrific product! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap and not well made","review":"I really was confused by all the great reviews for this product. It is a plastic piece of junk. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars on a more high-end model. I tried to made tomato sauce with this and had to keep pushing the tomatoes through the grates myself. It made a big mess and kept moving all over the place. The spinning piece that pushes the food through the grates scraped against the grate, as well, and tiny shards flaked off into my tomatoes.

I'm Christian, but the Bible quotes were excessive. They quickly became distracting. She puts down \\"relying on self and inner strength\\" and supports doing things for God.

I had to purge it from my library, even though the act of purging a book from my library racked me with guilt. It was required reading in a writing class I took, and I hated every minute of reading it. I hated it so much that I made my sister read it to see if I was crazy. She hated it as well. That was in 1998. We still hold this book up as the worst book ever written, except maybe Moby Dick.If this had been a good book, I would have liked it. I am fascinated by the medieval period, and tend to gravitate toward books (fiction and non-) about that era. I like the good murder mystery most of the time. I should have liked this book. But it was beat-your-brains-out awful. The writing was stilted and unnatural. The characters were inhumanly flat.Awful! Awful! Yuck Yuck Yuck! Do yourself a favor and stay away.

I have not found any to be more than \\"entertainments\\" with the exception of this book, which I believe to be a first-rate work.Here is what I like about it. It is short and succinct. So many books written today could benefit from a serious-minded editor with a sharp pair of scissors. In this book there is hardly a wasted word.The descriptions of theatrical rehearsal and performance are absolutely breathtaking. Unsworth deeply understands not just the mechanics of theater but the spirit, too - how theater can transform a player and an audience. Actors could benefit from reading this.The love interest between the actor and accused murderer is very cleverly and skillfully portrayed.It is commonplace to describe a song, poem or painting as \\"beautiful\\", but not so often a book. This is a beautiful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, very well worth reading","review":"If you ever enjoyed The Name of the Rose, be sure to also read Morality Play - although it is short, it is a really impressive piece of work, giving you a very good insight of the life in the towns in the 15 century.

Now for another long search..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile read, but not for the mystery...","review":"While I agree for the most part with the more prestigious reviews already posted, in the end, this book falls flat. Unsworth impressively whisks the reader back to medieval England, presenting characters who are sympathetic to a 20th century audience, and the story progresses in an interesting and thoughtful way. However, the final answer to the whodunit is much less impressive than the portrayal of the acting process, especially the interactions and improvisations that are part of every stage production"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flamenco - compelling","review":"This film is a delight for Flamenco aficionados.

What little dancing there is is a bit cool and a touch modern, as are the stark sets.

I would not be angry at Mr. Saura if he had named his video with some other name such as \\"I have no talent, therefore I act wierd in order to get famous\\".

The book shows only a couple of pictures per project, however the reading gives a fantastic insight into the mind of Libeskind. I'm not the type that would usually read the amount of text that's included in this book but it does draw you in, enabling a full and \\"accurate\\" understanding of what his architecture is all about. If your not passionate about deconstructivist architecture steer well clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Libeskind's Work","review":"The refreshing thing about this book is that it steers away from the traditional 'monograph' format, in presenting work both built and unbuilt as well as significant theoretical treatises from Libeskind and others. There could have been more attention paid to structuring the content so that the projects followed a particular line of architectural strategy (as opposed to alphabetical organisation) but with Libeskind this is likely an intertextual approach, allowing the projects to be linked as the reader sees fit. An excellent snapshot of the thoughts of one of todays best architects..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain Nonsense","review":"Firstly, you have to know that when Libeskind moved to New York, he hired another Architect (Alexander Gorlin) to design his own apartment. That alone should say a great deal about the hypocrisy of architecture's current king salesman/charlatan. But a look at this volume reveals why he may have made such a decision. Libeskind's rational is abstract at best, and barely rational. He cannot respond to human needs (vis-a-vis his own apartment) so he avoids designing for them. Only a fool would be taken in by the pretentious writing in this preposterous book. Decide for yourself if the cap fits."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American Architect???","review":"The thing about Liebeskind, that is even more true in his followup book, is that as much as Liebeskind tries to pass himself off as an American, a refugee seeking the American Dream, he is yet another European fool.

It is not a sympathetic portrait of Miss Wood' in fact, Mr. Lambert blames her for the tragic events in her life when she's not alive to defend herself. He also goes out of his way to attack her mother and her sister in what seems to be a personal vendetta while at the same time falsely glorifying rv actor Robert Wagner, who he admits is a long time friend of his. There would be no need to remember Miss Wood in a book at this time had she not drowned under suspicious circumstances that Mr. Wagner obviously wishes to conceal. It is clear that Mr. Lambert's true loyalty is to Robert Wagner, not to Natalie Wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natalie Deserves Better","review":"Very disappointing. Lambert presents Natalie as a narcissistic, suicidal sex addict, drug addict, out of control alcoholic. How did she ever manage to make a movie?This disconnected, chaotic account of many less than interesting moments in Natalie's life lacks authenticity. There's too much wild guessing, not enough flow, no sense of the \\"real\\" Natalie and what made her tick.On page 337, at the very end of the book, long after reading about her career, her family and her death, Lambert suddenly jumps back to details about her roles in West Side Story, Gypsy and her other films yet again. What happened to the \\"creative editor\\" he mentions in his acknowledgements?To add to the general confusion, a costume designer named Donfeld is mentioned on almost every page in the book.

I warn others who may choose this book as their first biography, STOP, put the book down and look for some other biography. However, if you want boring account of Natalie Wood's script selection, give Lambert's book a try, at the very least you can use it to treat insomnia. Lambert has done a grave injustice to such a fascinating Hollywood icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, left so much out","review":"Having read 'Natasha' by Suzanne Finstad and 'Natalie, a memoir by her sister' by Lana Wood I was very disappointed with this book. The two books I mentioned were both great, and gave in detail many new and suprising facts on Natalie and her life. This book by Gavin Lambert is horribly boring. The ending chapters on her death make no sense, it sounds as though Robert Wagner himself wrote the end, in which it only defends Wagner, and brings nothing new to what the public already knows. The author also goes on to throw out all of the evidence that pointed to something 'more' then just an accident. The only good thing about this book was the gorgeous pictures of Natalie throughout the book. Bottom line- this book was awful, one of the worst bios I have read. If you want a book on Natalie buy 'Natasha' by Suzanne Finstad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a average collection","review":"To start with an Amazon seller sent this to me incorrectly, but I listened to it anyway.The sound quality is just barely okay.

I've purchased KMS HairStay from regular salons before (in smaller bottles) so I'm familiar with how it performs, smells, etc. Right out of the bottle, I noticed this stuff didn't smell like the gel I had used before. It had a much more 'pungent' alcohol-like smell. After trying it a couple of times, I noticed it flaked a lot more as well which is odd, especially since the bottle specifically says, \\"doesn't flake.\\"This all led me to believe that either I received a bad bottle OR the bottle had been emptied and refilled with a much cheaper gel. Just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, I purchased another authentic bottle from a local salon to compare with. Sure enough, the performance was significantly better (and it did smell different).

The effects on our society of exposing the feeble-minded lower orders to their fantasies made real upon the screen can only be imagined with a delicate frisson of horror.

I think that the sex was focused on too much. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Denise Richards getting it on in this movie, but that theme can only carry a movie so far.

You start to become so suspicious of all the characters and expect the worst that it all becomes plainly obvious. The whole way through the film I sat there with a friend predicting what would happen next, and I was always right. The threesome scene and lesbian scene would definitely turn some guys on but since I'm a girl I wasn't too enthralled. The acting was okay but it wasn't enough.

Personally, Dillon doing \\"Singles\\" is the one saving grace for him that I have, he also does have some other memorable roles, but the fact that he most likely did sleep with his co-stars off screen, as well as on, leads me to believe he had alterior motives in choosing this script. I can't help but feeling like a little highschooler trying to witness some of the \\"action\\" in adult movies while watching this film. The script seems to be derived from a high schooler after all. I'm guessing this was filmed in a couple of weeks, in between the actors other projects."},{"rating":"1","title":":-(","review":"I dont see difference from the previous edition.

I don't see why nudity is so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Things","review":"The credits include significant actors, so you know the movie has to be good, right? Well, most of the movie elements are fine, except the script which is very light-weight in dialogue. Perhaps this is due to the difficult plot - more time writing to make that work than giving the actors something to say.Worth watching just to see Bill Murray play a sleeze lawyer and Denise Richards playing herself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"twisted wows","review":"Excellent performances in a movie that never quits trying to fake you out.It's hard not to enjoy a movie with beautiful scenes of the everglades,an excellent score,Matt Dillon,Kevin Bacon,Neve Campbell and a whole lot of the gorgeous and talented Denise Richards.The secondary actors were also excellent. Be sure to catch Carrie Snodgrass in a small part.She's put on a few pounds since Pale Rider but she could always act. She has the advantage of having one of the most irritating voices in the movies.This film will keep your attention for one reason or another throughout.

'Young Si' was the best story.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Set of Short Stories","review":"This is a set of short stories all set along the coast of Prince Edward Island, written with the usual charm of Montgomery's works. Most of the stories are written for older audiences -- there are tales of love lost and love found, family relationships, friendship, and the lure of the sea. These are appropriate for all readers with one caveat -- the last story, \\"A House Divided Against Itself\\" uses some language (including the \\"N\\" word) that was common when the story was published in 1930, but would be considered inappropriate by today's standards. Highly recommended for fans of Anne of Green Gables, or readers who enjoy stories of the sea with romantic, descriptive prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal esoterica","review":"Karma is a mixture of Enigma, Deep Forest, Dead Can Dance, Peter Gabriel's Passion, with a little bit of the Cocteau Twins on it.

I'm not much for this kind of music, but I can't resist how beautiful these songs are. Aside from \\"Silence\\", favorites include \\"Duende\\" (which features Sarah's back-up singer, Camille Henderson) and \\"Remembrance\\".

Not sure how it ended up on my ipod, but after listening to it I am glad it did. I hear Dead Can Dance (is that Lisa Gerrard singing on Forgotton Worlds?), Enigma (particularly, on Silence) and Peter Gabriel's Passion (Lamentation starts off sounding very much like The Feeling Begins).

A fan of the dark industrial beats and the deep almost robotic vocals. But this album 'Karma' paved the way for Delerium to change from the dark sounds to a lighter, more mainstream contemporary sound and this album heralded that change moreso than the albums 'Poem' or 'Semantic Spaces'. The lyrics of many of the songs were sung by guest vocalist most notable is Sarah McLachlan who was made famous by the song 'Silence'. The other notable songs on this album are 'Enchanted, Euphoria and Window to your Soul'.But my favourite two songs that are bearable to listen to day in and day out are 'Euphoria' and 'Silence'."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOT TO LISTEN MORE THAN ONCE","review":"When I first listened to this CD I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. At the time I was trying to find someone similar to Enigma. But the more I listened, the more this CD grew on me. It has a uniqueness all to it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karma is Karma and Delirium shares it!","review":"I bought this CD a number of years ago and soon afterward I moved to Paris. Let me tell you, riding the metro and strolling the streets of the \\"city of lights\\" while listening to the euphoric sounds of Delirium was something that saved me. And everytime I play it during dinner parties, people always asked me who it was... The vocals are so soothing and my favorite cut \\"Firefly\\" helps to put a spring in your step and a smile on your face. Truthfully, this is one of the most soothing and beautiful CDs I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. And one that I never get tired of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow and Harmonic","review":"Overall this is a great CD. The track shared by Sarah and Delerium is awesome. The sounds of the music throughout the remaining songs on the CD are harmonic and mellow with a good beat. Some of the tracks tend to be more monotone than you would anticipate in listening, (track 7, especially). I am a definite Sarah fan and will definitely give other Delirium LP's a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Etheral!","review":"Well, as the second CD I've bought from Delerium (the first being Poem) this has firmly established Delerium as my favourite band! This album is utter beauty! I love the covers and designs as well as most of the lyrics, though Duende is kinda disturbing. The sound produced is so great. The songs are all so different, from Silence with Sarah McLachlan, to 'Til the End of Time with Kristy Thirsk and the enchanting rhythm in Remembrance. There are so many different and unique and otherworldly sounds being produced on each song, I love them all. And this is definately one of the best Delerium albums, the second being Poem. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"All I can say is wow! This cd is amazing, captivating. I listen to it 5 times or more a day and I just can't stop..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambient and soothing","review":"Well, the music may sound strikingly similar to anything that Enigma put out, but that doesn't mean that it's not good. This music soothes the soul with haunting vocals and great ambient backdrops. Sure it may sound like religious music, but I don't care. This CD is something that I like to unwind to. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This is by far my favoriate CD. It competes with Semantic Spaces for that position, but I'd have to say that this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Karma","review":"This music is ethereal and is great for sitting in a room lit by candles with incense burning. I had never hear of Delerium and I'm going to check out some of their other CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but they really should make their own music","review":"I am still counting the number of great music creators that this 'artist' has 'borrowed' from; Enigma, Deep Forest, Dead Can Dance, Peter Gabriel, Archetribe, etc...Enchanted is a [spinoff] of an Enigma songTwilight is a [spinff] of a Deep forest songForgotten worlds is a [spinoff] of a great Dead Can Dance songLamentation and Remembrance are [spinoffs] of one of the greatest soundtracks (cd's for that matter) ever created, Passion by Peter Gabriel, although anything Gabriel touches is good...Now in closing this is not a bad CD but I really get angry when people try to sell music that is just a copy of someone else's great creation. For that I boycott Delerium, now that I unfortunately own most of their CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karma ~ Delerium","review":"With this recording the transformation of Delerium was complete. Gone was the heavy sound that was prevelent on recordings such as Stone Tower and in was the easier listening sound of Poem, Chimera and the like. Karma also had the international smash hit silence and I think that it is natural progresion on the part of Delerium. There are so many good tracks on this album and Leeb and Fulber have recorded and produced a true master piece. The book-let is very nice with an amazing cover that fits the mood and style of the album and the vocalists picked to sing the songs are all very accomplished with Sarah McLachlan leading the way with their break through hit Silence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than all the artists they rip off","review":"They rip off everyone, from Enigma to Deep Forest to Dead Can Dance. And the result is much better than any album by any of those artists (with the exception of Dead Can Dance, of course). There are moments of spellbinding beauty in songs like \\"Duende\\" (my absolute favorite) and \\"Forgotten Worlds\\", where they sample Lisa Gerrard's voice. And the Sarah McLachlan collaboration is exceptional. If you are into the Enigma/Deep Forest/B-tribe genre, this album will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Get Enough Of This Disc","review":"I just bought this CD yesterday and wow, there is nothing like this group in existance. Their music is so lush and haunting. I had used to think Enigma was the height of otherworldly music but Delirium outdoes them everytime. My favorites have to be Enchanted and Silence (featuring the lovely Sarah Mclachlan) A must for anyone who love ambient music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new... really","review":"Although Karma I feel could be taken a little more seriously than it's preceeder Semantic Spaces, it still lacked severly in originality. The over-sampling of other artists is simpley ridiculous and once you realize that most of the drum loops and much of the instrumentations are hardly their own, you gradualy begin to realize how phoney and trendy this album really is! Just to name a few, you've got samples directly lifted from Peter Gabrial, Tori Amos, Enigma (yet again), Garbage, Waterbone, and Dead Can Dance (DCD being the only band whom sample credits were given to), not to mention I reccommend albums by ALL OF THE ABOVE ARTISTS before I would reccommend this \\"Sampler of Various Artists\\". As for the lyrical and vocal arrangements go ... not bad for the most part but they failed to impress me much either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surround Your Senses.","review":"Delerium has woven an enchanting, charged musical shroud that you can wrap yourself in when you find the time for a little reflective solitude. Equally enjoyable when shared with a loved one--take off the watches and turn off the clocks and lose yourself in each other for a spell. This hauntingly beautiful music is perfect for making memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's resampled music, but it's good!","review":"Originally, this CD was purchased for the track with the vocals by Sarah McLachlan. However, upon listening to this album all the way through, I discovered that this music is very much in synch with other items in my music collection. I was surprised as well to hear the number of tracks that are very well suited for modern Middle Eastern dance--where more modern music is being used for ancient dance techniques. Some of the songs even give me chills up and down my spine, they are that \\"transporting.\\"I have shared the music with several of my friends and they have either purchased the CD for themselves or are planning to. If you like the samples on this page, you will probably enjoy the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEOPOLITAN SOULS LIVE IN SOUND","review":"An enchanting and a bit more solid follow-up to \\"Semantic Spaces\\", Delerium's \\"Karma\\" features some splendid female vocalists and a full chorus on many tracks. This CD begins with the seductive and tribal \\"Enchanted\\" with vocals by the wonderful Kristy Thirsk, soon after we hear Sarah McLachlan on \\"Silence\\", followed by the sampled vocals of Lisa Gerrard on \\"Forgotten Worlds\\" which uses Lisa's voice well. Every track on \\"Karma\\" is fine, you will find your favorites. Kristy Thirsk is featured in the final haunting piece titled \\"'til the end of time\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy, more original, less corny","review":"Front Line Assembly's side-project Delerium is sounding more dreamy and original than \\"Symantic Spaces\\". Less corny, a little less of the embarrassing Enigma beats and choirs, much more Mid-Eastern chanting and soundscapes, and stunning female vocals. Favourites: \\"Silence\\", \\"Window To Your Soul\\", \\"'Til The End Of Time\\". Try and get the double CD version which includes some interesting remixes from this album and \\"Symantic Spaces\\".To FLA fans who don't know Delerium, these two bands have nothing in common - this, the later Delerium work is pseudo-commercial ethereal (earlier work can be described as ambient), compared to FLA's industrial signature."},{"rating":"2","title":"a cd worth a standing ovation!!","review":"this cd is for anyone who has ever walked through a forest alone....for anyone who has thought there should be a soundtrack to life...for those who have seen the notre dame in paris...watched the sunset from the beach...or dreamed as they gazed unto the stars....talk about enchanting!...the music is hauntingly beautiful..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old ambients combined with modern technology","review":"An extraordinary trip in the history of music, that goes back to soundscapes produced by ancient cultures, combined with medieval chants all put together with de ultimate technology. With no doubt this record is an all time clasic. Leeb and Fulber creat a unique record that is an energetical alternative to the music produce by their side projects (Front Line Assembly, FLA, Noise Unit, Synaesthesia). This is also a record that shows the art of sampling in a very elaborated form. Perhaps the most outstanding sample used in this record is the voice of Lisa Gerrard from Dead can Dance in a unique reconstruccion of the a capela Persian Song. This album develops to the must the style that's present in Delerium's previous albums like Euforic and Morpheus. This is the ultimate development and definitive consagration of Delerium's sound experiments. Dont'miss the chance to listen to this masterfull experiment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is is one of the best cds I have ever listened too!!","review":"The vocalist has an angelic voice that just sends shivers down your spine everytime you hear it, the music is so powerfull it charges my mind with visions of vast blue oceans and , serene oldgrowth forests.

It lacks Depth and the music is simply irritating. I regreted buying after believing the reviews I read. Be your own judge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My reviews might offend some of Delerium's fans ... sorry","review":"After read most of the reviews. I decided that I ought to buy this album. It was described by some of the reviewers that this is the best album in the world. I should say that it will depend on individual's taste for music. And this is definately not my type of music. I am a big fan of Engima though and this album is nothing like any of the Engima's album. I tried to accept this kinda weird music but I gave up eventually. I simply find the music annoying. It just irritates me everytime I played it. I gave it away thinking that it is wasting my CD storage space. I am keeping Semantic Spaces though as I thought it is much better than this.Another thing to note, the cover design is very lousy. Delerium tries to add mysterious feeling to it's music by including some tamil writing and it is totally unfit. The only worthy track is Silience. Get the single instead and don't waste your money on this. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SPIRITUAL JOURNEY THROUGH SOUND","review":"After hearing KARMA by Delerium, I was utterly transfixed into a dimension of sound and visual stimulus. I couldn't get enough and found myself playing it over and over. I use this CD for massage and bodywork and everyone makes comments about being taken to another space or being lost among the harmonies and vocals. A must for Delerium fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely... Just Lovely.","review":"Quite the nice album. I just recently picked this album up simply based on the fact that I am a big fan of Bill Leeb's other projects. This is ALMOST no exception. I really enjoyed the quality of the song writing. Plus the interesting mixture of far eastern samples and Gregorian chants made for a compelling listen. But I wasn't expecting Mr. Leeb to boil all of his beats down to the Enigma level. Im not saying that this is wholly disappointing. (I enjoy progression of artists styles) But the radio friendly \\"Shuffle Step\\" beat that he uses with the kind of cliché 808 bass lines... get on my nerves after a while. Over all, I would buy it again and I would recommend this to most people. But I guess I was just expecting a little more percussive diversity.

And stuck so hard that even soaking overnight didn't release it. I scrubbed it out several times, finally resorting to stove top cleaner to remove the egg! Back it went. We're trying a Scanpan next.

I had cabin fever and was missing weather in which I could fish, so I went to purchase a book I hoped would help carry me back to my favorite stream. In reading this book, I was exposed to the ruminations of a good writer, but little that would lift the absence of my favorite hobby from, my mind. Sure, it was clearly and entertainingly written. But it was not much more than that. There was little insight offered to me, the reader who had some experience fly-fishing. That is why I gave if only four stars.

Many are full-page sized and all are beautifully printed. The text, however, is somewhat disappointing, serving as a rather shallow survey of movies of the early 30's. Historical context is covered well but, for all the pre-code movies that are available on cable these days, this book discusses in depth only the most well known (such as King Kong, It Happened One Night, and Sign of the Cross). Reading this book got me interested in watching pre-code movies, but most of the more interesting films I've seen from that era (Wild Boys of the Road, Safe in Hell, Other Men's Women, Five Star Final) aren't covered here, despite their provocative themes. I'm finding more depth in Thomas Doherty's book Pre-Code Hollywood.

Get an I-Dog instead","review":"My son asked for and received this for Christmas. Right out of the box, the sound was attrocious. Even with the sound turned all the way up on his mp3 player, he had to hold the speaker up to his ear to hear the music (his player has been tested with other speakers and there is nothing wrong with it. He can listen with headphones at a comfortable volume). Now after only 2 or 3 uses, the sound cuts in and out, and it has stopped dancing to the music. The manufacturer offers NO WARRANTY AT ALL on this product, so now we'll be throwing away the brand new Christmas gift and buying an I-Cat to replace it. What a waste of money!

It gives pertinent information on the Mediteranean culture and the times in which Jesus lived. This allows us a deeper insight into Jesus' teachings, and their meanings. This is therefore, a very valuable resource for those working in RCIA, adult education, religious education or for someone who just wants a deeper understanding of the Gospels. Each week is covered by an essay ranging from two to four pages in length. It is written in very easy to understand language making the whole learning process easier andmore enjoyable. I highly recommend this set of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultural, yes...Catholic doctrine? No.","review":"This book may cover the cultural milieu of the Gospels very well, but there is a good reason it carries no Imprimatur or Nihil Obstat. Earlier in the year, Pilch's gloss on a gospel passage was that it indicated the need for the United States to pass a system of universal healthcare...I kid you not. But this Sunday (2nd of Easter, the appearance of the resurrected Jesus to doubting Thomas) was the last straw. Pilch reads this passage as the apostles experiencing an \\"altered state of consciousness\\". In other words, the resurrection was a mirage.Please, please do not rely on this book for RCIA formation, at least not anything other than the strictly cultural, historical background information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware 3rd Party Sellers","review":"This book was advertised as new, still in the wrapper.

I thought it might be a good idea to simply e-file my estimated taxes also. However, this software is not simple to use. It isn't inutiative at all (no pun intended). The version I used is through inituit's website via an account, not a program I install on my computer. Sometimes the website is busy, so the program is temporarly out of service. I had thought I'd set up my account to automatically schedule a reminder and pay from my checkbook. However, today when I checked (it's time for the 2nd quarterly payment), I didn't get a reminder. When I tried to manually efile, I instead had to manually print out the estimated form and send the payment in the old fashioned way because efiling requires an earlier stamp than a postmark.

I tried the chief competitor one year (stunk). I tried a tax professional (horrific, no understanding, fixed THEIR errors, and got charged extra for it).

I hope they don't get penalized.I have trained 1000s of people in software and other technology aspects so I am very comfortable with software.

However, if you're looking for realism, you came to the wrong place. It appears to be an amalgam of separate samples, some of them more than likely created in a studio. The mix is a little off. It sounds like whoever did the mixing doesn't have a firm grasp on spatial reference, therefore, it doesn't sound terribly realistic. The waves are WAY too short and small sounding. It reminds me of the ocean waves in Florida where they are used to short, small wave sets. Unfortunately, I live in Northern California, very close to Mavericks, the biggest waves in the world. I was hoping for something a little more substantial. I'm still looking for the perfect ocean CD. At least there's no ridiculous synth music in the background, and there's very little seagull noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it claimed to be","review":"I purchased this as it said it was enhanced with music; it is not enhanced with music, just ocean surf sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent adventure with Nick Carter from AXE","review":"Pretty decent plotline, interesting characters and better than I thought it would be. Slinky babes, neferious baddies, action, close calls make for a fun read. It seems the authors are attached to the knockdown power of the German Luger, which is not a man stopper compared to a .45 autoloader. Granted this series was out before the 10mm and 40 cal weapons were developed, but the Luger seems to have been selected as Carter's main weapon despite its moderate firepower. Those things have a tendancy to jam and only carry nine rounds.Still, a good one in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely watch","review":"I have a smaller wrist, and this watch fits perfectly.

The members of the Latter Day Saints wanted to build a Temple -- and they did. It was never explained why the LDS members were rejected by their neighbors. I thought the movie was too superficial.

After viewing this movie I still don't understand why it was made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am an advanced beginner, I guess you would say. I have videos by Michelle Dozois and Tracy York and I was thinking this video would be much the same. Unfortunately, I found the pace of this workout excruciatingly slow, and the narration to be quite monotonous and dull. Based on the books I have and the previous videos I have viewed, I found some of Deason's \\"variations\\" on what I would consider \\"true\\" Pilates exercises somewhat bizarre. I didn't buy this video for the proclaimed \\"weight loss\\" aspect, but rather because I thought it would be a challenging and interesting workout. I regret buying this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT going to help anyone lose weight","review":"This also is not for someone looking for a challenging workout, or for someone who is not woo-woo. I was looking for something to really make me sweat and feel the burn. This video has you doing foot circles and the like.Also, I just can't get past her telling me to breathe out of my feet. I am sorry, but anatomically your only two options are your nose and your mouth, unless you have a sucking chest wound. Feet are just not an option for exhaling.

Deason is ok, but i think other Pilates vids are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Workout by Ms. Deason","review":"I am new to Pilates, but have been using Suzanne Deason's Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss for a while now. I decided to try her Pilates for Weight Loss because I like the tranquility of her other videos and the way she takes the time to explain the benefits of the various movements. I feel this video offers an effective workout regardless of your fitness level. If you are new to Pilates, as I am, I would strongly recommend that you watch the video through a couple of times before actually beginning the workout, so that you can focus on the breathing techniques and instructions that Ms. Deason provides. The video is fast paced, but it is well worth the effort to learn the routine. Overall it provides an awesome workout for the abs and is a great way to start your day. I intend to use both the Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss and Pilates for Weight Loss videos in combination, as part of my overall weight loss program. I highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the very overweight","review":"I can't help but think that some of the unhappy reviews here are from people with only 5-10 pounds to shift. If you're like me, and you've got quite a bit more to lose, this is a challenging workout. The pacing is good, and I'm not hurting myself. Maybe this video is more designed for people like me, rather than people who are already in good shape. I've got 100 pounds to lose, so this workout is just right for me. Just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very hard, but a great workout","review":"Great pilates workout but definitely not for a beginner. She does amazingly challenging exercises, harder than any other pilates video I've seen. However she really needs to eat something as she is disgustingly skinny - so if that bothers you, don't get the video.

It has helped me tremendously in all other pilates videos, where this has been overlooked. However i find the excersize portion is very slow moving and uninteresting in presentation. If I had not done pilates earlier, and this was the first tape i tried I would not go back to it. But having done pilates and enjoying it, i understood some of the moves, and I find this particular work out to be especially comforting after a very stresfull day. But its not my workout of choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay if you are looking for a relaxing workout","review":"The first 10 minutes of this video are spent talking about body, mind and spirit and how we have to have balance between them to lose weight and get in shape. It also touches on breathing techniques, which are easy to figure out. I usually skip this part, but I do the warmups, which are kind of fun. The exercises are for the most part, not very challenging, but it is still a good workout if you focus on quality of movement rather than quantity.As far as the weight loss goes, it's not going to happen unless you cut calories as well. I am still waiting to see if I can lose inches without losing pounds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hard enough","review":"This workout was too short and too easy. I guess I chose badly, but it was hard to tell just how much of a workout it gave you by the description. There wasn't even a workout time on the back cover.

Oh well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not stellar","review":"After several minutes (maybe 3) of commercials you have the choice of one workout on three levels. One program shows all three levels together and the two lower levels each can be seen separately.The commercials are annoying and after paying for the DVD, they are exploitative.All the same, it is a good workout and it is not hard to progress from one level to another. The explanations and demonstrations are clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves at a snail's pace","review":"This video was utterly dull and boring. It moves way too slow. I've been working out for over 15 years and consider myself to be pretty advanced in most areas of exercise.

It's a basic, no nonsense approach and you'll definitely see results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could return the tape","review":"This tape was a total waste of money. Through the whole 60 minutes, I kept thinking this was a warm up and that we'd be getting to the challenging stuff soon. I get more exercise getting off the couch for a snack!!

I thought that one was kind of lame too but I got way more of a workout than with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SOFT","review":"It would be a good Dvd for elderly people, but I don't think that anybody is gonna loss weight with it.

NOT FOR FITNESS LOVERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"I was GREATLY disappointed in this DVD. Here's why:1. It's basically 60 minutes of warming up2. The level 3 (advanced) is not THAT HARD.3. The annoying \\"inhale, exhale\\" chant really makes it difficult to find my 'center.' I just wanted to tell her SHUT UP4. I didn't break a sweat once.5. I used it twice and never plan to use it again. I mean, c'mon, I don't want to waste 1 hour of my day on something that won't get me results.I must say the ONLY THING positive about this DVD is the landscape.In short, rent this from Blockbuster or buy it used. Don't waste any more than 5 bucks on this. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, especially if you've done pilates before","review":"I have taken pilates classes at my women's gym for about six months, and a while ago I bought this DVD in case I couldn't make classes. That was four months ago, and I have used it two times! I wish I could return it.The scenery is lovely and the instructor's positions are impressive, but she doesn't do enough repetitions to make me sweat. It didn't even feel like a warm-up--just a nap with my eyes open. My gym's beginner class is more challenging, and way more interesting.This might be a good way to introduce yourself to pilates, but when you've become better, upgrade to something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for beginners","review":"This pilates video is great. It has three different levels of difficulty and two different lengths for each level so you can start slow and build up.The moves seems easy but if done correctly they can really challenge you and create smooth muscles. I recommend this to pilates beginners and people with joint problems. It works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, repetitive, and no weight loss will occur","review":"A complete disappointment, this DVD is irritatingly repetitive as it states the 3 different positions to take based on your level of fitness for EVERY single move. This takes alot of time. Additionally, one only gets a few repetitions of every move, not enough to work the muscle.I will not do it again and do not recommend it if you are looking for a decent level of strength and toning (and I'm not that fit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expect","review":"The title is deciving at best. This was my first experience with pilates and expected it to be more of a workout. I've done the vidoe about 5 times and am already bored. It is very slow and long. None the less, its a very nice way to end your day, especially the hammock at the end. This is more of a relax tape then a workout and is great to get you ready for bed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After really enjoying increased flexibility plus a great workout from \\"The Method Pilates - All in One Workout\\" and \\"Denise Austin - Pilates For Every Body\\", I was *sure* that I would enjoy rotating them with this new one while also burning enough calories to encourage weight loss. But this DVD is so low-key I barely ever put use it anymore. After purchasing this, I bought \\"A.M. And P.M. Pilates Mat Workouts\\" and that one is fantastic for those mornings where I'm tired or short on time, and at night I make up for it with the more intense P.M. workout.So... it sounds as though people wanting purist Pilates will find this DVD welcome. But for those wanting \\"Conditioning for Weight Loss\\"... it didn't live up to that claim in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS VIDEO IS WAY TOO LONG AND BORING TO BOOT!","review":"I am 34 years old and in pretty good shape. I enjoy workout videos because it's hard for me to find time to go to the gym with young kids in the house. I bought this title because I enjoy pilates and because the video got some good reviews. Generally, I'll enjoy a workout video full time for a couple of months before becoming bored with it and moving onto something else. This video left me yawning from the getgo! Yes, the scenery is pretty, but Suzanne's voice is monotone and uninspiring. Her poses are technically correct, but after one hour (YES ONE HOUR!) of trying to figure out her unclear instructions, you won't even feel like you got a workout. I'm trying \\"Minna-Optimizer Strength and Grace\\" next. It might not be any better than Suzanne's video, but it certainly couldn't be worse. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it","review":"I started off using 30 Minute Quick Start - Pilates for Weight Loss with Ana Caban and loved her video but wanted to see if there was a similar video for those days when I have more time to devote to working out. I thought the two videos would be similar (becasue they were both pilates conditions for weight loss) but was wrong! Pilates Conditioning for Weight Loss with Suzanne Deason was okay if you are a beginner or like a great explanation for everything (over and over again!). I found that the workout was really slow because she explained everything in great detail (good for beginners). It was so slow that I was getting bored during my workout. There was long pauses between each workout because there was too much talking!!! After using this video a few times, I just wanted to workout not hear the explanation a thousand times!!! It would have a been better if there a selection in the menu for people who already previewed the video so we could just workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a workout, only for extreme beginners","review":"I found this video to be definitely not for me. I have a little experience with Pilates, so the moves were much too basic. Even if I had no experience, there is minimal cardio benefit and is mostly used for strengthening abs. Even if you're interested in strengthening your core, I would HIGHLY suggest looking for another Pilates or yoga video. The pace for this one is much too slow and I found myself waiting much too long in resting poses for the next instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring!!!!!","review":"The exercises on this video are very good but that is masked by Deason's boring presentation. I had to put all my effort into trying to stay awake! I have no doubt that any beginner viewing this workout would be totally turned off by pilates and would never try again (which is a shame, because pilates is great for toning the body and losing weight). Try Ana Caban's videos instead. She is highly energetic and makes pilates fun (and effective)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring... and won't do anything for weight loss.","review":"I did this tape once before I'd ever taken a pilates class. I found it slow, boring, and confusing. After I took a few pilates classes I returned to it to see if perhaps I'd like it better. I had to shut it off at the 40 minute mark because I was bored and unchallenged. Other than a few key moves (such as The Hundred) you could pretty much throw this tape out the window. I can't see how this tape will help you loose weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"great flow","review":"What a great program! I have taken pilates classes before, and was doubtful about following a dvd program. There is just something about being in a class with other people doing the exercise that is just different, right? Well, with this dvd, it feels similar to being in a class. The women show three different modified versions of each exercise (beginner, intermediate, advanced). What MOST impressed me about this dvd though was the FLOW. The exercises transition quickly and naturally into each other, creating a holistic feeling of connection in the body-- and that is part of the goal of pilates-- to connect all the disparate parts and achieve balance. The verbal walk-through of the moves mean that I could perform the exercise without having to crane my neck toward the tv. And she is constantly bringing awareness to which body part you should focus on to complete the exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay for relaxation but....","review":"I bought this dvd primarily for its long running time - figured it would be a good value and would be a tougher workout than some of the shorter dvds. there is a lot of good instruction but much of the time is wasted on \\"mind-body\\" connection type stuff that some people might like, but does little for conditioning. also, even the \\"advanced\\" instructor (there are three levels presented) did not present particularly challenging moves and wasted a lot of time getting into the next position. if you continue the reps while the instructor is explaining the next position, it would be an okay workout, but would definitely not lead to any cardio benefits. the scenery is very nice but the three instructors aren't particularly attractive, one of whom seemed a bit chubby - which is not very motivating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"I bought this workout hoping for some challenging exercises, and got a bunch of stretches and breathing. I did the advanced version, and was so bored I could have fallen asleep. I have trouble believing that even the most out of shape person could lose weight using this workout. I'm very disappointed, after hearing that Pilates is so popular and a great way to stay in shape, I basically burned my money buying this DVD.The weight loss claim is tatamount to false advertising, and I'm surprised that their lawyers will even let them say this anywhere on the tape, let alone in the title. Stay away from this one if you really want to get in shape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting both for beginners and for experts","review":"One of the best introductory books I've ever read about the subject.

No self-respecting woman living alone would be so careless - and not immediately call a cop friend to get some reassurance. From the parts I skimmed over, it appears Carolyn finally got her game on, except for the marriage.Since I figured out \\"who done it\\" pretty quickly, I just skipped to the end to see if the led heroine finally got her stuff together.

I took it to the local warranty service place for it, and after 3 trips, and 2 MONTHS getting parts, it worked for about a week before it blew up again. It shuts off and turns itself on randomly as if overloading, but does it even when the unit is turned off! Click click all the time every 10 minutes. I have never turned it up even to test, and never abused it. My speakers are just like-new Bose speakers that work with everything else just fine. I tried both to call and email Onkyo, but the support is NON-EXISTENT, and the wait times online are always far longer than any normal person would wait. NO response from customer support emails at all.If you want to take a chance, fine, its up to you.

I will admit I am not using this unit at it's full potential. I use it upstairs in my bedroom system, and do not have an HDTV or a direct satellite box. I am running it through a VCR which is a substitute for the satellite box. HOWEVER...Despite the primitive conditions, the receiver performs very well watching tv, and when running the DVD with an optical cable, it fills the room with sound. With the Yamaha speakers I bought to go with it, the sound is full and clear. So for right around $300, I have a system that is good now, and when I make upgrades to my equipment, I DO NOT have to buy any extra equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable piece of junk.","review":"I started having trouble with this thing two months after I bought it. It has since been repaired three times. every time I got it back from service it would work for a few months and then break again.

I have now given up on it entirely, since having it \\"repaired\\" is a waste of time and money.I'll never buy Onkyo again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"I bought this receiver for a 5.1 system using Polk audio speakers. The sound quality for music was amazing, very clean. However when I tried it on movies the rear speakers would cut in and out when the sound track would get quiet. It was very subtle at first, I had to put my ear right in the rear speakers. But it was definately noticable. I tried different speakers, different wire and several different settings but the soundtrack on the rear speakers would still cut in and out. It might have been a receiver problem another unit might have worked fine, but I returned it and ordered a Yamaha RX-V659. I would highly recommend the Yamaha, outstanding sound quality, lots of power, and many features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not support HDMI audio!!","review":"This receiver is a joke.

Even though it has the HDMI capabilities I didnt use it, just the old standard method using the audio/video cables. Everything looks and sounds great!! I found the 505 easier to use than my old Onkyo TX-SV727 instead of video 1 & video 2 etc there are DVD, CD, Cable/Sat. This makes it much easier for people other than myself to use the reciever, also if I want to use my outside speakers all I have to do is select speaker B and no further fiddling with the reciever. I'm still learning about the reciever, but I would highly recommend this model for someone who wants the high end quality that Onkyo offers at a reasonable price. I looked at the 605 but it didnt make sense to pay twice as much for a little more power and a few more features!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Reciever for the Money","review":"I looked hard and this is the best receiver for the money I could find.

I could not be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great budget receiver","review":"I got a terrific deal on this receiver and for the money, it's hard to beat. Sure, HDMI is pass-through only but if you don't need it, then that's a minor quibble - it is a budget receiver after all. Sound-wise, it's very capable. 7.1, 75 watts per channel, what more could you ask for in a sub $300 receiver? It creates a very cohesive sound field with terrific steering and a well defined low end. It's amp sections aren't as great as those found in the 705 or 805 so don't try to crank it - it will run out of steam at very high volume levels. But for what it is, it does its job well. It's not for video purists or those who like to play their music and movies at ear-deafening levels. If you have the money then I'd say go for one of the higher end models as they will be considerably more future proof. However, if you're just starting out in the world of home theater and don't need all of the bells and whistles found in other models, then this model will do just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, clean sound","review":"Great product, the sound is clean and crisp. The numerous decoding technologies are great. Having the ability to decode for 2.1, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 is awesome for present and future expandability.

As long as this unit lasts 5 years I will say you will not find a better receiver unless you drop more $$$ for the TX-SR605. Otherwise this unit will impress. Also stay away from Sony. my last 2 receivers were Sony and both failed prematurely. My last Sony was an ES line component (their uber elite series). Well about 2 weeks after the warranty expired it self destructed. Real convenient I must say. At least I payed half of what the Sony cost and got a better unit out of it. The sound out of the Onkyo is much more natural and less boomy. Go Onkyo.

If you can only pass HD video thru the HDMI cable and no audio (because it's ONLY passed through a component cable) the whole concept of this receiver is pointless. Any other signal not input at HDMI port will NOT go thru the HDMI cable to the TV. Hence, every other non-HD product must be wired to the TV separately. I sent the \\"boys\\" to CC to get theSony STRDG720 7.1 Audio Video Receiver - Blackwhich I had already researched as having all the features we need. When they came in with this Onkyo, I didn't much care about the switch because the prices were the same, until I realized the receiver's limitations. Needless to say, they were back at CC to exchange in less than an hour. Now, the 720 model will not upconvert, but we don't need it.

I didn't know it was a 250-page book about his personal love of soccer (or football). Hornby's English. There are a lot of football fans in England. If I lived in England, I'd be a football nut too. But reading this book was like listening to steeplechase nuts recount the best races they'd ever witnessed. I was hoping it might turn into an examination of the global fanaticism surrounding the sport, but it became a very personal description of Hornby's love affair with the game, and I was more fascinated by why someone would write a game-by-game description of twenty-year-old soccer seasons. Hornby's a good writer, but I'd recommend this only to someone who really really really loves soccer."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for soccer-addicts","review":"I didn't finish this book.

Seeing how there are about a hundred Amazonians who gave this book a glowing review, you'll probably never get to this little warning, but that's what I'm giving you. I know everyone reading the book can relate to being a fan of a longtime losing team, it doesn't just have to be Arsenal it could be the Cubs or the Red Sox or any team that you really have a passion for... so? The problem with this book is unless you are a soccer fan or English or (God help you) both, then the book just doesn't make it. It's an autobiograph about a soccer (that's right soccer not football) fan. That's it, end of story. Not \\"tears-running-down-your-face funny\\" as GQ's review on cover promised. Not even that good ultra-violence that's in other soccer books. So me druggies, don't viddy-well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for sports fans, not just soccer (footy) fans","review":"This is without a doubt the best book on football (soccer) that I have ever read. It is also the best book dealing with sports that I have ever read. It describes like no other book I have read what it means to be a fan.Although this book follows the life of an Arsenal supporter, anyone can read it, because Hornby's experiences are no different than those of any committed, \\"obsessed\\" football fan. I am a Leeds supporter, and much of what Hornby said described what I feel, so perfectly. I especially liked the part when he went on about wanting to switch allegiances if he could, but found out that he couldn't because he was too emotionally tied to Arsenal. No matter how poorly they played, or how frustrated they made him feel, he still supported the club. I've felt the same way about Leeds on many an occasion.A great book about life, not just about football."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned! This book is not as accessible as his later work","review":"Just a quick, simple warning to potential buyers who liked \\"High Fidelity\\" and/or \\"About A Boy\\": \\"Fever Pitch\\" is not quite in the same vein. It's a fine book on footie--and is the perfect gift for any Arsenal fan--but the book should more accurately be titled \\"Literary Journal of an Arsenal Fan.\\" Each mini-chapter is catalogued by a specific Arsenal match (score, date, and pitch), and although there're some autobiographical vignettes about life/love, these are few and far between amidst pages and pages of discussion about Arsenal -- the team, its players, its matches, its history. In short, and I submit this review only to distinguish this book from Hornby's later stuff (and because I saw it being touted on the Amazon splashpage): \\"Fever Pitch\\" is not fiction, and there's not much of a plot. And unless you're already a moderate football fan, you're gonna' be bored and disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD DEPICTION OF SOCCER ADDICTION, NOT MUCH FOR THE NON FAN","review":"This book offers a very good image of the extremes that fans go to for their addiction when it ocmes to soccer. As a soccer fan, I can see a glimpse of myself in the pages, though I am not as radical as the author ever was.There is much insight into the feelings of soccer fans and their way of thinking. Particularly interesting and true is the feeling that only those that follow the team through the bad times should be allowed to cheer in the good times. Very true in myself included, I am afraid.However, given the deep focus on soccer, there is not much there for the non soccer fan. Even being a soccer fan, one needs to be quite familiar with English teams and the championships they play in order to fully follow the author. The book have benefitted from an explanatory appendix, but then again, true fans wouldn't need and might find it offensive if there were one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"The only thing keeping me from giving this book 5 stars is my own complete lack of interest in anything soccer-related. Take that personal bias out, and its a great read. The insight into the soccer culture in the UK is frankly frightening, but in a very funny way. Having lived through the Denver Bronco Super-Bowl failures of the 1980's as a kid, I empathized with Hornby as he details his own irrational emotions growing up as a fan.I think anyone, sports fan or not, will enjoy this book. Sports fans because they empathize, non-fans because it will help explain the mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it and you'll get it, even if you don't get it now.","review":"Get it and you'll get it, even if you don't get it now.That sums up the book... I am 1/3 of the way done and the only thing i can say is, I think I know what it's like -- Leaf fans (NHL) will be able to relate to the sad tale of Arsenal as a football club. In fact their failures and now recent success as a club mirrors the Leafs hockey tragedy and rise to respectability quite nicely.I really wasn't looking for a comparison tale when I picked up this book, but in the end I kept saying... yeah, i remember doing something like that, feeling like that or giving up like that (for ten minutes...)The book is not about football... it's about, as the author says, the consumption of football by an obsessed fan and how everything in life can relate to football. So get it and you'll get it, even if you don't get it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny or interesting","review":"\\"High Fidelity\\" was very funny and at times thought provoking. This novel was a big disappointment. I am not a sports fan in any way (although I was at the age of 10). Perhaps you need to be a sports fan (and Anglophile?) to appreciate this. I found the book excruciatingly trivial. Don't look to \\"Fever Pitch\\" for insight into \\"fandom\\" either. The theme of arrested male development is dealt with much more effectively in \\"High Fidelity\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful: another Hornby winner","review":"I pretty much hate all forms of football. The fact that I read a book about football (to the British, that is: the rest of the world calls it soccer) from cover to cover, smirking, chuckling and at times laughing out loud, attests, once again, to the talent of Nick Hornby as a wordsmith. This book is witty and clever, incredibly insightful about obsession and definitely worth a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for non-soccer-fans","review":"I bought this book hoping it would be an undiscovered gem by the writer who gave us About A Boy and High Fidelity. I am a late-middle-aged American with no particular interest in British football. The book is, at heart, an autobiography of Mr. Hornby as an obsessive football (soccer) fan growing up in the London area, and, in terms of word count, the emphasis is decidedly on \\"football\\" over \\"autobiography\\".While there were nuggets of self-revelation, there was much more of cavilling over the performance minutiae of players in whom I have no interest. And not football players in general, but-primarily- players for Arsenal, which I presume to be based in or near London. Who cares? I was much more intrigued by Among the Thugs, which at least had some visceral violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best football fan book ever","review":"This is an excellent book. Nick Hornby's wit is one of the best I have ever come across. I had read this book like 10 years ago, and wanted to re-read. It still doesn't cease to make me laugh at the humorous comparisons between Nick's personal life and his obsession with Arsenal. This is a must read if you are a hardcore fan of any football club, think football is not just a game, and more so if you, like me, are a Gooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very clever","review":"I am a woman who has no interest in football whatsoever...the American version of the European version. However, I've heard great things about this book and am very glad I read it. Nick Hornby is a great writer, and the construction of this autobiography is nothing short of brilliant. Hornby weaves his life story into a tale about his obsession with football, which is actually a huge part of his life story because he is just THAT OBSESSED. The writing is wonderful, and even though I did start to lose interest in all the football history after a while, the fantastic prose kept me turning the pages. I'm sure anyone who is even remotely interested in football/soccer will absolutely adore this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Not just a sports book, probably one of the best books I have ever read.

The people who run big teams, like the NY Yankees, or big companies, like Nike, need to understand the way fans think. I've seen how the prepackaging of sports here in the United States has sucked out much of the joy this book celebrates. In the end, sports aren't merely entertainment, they are tribal rituals and religous ceremonies. I especially liked Hornby's description of promotion and relegation in soccer. This is a system that should be employed in all professional sports. I am passing this book around to my friends now, so that they can begin to understand why it does matter that Chelsea not only win the ultimate Cup Winners Cup, the League this year, and as of this writing possibly the Double."},{"rating":"2","title":"a review from an unlikely reader","review":"I am a girl. An American girl. An American not-sportsy-in-any-way girl. So, to say that this book was not written for me is a bit of an understatement. Why in hell did I read it then? Because Nick Hornby wrote it. And I enjoyed it. Sure, it was interesting to get a glimpse into the footballing culture, but more so was his fascinating portrayal and dissection of obsession. His description of what it means to be a fan of something, is, sure hilarious, but it also strikes deeply into the core of this nerdy girl who waited in line, in costume, for six hours, for a film of guys wielding laser swords. Obsession/fandom becomes part of one's life, for better or for worse, guides us, builds our relationships, build us. And Hornby describes it perfectly and with affection and criticism. Grade: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Fanatic","review":"Nick Hornby is not embarrassed to be identified as a fanatic, as he proves in this semi-fictional autobiography about his obsession with the football club Arsenal. Throughout the novel, Hornby examines how the significant events and relationships in his life relate directly to Arsenal games he has attended. He attends his first game with his father shortly after his parents divorced, he knew he was in love the first time when he was able to share his team with a woman, and he buys season tickets at the same time his life starts settling down in his twenties. It is a very funny book and I learned a lot about soccer and obsession, but it also made me feel okay about my own personal obsessive tendencies, which pale in comparison to those of the main character. It isn't a difficult or long read so I would suggest it to anyone who just wants to read an enjoyable book, even if they don't care a bit about soccer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impeccible!","review":"Nick Hornby tells his life story through Fever Pitch, but the emotions and struggles he describes will undoubtedly resonate with many a male reader. We learn all we need to know about English soccer, the Premier League, the Arsenal Football Club, and, most of all, Nick Hornby, in its pages. The narration is filled with charm and I believe this work is far superior to everything that he wrote afterwards (even though I loved \\"High Fidelity\\" and liked \\"About a Boy\\"). His subtitles are hilarious (Wembley II: The Nightmare Continues) and his vignettes are riveting. The author's coherent weaving of sport into the larger tapestry of life is something that only a very abstract mind could have accomplished. I sometimes get out the section on the Arsenal footballer, Gus Ceasar, and read it aloud to whoever will listen as it sums up the fact that outside of athletic competition, few incompetent individuals are ever discovered or found out. I loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully, painfully boring","review":"This book was extremely pointless. Since each entry is a memory, they are written like them so they don't have an insteresting story-telling narrative. Also, some of the entries were just how the game was played and who won, with absolutely nothing interesting to say. And that for 300 pages, completely redundant. This book has no beginning, middle, or end. Just entry after entry of complete pointlessness. Now, it may be because I am not interested in sports, but this is just a football (soccor) journal and nothing more. Hornby was able to shove in a little bit of angst and childhood problems, but it is not nearly significant enough to keep the reader interested.Though the book had some very funny parts, it doesn't make up for the ennui I experienced while reading this book. You know, they made a movie out a this.....HOW?!! It barely works as a piece of fiction or reference book...but a movie?! Jesus. I'm sorry but this was one of the most boring books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Lit it ain't!","review":"I love Nick Hornby. I loved the movie Fever Pitch. I was more than prepared to love this book. I'm a woman. I think that's why this book was the most unbelievably boring book I'd read this year. Read anything else he wrote. Remember the the movies are always very loosely based on his books, but they're usually great reads in their own rights, just don't read this one. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk","review":"After ten minutes of reading this drivel I was compelled to return to a programming manual, this proving far more stimulating.The fact that people watch soccer (let alone read about it) leaves me cold about the future of our race. The ranting of a cockney hooligan may impress some people but what has that acheived for british society?? Hornby's witt is completely wasted on me and to be honest I was lost after the first chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fever Pitch","review":"My new favourite book. Well written and very amusing, it is The book about football, although I have given it to a friend who isn't into football and she enjoyed it enormously. Definitely a Must Read for football fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for footy/soccer fans","review":"Shannon's husband Josh writes: Fever Pitch is one of the greatest books ever written for the sports fan. Regardless of how you feel about English football (soccer), any fan of any team will relate to Hornby's feelings. This is especially true if you support a team that hasn't won a championship in a long time. I sometimes wonder if I should curse this book for what it's done to my free time. I was an Arsenal supporter before I read it, but I've now fallen into the true pit of fanatic. I wear the shirts, tape and watch games at absurd hours, listen to internet radio broadcasts, etc. Other Arsenal fans only nod and grin knowingly when I tell them about this. Fever Pitch is brilliant writing that you can feel and relate to. Who knows, you might wake up the sleeping Gunner fan inside you too. Don't worry though; they've evolved into a much better team since this was written.**Edited to correct misusage of the word \\"penultimate.\\"**"},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"This film was great!

I've read the book many times. Overall, I really liked the movie. No Academy Award winner but it kept my interest. I will watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"This movie does not deserve to be overlooked. The casting is excellent and the story chilling. A young boy who is experimenting with the evil within himself -- as many adolescents do, dabbling in cruelty and self-destruction with no intention of taking any final steps -- chooses as his victim a former Nazi officer who is an expert at cat-and-mouse games, and at cultivating evil... The boy's life is forever changed as a result. Not to be missed. Read the novella, too, from Different Seasons. Different endings, both very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"DILATED PUPIL","review":"Buoyed by the marvelous performances of Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro, APT PUPIL, Stephen King's expose on the horrors of the Holocaust, manages to entertain and provoke thoughts of this horrible blight on mankind.However, at the heart, I couldn't understand Renfro's obsession with the Holocaust, nor really understand where his cold heart came from. His cruelty in humiliating McKellen during the infamous uniform/march scene, is totally despicable in showing Renfro's callousness. Everything points to the fact that despite McKellen's evil, Renfro's is even worse in that he chooses it for pleasure, rather than the distorted duty of a Nazi soldier.The movie seems a little long at times, but director Bryan Singer keeps things interesting and his evocation of the above mentioned performances, is to his obvious credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apt Pupik","review":"I LOVED the book. The movie did not, unfortunately, include as much detail as the book. Todd's transformation could have been a little more dramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor adaption of a great story","review":"As usual, it seems like the director never reads the book. We all rented this and were disappointed up to the end. Where was the famous scene where the boy shoots at passing cars on the highway?

Then it drags out longer than is really justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling psychological thriller","review":"Apt Pupil is a thrilling movie that juxtaposes suburban life with the evil and corruption of a Nazi war criminal. The two leads are excellent actors. Brad Renfro plays a high school student who blackmails a Nazi war criminal (the outstanding Ian McKellen) into telling him everything (the who, the why, the where) of his crimes against humanity.Of course, life can't be as simple as that, and a high school student isn't going to get the upper hand on a masterful, depraved man. The two men form a fascinating friendship, countered by their opposing viewpoints on history. Apt Pupil delivers some brilliant twists in which each man must determine his own destiny.This is hands down the best adaptation of a Stephen King plotline. Don't miss out on this gem of a movie. If you enjoy this, try American History X."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Well today I am going to tell you story about an old man..\\"","review":"This movie was not a horror movie like the preview might stimulate it as being but it is more of a dark drama, until the middle when it starts going into the thriller genre. This movie was as good as it was because of one person, Ian Mckellen. He made the movie and put on a chilling performance as the Neighbor Nazi. The movie's ending I didnt expect it, but it did not have the huge twist like Usual Suspects, Singer's other movie, but I still thought it was neat. Overall for six dollars i felt that this movie was sure worth the price and i would have payed ten to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is sad, sad, sad...","review":"This movie is anything but \\"gripping\\". At the end of the film, David Schwimmer's character is pathetically weak. Sticking needles in my eyes would be more fun than watching this movie ever again. Unbelievable story and unbelievably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing; this movie is a sleeper.","review":"I dosed off several times while watching the movie. Even the parts I saw made me drowsy. The movie wasn't moving enough to keep my interest. Throughout the film, I kept expecting something exciting or at least interesting to happen, to no avail. One of the worst movies that I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to stop watching this movie early on!","review":"Someone recommended this book. I am wondering about him for doing that. I guess our society has just gotten so used to watching sick, sadisitic things in the media that it doesn't seem that awful. But to someone who doesn't watch t.v. any more & almost never will watch an R movie (big mistake to break that rule) it was that awful. To me it had a sadistic feel to it. I think watching things like this, which presumably are to help one be more enlightened, can actually just be desensitizing people to sufferings of others - & animals too, not to mention inspiring an increase in sadistic behaviors. I would give zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Marks for Apt Pupil","review":"Poorly directed, written, and edited. This is about as suspenseful as an Easter Sunday sermon.

You have to be happy people, this film is way too dark and evil. How can anybody like horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to my intelligence","review":"This was without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot revolves around a cartoonish elderly Nazi who gets his thrills by trying to gas neighborhood cats in his kitchen oven. That isn't even the most proposterous aspect of the movie. I bought this DVD on sale ...and I'm disgusted that I even contributed that much to the makers of this film. If you're into hateful, juvenile propaganda, this film is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Psycho Game of S&M","review":"A boy afraid of his own sexuality finds out a secret about his neighbor and turns it into a psychological power struggle. In this case, the guy is a nazi -- but in this film, he could have been a plain-old serial killer or child molester ... anything.Leveraged secrets allow an intense psycho-sexual game of S&M; throughout this pic. Witness the ending where the boy makes threats to another with the one thing he is most afraid of. (...)Twisted and intensly acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bone - chilling thriller","review":"I, being a Brad Renfro fan (obsessor), was overly -impressed by this wonderful movie.

This movie, even on it's own, still didn't give me chills, much less when compared to the book. I guess I expected a LOT more from the director of a classic like The Usual Suspects. This movie was 2 hours I'll never get back, and for that I'm saddened."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near as good as King's story.","review":"I read King's novella \\"Apt Pupil\\" about 5 years ago, and I thought it was the best King writing I had ever read up to that point. When I heard about the movie I was very anxious to see it. I was very dissapointed. This movie does a great job of following the storyline until about halfway through the movie, then they just left out too much stuff for me.

However this movie falls far short of expectations. Between pitiful acting, poor direction and a horrible screenwriting adaptation it is hard to tell where this went so wrong but a combination of all those factors doom this from the start. Ian McKellan wrangles as much from the script as possible, but Renfro never fails to bring down every scene he's in. Fans of the written story wanting to see the film version will feel cheated. Those experiencing only the film version will never know how deeply disturbing the written story was. And that should be considered a crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apt Pupil","review":"I got this through an Amazon approved seller, Movie Mars. It doesn't play.

In Apt Pupil you never understand why the main character Tod Bodine doesn't turn the old nazi in. Because he Wanted to know what it was realy like? give me a break!

Renfro is questionable as the young all American kidd turned into a vicious little bastard, but it's such a delight to watch Ian McKellan play the Nazi in hiding, giving one of his best performances for sure.

Penchansky also treats Genesis 3, a much more familiar text. In each case, Penchansky squarely faces up to the dark and disturbing images of God portrayed by these texts. He handles these texts with literary skill, theological acumen, and socio-historical imagination. Anyone who is interested in the Hebrew Bible's portrayals of God should read this book. It doesn't tell the whole story (and Penchansky doesn't pretend that it does), but it engages certain biblical ways of imaging God that are often neglected by readers nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"I have had this watch for a couple of years and I love it!I wear it every day and love the display.

His music played a big role in the first movie's success, so it is no surprise that the second movie, which hired Alan Silvestri to compose the score, fails in terms of generating emotion through the music. Silvestri is a wonderful score composer, but this score fails to bring much to the overall film."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A fun soundtrack\\"","review":"For being a fun movie, this is a fun soundtrack.

Alan Silvestri is known for his pairings with Robert Zemeckis, and great music has come from combining the two, and even though this score does fall short of his usual work, its great. The choir is amazing, and it had to have an Arabic feel to it with the finger bells and crashing percussion. Alan Silvestri is a musical genius and it has shone through again in this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic score.","review":"A great action score with memorable themes, though track 18 (The Mummy Returns) should've been replaced with different music.

Other than that, the score is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good, but can it compare with the first?","review":"I loved the first soundtrack. The fast action music, the eerie Imhotep themes, the romatic love themes, they were all good. Yet, I felt a little disappointed when I bought this soundtrack. I tried to sit and listen to it, to remember the scenes and where each track fit it, but I found it was not quite on the same level as The Mummy soundtrack.

I really liked the merging of the modern world with the mystical characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the audio sample","review":"This album starts out pleasantly enough, much like the online audio sample which I found to be similar to a small collection of actual wind chimes in a light breeze. After the first couple of minutes, though, the recording becomes somewhat choppy and contrived, with occasional \\"gongs\\" that are jarring and carry considerable sound distortion. On the upside, this album is all chimes, and chimes without music or other sounds such as babbling brooks, rain, etc. are hard to find. While I don't hate it, it does make me want to splice the good parts together and discard the 70% percent or so where the chimes are clearly being played (and rather poorly) by human hands rather than by the wind. If you must have it, I suggest downloading the mp3 version for less than a third of the price of this surprisingly pricey CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I like most environmental CDs but not this one.

Bogdanos right hand man featured in this book, Senior Master Sergeant Roberto Pineiro. I remember Bobby emailing me when he was there, but not giving me any details since his mission was classified at the time. I can truthfully tell you that this is an accurate story.Many war stories are written by some guy in a Malibu beach house who grew up watching too much TV. Col. Bogdanos has given us the spellbinding true story of what life was like in Baghdad during that phase of the war. I can't wait for the movie. This is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing treatment of an important topic","review":"The pomposity of this author is nearly unbelievable until one actually hears him present his story in person. The book, though interesting in scope, drips disgustingly with what is obviously an unresolved Napoleon complex of unprecedented magnitude. At under five feet tall, the diminutive Bogdanos constantly reminds his audience that he's a \\"Marine Corps Colonel\\" and a \\"Middle-weight boxer\\" as if it will lend credibility to his stature. Rather than comporting himself as an officer and a gentleman, Bogdanos blusters his way through his presentation in an angry Mickey Rooney-esque plea for relevance. The book is merely a printed version of the same. I could not be more disappointed in this book or its author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first chapter, then quit.","review":"The first chapter is a teaser to get you to read the rest of the book. One expects to find out who the culprits were and the evidence showing this, but one will be disappointed. The book is really an autobiography, concentrating on Bogdanos's time in Afghanistan and Iraq. One learns a lot about process, how wonderful certain people were, his philosophy, his love of family and what he thinks of people in the art world. One does not learn who the thieves were, even though enough evidence from the crime scenes would appear to have been collected (but was it?).The book appears to have been written to correct much completely incorrect publicity that appeared in the press after the looting of the Iraqi museum. I am unable to tell how much of this is valid and how much is deliberate spin.I did not enjoy his telling me how wonderful all the American military people were, but I suppose that is to be expected of an American.Read the first chapter, and then quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Downhill FAST","review":"I don't know what happened to the quality of videos at Living Arts. The pilates series is really way below standard-- compared to the yoga videos. I have the beginning mat series with Ana and I returned both of them because of the inadequate instruction and low quality production. READ THE REVIEWS for these other videos before buying this one! Don't be fooled like me. Some other pilates videos I would recommend are Denise Austin's Pilates for Every Body, Suzanne Deason's pilates for weight loss (ignore the title, it is more challenging and complete then the ones by Ana-- and gives me some hope for Living Arts). Honestly speaking though to get a total body workout that brings together mind and body stick with yoga-- it's as good as it gets. Pilates is good if you use the machines, on the mat it basically touches on portions of what yoga covers more completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for friends of Gen.

When I heard about this book, \\"The Lightning Mule Brigade\\" I immediately had to have it because I knew that NBF was involved in deterring Streight's Raid into Alabama.

Mistaking a simple seamstress for his half-sister, he kidnaps her in hopes of exchanging her for one of his own captured men. The romantic tension between Nathaniel and Alexandra practically leaps off the page as both try to reject each other's charms. Of course, it's futile! A stirring romance, with compelling characters and tremendous intrigue. I simply couldn't put this one down! An amazing debut from Brenda Novak!

Overall grade: B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as dishwater","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. What first lured me to it was the glowing reviews given by others, but unfortunately, the book couldn't live up to expectations. I found the characters irritating! The \\"hero\\"'s love for the heroine stemmed more from his lust rather than any stronger emotion. Thus, there was no basis for true love. All in all, this novel lacks the ability to entrall readers, and the \\"throw everything at us poor readers\\" method of plotting drove me crazy. Oh well. Maybe it was just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, maybe 2 and a half stars.","review":"Detail = excellent . . . Characters = disappointing . . . Prose = so so . . . Plot = overdone . . . Love scenes = were there any? Did I miss them?The love story between Nathaniel and Alexandra got lost in the midst of all the plot. So many things happened to these two that it was almost ridiculous. A very dark and depressing book. I didn't leave with a feeling that these two were meant for each other, that they _had_ to be together. This one goes to the UBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't finish........possible spoilers","review":"I'm VERY glad this book was free on my Kindle. I only made it 38% through.

The story captured my imagination right from the riveting beginning and held me in thrall until the last page.

Though, I have to give her credit for flawlessly shedding her foreign accent to play this role.3) The \\"Power Rangers theme\\" that I described earlier, is getting old.4) In a future season (I forget which one), Chuck has the chance to 'lose the intersect' and go back to having a normal life. To boost ratings and keep people interested, the network decided to keep him going; big mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required watching for Geeks and Nerds everywhere","review":"The five seasons of Chuck are definitely worth your time.

These songs are hypnotic and induce a twirl from anyone!! I highly recommend that the reviews be ignored, and, if you are a new Nicks fan, take a look at this before seom fo her later works.Take a look at this record--it's worth the money and the time.

Instead he was a hard working law man who had to be gotten out of the way for the new men from the east to take over. This book is a simple rehash of the tired old myths and fictions from Dimsdale and Langford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual level","review":"This CD was a disappointment in many ways. First, the material was just not as funny as his later stuff. Aside from his material about Marion Barry, the jokes were sustandard. Secondly, the mixing on this album was terrible and I had to turn the volume way up on my stereo so I could make out what exactly Rock was saying. Rock was also mumbling a lot, which made it even harder to understand him. He seemed to lack the confidence that he displays on his later albums. If you are a die-hard Chris Rock fan, the get this. Otherwise, just stick to his later stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appreciate Valkyrie","review":"I saw this movie on T.V. and thought what a great soundtrack, I've got to have it.

Well you get the idea.. It was a compilation of the most boring early 50's music with a couple of less than stellar motown non-hits. One Clapton tune.

It has realistic sounding storms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much rain, not enough thunder","review":"Was looking for more thunder. Very few thunder claps. The S/N was also very poor, so you have to turn the volume way up to hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get rid of the birds!!","review":"I should have believed the other reviewers, the bird sounds are HORRIBLE. Which is really a shame because they did a nice job with the thunder and rain. But the birds make me want to pull my brain out after a few tracks. I guess if you LOVE birds chirping in the rain constantly and not really sounding real then this is for you. Otherwise, move on. I'll be donating this to my local library's used book shop with a note of warning on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Rainstorm, But Bird Is Too Noisy!","review":"I should have taken the advice of the other reviews. The thunder and rain sounds great, but it is ruined by that annoying little bird! Although I enjoy the sounds of birds, the particular bird here is obnoxious. It repeats the same high pitch sound over and over again and it's very distracting. I would be willing to overlook, if it was only 3 or 5 minutes, but it chirps for the entire 60 minutes! I'm going to search for another CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought this to help my insomnia, and I listen to it every night to go to sleep. It goes from loud thunderstoms to light rain, lasting about sixty minutes long.

There was only one reviewer that didn't like it because of the yakking background bird. Other reviewers even contradicted the yakking bird review by stating that there was no annoying background bird noises. They must have received a different CD than the one that was delivered to my house. I tried really hard to block out the yakking bird, but just could not. It wasn't even a pleasant bird sound, just chirp, chirp, chirp, like it was trying to say \\"Get away from my nest\\". Distracted me so much I threw the CD away. Don't buy this CD if you're expecting to relax. I wish I could give it a negative five stars to balance out the great rating it received from others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive bird with thunderstorm background","review":"This CD, (like the bird on it should of) took a major flight into the trash can.

Having grown up in the midwest, not a rain forest, a screeching bird in the background is not something I associate with a \\"good old-fashioned thunderstorm\\".

Sigh...back to searching for an authentic thundering rainstorm CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had listened to the reviewer from Boise...","review":"Just recieved this a couple of days ago and, like the reviewer from Atlanta, was very disappointed to hear an annoying bird chirping in the background! I also tried to tune it out but wasn't able to. This CD is supposed to help you relax and all I could think about was blasting that darn bird! There has to be two versions of this CD and this is the one with a yakking bird on it. I even bought 2, one for me and one for a gift. What a disappointment. Save your $2.50."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bird Ruins It","review":"I should have listened to the other reviews about the bird. It totally ruined this thunderstorm.

I made the mistake of wanting to download the MP3. Apparently Amazon SAYS you can get an MP3, but you have to install their Cloud Player and save your purchased MP3 on their system and access it while connected to the internet. All I wanted was the MP3 and I wanted to play it on a system in a remote location that is NOT connected to the internet. So, I guess I spent the money and no MP3. Won't do THAT again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great white noise for stressful work environment","review":"if the volume of the recording had been a little more consistant I would have given this a 5.

What I want is something that provides a level of non-intrusive white noise and keeps out the normal thuds, thumps, creaks and groans of the house.This one does all that, but much more. The thunder and rain sounds are really relaxing and de-stressing. Everyone loves a good thunderstorm to clear the air, and you can play this one whenever you need to chill out a bit. Close your eyes, listen to the rain and you begin to feel the cooling breeze.Top recommendation for this one. And as with all the eclipse recordings - how can you go wrong at that price?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Storm.","review":"Having grown up with thunderstorms in Africa, I have missed not experiencing any here in N.California.

Over 12 years ago, I attended the Literature Project and the Writing Project in San Diego and learned many strategies for teaching my students to engage in reading and use writing in powerful ways. This book, written by Kelly Gallagher, a teacher leader in both those projects, moves everything I learned one step further. It emphasizes critical thinking when students read anything: from the symbolism and metaphors used in classical literature, to the bias used in journalism, and even to the propaganda techniques used in advertisements. It also emphasizes collaboration and truly thoughtful reflection, like asking oneself \\"What is left unsaid?\\" I believe we need more critical thinkers in our world and, if you open the pages of this book, you will find numerous practical ways to turn your students into people who think for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile with reservation","review":"I teach reading and writing from 6th to 12th grade. I found this book to be a good reference for teacing reading and writing and particularly the teaching of layers of meaning and understanding. However, after reading it for the fourth or fifth time I asked myself how much fluff, or unnecessary material, could I take out and still retain the things that really mattered. I was able to tear out about 1/6th of the book that was really unnecessary. This rendered a good book much better. Nevertheless I highly suggest reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource!","review":"I was so surprised at the number of ideas in this book that could be adapted to the lower grades! Gallagher is such a gifted writer--this would be an enlightening read for anyone involved in teaching and motivating young readers. I loved the idea of second-draft reading! Students have the idea that once is enough and this is far from beneficial if we want readers to extract deeper meaning. He includes student samples along with many lesson ideas. There are even some activities for the reader to do to get an actual feel what you will be asking your students will do. He shows the difference between assigning and teaching. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but difficult","review":"I consider myself an intermediate-beginner guitar. I can read music well and I have been playing for about 6 months now. I am able to play all the songs in the Hal Leonard Guitar Method Books 1, 2 and 3, but This book is pretty difficult for me. It will take a good amount of practice to get down just a few songs.

If you have ever felt the sensation of happiness, longing, lust, or even true love for that matter. . . buy this movie. If you have ever dealt with the feelings of being outcast from society, or just simply misunderstood. . . see this movie. If you still can't decide if this is the movie for you, then by all means try your best to watch this wonderful movie on cable before you come back here to buy it. . .just as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving to The Extremes","review":"I saw this movie when it was first released at the movies here in Australia, and was instantly brought to tears for the first time in my life.

You will never forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, could have run a bit longer","review":"This is actually Joseph Conrad's AMY FOSTER, retitled for the film. Well acted, well filmed, good sets. However, it lacks a little something compared to the written version, and I think a a bit more character development would have improved the film. Don't view this if you are upset by sad endings, or a character coming to a sad end."},{"rating":"2","title":"tragedy even touches 'the lucky ones.'","review":"Unlike Mr. Maltin, I did not find this movie 'sluggish' in the least! Perhaps by todays standards it is, what without buildings exploding every other scene....or fast action car races and deadly swift thrill kill rides.In spite the 'sluggish' pace of the movie, I found it profoundly moving. (No pun intended of course) I am a romantic though. I couldn't help but feel empathy toward the young Amy Foster, outcast and object of derision. Amy with her treasures from the sea. The love story is sweet, with a bitter twist. Tragedy even touches 'the lucky ones'.Beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted, this movie is definately worth any romantics time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Film","review":"\\"Swept From the Sea\\" goes beyond being a love story. It shows the plight of two very human individuals, who, luckily, find love from each other amidst the prejudice and scorn of their surrounding society. Newcomer Rachel Weisz plays Conrad's Amy Foster extremely well with a needed unearthly quality. Perez is near brilliance in his portrayl of Russian shipwreck survivor, Yanko. With his character's language barrier-- limited to only his expressions and gutteral delivery, Perez gives a heartwrenching performance. The film captures the Irish countryside in its amazing cinematography. It's an instant classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd","review":"It is not what I expected. The story is rather strange and it is not something I would want to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Be There","review":"Although I didn't find this entire CD that great, the song \\"I'll Be There\\" is woth 5+ stars. This song hit the top 40 years ago, then dropped off the face of the earth. I never knew who the artist was, or the name of the song. I called every radio station in the Chicagoland area, and visited very reputable music stores and sang it for them, and still no one knew. After searching for probably over 5 years, I FINALLY found out who sang it. This song is the most touching song I have ever heard. For anyone who has lost someone - You will be able to relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'll Be There\\" alone makes the entire CD worth buying","review":"I've loved the song \\"I'll Be There\\" since I was 10 years old. It moved me the first time I heard it, and 9 years later, it still moves me. It's just a truly powerful song. The rest of the songs are good enough, but just this one song makes buying the whole CD worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEX, DOLLARS & ESCAPISM","review":"This is the follow-up to their 1988 hit album Wild Wild West. The Escape Club produce a dance-friendly blend of rock that incorporates elements of funk, reggae and house music. Lots of great songs here, like I'll Be There, Call It Poison, So Fashionable (a wry comment on the empty lives of models), Freedom (catchy as catch can), and Sugar Man (a dead ringer for Lou Reed at his peak). Intelligent lyrics, hearty hooks and tight playing. Snap it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD has something for everybody!!!","review":"My Sister was killed recently in a fire explosion; and it seems that listening to \\" I'll be there \\" is the only thing that makes me feel better.

It's definately my all-time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most heartfelt songs I've heard.","review":"The song 'I'll be there', by the Escape Club, is one of the most touching and heartfelt songs I have heard. Whenever someone I know passes on into the next life, or when I think of someone I have lost, I listen to this song and it lifts up my spirits and somehow lets me know that they are ok.

The original pan still is functional and I use it every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Base of the pan is too small. (somewhere between 5 and 6 inches)","review":"It's hard to tell what the width of the pan's base will be by looking at the picture. It would be useful for the product description to specify the base width.The base of the pan was much smaller than we expected; somewhere between 5 and 6 inches. It's much smaller than other 8 inch pans we have. The pan is also deeper than we expected, which might explain why the base is so small. We intended to use the pan for pancakes and omelets, but its just to small for that job. We're sending the pan back in exchange for the 10 inch pan. Unfortunately, we'll lose the shipping on the return. Hopefully this review will help someone else avoid the same mishap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this pan about a month ago after doing a lot of research, and I am very happy with it. It really does not stick if you follow the directions and spray with pan before allowing it to sufficiently preheat, probably 2-3 minutes. As a general rule, I watch it closely and as soon as it starts steaming a little I'll add the food. I fry eggs in it every morning and they slide right out just as sexy as can be. :) My only complaint is that it does not come with a lid, which is something that was not made apparent to me when I ordered. Thankfully, I've kept the lids from all my crappy non-stick skillets and pots that have long since been scratched and gone in the trashcan, and they seem to fit fine. I do hand-wash mine to keep it shiny and beautiful, and it cleans up super easy. I've since bought the 11 inch pan to match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro Quality, Budget Pricing","review":"I've become more and more impressed with PDP products with every piece of hardware I use.This pedal is no exception. I received this pedal yesterday, and I set it up with NO adjustments to test it out. Right out of the box the feel is amazing.

I love most all the songs on this CD but I think my favorites are 1) Psycho Love - a whole lot of fun and strangeness; 2) Creepshow - girl kicks boy in the teeth, is she trying to tell him something?? and 3) Wasted Time - a best friend sinks into the deadliness of drugs while those that love him watch - devastating!Solid second effort from the guys - can't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, for every generation","review":"I'm a 15 year old girl.

The discovery of classic metal music was a thrilling experience. None of my friends listened to this music, so on my own I decided to buy some CDs. My first choice? Slave to the Grind.And what a choice it was. It's like a shock to your system, listening to this CD. With great guitar playing and insane vocal talent, it's impossible not to feel the music intensely.

Yet in this encyclopedia, it is impossible to find these components without having memorized the main dish's title.The pictures are wonderful.

The book was not quite the 'exhaustive compendium' I had expected. It is not a Larousse Gastronomique of cooking, but it is an excellent reference and inspiration guide. One of the problems is that many of the ingredients are not readily available in most parts of the United States. That should not stop a good professional or advanced amateur from modifying the recipe with local fresh ingredients in mind.The book is short on instructions.

I hear that pain and affirm that there is an audience willing to see a quality film on that subject.

Actors would start their lines one second too late. There weren't enough microphones on set, so even if you turn your TV volume up, you may not hear some of what is said. Hard economic times is supposed to explain why the main character's house and place of work barely have any furniture in them.

Soon upon arrival, she seduces her brother's gay live-in lover, then later tells him that she is pregnant with his child. From that point on, Dedee spreads bad luck to those around her. Even though some of the actors/actresses played their roles very well, I did not like the flow of the movie. Overall, I thought that it was pretty boring, and I did not like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, edgy comedy with a good story","review":"I liked this film. I saw it in the theater first and bought it when it was put on home video. I've shown it to several friends and they all enjoyed it. Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci are great in this film. Unfortunately some people will be offended by the un-pc views of Lisa Kudrow's character, Lucia, but I guess the truth hurts. Great characters and great writing. The film touches on other lifestyles, the consequences of careless choices, and differing opinions with biting wit. The fact that this film was so good prompted me to watch Don Roos follow-up, All Over the Guy, which was one of the all-time worst films ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent before you buy!","review":"Very over hyped movie. Really disapointing. Other than Lisa Kudrow not much going on here. Some interesting dialogue but not enough to carry the movie. I wanted to like this movie so much but I can't recommed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused girl.","review":"The Opposite of Sex is that kind of drama-comedy that give an improvising plot, with no direction and no solution. Cristina Ricci is convincing in her role as the confused girl, the other gay boys are not completely involved in this kind of theme, they only can produce a mediocre acting work. This kind of film is not for the mature audience, because it gives no solution or a rational ending to the exposed problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"LISA KUDROW ROCKS!!!!!!","review":"This movie is a rare find, a film with wit, stlye and substance, covered in a frothy foam of cynicism. Christina Ricci may be this movies star but, Lisa Kudrow proves to be it's soul. This movie shows why she wins the emmys. Now if they ever make her a lead. She could well have Helen Hunt on the run.

Well I guess it was just suppose to be a funny movie who mean nothing, well suppose to be funny I don't say it was funny!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the opposite of fun","review":"This movie starts off interesting, with Ricci narrating some acerbic, comedic lines and giving us hope that we are about to be in for something really offbeat and good. Enter the always annoying Lisa Kudrow who proves adept, once again, at whining, complaining and acting as if she is going to burst out laughing at any moment. If she were more interesting to watch, perhaps we could stomach her blatant self-consciousness. Some of the \\"Friends\\" should just stick to stupid television shows.The negative (and not funny enough) stereotyping of gays and the endlessly pointless and agitating dialogue forced me to make my \\"Coffee and Cigarettes\\" moment of shutting the movie off about halfway through. I moved on to Pandaemonium - a movie infinitely more worthy of your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated films of 1998","review":"It never ceases to amaze me that there are people who rave about this movie. Sure, it has promise. Christina Ricci is one of the more promising young actresses working today. But the script and premise is woefully contrived, dull, gimmicky, and ultimately uninvolving.Much praise has been heaped on Lisa Kudrow for her supporting performance. Unfortunately, it would seem that the people who have praised it have never heard of Teri Garr, whom Kudrow seems to be working overtime to try and imitate. Pity, as Kudrow has displayed talent.So forget this movie. If you have not seen it, all the praise will just end up letting you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, funny but....","review":"I would of given this movie 5 but Lisa Kudrow's failing character really made a movie just a tiny bit boring as well as the fact that this film had too many gay characters which kinda was annoying.

It's nice to see Christina Ricci being in a more normal movie, seeing as how she is normally playing a depressed gothic person. This movie is about a teenage girl, Deedee (Ricci), who goes to live with her half-brother,Billi, who is a homosexual. Soon, Deedee steals Bill's boyfriend, Matt, and he gets Deedee pregnant. As a result, Deedee and Matt run away to Vegas and get married. While Bill and Lucia (Lisa Kudrow) try to track the two of them down, many funny things happen along the way...but I'll just keep my mouth shut and let you be suprised. You should go see this. However, if people cursing a lot offends you, maybe you wouln't like this movie very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"opposite to Hollywood","review":"This is very unusual black comedy. There are hundreds of black humor jokes (many very smart ones) and it seems to me that the movie was made only because of these jokes (not because of some kind of interesting story). That's just how I would describe the movie. I give it 4 stars for being very funny at times and for 1 very interesting point (instead of interesting story, unfortunately) that was revealed at the very end of the movie. It's about Christina's character's real feelings. Hope this will help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting Wit, Good Cast (and, even a funny \\"Friend\\")","review":"Christina Ricci is marvelous as the sarcastic narrator of this witty, sly little film. Although the plot has a few not-so-plausible glitches, in my opinion, the cast, including Lyle Lovett and Lisa Kudrow, make the film a worth-while endeavor. Some of the one-liners in this movie are lost if you only give it the once over. It's comedy that remains true to the characters; its character sketches that are worth fleshing out; and its multi-dimensional so it satisfies the audiences who may view it multiple times and discover tid-bits they missed the first time around. Intelligent and engaging, it should have found a broader audience; it definitely has a broad appeal. It's not only worth owning, it's worth loaning to friends and family who may, just by looking at its packaging overlook it, but will watch it because you asked them to. They'll thank you later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little film...","review":"I had to write a response to the previous reviewer's complaints about Johnny Galecki's performance as a gay man. Yes, he's over-the-top and, yes, Hollywood needs to make films with gay men that are less stereotypical. But, you can't deny that guys like Galecki exist and he certainly is not a sympathetic character to begin with. I know lots of queens like him and felt his performance was true to that. Now, off the soapbox...lol. If you like funny, disturbing films and aren't offended by unusual themes or strong language, you'll like this. Ricci is great and Lisa Kudrow should have been nominated for an Oscar. She finally nabs a role that lets her get away from the ditzy Phoebe-type characters she's slowly becoming typecast in. She's great, as is the cast as a whole. If you liked 'Go' or 'Election', you'll like this, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but Interesting","review":"Delightfully different coming of age movie.

If only more directors would dare to make such unconventional movies more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does it always have to be about the sex, Why not Shampoo, I want a good Shampoo!","review":"WHat I like about this movie is its corkiness and Its able to take things to another level of an in your face black comedy and its unbashful way it stereotypes its characters. The movie after a while just drags and gladly waiting for it to end but my rating is solely on one scene that I hold close, It's when Lucia( Lisa Kudrow) and her deceased brothers' lover ( Martin Donovan) have a conversation about sex and her brothers passing of AIDS.

I live right next to a bay so the prospect of rising water was very worrisome. I used this tape to secure a tarp around my house and it adhered to many surfaces, including my driveway. What surprised me was that it even adhered to the surface when it was wet! (It started to rain before I can finish taping.) The secured tarp survived the storm, with only a small corner of it coming off. My only complaint is that when I removed the tape after the storm, it took away some paint from underneath. All in all, however, it's a great tape to have because it is strong. Also, you don't need scissors to cut off the tape. You can tear it off with your bare hand! What a wonderful product! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more...","review":"I want more. I want to see what this director does in his next feature. Its going to be a good one.

I guess when it comes to cinema, I am a little lazy, so for this movie, I had to turn my brain on. I had to not look for hollywood, but investigate the story. Some parts, from a relationship perspective hit home, which can make one uncomfortable, which, I looked at as a positive. One aspect I thought was very strong was the music, not sure the technical nomenclature, but, it made an impression.

Appropriately one-dimensional, the actors all created a visceral response: Lisa's natural sadness, Jenna rushing her funny one-liners as if perpetually late for a date, Ty's snaky smile and oily delivery. Kudos to the director for restraining them. The plot did cause me to scratch my head at a couple of points (bar scene with Ty and the ending) and the score was sometimes reminiscent of Dark Shadows.

The best performance in the movie was given by the actor playing Charlie. Jenna's timing was lacking, the role of Tyler should have been recast, and Lisa was whiny with no facial emotion.

The mercilessly repeated punchline \\"So, do you have any Pot?\\" is Avatar's only attempt at humour. The plot itself is tripe, trying to weave together notions of solipsism and internet dating, with a touch of the implausible Nigerian 419 email scam.

He begins to yell up to her and she is too far away to hear what he is saying, so when he says, \\"Rapunzel throw down your hair,\\" she thought he said, \\"throw down your underwear, which by the way landed on his head.Well, the book continues like that with all sorts of things being thrown down on the head of the Prince until the last page.No, Rapunzel does not end up with the Prince, but she is still happy.What a great refreshing book this was.

I think it didn't do so much for my play at the beginning because I had played so long that I couldn't get out of my thinking rut. Despite the name, read this thing as soon as you know how the pieces move! It gives a good foundation of what to look for in a game, otherwise you will be honing your chess skills in the wrong direction.

Mr. Silman building on his insights as related in the Amateur's Mind, rebuilds chess from a game of endless calculation, or reactionary candidate moves, to one of of actually being able to analyze and see any position in light of its true themes. Finally a book that teaches the player to think, not react. The only real weakness is it is not complete enough, something he works on remedying in his Workbook. After this book a chess enthusiast is more able to move to more esoteric texts, with better understanding. Rather than spending years memorizing apocrypha to get to the same point.

I would not recommend this even for kitty litter. Burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive & Short-Sighted","review":"D'Souza is excellent at presenting simple and logical explanations. However, he is unwilling and unable to see complex issues.History, institutional violence, racism, sexism, economic stratification: these things did not affect him. Therefore, he claims they do not exist. D'Souza's America is a simple, defensive, and arrogant.America is a wonderful country and there are opportunities, but there is more to America than a shining city on a hill. \\"America\\" is a reflection of the people that live here. Culture, religion, race, politics, and history: Americans have diverse and conflicting beliefs. And, America is a complex and diverse unity. Us/them and either/or analysis does nothing to solve actual problems.Check out Michael Moore or even Limbaugh for deeper and more passionate essays. D'Souza is severely limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Modesty Please People!","review":"You know, I would probably have to agree with the idea that America is the greatest nation in the world today (maybe ever?). But this does not mean that we do not have many, many problems to work through as a country. It frustrates me when people like D'Souza use what's so great about America as ammunition against anyone who dares be critical of what's not so great about America. If one only focuses on the good, and shuns those who bring up the bad, then the bad will never get fixed and America can never become even better! A little modesty will help us solve what problems we have rather than just ignoring them as people like D'Souza seem to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written rhetoric","review":"Being a conservative, I looked forward to reading this book; however, I found Mr. D'Souza's arguments to be immature and not well thought out. The world need less of the liberal-hating rhetoric Mr. D'Souza spews forth and more answers to fixing the real problems within our great country. To think that America is perfect, with no problems, is a dangerous attitude, and criticizing those problems is not un-American. The only way for America to remain great is to see those problems and fix them -- not blame them on liberals or conservative. After all, we are more than liberals or conservatives -- we are AMERICANS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another jingoism fix for a society on the verge of overdose","review":"The problem with books like these is that it reduces a population to pacifism. If we're the greatest country in the world, then why bother improving? Better yet... anyone who wants to improve things must be against America!A true democracy thrives on feedback and evolution. A great nation has humility and respect towards other countries and cultures. Blind nationalism paralyzes the process and results in a nation that never gets better... and likely worsens over time for it's inflexibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enlightening and enjoyable read","review":"There are so many important ideas in this text. It's an iconoclastic book that looks moral relativism in the eye and watches it wither. For all this, it's readable and unintimidating. My recommendation would be for every college freshman to read it prior to their exposure to the morass of conflicting and cynical information they'll receive subsequently. Recommended for any adult who wants a better understanding of our culture and it's place in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful perspective from a born in India American","review":"D'Souza brings a fresh look at America and approaches it by looking at what critics say followed by an analysis of the facts. Thus, allowing the reader to look beyond what is politically correct, (this book may not qualify as PC) and providing the facts and the histrory to put things into perspective. Having spent 50% of my life living in developing countries, it was easy to come away from the book with a feeling of pride in being an American. Albeit, one who might approach some topics with greater sensitivity in real life than the writer did in the book...which is one of the books strengths."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT's the truth without beating about the bush","review":"IT has excellent ideas and its very refreshing. It offers arguments and answers from different angles. It has theknowlegde of one who has been outside America and who is thus,able to appreciate this country for what it is while at thesame time acknowledging that it does have its minuses.I love America and I knew why I love it after I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced, Objective, but a little naive","review":"I did enjoy this as the author does the best as possible to stay with known facts. Some research did in fact go into this book, it is not so much experience that helped Souza write this, but as the book unfolds you will notice the authors views come from being an immigrant. Comparison is not negative when applied as Souza relates homeland to the U.S.A. However the author does in fact need to take a closer look at the entire spectrum of America, a bit of dreaming shows here in the quest for that American dream. I'd recommend reading Karl Maddox's Book SB 1 or God to be a bit more real on what's so great about us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imperialism, Global Hegemony, and Corporate Greed.....!","review":"If you want to read a real good book about what's so great about America, and if you share a conscience of humanity, and social justice for all, then I would suggest reading Howard Zinn's \\"A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present\\", or William Blume's \\"Rogue States\\". Being myself of South Asian descent, in which world does D'souza think he is living in, when we have such progressive South Asian forces, like DRUM(Desis Rising Up and Moving) who are defying the corporate mainstream, and speaking out against bigotry, racism, and this so-called myopic view that he holds, that we all should stop complaining, and suddenly be elated with joy of our country, no matter how many genocides occur, in our name...shows how the mere immaturity of his own one-dimensional psyche!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so great about America (Conservative Edition):","review":"It can be summed up in one tidy little phrase: the unfettered and god-given right to earn, save, and invest money. You will never hear a conservative praise the artistic freedom of the United States, its respect for diversity, its secular government, nor the Constitution itself (with the exception of the Second Amendment, of course). Money and money alone gives them pause -- they proudly salute the golden calf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, there are better books out there","review":"Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false. On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as \\"isolated instances\\" and not planned nor calculated. Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathtakingly ignorant; don't waste your money","review":"Dinesh D'Souza, who emigrated here from Calcutta in 1978, displays a level of ignorance of American history, politics, economics and culture that is laughable. But for the Immigration Reform Act of 1965 - which was bitterly opposed by those conservatives who now treat D'Souza as their pet token, yet which was pushed through by the liberals he so despises - D'Souza probably wouldn't even be in this country. For him to accuse both Pat Buchanan AND the Rev. Jesse Jackson of \\"hating\\" America demonstrates the pathetic level of his discourse. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays to the Gallery","review":"Dinesh D'Souza seems to have figured out the Americans. Like Rush Limbaugh, he plays to the gallery consisting of a White crowd. Never mind the truth, just heaping lavish praise boosts the ego of this crowd and Dinesh D'Souza acts as a lusty cheerleader for the Whites.No new perspectives, no new information, just out and out praise for Whites - that is what his book is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Dinesh","review":"He is probably my favorite comedic writer. The sense with which he takes his craft is truly something to be admired. Is to \\"American Values\\" what Stephen Colbert is to \\"Conservative Pundit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"No-one has said it better!","review":"Mr. D'Souza has taken a subject rife with emotion and clearly, explicitly, and with occasional humor presented the truth for all to read and understand. He supports his statements with fact and footnotes, includes an extensive bibliography, and, in general, does a masterful job of presenting what every American...indeed, everyone who takes a stand for or against America...should read. This book should be a mandatory freshman-year text in every US college, if those colleges can find professors who have read it also. I have commended this book to my friends and family, and their families as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Noble Cause.","review":"This book is really a \\"how to\\" book. It depicts ways in which you can defend the country that many others are ashamed to say they live in. The author attempts to understand radical Islam as opposed to simply condemning it. His analysis of the Islamic mentality is concise and thoughtful. We will understand those who hate us much better because of his efforts.What D'Souza does here that is truly unique is that he puts geopolitical events in the proper perspective. There is no denial to be found in his pages. The US is far from perfect. We have committed numerous wrongs but in the final analysis we are the freest, kindest, most generous country on this planet. We should all be as proud as D'Souza."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposes the Multiculturalist's Agenda","review":"Thanks to this book, I can see the M.C. agenda in my children's grammer school.Dinesh is great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"For anyone who has not read this book, but has seen Mr. D'Souza go toe to toe with any opposing viewpoint, this is a powerful collective of his perspectives on all major issues confronting America today. He is the recking ball of logic that easily demolishes all the half baked and the insane political correctness that threaten to weaken our nation's core foundation. America IS the greatest nation on Earth and if you truly love this country, here is all the proof you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite finished","review":"I admit, I'm only 3/4 of the way through the book. But, I've highly enjoyed every page thus far. D'Souza's writing is quite enjoyable- a very fresh and engaging look upon both the best and worst in the America I know today. If there is a person who is perfect, please let me meet him. If there is another government in the world that is perfect, please take me there. D'Souza stresses that America does have problems still, but overall it is a great country. I strongly believe in this! I thank God every day that I was born in this country and given the opportunity to make my own destiny. From many other reviewers, I see this is not the case. That, I belive, is a sad state. If you are not willing to be part of the solution in upholding the values and displaying pride in America, then you are part of the problem and you would probably be much happier in another country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinesh is a talented writer. I love this book! You will too.","review":"As an immigrant, and man of color, Dinesh has a unique and refreshing perspective. Dinesh points out those things that make the U.S. unique and worthy of admiration. He examines criticisms, which he sometimes finds valid. He points out elements of American life that we take for granted, and which are not the norm in the rest of the world. He reminds us all why we must cherish the gifts we have been given in the USA, preserve them, and fully pass them on to future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking in the mirror","review":"Since Mr. D'Souza has been labeled with a \\"conservative\\" identifier, most will dismiss this book without bothering to look past the cover.Mr. D'Souza argues with a clear logic his opinions, opinions that can be as grating to the conservative ear as they doubtless are to the liberal. Luckily for my ears, I fall into neither camp.The basic premise of his book is answering the question \\"If America is such a terribly oppressive place (as her critics argue) why do millions around the globe leave their countries (now as well as in the past) to come here?\\"His arguments take apart the doctrines of multi-culturalism and moral equivalency- the pillars of liberal ideology. THAT is the left wing's primary objection to this book.His arguments are very convincing, and will be difficult to answer. I eagerly await the left's response, which so far has been little beyond the traditional cries of \\"ism\\" crimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Author Lives Up To The Books He Writes","review":"I just had the distinct pleasure of listening to Mr. D'Souza deliver a talk at a national meeting organized by The Foundation for Economic Education. Before he was to speak, I saw this powerful thinker spend a few minutes playing with an infant, talking to the child's parents about the challenges and changes a newborn brings into one's life. Then he took the podium and faced an audience of at least 300 people. When he finished sharing his experiences and visions, Mr. D'Souza received a robust and sustained standing ovation. Thankfully, C-Span was on location to record the event. I left with an autographed copy of What's So Great About America and the feeling that I had met a man who walks in Ghandi's footsteps, albeit along a different path. It is a gift to know you are in the presence of a brilliant man with a heart to match his mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open the borders...","review":"I found this book in the book store and had the pleasure of hearing him discuss the book on CSPAN2's Booknotes. For all of you who area ashamed to be an American - YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE. That is one of the greatest privileges we have. I don't know who first said it but to find out the best country in the world: Drop all borders and see where people leave from and where they are going to. People risk their lives and leave their families to come to America. They don't do that to leave America, they don't do it to run off to Czechoslovakia. Why???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Objective, Educational, Philosophical and Inspiring","review":"This book is easy reading for anyone who feels consistently deprived by the media of the depth of thought, analysis and honest portrayal of world events which this book offers. D'Souza makes the complex understandable. I learned a lot from this book. Critics attempt to discredit the author, but they offer no convincing arguments to his facts, logic, honest empathetic analysis and conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't disregard this review because of its rating","review":"It makes me sad when people who are otherwise good, are so ignorant of the things around them. The blandest american car, the newest fast food outlet, the mainstream movie scene...as the culture of a new beat surges beneath the surface. I can see why so many of you embrace the idea of a perfect america, but it is a one-sided view. America has become a place where the good have been declared won, and the rest cast away. This is a place that can say, Utopia has arrived! If you can't pay the entrance fee, get out! And then refused to look at its own flaws.

This is exactly the line of reasoning that is aiding in the swelling of anti-American sentiment around the world, and that is causing the United States to act in an almost purely unilateral way. If this line of reasoning controls US policy in the future then we can only expect more attacks on US soil, not because of \\"evil do-ers\\", rather because the blatant refusual by the United States government to acknowledge differing people around the world. I would recommend this book if you want a good laugh, or are incredibly ignorant and want to believe that \\"we rock and are the best country ever!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"US is great... but India-bashing in bad taste!!!","review":"Wonder why D'Souza resorted to India bashing... perhaps 'grapes are sour'. Countless Indian borns have made it big despite their not-so-great beginnings in India. Perhaps, D'Souza did not give it a try. Ask the 25+ billionaires (yes, US Dollar Billionaires) from India and countless millionaires - how come they could make it big while D'Souza could not. D'Souza has made sweeping generalizations that are ridiculous and exhibit shallowness of his journalism.Frankly it is best Dinesh D'Souza (and his types) finds peace in the middle world called \\"Limbo\\". He is neither a true American (professionalism & entrepreneurship is the religion of America - and Dinesh exhibits neither) nor true Indian (glad he is out of India). He is a lesser human to say the least!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author has no clue.","review":"The author is a foreign-born and sees the goodies only. He is naive, has no clue on some issues. Yes, America is very good country for a foreigner to live in, yet he fails to see Vietnam war, slavery, low wages. I have not read his book, and I will never. I have seen him on C-Span, telling point blank that 'This (US) is the only super power in the world that doesn't tell other countries what to do\\" I don't know what part of the world he lives. He is comparing Zhengis Khan with Modern America. Simply the person has no clue. Now-a-days, especially after 9/11, a lot of pudnits get pleasure comparing our (US) system of government, the ways of living comparing with Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iraq. The aforementioned countries have not come out of Middle Age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist, elitest, and ethnocentric!","review":"D'Souza is one of the most racist, elitest and ethnocentric men I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.

It read to me like it had been written by young teens, and it played out like the sort of classroom discussion where everyone thought they had something interesting to say without managing to state much intelligently at all. Having said that, it was interesting to read about some of the concepts for the first time - though I do wish I'd found a better book for it. If you're 16 or younger, you might find this book tolerable.Read the other reviews for more detailed and erudite critiques - I just wanted to add my thumbs down to the rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 1 step reversible stroller available!","review":"I love this stroller - way nicer than my Gracco but 1/2 the price of the more expensive brands. This is the only stroller that you can switch the baby from facing you to facing the world in one easy step by flipping the handle - all of the others you need someone to hold your child while you remove and flip the seat. Also comes with more accessories than the average stroller - love the attached and rotating cup holder and the foot muff. Not sure how great the pictures are but this stroller has the BIGGEST canopy it will fold all the way down to the bar to help block the sun. The only 2 reasons i didn't rate the stroller 5 stars: 1. it didn't come with a rain cover, and 2. i had to watch a video to figure out how to steer it - you need to lock the back wheels for which ever direction you're going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks aren't everything","review":"I received the 2006 model of this stroller for my baby shower. I has read good reviews on it and thought it was more attractive than your run-of-the-mill Graco stroller, and less expensive than the trendy Bugaboo. I am so dissappointed with the quality of this stroller, however. The main problem I have with it is that no matter what I do this stroller veers to the left when strolling. This make the stroller IMPOSSIBLE to use. I literally have used this stoller less than 5 times and I've had it for a year. Everytime I try to use it I get so frusterated that I want to just throw the stroller away.

I started listening to Four and than their first album, than Travelers, Save His Soul, which were all amazing to me. I was lucky enough in the fall of 97 to see Blues Traveler for the first time in a downtown theateR were I got to stand all night in front of Bob (R.I.P), which was totally awesome. I think Bobby was the main backbone to Blues Traveler and without Bobby to me, there is no Blues Traveler. Not a Blues Traveler that once kicked out the jams to great tunes that I still know. Buy anything up till Straight On if u want to hear the real BT."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was expecting much more","review":"it seems that no two reviewers really agree on which blues traveler albums are good and which are not-so-good. if you ask me, \\"Blues Traveler\\" is good, \\"Travelers and Thieves\\" and \\"Save His Soul\\" are amazing, and \\"Four\\" is mediocre, and finally \\"Bridge,\\" which i think is pretty bad. Before i explain that let me say that the song \\"All Hands\\" is great (could have been better though) and \\"Sadly a Fiction\\" is pretty good. Most of the rest borders on garbage -- nothing more than pop songs that have been done many times before. Blues Traveler is one of my favorite bands, but they have lost it. I'm hoping they will find it and give us another album as soon as possible -- they have new potential with the addition of Ben Wilson, who is actually good on \\"Bridge,\\" using retro keyboard sounds, organs, and piano. I know BT still has the ability to rock, but they definitely do not rock on Bridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back On Track","review":"O.K...so \\"Straight On Till Morning\\" wasn't BT's best effort, but this can now be regarded as a mere creative bump in the road with the release of \\"Bridge\\". This cd is an absolute treat that gets BT back to what they do best...JAM. Lyrically, the cd may not hold up to \\"Travelers and Thieves\\", but musically this is a slam dunk. The addition of keyboards is tastefully done and I can honestly say (after recently catching them live-5 stars) that they are as tight as they were 10 years ago. The fact that no radio stations are playing \\"Bridge\\" should tell you that this cd is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues Traveler is Back!","review":"After the death of bassist Bobby Sheehan many fans wondered if the band would survive. But survive they have, and with the additions of keyboardist Ben Wilson and Tad Kinchla on bass, the boys are back with \\"Bridge.\\" This album has something for eveyone. Catchy tunes are here for the casual fan (Girl Inside My Head, Just For Me) as well as some hard, slamming tunes for the seasoned traveler (You Reach Me, All Hands.) The album also features a wonderfully written and played ballad to Sheehan in Pretty Angry. Pick up this album, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The band is dead","review":"Blues Traveler has put out phenomenal albums (the first one, and Straight on till Morning) and rather poor ones (Travelers and Thieves...) but this one is the all time low. The piano isn't adding anything the band would need, it always seems out of place. Tad's bass playing is just fooling around really - he sounds different on every track but never ok. John's lyrics were so different once - now we're down to \\"Will you catch me if I fall\\" and similar platitudes. In the musical context of all this, worst of all, even the harp sounds like it's own cliche... Too bad it's over, but the prevailing thought is: I am grateful for all the incredible music these guys have given me over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst out of the best.","review":"Bridge, an album that plays absolutely no testament to a band whose ability far superceedes this pile of [garbage]. I have been listening to BT for about 15 years now, seeing them doing live shows in the Jersey area in the late 80's. If you want a great album, buy \\"Save His Soul,\\" dont waste your time with this garbage. Im sorry Bobby S. is dead, he truly was a backbone for this band, listen to any early stuff and his bass is clearly prominent. Its a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The band is dead? Are you crazy?","review":"Are you listening to the same CD I am? Ok. If you've become a huge fan of the pre-packaged, more manufactured sounds of \\"Four\\" and \\"Straight On\\" then you may be a little disappointed. But if you're like me and enjoy BT's more adventurous side such as \\"Travelers and Thieves\\" and \\"Save His Soul\\", I think you'll be pleased. Ben Wilson's piano work adds a pleasant new dimension to the arrangements and partially compensates for my one complaint about the album: Too little harmonica. (Thus only 4 stars). The songwriting is stellar as always, despite the supposed \\"cliches\\" in the lyrics. A solid effort--and I suspect the next one will be awesome. Thanks, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the album of the year","review":"This CD shows the amazing talent of the members of Blues Traveler, and the flow of creativity stemming from the loss of their Bassist. In an era where overproduction and lots of hype rule the music industry, it is nice to hear a stripped down album of great music. As a matter of fact, I didn't even know there had been a new Blues Traveler album released until I saw it in the stores. Overall, there is not a bad track on the CD, something I never say. Definately worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"I have been a fan of BT since their album 'Four' was released. I then went about buying all of their other releases. I can honestly say that this is just as good or better than any of their previous releases. This is a new version of BT, accepting the loss of Sheehan and moving on, he will be missed. The music is very well written along with the lyrics. A few of the songs on the album sound a lot like old concert favs, but then the new sound of other tracks sheds light on where the group is headed. I look forward to the future that this CD gives a glipse of.

But this has to be one of the poorest books on the subject. It wastes your time with useless info on how to open and close, and save files, which is exactly same as in any other MS program.

This is a good book if you don't know much about FrontPage and want to learn about how to use it. Advanced website designers probably will want to use other developing environments anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Official FrontPage 2000 Book","review":"This book is decent reference material for experienced web devlopers looking to learn the tools of FrontPage, but is not appropriate for beginners. The mateial is poorly presented, lacking in graphics, and is poorly written. The book is plagued by irrevelant information, run-on sentences, and topics being referenced before they are defined and explained.

It is visually beautiful (the chateau reminds me of Versaille) however, the game is low tech, very static and the player is extremely limited in movement and objects that may be picked up.

The graphics are good (not great, but good), but that is all I can say about it. The puzzles are simplistic at best and few and far between. Most of the storyline appears to be concerned with French history. This would better be served by marketing the game as an educational tool, not pure entertainment. There are many games available with more difficult puzzles, intriguing plots, and more hours of entertainment than this one for the same price. Unless you are interested in a superficial overview of French history, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short, too boring","review":"Most of it is trivial, and an average gamer can finish it in just a few hours.

THis was very annoying, particulary after you spend time learning the (superficial) history of France. In addition, the controls were difficult to maneuver and static and the puzzles were not inspiring. THe graphics were good but it gets boring when you have to spend your entire time on the castle grounds...it felt like prison after a while. THere was no creativity in this game. I would not recommend it. UNfortunately, there are few very good adventure games. Even the Longest journey, which I had problems with, is superior to this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"best null modem adapters around","review":"These slim-line null modem adapters are excellent.

His best album would be Link's Three Track Shack which is really a collection of three other albums. This album is in the same vein as Link's Three Track Shack but is not as strong and in fact has a few of the same songs rerecorded and repackaged for this album. The songs that are new are worth the money but only if you really enjoy the Link Wray from this time period. Don't try looking for the young dirty guitarist Link Wray because you won't find him here (even though it is the same guy). This album sounds more like The Band or the Greatful Dead than the young Link Wray. If this is your first trip into the Link Wray of the 70's than pick up Link's Three Track Shack, if your looking for a follow up to Link's Three Track Shack than this is your next and really only logical choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD from original album","review":"This is the CD from the original album that my son had from the 80s.

There are only 3 items - each is less than an hour long and are OK but I wish they would of had more footage of the cast and direction and maybe some commentary. The footage of Brian Fuller is pretty limited.I know this show did not garner the ratings that the network wanted but it deserved to have a little icing on its final cake.The packaging is a little better than S1 but not by much.Really this set is mainly to get the episodes for posterity.

You probably have seen videos, at least some of these: Rooster, Angry Chair, Down in a Hole, Would? and Them Bones. In my opinion they could have made a video any of these songs on the album...well maybe not \\"Iron Man\\" which is a short scream, kinda interlude before \\"Hate to Feel\\". You may not like the vocals but I love 'em. They are so spooky...spookily great! Just love this album so much. Definitely one of the top50 rock albums of all-time! \\"Rain When I Die\\" is a great song...it tells about mercy before dying...well at least the Finnish Christian rock band \\"The Rain\\" told me...Stars: Would?, Angry Chair, Rain When I Die"},{"rating":"2","title":"AIC the best band ever","review":"GREAT ALBUM. 5 Stars.

A buddy lent me this album and I was blown away. Staley's vocals could be eerily haunting, yet brash at the same time. Cantrell's guitar work is the best of his career. This album is Chains at the top of their game. Though it is easily forgotten in the shuffle of Nevermind, Ten, and Superunknown, Dirt is an album that every rock fan should have.R.I.P.

What else can be said, Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell were two of the best songwriters to come out of the 90's and its none more apparent then on Dirt. Each song almost feels like a tale of Layne's mind as he coped with heroin addiction, which would sadly cost him his life a decade later. You get a real sense of geniune, thought provoking lyrics with Staleys tortured yell and Jerry Cantrells ever rocking guitar. An absolute must for any fan of AIC or just good music in general"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I've listened to this CD over and over. Favorite track is Them Bones.

Every song is well thought out and very well played. The harmonization between Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell will continue to be imitated but never duplicated. No other musicians have ever been able to fuse such a complicated and unique style and also a kind of \\"I wish i would have thought of that\\" simplicity. From the hits that almost everyone has heard like \\"Rooster\\", and \\"Down in a Hole\\", to the songs that could've easily been number one hits had they been released, like \\"Junkhead.\\" Alice in Chains helped to birth the revolutionary grunge style. They were pioneers that helped to bring about some of the most talented bands today. This album captures them in their prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"to all of you who said this band is better than Nirvana","review":"It's an opinion, you can't prove they were better. Don't forget, Kurt Cobain was the voice of the generation not Layne Stanley, who has the most whiney voice comparded to Kurt's screaming that actually fits in the genre grunge, so it's an opinion. Alice In Chains was good, Nirvana and Pearl Jam and Soundgarden were sooo much more influental.....and thats a fact"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hw did they get popular???","review":"Any album you buy by AIC sounds the same so this is no exception.

Facelift showed a band with quite a bit of promise, however, this album didnt live up to this fan's expectations. It does have some decent guitar riffs, although much of it is just plain noise, and personally, Layne Staley's vocals have never struck me as more than a guy who just slammed his finger in a car door.

There is alot of other good music not so \\"popular\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn! Give me real grunge like Staind any day of the week.","review":"So I decided to listen to this album because I heard it was an amazing grunge album. Man! I was so disappointed. It was simply awful. Not one good song on it. All of the songs sound EXACTLY the same- seriously, folks. The guitar riffs are unimaginative and uninspired and that Lane Stailey guy is a horrible singer. He sounds like a whining puppy or something! Listen to real grunge like Staind or Daughtry. Alice In Chains are lame post-grunge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grunge can be done right, but not by AIC... my god, this droopy stuff is boring.","review":"I don't hate grunge, but there is another genre that it overshadowed, namely METAL, that should get the real praise. Of the \\"big four\\" of grunge (Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and Alice in Chains), these guys were the second-to-worst. If anyone knows a band that sucks more than Pearl Jam, give me a call. Oh wait a sec, what about every friggin' nu-metal band out there today, especially (gag) Seether and (gag) Nickelback and...Alice in Chains sucked too. I don't know about you, but I like music with adrenaline and energy in it, not this droopy crap.Soundgarden, Nirvana, and Tool were good, original bands. If you want grunge, go buy their albums. Stay the heck away from this. It sucks. Get the idea? This review is a little off-topic, I guess, but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly reeks..........","review":"This music is tasteless. Nothing but plain old recycled 70's riffs w/ offbeat drums. The riffs are same as Led Zepplin's only they were a great and time-tested group. How come AIC couldn't release another very good CD like FaceLift? 'Sickman' is just that, sick. Songs like 'Dirt', 'Junkhead', 'Hate to Feel', and 'Rain When I Die' have way too slow rhythms and are boring. Layne Staley sounds like Beavis as Cornholio. If you want better grunge, go listen to Soundgarden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh, the memories this album bring...","review":"A college staple for me, this album is amongst the best of AIC. Definitely a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The grungiest.","review":"As much as I love \\"Jar Of Flies\\", this is their best album. It's just track after track of pure meaty grunge. \\"Nirvana\\" were a bit more punk, and \\"Soundgarden\\" were a bit more metal, but \\"Alice In Chains\\" to me, were nothing but grunge, and \\"Dirt\\" is a perfect album title. This had a few huge songs, including \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\", and \\"Would?\\", which was also on the \\"Singles\\" soundtrack. Of course the other tracks on here rock just as much. \\"Junkhead\\" and \\"Rain When I Die\\" are two other favorites of mine. This band was always a little dark and mysterious, which is part of what made them special, and they are sorely missed. Fortunately, \\"Jerry Cantrell\\" continues to carry the torch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grunge at its very best.","review":"I'm surprised that with such excellent albums, Alice in Chains has never really gotten the recognition they deserved. I suppose part of this has to do with the fact that they are much heavier than a lot of the grunge bands that were out at the time. It's true, they are heavier, but they are better than most. \\"Rooster\\" is an expressive song about the Vietnam experiences of guitarist Jerry Cantrell's uncle and really makes you think about what all those soldiers had to deal with. \\"Them Bones\\" starts it off and is one of their catchiest songs. \\"Would?\\" is an interesting song about...I don't know. But it's very cool. In short, this is one of the top albums of the grunge era and is much better than most of the alternative stuff that is out today. Pick this up for a truly unique experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt defines Alice In Chains.","review":"\\"Dirt\\" should be any Alice In Chains fan's favorite album. It defines who they are, what they sound like, and what they are trying to say. Layne Staley's and Jerry Cantrell's harmonic voices team up to balance out the heavy background guitar and turn it into their own original no-rules version of heavy metal. Alice In Chains have peaked with \\"Dirt.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL record of the 90's!!!","review":"Forget Nirvana!! This record is THE record of the decade! The music itself is pure, but singer Layne Staley's lyrics about his eternal struggle to his various addictions should've grabbed the attention of critics and fans, instead of the depression and whining that Kurt Cobain put into his music. A MUST listen!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Alice in Chains album to date","review":"Chock full'o great tunes on DIRT. Rooster, Down in a Hole, Would?, Rain when I Die, Them Bones, Dam that River all are great grunge rocking tunage. With the exception of a few weak tunes (Sickman, Godsmack, Junkhead) this disc is classic from beginning to end. Cantrell rips power chords that rattle the spine and Staley writes lyrics that borderline the need for therapy. Check out the tune 'Dam that River'. Easily the best Alice in Chains album to date. Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed component of every decent CD collection","review":"I'm not a big fan of what Rolling Stone Magazine called grunge. I instead prefer the hard corp and thrash metal groups that prevailed before the media blitz.This CD is definitely best of class. Anybody who is reading this review who does not already own this album is either very young (go buy) or has poor taste. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"a desert island album","review":"dirt is probably my favorite guitar album of all time; one that i know every nuance. the vocals are truly unique. in addition to layne's great sustained melodies, the backup vocals and harmonies make this a great album to sing along with. highlights for me are the final verse of \\"down in a hole\\", which features, i think, 5 or 6 overdubbed harmonies. the wah-wah riff of \\"rain when i die\\" is unforgetable. cantrell's solos hinge on insanity. the way he fuses blues with elements that seem to not fit fuel his leads. i think cantrell's incorporation of different rythms into a solo are what give him his audacious and unique sound. alice in chains and soundgarden were the best bands of the 90's; much better than their grunge buddies nirvana and pearl jam. dirt is their hardest but best work. it is probably the single best album i own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never thought I would like Alice In Chains","review":"I bought this CD in 1997 because I heard Rooster on the radio. I just had to hear that tune again. I really thought that I would hate this band. (I am a classic rock fan and judged them by their name) Oh how wrong I was. Aside from being a bit dark and dreary and depressing at times I found this to be a very worthy band and cd. There is some serious talent here. I quickly rushed out and bought all of there stuff and like most of it. This one is probably my favorite being close to jar of flies. Jar of flies is actually a relief after dirt because it is not so intense, but dirt is very powerful and is really fun to crank on the stereo. By the way.....soundgarden is really not in any league with this band. They have a few catchy tunes, but these guys are real talent. Too bad they are not making music now.Down in a hole is one of the best individual tunes to come along in many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Excellent","review":"These are terrific songs. They really are. Cantrell's composing and playing are absolutely top-notch. Staley's lyrics are positively mind numbing, and he sings them with conviction and a sense of dread that has pretty much not been duplicated since. I can't count the number of times that I played \\"Down in a Hole\\" at a time in my life when I also felt that \\"my wings had been so denied.\\"I agree with others that one--after more than one listen--can sense a strange sense of optimism in this music. I can't put my finger on it, but this music really does accomplish its mission of performing a mental \\"primal scream\\" of sorts and has a cleansing effect that can ultimately be positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deppresing yet powerful","review":"... Every track hides a deppresed feeling, but the more deppresing of them all is Hate To Feel. Don't get the wrong idea; this is a great album, played perfectly on every song. You should get this album even if you're a bitney spears fan.There are songs that no matter what music you like; you'll like this ones... Like Down In A Hole, Would? and Rooster, the most known tracks from AIc..Once you get past those songs, you should listen to the other gems, and listen Sickman, the biggest +point in the album, or Dam that River, or my personal favourite, RAIN WHEN I DIE....Let's not say more: get this album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds even better than it did!","review":"I waited quite some time to get this & it was a quite expensive, but the packaging & sound are great! This is a great listen; I always though AIC was the 90s version of Sabbath & with one listen to this, I think you'll see what I mean. Apparently, this is an Amazon exclusive because CDNow was supposed to get this also originally, but have now taken it off their inventory. This album was a chronicle of Layne Staley's heroin addiction & demons which ultimately claimed his life last month (R.I.P.). So very sad, but with some artists, it's easy by listening to them to see that they know their time is short (go back & listen to Mother Love Bone & Blind Melon as well as AIC now & see what I mean). So sad that he couldn't conquer the addiction, but the same goes for so many other great talents as well. We will always cherish their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing piece of work!","review":"I'm sure most of you know that Layne Staley was recently found dead in his Seattle home at the age of 34. While his passing is a huge loss to the music world, his voice will live on in the amazing body of work Alice In Chains released.All of their albums & ep's are great, but \\"Dirt\\" is probably their definitive album. It runs the gammut of bone-crushing tunes like \\"Them Bones\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\" to songs like \\"Down in a Hole\\", which displays Layne Staley's and Jerry Cantrell's great vocal harmonies.Every song on this album leaves you wanting to hear everything by this band. And I suggest that you pick up ALL of their releases. Everything they ever put out is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent album","review":"good quality, and i love the music so its got an A+ from me but thats speaking more for the music than vinyl quality cause im a noob in the vinyl business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up to Facelift","review":"One of the things I respected the most about Alice In Chains is how consistently good each of their releases were, something I don't feel any of the other similar bands of the period were able to achieve, and Dirt is another example of one of the most creative stretches by any band ever. While I don't feel Dirt is as good as the debut(which is common for me), Facelift, it is close. Again buy Dirt as a whole and listen to it the way it was intended. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop D","review":"As rock's cautionary tales about heroin abuse go, this one holds a little extra resonance. It never sat all that comfortably with the grunge label, but rocked like early Sabbath wished it could.I never enjoyed the more popular songs all that much (i.e. \\"Rooster\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\"), but love the remaining tracks -- which veered further away from the rock norm. The album flows despite it's crackling, strained psychological underpinnings and themes of anguish and disgust."},{"rating":"2","title":"AIC","review":"Ordered this for my significant other and it was a great gift.

This album was practically issued at local alternative music stores at a introduction to the angst filled early-mid 1990's. Much like Frampton's \\"Peter Frampton Comes Alive\\", this is a must have for the Generation X community. I remember buying this tape after years of listening to top 40 and old,classic rock and having a revelation,that led me to spend hundreds of dollars at a local music store.

It purports to be a stunning muckraking work, yet it is nothing more than a critigue of the aesthetics of power in Washington.Critics such as Klein have long seen advertising as being a negative force in politics at least since the Eisenhower campaign hired an advertising agency in 1952. Klein claims that since the Nixon campaign of 1968, politics have become nothing more than slickly packaged advertisements.Klein's book is really nothing more than the same old, same old."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I enjoyed Primary Colors, which is why I bought this book. Unfortunately, Joe Klein has turned into yet another mindless beltway pundit. There's nothing in here that you wouldn't hear on a typical Sunday morning round table: both sides are wrong, we need to get beyond sound bites, etc, etc. Klein is a good writer and I think he means well. He ought to try spending some time oustide of the beltway bubble to reconnect with average Americans. Maybe then he wouldn't run around taking about how the United States should consider using tactical nuclear weapons against Iran. And maybe then he'd manage to produce another good book.

Doesn't matter how good, even how GREAT, a clown he may be, you don't fit in with the yuppies. The title track is actually not too bad, once you get used to it.

As with alot of teens in the '70's, I would light up before my initial listening to the entire album in the comfort of my bedroom. Wow! \\"Further Than We've Gone\\" and \\"Bluejeans and Moonbeams\\" really blew me away... Well, time went on, my albums were eventually packed away... never abused, just rarely used... Last summer, at 41 years of age, I decided to brouse thru my albums... There it was!!! My ole Cap't Beefheart!

Every one of these recordings are evidence of the genius tht was Ray Charles. Some are quite simple in their arrangement, some vastly more intricate, yet every one expresses the powerful emotions that exude from the music and the man.This collection is seminal in it's importance in recording the birth of a genre that founded the careers of some of our most important popular musicians.

How can anyone call Clinton \\"the worst family\\" when so many much more horrible presidents have been in office (look at Bush!). All presidents have done questionable deeds (even Clinton, our centuries best president) but you have to compare the harm they have done. For example, many people who support the Bush enviornmental policy (which harms untold millions if not billions of people) have been outraged at Clinton for getting a BJ! How absurd! Anything Clinton has done hasn't harmed a soul compared to what Bush is perpetrating. It's like comparing someone who stole a car to Hitler. Not to mention all the good Clinton did. Our country has NEVER been in better shape than in the two terms of President Clinton. This country has gone to the dogs in the few short months his term has been over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your enjoyment will depend on your beliefs","review":"Make no bones about it, whether or not you like this book will depend almost solely on your feelings about the Clintons. If you hate them, you will love this book and read it in one sitting. If you love them, well, forget you have ever heard of this book and go pick up something by Jake Trapper or Joe Conason.You have heard the saying, \\"You always hurt the one you love.\\" Hitchens, a devote leftist, reacts to his sense of betrayal for the Clinton years by demonstrating how Clinton abondoned his political base and his orated beliefs in pursuit of greater electoral power. Hitchens goes through the Clinton scandals, their affects on the presidency and their propensity for abandoning their friends when it is expedient in devestating detail.This is a quick read, less than 200 pages, and seemingly pretty well research and thought out. Worth a look - if you don't like the Clintons."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate this book a -1 I would","review":"The book has a fatal flaw, and that is its complete, total, absolute lack of footnotes, references or bibliographies. There is no reasonable way to verify which of Hitchens' quotes are made up and which are not made up.For instance, on page 63 Hitchens quotes George Stephanopoulos as having said \\"For eight months of 1995 and 1996, Morris was the president.\\"Now, George Stephanopoulos may in fact have said that. Then again, he may not have. No way to tell, because Hitchens cannot be arsed --to use an Anglicism-- to tell us the source.Indeed, this book cites no sources whatever! Not one! As a work one could reference in researching President Clinton it is less than worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchens... only liberal not to trade principle for Clinton","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Made me realize how much damaging information is out there that the major media ignores. Hitchens finds it, and reveals it in this short but hard hitting book. Interestingly enough, though it's been the political right attacking Clinton for 7 years, Hitchens attacks him from the left. I may not agree with Christopher Hitchen's politics (his thoughts on Welfare reform have been proven dead wrong) but I admire his character and his courage for standing up for what he believes. If you read this book with an open mind, you'll believe that Bill Clinton is pure sleeze who had disgraced the office of President and our whole country for far too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchens is our hope.","review":"As a well-trained doctor he diagnosed the problems of \\"Clinton\\" right wing agendas. As ZERO tolerance presidents, Clinton was the first to cover up his legal problems. Clinton is a man of no value. The only issue he supported is welfare Des-reform and legal immigrants abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intellectual Honesty","review":"Hitchens' main concern in this book is to demonstrate that the Left has lost its intellectual honesty. If, in fact, the Left was willing to aid and abet a charismatic self-serving demagogue, then what else could they stoop to?While Hitchens did, in fact, work at the Nation, they sacked him because he was constantly trying to hold the Nation to an intellectual standard that they blatantly discarded going into the buildup for the last DNC sweep of the Whitehouse and Congress.To understand the modern DNC, you need to read Hitchens. Once you see how it went under Clinton, then you suddenly understand why the current administration shielded Fanny Mae and Big Pharma rather than pursue real economic and healthcare reform.Clinton was a corporatist. The parallels to the current administration are more than just coincidence. It's the modern DNC political blueprint.By the way, corporate socialism is, by definition, Fascism. And a devout Communist like Hitchens knows it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southerners always get the worst of it.

Um . . . yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Exposure --5 stars not nearly enough","review":"Wow. Could not put this book down. In this thin book thick with truth, Mister Hitchens has distilled and and crystalized the charlatan-in-chief's tale/tail. I use to resent the fact that Clinton will get his own presidential library. But no longer. Build those bricks high; and stock those shelves full...with this book and this book only. Because these words tell it all. Thank you Mister Hitchens. I salute you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Hitchens for intelligence, bravery, and honesty","review":"I'm glad I bought my copy of this book.I'm always happy to listen to the television when Christopher Hitchens is on. He seems refreshingly honest and thoughtful. I bought his book hoping to read his ideas in depth and to show support for someone who stood up to be counted at a crucial time. I found the train of thought in his book harder to follow than his train of thought on television. Many events and people were mentioned. Some of his allusions were unclear to me. I had the feeling he needed to rush his writing, in order to get the book out by a deadline. I truly hope he has more time to write another version that is clearer.I know he has a lot to say and he only needs a larger book to say it in. You may want to buy this book if it looks like he will not bring out another one, or if you would like to have a book that has successfully captured the atmosphere of Clinton's presidency and impeachment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No One Left to Lie About: The Fantasies of Chris Hitchens","review":"Christopher seems obsessed with sex -- other people's, that is. On page 26 Christopher writes: \\"'The Monster,' Morris called Clinton when in private congress with his whore. 'The creep,' she called Morris when she could get away and have a decent bath.\\"The irony here is that Christopher had just spent pages 16 through 18 trying to convince us that he and Ken Starr were not guilty of \\"Sexual McCarthyism\\" -- a term which Chris finds offensive.Yet a mere 8 pages later Chris is talking about \\"whores\\" and \\"creeps\\" in his characteristic condescension and disdain towards others. That condescension and disdain runs throughout the book, a mighty torrent of revulsion. I, however, feel revulsion for Hitchens himself. He is a truly, frightfully ugly man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant bias hangs Hitchens","review":"This is not a review of this book but rather a review of Mr. Hitchens. He is not shy about expressing his utter contempt and hatred for the Clintons as he did on Larry King. How can anyone take this book seriously? Even if what Mr. Hitchens says is accurate, and I would assume that most of it is, why would anyone cast his or her \\"economic vote\\" (trans: pay money for) a book that fosters hate?

I love in the intro how he thanks his liberal friends for not joining the \\"liberal herd\\" in supporting Bill Clinton. That's the greatest description of most liberals I've ever read, \\"liberal herd.\\" And this coming from a liberal writer. I'm not crazy about George W. Bush, but it is such a RELIEF to have Clinton out of office. This book sets down the reasons why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanctimonious posturing","review":"Christopher Hitchen's book \\"No One Left To Lie To\\" could have been great. I've always enjoyed his entertaining style and trenchant analysis in Vanity Fair. This book, however, is a huge disappointment. There may be insightful commentary buried in here, but it is under literally bucketfuls of invective, name-dropping, and self-aggrandizing. Hitchens clearly lacks emotional distance from his subject and he comes off petulent and mean-spirited. While this book is quite short, the reading of it was as arduous a process as picking up War and Peace in the original Russian. NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage! Who IS this revolting fellow ?","review":"Why do Americans insist upon dismembering their presidents ? Here in Great Britain we are accustomed to the rather rough handling or our PM in the House of Commons, and in the less reputable papers, but we've seen nothing compared to what Mr. Clinton has endured. I must say, I only made it some 75 pages through this 'book' before I tossed it aside and went out for a pint.

This book speaks truth to power, and once again power is shown with its pants on fire. Unlike all the liberals, feminists, Cabinet members and other assorted apologists, Hitchens just cannot swallow the lies, obstruction of justice, perjury, illegal fundraising, etc., nor wash it down with what's left of the hope that Clinton won't completely scuttle the agenda of the left. It's a polished amplification of his piece in Vanity Fair, whose title was almost as good as this one: \\"It's Not the Sin, It's the Cynicism.\\" That about says it all.By the way, where did all these other weird reviews come from?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Clinton's sins were so numerous and so well-documented it's almost a shame to applaud a book that sets them down on paper. Something that should be standard practice should not have to be applauded! But the liberal press were such Clinton groupies, the truth was so hidden or distorted so often, this book is indeed one to be applauded. Aside from Clinton's sins being revealed, this book gives insight into the minds of the \\"enablers\\" who let Clinton get away with his crimes, or who looked the other way or defended him once they were committed. An excerpt from the book describes such Clinton supporters perfectly: \\"I have known a number of people who work for and with, or who worked for and with, this man [Clinton]. They act like cult members while they are still under the spell, and talk like ex-cult members as soon as they have broken away.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"utterly surreal","review":"Even though I pretty much knew what direction this book was going in, it was weird and at the same time refreshing knowing a guy like Hitchens wrote it.

This was the MG's first album and was recorded after the 45 of \\"Green Onions\\" hit the top of the charts. The inventiveness and fire evident on the \\"Green Onions\\" single is just about impossible to find on the other tracks of this album, though. If you were thinking of getting this so you could hear \\"Green Onions\\"--well, don't do it. Pick up \\"The Very Best of\\" on Rhino. It has \\"Green Onions\\" and about 17 other songs that are just as thrilling.

This is a band that was subtle even when it was showing off its formidable chops.

Being an exceptionally great band, I don't believe that this disc is a true representation of the Who's \\"greatist hits.\\" While it does contain songs which are truly near to my heart--Won't Get Fooled Again being one of them--the album seems more of a attempt to earn a profit by cashing in on the millenium craze than a true record for the consumer. Sure, there are some absolutely great songs here (this being the only reason I didn't give it the minimum one star), but there is simply too much left out and overlooked to be a true compilation of their best. If you are new to the Who, try the My Generation--the Very Best of the Who disc instead. It contains many more songs which I believe give the listener a better idea of what these guys were all about.

She is Jewish and her class is making decorations for Christmas. But, since Jennifer doesn't celebrate Christmas, her teacher lets her make something for Hanukkah. When she goes home from school, she decides to form a club for herself because she is the 'only one'. Now the other kids feel left out too - until they all figure out what is unique and special about each one of them. What a wonderful way to show children how truly special and one of a kind they are!

This true story chronicles 5 years in the life of one of only 12 children to survive the Lodz Ghetto in Poland. Over the course of the book, Syvia goes from being ashamed to wearing her yellow star, to having it save her life and the life of 800 other Jewish people.

It has also been published in French by Pygmalion Presse, Paris, and in that edition does double duty as an enjoyable read as well as an opportunity to improve one's French. If you have an interest in military history, politics of French Colonialism, or just want an evening's diversion reading an extraordinary journal of a middle class Englishman's survival and eventual success in a severe and foreign environment, you couldn't do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"I had the old version of the book and at first the pace is slow and the diary format wasn't exciting. Later on, the action picks up and I came to like Murray as he is a very good lad and makes me sympathize with him. It is a wonderful account of 5 years in such a tough environment, although I would never join the Legion unless I really messed myself up somewhere in life...the reasons not to join are plentiful and I'm not sure Murray had any good reason to join the Legion other than for adventure, at a time when youths could take time off and worry less about the rat-race as it is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent description from the diaries of a young man","review":"I found this book in paperback while travelling through Australia in the summer of 1998 and have just finished reading it.I am compelled to let the military readers and future wannabe's of the legion know that this is an excellent resource for you. It includes a young mans thoughts and experiences through his five years as a paratrooper.Now that North America lives in a politically correct and very frustrating soceity, it's hilarious to know that we can still be men in the legion.

It presents basic flat pattern drafting and manipulation (with an emphasis on design elements rather than fitting) in very clear and easy to follow terms. Topics include all sorts of women's clothes (including lingerie blocks which are not covered in any of my other books), a section on children and infant's clothing, and a brief section on pattern grading.There are other books that get a little deeper into theory and commercial practice, and tweaking the fit on your basic block is not really covered in much depth, but its succinctness is much of its charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to James Chiu","review":"I'm going to watch this DVD soon but wanted to ask the reviewer named James Chiu a quick question.

But it's an insipid biography of his life.The problem is not merely that the film covers the most introductory aspects of Che's life.

All that you need to provide a good seal for a normal 2-car garage is included, except possibly some isopropal alcohol to clean the area of cement where the strip will be glued. The strip, the glue gun and the glue are in the box, along with easy to understand instructions. You will also need a sharp knife, like a carpet razor knife, to cut and trim the edges for a perfect fit on the sides of your garage door. This product does not replace the rubber seal attached to the bottom of your garage door, rather it is applied to the cement underneath the garage door to form a perfect, air tight seal with the rubber seal on the bottom of the garage door. It works as advertised. Takes about one hour to install for both garage doors.

Shallow characters, stereotypical actions, simple plot.. The plot is easy to enough see from the beginning of the book...It has short sentences and a fluent writing style that make it an easy read...Still what a waste of time....I was interested in this book because of its context in late 50's space exploration....but I learned almost nothing on it from this book....If you want to read a good spy book, read John Carre.

It gripped me from the fly leaf! It's a good old-fashioned thriller. A man goes on a journey of self discovery because he's lost his memory while a disaster looms.

I read the book and then listened to it on tape with my husband and I think it is equally entertaining either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This is a very enjoyable book, well worth reading. Great suspense, very hard to put down. And great characters.Some reviewers have a tendency to \\"grade down\\" all of Follett's books because they compare them to his Eye of the Needle and don't find them as good. That's silly. Eye of the Needle is a classic, and no writer can be expected to write the perfect book every time. I typically favor \\"higher-brow\\" literature, yet I really enjoyed Code to Zero. It fully deserves 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty Work at Cape Canaveral","review":"It is 1958. A man awakens on the floor of the men's bathroom in Washington's Union Station and realizes that he has no memory. Is he the drunken bum that it appears, or is he someone else? As he works to restore his memory, he finds that he is scientist Claude Lucas, who holds a forgotten secret affecting America's future in space. It is hidden because someone deliberately erased his memory. But learning this brings peril. CIA agents pursue him, and they intend to kill him. While the countdown proceeds for America's desperate try for its first successful launch into space, Lucas uncovers the secret. Can he act in time to keep everything from blowing up? This story is not as powerful as Follett's recent Jackdaws, but it's a mighty fine thriller that will hold your attention. If you like spies and suspense, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a Good Novel","review":"I really think the idea behind this novel is spectacular. A man wakes up one morning in Washington DC, dressed like a bum, not knowing who he is. Turns out he is a NASA bigwig, and he has something to do with the apace race.Set in the 40's and 50's, the book is true to its setting, though there are a few mistakes. This could just be Follet changing history through fiction, so I can let that slide.What makes this book work is the superb characterization and background story that keeps you interested. Obviously, Follet knows what he is doing, and his strong points definitely overshadow the few mistakes and glitches.If you like this sort of novel, try:The Sigma Protocol, by Robert LudlumSoft Case, by John Misak"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointing","review":"Of course the protagonist lost not only his memory but had the misfortune to fall into an alternative universe where in 1958 there existed the concept of xeroxing documents along with Cadillac Eldorados and Ford Fiestas, which in our universe came along many years later. I too would have been as confused as our less-than-intrepid author, and I too would have lapsed into insipid dialog and unreal plot twists.Mr. Follett gives great credit at the end of the book to his researchers, etc., who helped him. Too bad none of them had the brains to do any research into contemporary history.For shame, Mr. Follett."},{"rating":"1","title":"ludicrous","review":"Like others, I loved some of Follett's earlier stuff, and this suffers badly in comparison. My eyes were rolling throughout at the repeated fantastic coincidences the author lards onto the plot - the \\"by an amazing coincidence, it just so happens that\\" events you are asked to swallow are far too many and far too implausible.The basic setting(espionage around one of the early US rocket launches) is a good one, but everything else is a let down.Finally, this is a minor thing, but the author has characters repeatedly refer to \\"Xeroxing\\" things and \\"carrying Xeroxes\\" around - Xerox machines were hardly common in 1958, and their usage as a verb was many years away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was just bad","review":"This was my first Follet novel and likely my last. This was just bad. That's the best way to describe it. The character interactions were strained. The mood and nuance of the book took very small and unsure steps. But mostly, there was zero creativity in getting from one situation to another.My problem there is that Anthony, the main protagonist, pretty much gets everything he needs to happen. If he were to suddenly need a can of Coke, you can bet that there would be one, on ice, wherever he was standing.I'm not going to go into the factual erros that others have explored other than to say they were there.Finally, the book just wouldn't end. It was as if the author needed to say, \\"Oh...and,\\" over and over again. The lesser protagonist, who I will not mention by name, and the way that character left the book was just sophomoric to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Follet","review":"I never really liked Follet novels except for \\"Wings of Eagles,\\" but \\"Code to Zero\\" is a very good book. I think it is one of his best works. Yes, it's different, but it's a book by a seasoned writer who plays with words, applies excellent charaterization, and pays attention to detail. \\"Code to Zero\\" is not your typical breathtaking thriller, but it's an interesting book and time well spent. If you prefer a fast-past thriller, I highly recommend the new powerful megathriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable cold war spy thriller about the space race","review":"At first, this seemed like a pretty typical espionage thriller and nothing too special or exciting. But as the story progressed, the more I got involved in it and enjoyed it. The space race element was intriguing, but it was the characters that really got me hooked. Through their history and relationships, which unfold to the reader as the amnesiac main character rediscovers them, Follett dramatizes how communism ultimately means the sacrifice of all one's own personal values, everything and everyone he holds most dear. This makes for high drama, conflict that is meaningful both intellectually and emotionally as these elements are united in the story. Quite well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging!","review":"Great story and characters. And it is so well written that I forget I am reading.

The Hammer of Eden continued his decline. Code to Zero cemented it. It has trite diaglogue, is badly edited, lacks the detail of works like Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca, and just plain stunk. The pages were double-spaced to make the book reach its required page length. One of the things I've most loved about his books was his ability to write vulnerable male characters and strong female characters. His characters were so thinly drawn as to be caricatures. Unless he goes back to being the writer he used to be, he's lost me. I doubt I will ever read him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"By far the worst book Ken Follett has written. It is incredible to me that the same person wrote \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" Ken Follett has been my favorite author for at least a decade and I always look forward with great anticipation to his new releases.

I have never known anyone, who has ever known anyone, who has ever known anyone who has had amnesia. Ok - I know it exists, it is a medical fact. Still, this tool for creating a story is so tired, so pat, so ridiculous!! And how do the people in Luke's life react when they find out that he has amnesia? Is even a single one of them dubious, the least bit skeptical? No!! They don't question it for a second, but act like it happens everyday, and immediately begin launching into a description of what they know of Luke's background, as if they were giving a recipe for onion dip.

Don't make me do it, Mom!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and mediocre","review":"Ken Follett's name still sells books and that would be the only reason to consider this book. Peter's review below is dead-on - this is flat stuff - nothing like vintage Follett (Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca, Lie Down with Lions etc were very good).Either he has lost that touch or this is a rush job or ...The only reason to give it 2 stars is that it maintained the minimum interest necessary for me to complete it(not a very long book.

Do yourself a favor and give this one a wide berth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I read this book in one day while on vacation. As always, Ken Follett did his research and created compelling characters in a non-stop action situation. Although this was not my favorite book by him, this book was excellent.

Just to get it over with. I didn't think it was filled with suspense, I thought it was predictable; it wasn't a thriller, it was a bore and the characters and their dialogue were corny. The premise is promising. A man who is suffering from amnesia has to discover who and what he and his mission are. And why government agents are \\"out to get him.\\" As I read this book, I kept thinking that I was reading from an elementary school reader. Mr. Follett insists on explaining each element of the thin plot and should give his readers more credit than that. I think most readers know what's going to happen in the story before the writer does! Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling novel from start to finish","review":"I don't think that I've ever read a book of this length faster. This books doesn't waste any time in grabbing hold of the reader. The characters are all superb. I want to be Dr. Claude 'Luke' Lucas. He is practically an American James Bond. Women want him and men want to be him. There isn't a single dull moment in this book and quite frankly I don't care about it's historical accuracy the story is second to none. Bravo Ken Follett!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Ken Follett ill?","review":"As a longtime fan of Ken Follett, I find his most recent work disturbingly lightweight. Specifically, is his interest in memory loss simply that of a professional writer, or is it a personal interest necessitated by his own loss of faculties? It is difficult to reconcile this effort with previous works, such as the splendid -- indeed, writing-textbook-quality -- \\"The Man from St. Petersburg.\\" Or, \\"Lie Down with Lions,\\" or \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" Seriously, I had the feeling that it was written by \\"a loved one,\\" who tried his or her inept best to ghost in Follett's style, but fell dismally short of the mark. I was delighted as I began, disappointed as the book progressed, then angry, and finally appalled and fearful by book's-end. Ken Follett: If you're alive and well, please let your fans know.

To be fair, if you had never read any of his really great works, it would probably be a good book. I, along with others, keep hoping for another 'Pillars of Fire.' This isn't it.

That's what got me hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing","review":"I have enjoyed many of Ken Follett's books. Sadly, I did not enjoy this one. It seemed as if it was written for a grade school student. To make matters worse, the characters did not react in realistic ways.All too often, the dialog goes something like this:Luke: \\"Hi, are you my wife? I am glad to have found you. I have amnesia, and I can't remember anything. Sorry I have been gone for so long.\\"Wife: \\"That's okay. I understand. What can I do for you?\\"While this may not be an exact quote, it is pretty close to what is in the book.Because of the ludicrous dialog, I just couldn't get into the book.

The idea is interesting enough and the opening scene holds promise but I found it to be a lackluster presentation and after about 80 pages or so I gave up on the novel. It felt like a dumbed down novel in characters and plot demonstrations. Hard to go into more details without giving spoilers.

Follet throws in some background about Luke, Anthony, Elspeth, and Billie's days at Harvard and then time spent as spies during the war. The lives of the four are intertwined till the very end and there is love and betrayal at every corner.Follett's strength is his charactarization and his research of the time period and the subject matter. This is a solid novel that is fun to read, but the end isn't a jolting climax, just a logical ending to all that preceded it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did it again","review":"I would guess the best I can say is when I see Follett I know it will be a good read. This was outstanding with all the elements of Politics(cold war) espionage, mystery, intrigue and all the elements to keep you finding time to continue reading. One of my favorite Authors and I will continue to read all that he writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner of the fist caliber","review":"Loved this book, it kept me up till 1 am, I HAD to finnish it. The book is suspenseful, and probable. I could not guess who the villans were, and that always impresses me and makes the reading more fun. The female characters are great. I did have to snicker at the sex scenes, I just couldn't picture a woman saying those things, especially about an outfit she had sewn herself, but I suppose it is the fantasy of the male author. Don't wait for the movie, movies are rarely as good as the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ken, wha' happen?","review":"This is, frankly, a terrible book. It's made more so by the fact that Follett has written great books before (Pillars of the Earth, for instance)...so what the heck is he doing here? It is, at best, a first draft for any novelist. The plot: contrived. The characters: unbelievable. The writing: tepid, sophomoric. Whoever was editing this should be taken to task as well; there are obvious repetitions of the plot (like \\"Pete's\\" reasons for looking up to Anthony getting explained at least twice) that should have never made it to print.Ken, you're too good a writer to be churning out garbage like this. Take your time and give us something worthy of your talent and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like earlier Follett","review":"Code to Zero, while not nearly as powerful a novel as Pillars of the Earth, and not up to the standards of Key to Rebecca or Eye of the Needle, is a vast improvement over Hammer of Eden. The plot has several surprising twists and keeps the reader involved with the characters, wondering who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Code to Zero also gives an interesting view of the cold war paranoia that existed during the late 1950's, especially as it related to the space program. Follett's views on mind controlling drugs and the state of 1950's psychological research are also fascinating. I recommend this as a quick and engaging read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, but that's all","review":"I really enjoy Ken Follett's books and began this with enthusiasm. I settled quickly into the tempo of the book, but was thoroughly disappointed with the details which pad out the story - the environment, the history of the times, the fine details of the characters. This book is set in the scientific world of space exploration in the late 1950s, but it could be set anywhere, at any time. The only real references to the background subject matter are the headers in italics at the beginnings of the chapters - the book is remarkably light on research - so unlike his other great books.We follow the adventures of our hero who has lost his memory. Unfortunately, he finds this out and sorts out his life with remarkably little trauma and ease. He has a history of course, but even this colourful past is pat and unbelievable.This is quite a weak story that kept me entertained enough to finish the book, but no more. I was frankly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat characters, borrowed plot, awkward storytelling.","review":"I really wanted to like this book - the premise of an amnesia victim struggling to find out who he is and what happened to him is, while not a new idea, a fun plot to read. But the flat characters never develop into people you can care about - and the flip-flopping of time lines to tell the story is awkward. The race for space with the Russians, amnesia, double agents, lost loves, cat and mouse games to stay alive - it's all here but it never comes together. Maybe Follett should have take a tip from Ludlum and gotten Gayle Lynds to co-write - perhaps then all the potential of this book would have come to fruition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop after the first 100 pages","review":"...and I wanted this to be good. I am fascinated by the idea of a man waking up and having no clue who or where he is. It started out great, but at some point turned into a series of car chases and simplistic dialogue. Hard to believe this is the same author who wrote Pillars of the Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this book only if (a) its free and (b) you're stranded","review":"Hard to believe that this book is by the same author that wrote \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"Night Over Water\\". Good premise that never, ever, gets off the launch pad for the entire book. Historical inaccuracies abound, i.e., Xerox photocopying in 1958, sloppy editing, i.e., in one scene Elspeth is driving a white '57 Chevy Bel Air convertible, in the next scene its a white Corvette and in the next scene the '57 Bel Air is back, and Mr. Follet assumes that the reader has no short or long term memory, i.e., he tells over and over why a character is loyal to another character. Poorly developed plot, no real character development and the way that events fall together are pretty incredible. James Lee Burke and Martin Cruz Smith are better at writing this kind of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, but becoming his standard","review":"I am very disappointed that the Master who wrote Pillars of the Earth and Key to Rebecca should deliver such vapid drivel. This is Freshman Writing at its worst. After a series of exciting, well-researched and superbly written books, Mr. Follett has churned out Night Over Water and Code to Zero. He treats our nation's space secrets and an intense ...... relationship with the same surface brush, without depth and with infantile thought processes. I have now twice vowed not to buy any more of his books. I hope I keep my promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Follet's best work","review":"I've found Ken Follett's books to be \\"hit or miss\\", with this one in the \\"miss\\" category.This book comes across as more mass market trash than any of his other works, and his research was shoddy at best.The whole basis of the book was that the Russians were spying on the American Rocket program, which is a bit hard to fathom, as the Russians were far ahead of the Americans at that time. Korolyov and his team had developed the R5 and R7 by that time and didn't need Von Braun's help.His explanation of the Buzz Bomb is laughable.Overall, not one of his best. I suggest you try \\"Lie down with Lions\\" or perhaps \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disappointment","review":"There is not anything anyone can say that would convince me that the author or this book is the same author of Key to Rebecca and Pillars of the Earth. This book was an insult at best - throughout the story the one thought that continually ran through my mind was 'Give me a break!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is definately a great suspense thriller written by a great writer. There can be no complaining about plot and character development, because both are handled very well by Mr. Follet in this one. From start to finish it delivers what it was written to deliver, suspense, action, and plenty of thrills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Code To Zero Stars","review":"An amnesia victim, with no sense of his identity or personal history, goes to the library and, within an hour or two, determines that he is a rocket scientist. He pulls books from the shelves, determines that he understands many scientific principles, and out of all the known professions and occupations concludes that he is one of the world's top rocket scientists. C'mon !! This is ridiculous. Coincidence after coincidence makes this Follett spy-novel a concocted farce. This book does not come close to \\"Eye of the Needle\\" or \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This one fell flat.","review":"\\"Code to Zero\\" is set during the Cold War, and the US/Soviet space race in particular. It is the story of a group of friends at Harvard who become scientists and spies, spouses and friends. We begin with Luke, who wakes up in a men's room with no memory of who he is. Bit by bit, Luke figures things out and events come to a head at the launch of an American satellite.The story is by no means awful... but based on Follett's earlier, compelling, powerful storytelling, it is a disappointment. The characters are somewhat flat, the dialog is stilted, and the plot is simplistic.Follett certainly set himself a high bar with his earlier novels, which I do recommend highly. I was sorry that Code To Zero didn't meet that same standard. If this were my first Follett novel, I'd probably not pick up another... don't make that mistake, the others are very worthwhile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been a great thriller &#65533;&#65533;.","review":"But the story has been developed too poorly (at least for Follet's standard).The idea is great, even if the \\"schizophrenic\\" protagonist reminds me Bourne, a Ludlum's character.There are too many coincidencies .... For example, I think that is quite impossible that a group of fellow students are, many years later, all involved in such an intrigue, with all these different rulesA plot like this needs more pages and more details to be told, and, I know, the author is able to..... I'm thinking for example to \\"The pillars of the earth\\", but this time he didn't...This novel has been a great disappointment, expecially because I'm a Follet fan.... I've read almost all its books and this is, no doubt, one of the worsts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far below par...","review":"This latest novel shows none of the brilliance of Pillars of the Earth, none of the fascination of Dangerous Fortune, none of the history in A Place Called Freedom, none of the intrigue and sharpness found in Eye of the Needle, and none of the action in On Wings of Eagles. I can't believe it could be the same author of the aforementioned stories. Even the editors dozed as they worked: neighbourhood, but favor. Follett borrows from Trevanian when using clothing to delineate characters: Bowler and Raincoat. For those who have read this book, How did Luke have his front door key with him in Huntsville when at no time had he found his own clothes, wallet or other, and none of his friends had given him a spare key? For me, this novel reflects the problem with large advances and small expectations for popular writers. The author's grand smile on the back cover may just reflect his awareness that he has put one over on his publisher and his dedicated fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey to the max","review":"Ok, first of all the amnesia story line is interesting for the first few chapters and then really snowballs into unbeliavability. Also both the female characters are aggressive, beautiful and smart - let's try to cover all the bases of political correctness. The main character is a macho man, except around women where he is a total wimp and too much of a gentlemen to be believed. Actually, this would make a fair movie of the week, but only on the comedy channel. Almost laughed out loud in spots during the romantic interlude passages. Oh well, at least it is a very quick read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book disappointed the devout Follet fan in me. The book does have exciting moments, but its often very predictable, a trait definitely not desirable in any suspense books. The amnesia thing does seem interesting, but the author doesnt pull it off that well. I found Bourne Identity, (by Robert Ludlum) which has a similiar idea, immensely more exciting. I would recommend that to any avid reader of suspense. This book however is just okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"I have read all of Ken Follett's books and he is one of my favorite authors. NO WAY could the author who wrote \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" be the same author who wrote \\"Code to Zero!\\" So, I think it must be one of two possible explanations. 1) Ken Follett ran afoul of the CIA and suffered the same fate as \\"Luke\\".....he woke up one morning and couldn't remember anything, including how to write. Or 2) A high school student wrote the book and Ken signed his name. Considering the absurdity of the entire plot involving the memory loss, I would conclude the latter. Along with the inaccuracies, the characters and the plot are absurd and simplistic. A child could have predicted the outcome. Please, Mr. Follett, make your next book worthy of YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely told but flawed premise and facts","review":"The spy story was told well and could have been a nice read if one could forget the absurd premise, overlook glaring historical inacuracies, and unbelievable happenstance.I guess, time to move on to another author. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Follett","review":"I gave this 2 stars only because I expected more from Follett. The dialogue was sophomoric, the action was inconsistent (why would Anthony only erase Luke's memory instead of killing him as he did with other friends), and the development of characters was not up to Follett's usual fare. After reading \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\", which I thought was one of the better books I've read,this one was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Done","review":"This is poorly written story by an author from whom one expects much more. One of Mr Follet's strengths has always been his wonderful plots with their strict attention to detail. This one has more holes than the proverbial loaf of swiss cheese. Descriptions are sophmoric. Very disappointing. If you've got to read this do yourself a favor and check it out of the library. Don't fret if there's a waiting list. You aren't missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!!","review":"i quite enjoyed ken follet's new book, code to zero. i've been a fan of his for a while now and have read pretty much everything he's written. although not quite as elaborate or involved as his other books, this book does not disappoint. it was fast-paced, exciting and, in general, a good read! if you're not too fussy about facts and just like a good story, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ken who?","review":"if on the cover it is not shown 'ken follet' as author, how many copies this book will sell and how many review it will collect? luigi accomazzo italy"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is as light as an episode of Gilligan's Island.","review":"This will be the final Ken Follett book I ever read. I don't know what has happened that would cause a writer with such skill to spit out such drivel as Code to Zero. From reading the first chapter, you can preety much plot out the plot line and character development. I wonder if Mr. Follet thought of adding anything realistic to this book. At no time did I feel suspense, or danger, sympathy or affection for any of the characters or situations. This book is as light as an episode of Gilligan's Island, and would have been better written by a romance novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follett does it again","review":"I bought the book Saturday and a week later I had finished it. It leaves no room for putting it down and you're just turning one page after another to find out why this apparently nice main character Lucas has lost his memory. Follett has done his research about rockets very well and you feel you're right there following the breathtaking event of launching America's first rocket. Follett has a way of describing people and the settings in a very vivdly image and I didn't find it difficult to see the whole story running as a movie inside my head while I was reading. I gave it four stars though 'cause the ending is maybe a little too ordinary. But I can highly recommend Code to Zero"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ken Follett, please don't do this again!","review":"This Follett is a mere shadow of his previous novels. I am a huge Ken Follett fan. I have read every one of his books and look forward to them. This book is written by a Ken Follett imposter! It is a huge disappointment with a ridiculous plot, featuring an incestuous bunch of people who are best buddies at Harvard and then segue into each other's lives forever after. They marry each other, they divorce each other, they plot and they plan. This book is very readable, a Follett trademark. But as the pages turn, I found myself getting angrier and angrier for being a sucker who bought this book in good faith and who was rewarded by junk. Such a poor effort that Follett, in the epilogue, mistates the moon walk as July 1968 and not the actual date of 1969."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Possibilities","review":"There's one great strength of Follett's that some reviewers here don't mention. How do you get any better than with this opening line: \\"He woke up scared?\\" Are you compelled to read on? I certainly was. By the end, I enjoyed \\"Code to Zero\\" far more than \\"Jackdaws\\" whose characters seemed over-the-wall, though true life is often stranger than fiction so his motley WWII gang of women and homosexual spies may have been more realistic than we would assume. The only thing that stretched my disbelief in this novel was the speed in which the hero and NASA scientist recovered his memory as the 'clues' unlocked his drug-induced blocks. The good news is it has inspired me to read more about this amnesiac condition to find out if it could be so easily bypassed. There is no doubt Follet's masterful story telling talents are as gripping as ever even when readers complain about his treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little confusing","review":"The whole book was totally different than what I am used to reading. It tended to jump around a bit to much and was semi-hard to follow at times. It needed to reenstated its points more often and not throw so much information at the reading in such a short period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Code To Zero Did Exactly What I Wanted It To Do","review":"I bought this book in an Airport when I was on a long lay-over. I read it in about 12 hours and it did exactly what I wanted it to do, it passed the time. Isn't that part of what all books are supposed to do? If the author keeps you entertained while you're reading the book, his/her job is done.The story line was very good, above-average in my opinion. I had never read Follete before as best-selling books aren't what I usually purchase.There were no slow moments in this book. I didn't analyze it for historical accuracy but taken purely as a work of fiction written for entertainment, it was very fulfilling.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something fun and exciting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"For the author of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", \\"On the wings of eagles\\" this is a disappointig book. I bought it in the airport before a long intercontinental flight, thinking it would take me trough the flight. That was two weeks ago, I still didn't finish it. If you look for a cold war - time, spy novel, try something else. To bad for Follet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"This was one of the fastest reads I've ever had! I couldn't help myself, I really couldn't put it down! The suspense is skillfully done in this tale. It reminded me of the \\"Eye Of The Needle\\" - I found myself wondering if things I knew happened were going to happen in the book! If you enjoy Follett's work, all of his work, then you will enjoy this book. It's not as complex as \\"Dangerous Fortune\\" or \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" but it definitely grabs you and pulls you in immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting!","review":"I don't feel how you can state that \\"The Great American Midget Toss\\" is humorous. I feel its a very degrading song, especially when it talks about throwing another minority individual. Would it be funny if they sang about tossing any other minority individual? Its a disgrace to those who have dwarfism, and its a disgrace to parents who have children with dwarfism. Would it also be funny if they sang about tossing those with Downs Syndrome, MDA, or any other disability? As a band, they should have used better wisdom and knowledge before they wrote a very degrading song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but not yet","review":"I love most classical vocal music and sing in a choral group myself, so I was looking forward to hearing this \\"child-wonder.\\" I have to say I was disappointed.

Not only is pitch in question throughout, but her phrasing is very poor--as if someone told her exactly how to phrase?...There were alot of child prodigies who sang better than this, Deanna Durbin comes to mind...don't waste your money on this unless your related to her: better thought, if you're a relative, go pay for a few good voice lessons for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not my idea of the voice of an angel!","review":"Charlotte Church is okay and this CD is okay but when I hear her voice I don't think of an angel at all, now Sarah Brightman has a voice that makes me think of angels.

No way!","review":"I keep seeing the h-word (hype) being thrown around in regards to CC. It just ain't so. She gets practically no radio airplay, her TV appearances are usually limited to one song (her wonderful PBS special being the exception), and she doesn't show up on MTV five times a day. She gets nowhere near as much publicity as Madonna, LeAnn Rimes or Britney Spears (the POSTER CHILD for hype). Word of mouth, people recommending this CD to others, is what sells \\"Voice of an Angel\\". She's practically owned Billboard's Classical Crossover charts since March, and her new CD, titled simply \\"Charlotte Church\\", comes out in November. It's a good bet she'll eventually occupy Number One AND Number Two on the chart."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Voice of an Angel\\" - So What?","review":"I've been bought many classical recordings so that I didn't regret to buy.

I'm a teenager myself (15) and am usually into the whole rock/alternative music but this was a nice change. I think she has a wonderful voice and I'm thankful she shared it with us all. I do think she could have picked songs a little more diverse. I like hearing church songs but she could have added a few non-church songs as well to capture everyones listening tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"not yet...why don't we wait a few years and see what she has left to give us. She's too young for such a big undertaking. It could seem like exploitation---but perhaps her destiny is to be a bright little shining star singing for all the dignitaries of the world, and making people very happy. She has the qualities that people love, she's young and she is a \\"good little singer,\\" but should not be putting such a strain on such a young voice. She may never have a career beyond these few \\"wunderkind\\" years, but no doubt she's made a lot of people very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sincere but thin","review":"Let Charlotte Church grow up please. Let's check again for her in about 10 yrs...doubtful that we will still be listening to her unless...she is allowed to mature, develop interpretive ability and have more heart than a boy-soprano. But then it could be that she joins the ranks of many, many good, professional singers who don't achieve the limelight.There is sincerity in her voice, she's cute... her voice crystal clear, but vapid and thin. It's good church music though and we applaud her love of music and singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate, More Predictable, Youthful Athleticism","review":"Once again the music industries fascination with youthful athleticism has brought about another unfortunate record. It is time we got back to appreciating years of training, and living long enough to sing songs the way they were intended.I look forward to Charlotte Church's album after she has been further trained and gotten A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE.Overall the CD was, predictable and lacking any real human emotion. Much like an operatic Monster Truck pull."},{"rating":"1","title":"a typical breathy mashed-pototoe sound loved by the British","review":"I wasn't the least impressed. As a professional singer ( have been for years, and having had a wonderful 6 octave range at seven years of age, and teachers wise enough to reign me in )and a teacher, I found raw ability, but not finesse. Too judgmental you say, well, it you are going to sell her like a \\"professional\\" she had better put out like one. Her diction is terrible, and quite frankly she sounded like a girl trying to sound like a boy soprano. She has lots of obvious flaws in her production -- a wobbling jaw when she sings loud notes, and a terrible habit of forcing and pulling the head back on the highest notes. Sadly, unless she gives up singing and starts to really train properly she will be only another drop in the pan. Interestingly, those who love her the most have no understanding of the music she sings. I hope that same mindset is not running her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mockery of the Art Form","review":"The girl may have some staying power, but the fact that singers such as Church and Bocelli have become a mainstay of opera lovers is a mockery of the art that I have grown to love. Church may have a cute voice, but she, like Bocelli, has no business calling herself an opera singer as she did at the Music awards. An opera singer is supposed to have great vibrato, virtuostic tone, and a true control of their voice. I feel a degree of monotone quality in Church's voice that leaves me bored and tired. This CD is a waste of time. Buy something by Cecilia Bartoli if you want some real singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're not a classical music fan, you may be after this..","review":"I read about this artist online several months ago, and had to order my copy from Europe, since Amazon didn't yet have it here! It was well worth the wait. The upper registers of Charlotte's soprano have a depth and maturity very rarely found in young singers. There are a few times when her voice betrays its youth (she needs to work on her breathing a bit), but only if you're listening for it. Those songs which she lists as her favorites are particularly endearing, as she really puts her heart into it and seems to just lose herself in the sheer joy of singing. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice that is as refreshing as the performer.","review":"Young Miss Church demonstrates quite a range of vocal talent on this disc. Yes she may faulter slightly in the highest part of her vocal register and she also may not support the longer duration of some notes but do not miss the big picture. Miss church has a voice that can reach down into your being and allow you to transend to a higher spiritual state of mind. With continued coaching and practice she will have the ability to attract many newcomers to an area of music that has basically been overlooked by the majority of the population."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystified by all the hoopla","review":"I read all the rave reviews, heard that the album was platinum, and thought I could not go wrong by buying this CD. Boy, was I wrong! Charlotte has a good voice but I don't like to spend my money on \\"good for her age\\" type music. She has trouble reaching and holding the highest notes in her range and just doesn't compete with major opera diva you might name."},{"rating":"1","title":"a premature debut","review":"I don't think it's wise for Miss Church to receive so much hype at this moment. Although she has a pleasant appearance, there's nothing exceptional in her voice and singing. You may find many girls of her age who can actually sing better. It's better for to nurture her talents carefully rather than making such rash career decisions at such a tender age. Frankly, I'm bored by her singing after putting on the disc for a couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"To all who criticize young Charlotte all I can say is \\"baloney\\". I'm no opera critic. In fact, when some aspiring Miss America contender begins caterwalling in the talent competition I use that time for a restroom break.Miss Church, on the other hand, holds my attention--sends chills up my spine on several selections--and awakened an interest in music I did not possess previously. (God help me, my last CD purchase was Britney Spears.)Charlotte may be young and incompletely polished, but the sheer potential of the lass astounds me.Hopefully she will only improve with age and, in doing so, will convert others such as myself to the beauty of her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Church lives up to the hype.","review":"I am a 14 year old classical music fan. I'm not like the other one that posted, saying he studies classical sopranos. I am a muscian and a fan. To tell me that she is just another girl with just another voice is false. Why anyone would be so set on bringing her down is beside me. To all the people considering buying this CD, do it. Don't listen to these shallow pessimists who only want to bring down out the bad in her. She isn't perfect, but she does have a Voice of an Angel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, marvelous, fabulous, beautiful!","review":"\\"Voice of an Angel\\" brought tears to my eyes and sent chills down my spine at the same time. It's that good. A few of these reviewers said they were disappointed and could name better singers. Well I've heard nearly all of the ones they cited and found that, while they are indeed excellent sopranos, they don't have anywhere near the same sense of wonder and joy that Charlotte has. Charlotte's \\"Pie Jesu\\" is the most beautiful song I've ever heard anyone sing. She gets my vote as the best soprano going. (And just to be fair, Kiri Te Kanawa's \\"Panis Angelicus\\" is a bit nicer than Charlotte's rendition. It's the one song on the CD I'd like her to re-record when she's older.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice","review":"I really enjoyed the talented voice of Ms. Church on this CD. \\"Pie Jesu\\" is a soaringly beautiful, and emotional rendition of the song. The songs I really loved in addition to the previously mentioned are: \\"Danny Boy\\" \\"I Vow to Thee, My Country\\" and \\"My Lagan Love\\". The other songs weren't as impressive. They didn't really move me or stir me either musically or emotionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine-tingling","review":"I'm no musical expert, especially in the classical field, but I know what I like--when music gives me that spine-tingling thrill, like Charlotte Church's Pie Jesu and Ave Maria do. I'm surprised at the negative and rather venomous reviews--why not just listen and enjoy, rather than try to decide if her voice is being ruined and whether or not she's the best you've ever heard? I say--she's a talented and amazing young artist. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely moving.","review":"I purchased this CD based upon the reviews I had heard and read and what little I had heard of her on the Ford Global Anthem commercials.The first time I listened to this CD, I was so moved by her voice that I cried while listening to and hanging on every song. I could feel the power of her voice throughout every bone in my body.I highly recommend this CD to everyone I know, regardless of their musical preferences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, peaceful, wonderful music: a talented girl","review":"I checked into Amazon today to try to get the second CD of Charlotte Church. My husband, 58, never likes the kind of music I do, but Charlotte Church sings to his soul...and to mine. I was surprised to read so many critical comments of her work. What do people want ? Besides, they can listen to it in most good stores and decide not to buy it then and there....no need to throw it away later. It would be a dream to be able to sing so beautifully. By the way, have you heard her sing on the latest car commercial ? She's taking that \\"shaky\\" voice all the way to the bank and to a wonderful career. some people don't know quality when it's blatant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Do Credit to Artist","review":"The CD Voice Of An Angel fails to do credit to Charlotte Church's wonderful voice. The sound track appears to have been done by amateurs. The orchestra, chorus and instruments...even the celtic harp...totally overwhelm the soloist, who sounds as if she is in an echo chamber far away from the microphone. Arrangements of even such familiar tunes as Danny Boy are very bad ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful young voice; I hope to hear more.","review":"I just heard Charlotte Church on PBS for the first time today; will definitely order the CD. She has a beautiful clear voice that can only improve with maturity. I always admire those who can sing well, since I don't, and this child truly has \\"the Voice of an Angel.\\" Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the cute little girl... this is genuine music!","review":"I am no sucker for fancy packaging or slick personalites or cute faces. This album was bought for me by a close friend who has also turned me onto the likes of Yo-Yo Ma & Pavarotti, as well as other classical\\\\opera artists I'm sure you wouldn't call \\"fads\\". Charlotte's voice is stellar, and the songs are profoundly spiritual. I hope she continues her training and continues to grow as an artist, for this album is very moving. Listen to the samples, if you're not sure... sound like a no-talent little kid to you? if you think so maybe you should leave opera behind and try rap or something more suited to those without appreciation for substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"relax and enjoy, don't critique!","review":"The average person wants to hear beautiful music not study her technique. It is beautiful music from an angelic child. It will move you and inspire you if you don't get caught up in the whole issue of critiquing her i.e \\"She's not opera.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Potential-- I'll Wait and See","review":"\\"Voice of an Angel\\" gives the listener a promise that one day Church will be a satisfying soprano. For now, however, her voice is slightly thin in the higher ranges and she lacks so much of the real emotion that makes the greatest sopranos so wonderful to hear. I believe that one day she will be among the best in the world. At present she is a very talented adolescent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature to be called a soprano.","review":"When I heard about Charlotte Church that she is a 13 year-old soprano with an angelic voice, I was really excited. But after I listened to her, I got really disappointed. First of all, she doesn't have an angelic voice I was looking for. I thought the voice of sopranos like Emma Kirkby and Kathleen Battle sounds more angelic and innocent than her voice. Of course Church has a voice mature to be a 13 year-old, but that does not mean that she has a mature voice and technique to be a soprano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of the Millenium","review":"....The CDs Church has produced only offer a glimpse of what we will hear in 10 years when her voice has matured. If she stays the course ...she will be one of the greatest sopranos or mezzo sopranos up there with Callas, Tibaldi, and Te Kanawa....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Awsome","review":"This album takes us places on earth we've never heard before. A voice that has come from another dimension. This and Angelic Piano are our favorite CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her voice is lovely , but the caliber of music is premature.","review":"Charlotte has a great deal of potential. With time and tutoring she will blossom. Her debut CD simply should not have been so difficult. She struggles often and sings out of her strongest range. At many times during the CD I really enjoy listening. However, there are also times when I cringe. I find it difficult to listen to the entire CD without gettting annoyed by her immaturity. The problem is that she is marketed as a prodigy and expectations are set incredibly high. (ie. She's no Michael Jackson or LeAnn Rimes) I do look forward to her future career and listening to her as her voice matures in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this now!!!","review":"Unlike most kids my age, I'm not usually into whatever's popular. I like what I like, and I love this! Buy this CD, stop reading this review and buy this now! Charlotte has an amazing talent! Buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money , over hyped dissapointment","review":"Looking for a new Barbara? Andrea? Don't look here. Just average production quality. Average voice would make an exceptional boy soprano. Find a better recording of the boy soprano. Find her publisists and buy them instead!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute kid; no vocal range","review":"Voice of an Angel? No, just marketing hype.Charlotte Church does fine with songs that avoid the higher and lower registers where her voice noticably fails her. Unfortunately, there's only a couple such songs on this recording. Most of the album makes for tough listening, unless you're tone deaf.Ms. Church was exposed to the world much too soon. Give her 5 years and she might develop a truly angelic voice and make a go of a singing career. Such early exposure will probably doom her career. For now she's just a novelty act."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"High Notes\\" equals hype","review":"Charlotte Church is quite frankly another singer whose hype and \\"high notes\\" have made her regarded sometimes as a prodigy and opera singer. I don't have perfect pitch, but I'm almost certain she does not go much higher than a high C. Well trained Mezzo's hit high C's. She makes the notes she sings sound high. Her vibrato sound horrible at the least. She sounds like an unchanged voice forcing itself to change. Her repotoire is appropriate for her age but the vibrato and \\"adult fullness\\" she adds are not. Some people say I'm jealous (I'm a fourteen year old lyric colorutra)of her fame and talent. I am only jealous of the former not the latter. She had the right connections to reach it to the top but when her voices goes through maturity she will come tumbling down."},{"rating":"2","title":"better with each repeat listening.","review":"Charlotte is obviously young and lacks the vocal support to sustain prolonged notes but I must admit that after listening repeatedly to the CD I was impressed with the vibrato in low registers as well as the intonation throughout. I agree with the reviewer that I was most reminded of the similarity to boy choir sound in her very clear high tones. The choice of music was also good and it brought back some very dear memories of Welsh choirs I heard some years ago in Wales."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice Of An Angel","review":"When I first heard this cd, I couldn't believe the voice was coming from a 12 year old! She's got the most beautiful voice in the world. I would recommend this one to my entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I love this CD. I first saw Charlotte on David Letterman, and I bought \\"Voice of an Angel\\" the next day. What a talent! I wonder if Charlotte will do any Christmas music this year; imagine her rendition of \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" or \\"Silent Night\\"! I hope she gets the support she needs to continue her career in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Fresh Air!","review":"Compare Charlotte's voice to any of her contemporaries and you'll agree that she's the queen of teens. Her singing of \\"Pie Jesu\\" alone is worth the entire collective output of Britney, Cristina, Jessica and Mandy. Let's get off our high horses and judge her for what she is... a super-talented teenager without peer in her generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ticket to joy","review":"Can you stand one more joyous rave? This CD is something special, an amazing accomplishment. She truly has a voice from Heaven! And she's improving dramatically as her follow-up album shows. But every time I play \\"Voice of an Angel\\" I'm brought back to that magic moment when I first heard her sing. Something told me right away this was a superstar in the making.I'm every bit as amazed that some snobbish reviewers got their delicate noses out of joint and needed to put little Charlotte her in her place by their ugly pans and silly comparisons. It's their world that her singing takes me away from in the first place! For which I can only say, Thank you Charlotte!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not the voice of an angel...","review":"It's simply embarrassing to listen to the poor child's ridiculously artificial singing. It certainly does not touch the heart of a listener with some musical understanding and interest in artistic quality. What I recommend is that Charlotte Church should take some lessons with a children's choir and stop pretending to be what she isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This young lady truly has a voice of an Angel.","review":"I have watched Charlotte Church on PBS and listened to her CD, Voice of an Angel. She is truly gifted. She is a refreshing change from that generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful voice","review":"Very beautiful voice! It is unusual that she is so young and chooses classical songs. Many young people today choose rock and roll and other popular music. I really admire Charlotte!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, soothing, comforting, engaging.","review":"This CD was purchased mainly because of the title. Then I read the list of songs and was further encouraged. Next, the cashier shared her excitement about the CD. I listened to it immediately upon entering my car and I was not disappointed in the least! Add my name to a growing list of Charlotte Church supporters. I pray God will continue to bless her and that she will continue to use this gift as she has so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 12 year old boy could make the same sounds","review":"And stay on key. I have a lot of respect for Miss Church's publicity agent but I would have more respect for her if she would have gotten singing lessons and then been a 20 year old diva who could handle a song that requires more than one emotion. I found Miss Church shrill in the extreme and hope that she will take her desire to be a singer to the next level: beyond the hype and into the art form"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not sing","review":"Her voice has no range, she can't come close to the higher notes in these songs, her performances are devoid of emotion, and she her choice of songs is completely unoriginal. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice for a 12 year old, but no good for teenagers....","review":"Good voice for a 12 year old, but no good for teenagers, her voice could be used in ways more open to all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is where she started....","review":"This CD, when compared to her other, more recent, works, is amazingly simple. The amount of talent that she had as a 12 year old is astounding. I can truly see the improvement in her technique from this one to the most recent CD.I liked this CD. It had many songs that I love (\\"When at Night I go to Sleep\\" and \\"Jerusalem\\") with songs that I had never heard before.I would recommend listening to the CD in addition to her later ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"My goodness this is good!","review":"I recently saw this young girl on one of the late night talk shows and indeed thought I had been transformed to the great beyong and was listening to the voice of an angel. Her soprano voice is lucid, quite musical and infinitely listenable. The pieces range from straight opera to modern stage to traditional folk. Her voice carries them all to new heights, and the arrangements are equally stunning. You may find that you play it from start to finish and want to hit the start button again. This is a beautiful and fun album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice really does sound like an angel.","review":"I first saw Charlotte Church on Oprah. She was outstanding! You never would have thought this 13 year old girl could sound so heavenly. I never liked opera before but she makes you wish you could sing like her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting, angelic, amazing and inspirational","review":"As a 48 year-old lover of inspirational and traditional music, I was immediately addicted when I first heard Charlotte on the PBS special. Having now had the CD for a couple of weeks, I have become hooked on the beautiful music of her voice. Not only are the selections heart-warming and inspirational, but her delivery is pure. I was actually dumb-founded when I saw the one-star ratings on the review summary, but then I read them and realized that the reviews came from a few \\"want-to-be's\\" and are very unattractively generated out of envy. Bemoan all they will, Charlotte has a truly God-given gift that the rest of us are lucky to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a young person but not outstanding","review":"I agree with other reviewers when they say that she sings with little technical expertise, most noticably breath control, phrasing, and actually FEELING something while you are singing. She shouldn't have made this CD so young. She'll probably grow up and mature into a nice professional voice. But I know several people who are as good/better than Charlotte Church and I agree that if you like this CD, you should try REAL opera, such as Callas, Sutherland, or others. You might find it to be better and certainly more culturally enriching than this CD, and don't be turned off because it's opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Church is a delight.","review":"I don't compare her to another, more seasoned, singer because she's only 13 and no one at that age can \\"compete\\" with the mature pros. Being 13 and the type of music she performed on her CD makes her very appealing. Remember, she's still a kid and for a kid she does it very well. Charlotte: Keep up the good work and be a teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of an Angel, an perfect CD","review":"De CD heeft aan al mijn verwachtingen voldaan, de kwaliteit is prima en de levering erg snel dus een zeer goede keus."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly mastered - Voice of an Angel","review":"To me this CD was poorly mastered. Miss Church's talented voice is totally dominated by her accompaniment; further not much volume range either as I attempted to bring her out of the background fog.

A must!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a kid singing.","review":"I'm really amazed that anyone would let a child sing Opera. I've always heard that singing that type of music before the voice has time to mature can destroy your voice. In fact, I know people that this has happened to. They developed nodes on their vocal chords.I listened to the recording and I found it annoying to listen to. I enjoy Opera and Classical music, but I want to hear them sung by a mature voice, not a child. I really don't understand how this album ever got recorded. Who did she know? I heard Andrew Lloyd Webber. I guess it's true. It really is who you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl is how old??? I can't wait to hear more from her","review":"After seeing(and hearing) Charlotte I knew she was something special. She is certainly blessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Okay so she doesn't sing every note perfectly or pronounce every world with perfect diction, but she's only 12 years old. Surely everyone that has any music background knows that she has a heavenly voice. I think with a few more years of voice lessons, she will be one of the best opera singers around. Her cd is a great first start. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly good performance but technically dissapointing...","review":"You've got to give her some credit! The voice is angelical and the music is appeasing. It is one of my favorites in the car after a long days'work. I'm however, appalled at the recorded sound, and it even tells you it was SBM processed. Difficult to believe as it does'nt project the individual instruments nor a perspective of the background. It is ill taped and apparently by amateurs at best. A remastered ADD from 40 years ago sounds better! This is a major setback in todays' standard, in an otherwise enjoyable performance, without getting picky at the genius limitations of a 13 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Church shows promise of developing the \\"Voice of an Angel\\"","review":"While I enjoyed hearing Charlotte Church's voice, when it could be heard over the accompaniment, only one song on the entire recording came close to the promise of the CD's title -- the Caccini \\"Ave Maria.\\" The song was achingly lovely, despite Church's awkward phrasing/breathing and other technical difficulties.Every song on the disc is nice, but when heard in one sitting, the songs become monotonous, because Church simply hasn't lived long enough to know what she's singing about. There's no expressiveness or emotion in her singing yet. However, with more study and with age, she has the potential to develop the \\"Voice of an Angel\\" that this CD promises, but fails to deliver. I look forward to hearing future recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's called child labor","review":"this isn't a good thing to be doing to a child's voice. the strain is showing now and will show worse as she gets older. this shouldn't be supported."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to those who sing","review":"The conception of this album alone makes a total mockery of those of us who actually indulge in the elements of voice, such as professional voice training. Sure, Charlotte Church is entertaining, perhaps cute, but she is no singer, much less a professional one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While she has a lovely voice, the total sound quality of the CD was poor. There was no personality, no emotion coming through in any of the selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Over-hyped","review":"It is nice that the public enjoys beautiful music purely performed, much in the tradition of boy sopranos in Great Britain. Belting it's not, and Charlotte's delivery is refreshingly simple and direct. That being said, the echo effects and background are clearly designed to give the voice a weight and aura it unsurprisingly does not possess. Also, though more subtle than belting, Charlotte is resorting to vocal tricks to inappropriately \\"darken\\" her sound (make it seem more mature) that are not good for her voice in the long run. I've heard a number of more talented and better-voiced singers at her age and younger that were not blessed or cursed with such publicity. Pretty sounds, yes. Voice of an angel? Give me a break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Voice, Boring Sellections!","review":"Okay yes Charlotte Church has a nice voice that is quite impressive considering she was only like 11 or 12 years old when she made this recording and I was very impressed when I heard her sing on a TV show so I bought this Voice Of An Angel CD and one of her other CDs, the one where she is wearing a red coat on the cover. Her voice is nice but to be honest I don't enjoy her CD's all that much, I can take Charlotte Church in small doses but not listen to a whole CD of her singing because some of the selections she chose are kind of insipid and just really don't interest me and that is just my personal opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INDEED ANGELIC","review":"FOR ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE HEARD THE SOUNDS OF YOUNG OPERA SINGER CHARLOTTE CHURCH YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT HER SOUNDS ARE QUITE ANGELIC. THE TALENT OF THIS YOUNG LADY SENDS CHILLS UP MY SPINE. AS SHE SINGS EVERY HIGH NOTE I GET CHILLS. SUCH AMAZING TALENT COMING FROM SOMEONE SO YOUNG IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO IMPRESS ANYBODY. I GIVE THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S ALBUM 5 STARS. SHE WILL BE ONE WE NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is a beautiful CD! Buy it now!I started listening to Classical music rather than anything else about 6 months ago and I bought this CD only 2 weeks ago. Between this CD and the Classical music on the radio, I am one happy person.This CD shows talent at its best, without a bunch of over-produced junk. Yes, it is true, Church's voice may falter slightly once or twice in one of the songs, but her voice is extremely developed and strong, and-geez- she was only twelve when she recorded the CD! I hope Church keeps making more CD's just like \\"Voice of an Angel\\". And one more thing: I think that the title is a perfect description of Church's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest.","review":"I freely admit that I am no music expert. But I know when someone is off key. Just listen to the sample recording of The Lord's Prayer, especially the words \\"name\\" and \\"heaven\\", she wavers all over the place and seems to run out of breath. That might be fine for singing in my church choir but I expected something a little better from a \\"prodigy\\". I am of Welsh descent and would be proud to have a real 12-year-old prodigy representing the Welsh people. Unfortunately I don't think she is that outstanding and I am going to wait and see if her voice and technique improve. Her singing and technique seem mediocre to me. (By the way folks the angelic quality you think you are hearing is just an echo, not her voice. Even I sound good in the shower.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"Maybe it comes over much better live, but this CD was such a dissappointment. I suppose its a perfectly nice voice, but she has poor breath control, an unfocussed tone, little expression...It wouldn't be so bad, but there are so many young singers (boys and girls both) with better voices and better musicianship than this who get no chance to make themselves heard. So here's the bottom line. If this music isn't familiar to you, but you like it, great - now go out if you can to listen to some live performances of some of the music - try the Durufle - and welcome to the glories of classical singing. If you like listening to classical music and you like female singing - give this one a pass and buy some more von Otter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief","review":"If the soundtrack to heaven is Charlotte Church's ear-splitting caterwauling, than please sign my name up on the eternal damnation sheet now. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's all right, but...","review":"I'm a soprano currently studying music in a university. I say she has done a lot to improve the public's opinion about opera and for that I am grateful. But, she is far to young to be preforming so much and to have cd out. Her voice will improve with age, and I'd much rather wait until she is able to use her talents to her fullest advantage before I buy anything. In the meantime, I'll buy cd's from the truly great prefomers. They will show you what it's supposed to sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good, but not there yet","review":"She's nice and has a lot to offer, but I'd rather spend my money on Kathleen Battle, Kiri Te Kanawa, etc., etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"I have never purchased classical music in my life but after hearing Ms. Church sing I was simply captivated. If I believed in mythology I would think she was a siren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not as good as the hype:","review":"Charlotte does have a very beautiful voice. The young lady is indeed very talented. The comparison of her voice to that of a young boy's is right on. She is the same age and her voice the same maturity as theirs. I found the selections on this cd much more suited to her voice and personality than the ones on her other cd. As to her billing of \\"opera singer\\", I think not. Many of the local colleges provide better opera than she does. Her high notes were strident and shaky enough to make me uncomfortable. Also, I could not understand any of her words. As a linguist, I was saddened by this. I see vocal music as the incomprable combination of poetry and tone. To understand the poetry however, one must understand the individual words. Charlotte has tone but that's about it. I will love to hear her when her voice and her personality have matured and when she has developed other areas of her musicality."},{"rating":"2","title":"only 12???","review":"My God...she has an amazing voice for a 12 year old...unbelievable. Her singing isn't yet very polished (as in not always being in tune, taking breaths where they shouldn't be taken)...but for her age she's still phenomenal. But I just couldn't give it 5 stars bc I beleive they rushed her to make a cd before she was mature enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for relaxation","review":"I've had this album since April 1999.

But to become a classical singer takes training beyond the age of 12 no matter how gifted you are.

My quibble is that a 12-song \\"millennium\\" collection on a CD is just chintzy, especially when the songs are not extended play versions.

The concert was and is one of the top two shows that I have ever been to (yes better than U2, Prince and Dave Matthews) it was the first time I ever saw a band with a horn section, and the band really rocked that night. I got Live Baby Live the first day it was released and to my amazement the cd matched up perfectly to the concert I saw. The sound was as good as was the awesome song selection.It has been over 10 years since the cd came out, and I still to this day grab this cd for any road trip! It really is INXS at their best. The greatest hits are represented and the feeling that you can only get from a live band giving its all is there.

Shine: there is an initial shine that is beautiful-- keep in mind though the shine goes away but granite has great reflective properties so once it is clean it looks sharp3. Smell: it's a strong pleasant smell.Since it's just a cleaner there isn't much more I can say. It would be five stars if the initial shine remained.

That someone was me.I won't get into the plot, because the Amazon description is accurate enough, as far as I can tell. I don't know, I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes. I couldn't take any more. My stomach hurt too much from laughing. I probably had a bigger movie budget in the cupholder in my car that I use for spare change.

Although there were some parts of this book that kept me interested, and as a history buff, I was happy with its historical accuracy, there were also many parts that dragged. I also feel that the author used massive amounts of description to make the book longer--there were way too many similes and metaphors packing the pages. To top it all off, I think the end was extremely anti-climactic. Was it a terrible book? No. But I wouldn't strongly recommend it to anyone, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"James Lee Burke's \\"White Doves at Morning\\" is richly written, peopled with well-drawn characters and beautifully atmospheric.It is an historical novel set in the Louisiana bayou country during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Fictional characters mingle with true-life figures---abolitionists, slaves, overseers, white trash, secessionists, madams and war profiteers. And. we see the origin of Angola Prison.The dialogue is magnificent, the moods created extraordinary and the pace is rhythmic.I found it compelling reading that engaged me from start to finish.The white trash villains are particularly despicable. The central protagonists, while flawed, are easy to cheer for.JLB maintains his high standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing to a Robicheaux fan","review":"Had I not read with increasing delight most of the Dave Robicheaux stories (and other Burke offerings as well) and formed a deep appreciation for this real, flawed, heroic character, I might have kept reading. But after fifty pages of cardboard characters, improbable situations, and flagrant cliches, I was so disappointed in Burke that I tossed WHITE DOVES AT MORNING into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I have been reading James Lee Burke's books for the past year. Gone through them like a great meal.In general they blow my mind. Burke combines fascinating characters that motivate interesting plots with prose thatwhistles off the page. Often in Burke's books there is either references to the Civil War or actualreminisces. Finally a full blown novel of the War. Every page feels like Burke must have relished finally writing his Civil War novel. I haven't dared writing a review of any of Burke's books because he is just too damn good to review. White Doves somehow has moved me to write. Usually I am not interested in historical novels. White Doves makes books like Gone With The Wind an embarrassment. Do yourself a favor read James Lee Burke. Take a trip back in our countries history."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Doves at Morning","review":"I hated for this story to end, the characters were wonderfully engaging.

From Chic Cheer to Savoir Faire,pure elegance! So prepare yourself to be swept away by the best dance ever. Many Billboard charting singles here. Intricate orchestrations still amaze after 35 years.The newer 2cd definitive edition is okay, but I recommend that if you want more just puchase the original albums(box set) rather than a collection, they are that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Goods","review":"I wasn't happy to receive this CD from this company. They printed my address and underneath that was \\" or current residence\\". Oh, it gets better! The CD was cracked on the front as well as the back and it wasn't a used! So, I was not pleased when I saw it. However, the CD itself wasn't scratched and the music was really awesome. It's a rare CD and the price for it was perfect. I think they should've packaged it a little better and NOT print current residence. Chic's CD should be treated with style not like a piece of junk mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara Cook does it again!","review":"Another beautiful piece of work from this one-time Broadway ingenue, whose voice only gets better with time. I especially liked some lesser-known songs from Broadway, such as The Very Next Man (Fiorello); In Buddy's Eyes (Follies) and a medley from She Loves Me. The orchestrations by Peter Matz are rich, complex, and totally unexpected. In short, a must for any Barbara Cook fan, and anobody who appreciates the Broadway show song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"I would not reccomend this book to anyone. It is evident that each of these pieces was part of a longer article but was butchered down to the point where arguments seem weak, incomplete, and disjointed. Furthermore, one piece even goes as far as using ideas of Hannah Arendt and claiming that they are the basis of some sort of mixed up political theory. Hannah Arendt is not a political theorist people, she even says as much herself! Overall, this book was a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice looking.","review":"I ordered 3 sets of these to be nameplates for my candle business.

It happened when I was 10 years old, and I don't even remember the news reports, only how often my sister and I played the Gordon Lightfoot 45 over and over. Michael Schumacher has done justice to the story, and most importantly, the crew, by detailing not just what were thought to be the events surrounding the sinking, but giving insight into the investigations, and the lives of the crew and family. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in shipwreck and/or Great Lakes history, and anyone else who enjoys well-researched and well-written non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on the Mighty Fitz","review":"I ordered this book with the last of a a gift card, and needed something cheap enough that I could buy it and pay for shipping for less than 9 bucks....I am glad I did.I have been interested in shipping and shipwrecks for a while now, and have always been interested in the mystery of the Fitz. I have read a few books about it, but they were written a long time ago. This one was written in 2004 or so, and is a little more modern.Obviously, since no one survived on the ship, there is no way to portray the actual events of the ships sinking. The author does a great job of describing the night and the storm through the memories of the captain and crew of the Arthur Anderson, the ship following and guiding the Fitz.Also, a portion of the end of the book details the investigation of the sinking and the lawsuits and finger-pointing that took place in the years following.A great book for anyone interested in Great Lakes shipping. Very emotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, but.....","review":"I feel the book was excellent in telling the story of the wreckand investigation but as another reviewer said, where's the maps?Since I am not from the Great Lakes area I would have liked tohave a map(s) of the lakes, the shipping routes, the shoals, the route the Fitz traveled, and the area where it sank. I would also have liked to have some drawings of the Fitz showing the hatches, etc. so I could better understand the things that came out in the investigation. A few pictures would also have been great (but not absolutely necessary) as the author talked about all the pictures that have been taken. I give the writing a 5 but overall a 4 because of the lack of maps and pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my son-in-law for his birthday.

We have quite a bit of maritime history in our family and we do not live far from the museum where the bell from the Fitzgerald is housed. Brings back many memories of the lakes. The writing flows well and it personalizes the crew as well as tells the story of the disaster that befell the Fitzgerald."},{"rating":"1","title":"old beer","review":"I've read two books on the loss of the Fitzgerald: \\"Gales of November\\" published many years ago and now this one. With similar faults, both have failed. Each has lost an opportunity to tell a compelling tale. Schumacher's writing is stale and flat, using hackneyed conceits that just make me groan and squirm with discomfort. The book's organization is disjointed, poorly laid out in its narrative. I note as I read how many chances to make a narrative rich with detail were missed and how an awkward phrase could instead have been said with grace.With \\"Gales of November\\" full of factual error (e.g. confuses longitude and latitude) and poorly imagined, I am mystified why the author and publisher thought they had anything better to offer this time.This ship and its tragedy remain without the skilled and able storyteller it needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I just recieved the Italian horn.....in the listing it stated it was .75 (3/4) inch long.

Although this might not be one of Petrucciani's most emotional concerts (a German audience is somewhat less of an excited bunch than, say, the French) this album catches the ear of the listener from the first second. It is a compact collection of wonderfully assembled songs, which fit together in a magical way. Petruccianis style is similar to Keith Jarrett, although he has a more pronounced feeling for melodies: Solo Live is more extroverted, more accessible, more versatile than the Koln for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for kids, teens and eager star wars fans hands off!","review":"First of all, this CD is clearly for kids. Especially the 2 - 7 year olds will enjoy the read along - style of the hughly coloured book accompanying the cd. Those who expect a high tech soundeffect - adventure will be greatly dissapointed - not only that the use of soundeffects and original dialog is very limited, unfortunately the old music from the elder movies was used...although the new score was already availabe. Nevertheless the quite complex story is vivdly told and any scary, for children unsuitable elements like violence and too dark descriptions of evil characters are left out. A little more atmosphere would have done alot to improve the overall experience! Good for kids, teenies and eager star wars fans - hands off!

A narrator was used sparringly to make transitions and all the dialog and music was straight from the movie, this is completely opposite. Now I know the Lucas marketing strategy is to drip out products like frozen molassas over the next hundred and fifty years, but this, like JAR JAR, was just bad thinking. If you're looking for a read along book, okay here's a really bad one, go nuts.

It's dimensions however, while being great for cooking a whole fish, require the use of 2 burners (medium size) adjacent to each other. I have a Viking cook top and the largest burner is not capable of heating the pan out to the far edges of the oval, in spite of Creuset's legendary ability to distribute heat evenly. If you don't have 2 adjacent medium sized burners on your cook top, this pan is not the right choice for you.

Fortunately for my mental health, part of it broke off in the lighter after about 10 uses and I was plenty content to throw the rest out the window.I'll just list some highlights of the stuff I hated because it's been over a year since I used it.1. There is a huge delay from when you push a button on this thing until it actually does something.2. Output level is way lower than the normal radio or cd player level so you have to turn the volume up about 50% more than you would for the other sources. If you forget to turn the volume back down before you unplug this POS or search for a new frequency, you get treated to static or the other source at 50% higher volume than you would normally want.3. On road trips, even in the middle of nowhere, you have to change the frequency no less than every 15 minutes.

It's user-friendly and the flexible goose neck makes it easy to adjust and see what's going on even while driving (add note of caution here).I'm in Los Angeles where there's more stations than available bandwidth. This makes it hard to find a clear frequency slot. I previously used a Griffin iTrip and was able to use it on three or four station frequencies. I could only find one spot on the radio dial where the Tunebase would work semi-reliably. It's just not quite powerful enough to cut through the background noise in this over-crowded radio market.

So more like 'FM as your driving out of the station's range' quality. And that's once you scour every frequency, one-by-one for the clearest. I tried this with factory and expensive aftemarket car stereos in a variety of environments and was consistently disappointed.

Although he has a noble attempt to deviate from the who is the killer plotline (we know who did the murders in the 2nd chapter), you'll know it's something they did in the past and someone is trying to erase it plotline.

It's okay and if you like the Alex Cross series you must read it, but it's just not up to the high standards of the first Cross books. Since Patricia Cornwell has forgotton how to write, and Patterson is losing his touch; who's left.

Patterson's prose can sometimes be too simple and I'm afraid this is one of those times."},{"rating":"1","title":"overly contrived plot & twists","review":"I'll read this author for a quick, cheap escape -- something good if one is locked up or needs an easily accessible, cheap read to pass the time for 30-mins or so...maybe a few hours, even. I won't fault you if you microwave some buttered popcorn and pop open a brew and read this book...But, I care little for this author's books on a deeper level. The plots and the twists & turns he uses come across to me as overly contrived and this is a big turn-off for me. When a plot development is written in order to create a bigger 'twist' at the sacrifice of naturalness and realness, this is badddddddd. For me, anyway.As soap operas have their place, so do these books, including 4 blind mice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to James Patterson?","review":"Does anyone else think that his writing has tanked?

I will not be buying any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A High School Writing Effort","review":"I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read. I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability. The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it. As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting. I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downer of a Climax","review":"Four Blind Mice is the first James Patterson novel that I have read. I saw both Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider on DVD, so I knew that he had a good idea of how to tell a great, suspenseful story. Four Blind Mice started off with an interesting premise and I felt like I had purchased another winner. Unfortunately, I was left quite disappointed. I felt that the story moved along at a great pace, but more intricate details were left for the imagination of the reader. The action seemed lacking and the climax was bland. If you are into a slightly amusing 4-hour read, then pick this one up. Otherwise, I'd stick to something a little more gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"just don't do it","review":"If this load of tripe can get published than anyone can!

This novel was so entertaining that I was able to finish in 2 days. Would have finished sooner, but life interrupted. Alex Cross and Sampson were superb in this grippng outing. I would have liked the killers to stand accused, but wasn't disappointed with what happened.

It made me scratch my groin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson simply stinks these days","review":"I don't know why I bought this book; I've been less and less happy with Patterson's work. It's getting repetitive, the 8-million-chapters thing is just laziness for actually developing a story and/or characters, and his skills appear to have deteriorated beyond hope.But I bought it anyway, read the whole thing, and then did something I almost NEVER do. I chucked it straight into the trash.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. If you've liked his stuff in the past, you will almost certainly be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...to say the least","review":"I couldn't believe Patterson had sunk so low...but I guess he has. I've been following the books for awhile, avidly buying each as it comes out, but I just don't think I can stand to read them anymore. It started with the Women's Murder Club and has only gotten worse. The story was predictable, something I never expected of Patterson and the 'love interests' and Nana stuff is just horrible filler that is so uncharacteristic of what I've come to expect from Patterson that I almost couldn't finish it. What, did he write it in like a week? I still love Kiss the Girls and his earlier work but I can't put myself through another one of these. Save yourself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Blind Mice (James Patterson)","review":"As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.

After reading 8 books, I feel that I know Alex's family. Nana, the kids, Christine and his other girlfriends, and John Sampson. No other book, so far, has dealt with the emotional side of his family as much as this book. I shed a few tears and cheered several times. It put a \\"human side\\" to the stories. It was a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"This is my last Patterson novel; I've had it. He's been going downhill for awhile and he's at the bottom. This is the poorest writing I've read in a long time; school kids could do as well. It was like reading a diary..short, choppy, no plot, descriptions or fleshing-out of anything. It says he's investigating, but we never know how or what he's doing. No investigation at the crime scenes or anything. You don't know how he found out who the final killer was. All the asides with Nana have nothing to do with anything...just empty filler. I had the feeling he was just whipping this off as fast as he could to get another book out there and get some more money...no research or thought put into it at all. I'm mad at myself for buying it and then reading it. No more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker","review":"I was just thinking, after I put this book down, I wish I was the literary critic for the NY Times.I wish I could warn people about this total waste of ink and paper. Every chapter is about two pages long and the publisher used LARGE TYPE to make the book feel thicker. I believe the author knocked this out over a weekend.The story is thin, there's no characters and I couldnt wait to finish it.Bring back book burning, this is junk.I guess you could say I didn't like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit team--Poorly developed","review":"This is an incredibly poorly written book with each character's persona is not as fully developed as it could have been. Its a quick read at the beach type of book. This is a shame because the idea is good but the author skims the surface the the three main bad guys' personas, adds unnecessary violence where non-violence would have worked so much better. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are way too many plot holes. Big ones.","review":"While the read was fun and engrossing, never dull, the obvious plot problems were glaring.The time between conviction and execution, the basis for investigation, is totally unbelievable. People in base housing at the time of the execution are witnesses to the murder (the average time in any one post is generally less than three years). Patterson really doesn't seem to know that much about the military beyond his own prejudices.The Army and the system that is the miliary are the bad guys in this book, which totally disgusted me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There were more holes in this plot than an Iraqi mine field.

This plot was simplistic, unbelievable and too pat.I have complained about all the white space in each of the eight books by Patterson that I have read, so I will just say that C. H Mitchum (Chelmsford, MA USA) posted a review on January 27, 2003 that captures my sentiments exactly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson's Worst","review":"This \\"effort\\"(?) by author Patterson is extremely disappointing. The military backdrop which constitutes the fundamental basis for this publishing disaster is a poorly researched and contains egregious factual errors, shallow detail and grossly stretched credibility. The plot projection is \\"fleshed out\\" by graphic gory detail and superfluous sex which the reader is expected to relate to reading entertaiment. The inclusion of this disaster on recent bestseller listings can only be from the derived momentum of Patterson's past literary eclat with his Alex Cross character; clearly this book would never be looked at by a responsible publisher were it the author's early effort. I am embarrassed that I was \\"conned\\" into buying it and that I humiliated myself by finishing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Following Alex Cross's Career","review":"having read all the Alex Cross mysteries from Along Came A Spider to Four Blind Mice, i'm realizing something...Cross's career climaxed at Roses Are Red. The following books really havent done much for me. I picked up Four Blind Mice upon its November release date and here it is mid-January and i'm just now finishing it. it was a painful read because i couldnt get into it. the short chapters have never been a problem, its the lack of character-depth, lack of mystery, the graphic description of the senseless murders--especially to the women, and once the big mystery was revealed it was like: okay...and? I thought nothing in this series would be worse than Violets Are Blue. At this point, I cant tell if \\"4 Blind Mice\\" is the title or author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like sex, violence and political correctness","review":"If you like sex, violence and abundent political correctness at a third grade reading level, this is the book for you. If you are desperate for time to kill and can stomach his mainstream style, this book fits the bill. This book does move fast and at times can be full of thrills and adventures, however, the ending is anticlimactic. His obvious agenda taints what could be an enjoyable experience.The Road Warrior from Philly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing his touch","review":"I find it hard to believe the reviewers quoted on the covers and front pages of this book actually read it. The plot is choppy, made worse by 1-2 page \\"chapters\\". A sloppy lack of follow-up (what happened to girlfriend Marcia? Who wrote the faked \\"love letters\\"? etc.) makes it confusing and frustrating to follow. Mix in excessive amount of graphic violence, which does nothing to further the plot. Add in characters who speak in unrealistic and stilted dialogue, and you have this book. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"Patterson is one of my favorite authors. I received this book as a Christmas present. What a disappointment. How the innocent people were \\"set up' with their blood and DNA is never explained. The book is a miss-mash of thoughts and plots.It is one of Patterson's absolutely worse books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Shame","review":"Again, I am disappointed by a recent JP novel. Sloppy writing and ridiculous plot, sex unrelated the story. JP's earlier novels are great and there was a time when I would plunk down money for them no questions. No longer.

JP is churning out crap and expecting his name to carry the sales of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Line Ruins Book For Me","review":"Can anyone get by the time line in this Book. A Sgt. That Sampson served with in Vietnam is on death row. But wait. Sampson and Alex Cross are in their \\"early 40s\\" according to the chapter with the softball game. The book is set in at least 2002, as Sept 11 is mentioned. So if we stretch \\"early 40s\\" to be 45, then Alex and Sampson are born in 1957, U.S. pulls out of Vietnam in early 1973 when Sampson and Alex are 16 years old, too young to legitimately sign up for the US Army (Which Sampson points out that Nana helped him do).If you're going to write a formulaic \\"Bad US Military people prey on innocents\\" book, at least respect my abiltity to add and subtract."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misuse of talent","review":"Once again we see an author in search of some quick money turn out a potboiler that perpetuates lies about the military. Leave aside historically challenged background of the book, the poor writing and plot twists that must have come from the booze bottle and consider the basis of the story. The author would have you believe that Soldiers are by definition amoral sadistic killers supported and protected by their superiors.I know, \\"it is only a story\\" but Patterson chose the story and the spin. So if you want to support blatant lies about the men and women who are out there daily to protect you and me have at it. However if you do not consider this type of trash worthy of your dollars I recommend you pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Tripe - or am I too Kind?","review":"Patterson used to be a writer of compelling thrillers but this is so lazily written that I must supsect he has discovered a long hidden stash of Roer 714's.These Cross stories have degenerated to the point where I wish I could enter the story and dispose of the insuufrable Nana Mama, all the children and every love interest Patterson crowbars into the novel. That would at least leave me with only 50% of the book to be derisive of."},{"rating":"1","title":"First-time Patterson reader","review":"...so take my review for what it is worth! I picked this one up on a whim, and was disappointed by it. The chapters are insanely short, many of them less than three pages. Sometimes there is a chapter break in the middle of a scene, and the next chapter picks up right where the other one left off! It made it hard for me to focus on the book.The plot was OK at best. As a 14-year veteran of the military, I found most of the military scenes to be unlikely at best. Maybe he had some military personnel giving him info, but it sure seems unlikely to me.Finally, the dialogue seemed forced and fake to me. The best writers make you feel like you are in the world of the book; this novel made me feel like I was reading a novel attempting to present real dialogue. If you are a fan of the series, you will probably like this book. Otherwise, approach it with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triman of LI","review":"One of Pattersons best.

The only downside, they read fast, I finished it in 5 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put it Down","review":"I really enjoy Patterson's writing style. Chapters just seem to flow very well together. Love the Cross Character. Highly recommend this book I kept turning the pages and couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome James Patterson makes me want to write","review":"I love this guy. I just started reading his books I am a huge Mary Higgins Clark fan so was a twist for me. I grew up in Fayetteville NC, my father is retired Army and my Mom worked at the Hospital across the street from the hotel where Dr Cross and Sampson stayed. When I started reading I could see my home town. I actually felt like i was in on this investigation with them. To me that is what a book should do for you. You can take on the persona of the characters, you want to get those bad guys as much as they do. Each one of his books ties his storys together you learn about the characters. You can actually relate to some ot the things they go through. I stongly reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading sheer imagination and excitability that you expect from any mystery writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Cheese in This One","review":"It's not clear to me what Patterson's attraction is. He does write the shortest chapters of any modern author (even shorter than Robert B. Parker's, but all that does is add white space and pages. In this book Alex cross is embarking on his \\"last case\\" to prove that a friend of a friend is being framed for a murder. Alas, he fails, but in the process realizes that someone is going to a lot of trouble to frame former Viet Nam veterans for murder and being very successful. We learn early on who is doing it, but not who is ordering the killing. Many dead bodies later we find out the answer which is somewhat predictable and not very startling. I was given this book as a gift. I am thankful that I did not shell out hard cash for it. If you like this author, I suggest the library or waiting for paper back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not his best, but still good!","review":"Good book. Lots of vintage Cross.

This was my first Alex Cross novel and regretted that this had to the be first. The plot seemed rather unorganized and the ending was not plausible. I know that Mr. Patterson releases books frequently... maybe, he shouldn't. It is the quality that readers are concerned with after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another feather in Patterson's hat","review":"I am the type that when I find an author I like, I tend to read all of thier books, regardless of the subject matter. I have have read all of Patterson's book to date. I have always been pleased with his writtings, some more than others of course. I must say this Four Blind Mice was one of the more enjoyable reads. It did have more twists and insight than his normal Cross novels and they played well.If you like Patterson and the Cross series, this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God","review":"this book is so bad that it could have been written by a 14 year old child.

I am a HUGE Alex Cross fan and am always recommending the Alex Cross series to people.I read the book and lost interest pretty much straight away, the only thing that kept me going was that something good might happen at the end. I can see what James Patterson was tying to do with the short chapters, but you can't write a series of books and then change the format, style and talent of the last one and expect to get away with it.I described this book to my partner as 'nothing special, I don't think James Patterson did either as I have an idea he had to rush off somewhere before he finished it and just chucked words at his PC'Also, the proof reading was pitiful, I don't claim to be the best speller in the world and often make mistakes, but even I noticed some obvious mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is another in a series of books featuring Alex Cross and the cases he solves.

A nurse, possibly having killed as much as 40 patients is something that gets one's attention. It is something one is horrified about. And Mr. Phelps is justly horrified, but as an author is too horrified. He writes the book as for someone he does not trust to be as horrified as him. He treats us readers as sociopaths, as mentally challenged sociopaths. He hammers in the same key multiple times so we get it. He goes over excruciating dull details to make us believe that woman spent 24hours a day, seven days a week being evil. He paints her as close as a mustachioned person tying an innocent to train tracks as he can get away with,and in doing so he commits the worse fellony a writer can do, he is boring. The only reason I gave him 2 stars was because he has done his research.Next time I will stick with authors that can make a statement without either treating me like a 3 year old or boring me to death"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Angel of Death\\" really isn't that interesting....","review":"This book was an accurate and comprehensive account of Kristen Gilbert's crimes and prosecution. Phelps has obviously done his research, and did a fair job recreating the time line and relating the story in a readable way.Only the first quarter of the book covered Gilbert's commission of crimes, the majority of the book covered her prosecution and trial. I found this part a bit dry, and thus the two stars.If you really love true crime books, this will likely end up on your list. If not, I'd recommend you pass...."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ","review":"AS SOMEONE WHO FOLLOWED THIS TRIAL VERY CLOSELY I WAS AMAZED AT THE ATTENTION TO DETAILS AS WELL AS THE EASY TO READ STYLE OF MR.

There's more to the story but that's the basis of it.All evidence indicated that the guard was not in on it.This book is vastly superior to his more recent \\"Murder in the Heartland\\", probably because it wasn't rushed into publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"I usually require that authors have a good command of the English language but in this case I'll make an exception. This absorbing story kept me fascinated from cover to cover. I'm a voracious reader of true crime; this is one of the best I've ever read, which is saying a lot. I'm also an RN and could follow the medical aspects easily. I'm so glad this nurse no longer can have contact with patients!! Phelps could stand to take a good course in writing, however.

Some folks must believe it makes them seem \\"worldly\\" to include the comparisons in their reviews. Honestly, I believe this show solidified AMC as a series powerhouse. It already had Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and Walking Dead in their stable. This show rounds out the offerings nicely and makes the channel one to beware if you are a network.The Killing is intelligent and has a cast of characters that leave you constantly guessing. Deep into season two and there is still a mystery to be solved. This is a show to share with friends, And the \\"partner dynamic\\" hasn't been this engaging since X-Files."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERIOR ACTING, REAL REACTIONS, GREAT PLOT","review":"While a killing has been a topic of all media for centuries, this is a highly skilled production which is profoundly exceptional.All the actors are not acting.

She'd be wrong on both counts. She over-relies on misdirection and ambiguity in developing her charcaters, and in the end most of them seem contrived and two-dimensional. What's worse is she persuaded me to become emotionally invested in her central dramatic question, \\"Who killed Rosie Larsen?\\" Only to be told, \\"I'm not going to tell you, besides that's not what the show is about.\\" Really? What rubbish! AMC cancels Rubicon and gives us this tripe. I will not be back for season 2. Who killed Rosie Larsen?

They must think that we are willing to put up with ridiculous red herrings, mangled McGuffins, and mishandled misdirection for ultimately no payoff. I really hope they are wrong.The acting is wonderful, really. Watching the parents go through the sorrow and heartbreak was painful to watch. Watching the detectives, interesting. Watching the politicians, meh. But being jerked around for no good reason? Especially with the season finale? Nope, I refuse to watch this tripe any more, no matter how much they might dress it up as haute drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"All talk, no payoff, terrible show","review":"This show was marketed as being unique, an entire season dedicated to one murder and the investigation to find out who did it. The first few episodes are interesting enough, but as the season goes on, more and more worthless sub-plots kick in and the main plot gets terribly diluted. One of the final episodes is completely off plot and adds nothing but time filler! At the end, you are left with an awful cliff hanger when you were promised a conclusion. Avoid this show and go watch something, anything else, even a blank screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimless and worthless","review":"Each \\"twist\\" is really a non-sequitir summoned from the writers' heads. By the end of Season two, our two cops have fingered at least 10 people for this crime and the list keeps growing. By the end of it all, there's no linear story arc, no rational development of plot or suspects and an array of red herrings that do nothing more than add episodes to an increasingly pointless series. I can deal with not having the mystery wrapped up in one season. I cant deal with weak writing that needlessly pads the plot with distractions trying to make them look like intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome show!!","review":"If you like police procedurals with a backstory, you will love this show. The season evolves around the killing of a high school student in Seattle. And as in all great detective shows, nothing is as it seems on the surface. Two detectives are assigned to find Rosie's killer. Their investigation points them everywhere--high school students, teachers, neighbors and even politicians. The writers do a great job of developing all characters and side stories. I, for one, cannot wait for the second season premiere which is in April (I think.)

I've seen other shows that started out really good and then became more and more ridiculous as the writers threw in unneccessary plots just to continue the series. On a sidenote- is it just me or does the casino symbol look a lot like the emblem used in the Hunger Games trilogy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"total loss of time","review":"There is practically nothing I could add to the other 1 star reviews - other people already said every single word I wanted to say about this show.In short, not to waste somebody's else time like mine was wasted by those series: awfully slow, boring, a really dumb set of characters, truly inept plot twists.I watched with my finger on the fastforward button for the second half of the 1 season - does not look I missed anything considering that nothing happens for about 75% of the time.The pilot was good and I had such hopes for that show.. well, those went the way of many hopes. Total waste of time, these series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointlessly meandering and hopelessly contrived situations","review":"I love well-written television. This is not it. Even though murder investigations are not all likely to proceed in orderly fashion, the writers here create freakishly complex meanderings and blind alleys that feel hopelessly contrived. This show attempts to portray a gritty ultra-realism, which is appreciated, but when they throw in an FBI sting situation worthy of NCIS, the writing destroys the atmospheric credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"A show about the worst detectives ever and a director that hates the audience","review":"Want to waste approximately 10 hours or so of your life? Then this is the show for you. After a promising start (the first two to three episodes were quite good), enjoy as each week the terrible writers insert a red herring at the end of each episode. Thrill as the director strives to make you care about none of the characters. Watch in amazement as, towards the end, the detectives discover things that even basic police work would have uncovered in the first couple of episodes.This is one of the worst TV shows I've ever watched. None of the folks that I know who watched season 1 (grudgingly, towards the end, only to find out the killer) won't be around for season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something else to watch","review":"What a frustrating, poorly written show. Aside from a couple of decent characters, The Killing was a complete waste of time. It certainly doesn't live up to the AMC standard set by Mad Men, Breaking Bad or even Rubicon (which I thought was at least good enough to get a second season). The \\"twists\\" that happen throughout the show aren't clever or interesting - just maddening. As soon as a character is purported to be the killer, you spend the next 2 episodes wondering what absurd set of coincidences will be revealed that vindicates them. After about 6 or 7 episodes, my sole reason for watching was to see how the show wrapped up. I couldn't believe that AMC opted to green light another season - I certainly won't be back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"Great cast and more importantly, great adaptaton of the original da ish series......not always happens.

Who knows? Maybe the Danish original version they based this on is okay, but I don't think I'll test the waters on that. No real crime-solving or detecting here. Just grief, grief, grief, tears tears and bad moods. The female lead detective is supposed to be moving at any second from Seattle to, uh, I think Oakland... and why is this interesting to us? She keeps missing flights and having uncomfortable conversations with her nine year old son that go nowhere.Just awful. There's a political subplot that is as fascinating as all behind-the-scenes political insider stories are -- in other words, it's as fascinating as watching paint dry.I'm boring myself writing about this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother with 2nd rate remake","review":"Very simple. Put aside prejudice as I had to and go with the flow and watch the Danish version with subtitles. Promise you that within 30mins you are hooked and at ease. This from an Englishman in London who never watches subtitled movies.This version is pointless and the DANISH ORIGINAL is without doubt the finest piece of tv I have seen in 40yrs. Outstanding and even better dare I say it than PRIME SUSPECT and EDGE OF DARKNESS - two UK classics.24 series one was nearest to me to this in terms of edge of seat rollercoaster. Stayed up til 3am two nights running as my girlfriend and I could not tear ourselves away.Unbelievable. Does not get better but AVOID THE US VERSION LIKE THE PLAGUE.

I would rather tell you that the first halve of the season is blah - ok, but the last halve was so interesting that I had to watch the last 5 episodes in one night until 3 A.M. in the morning on a work day. I could not even believe how good it was and it definitely made up for the first halve of the season. The second season is better in my opinion, but the authors had to give the background and it is a bit sad. You really get connected to the characters and you forget that this is a show. I teared up a couple times and I am a man. Very realistic, doesn't leave a stone unturned, only for mature viewers, and definitely worth your time if you like a mystery. Give it a try, even if you don't like murder mystery shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, but it leaves you hanging every time!","review":"This show is excellent - great acting, riveting storyline, etc. The only downside is the show really leaves you hanging at the end of each episode.

It was absolutely superb. Loved the plot the acting the characters etc etc. Hadn't enjoyed a thriller as much as this since watching Prime Suspect many years ago. Can't wait for the realease of season 2. Watched the Danish version and didn't enjoy it as much even though I am a fan of world cinema and often watch movies with sub titles.

I absolutely loved the first 4 episodes or so, I thought that there was wonderful character development and it was so interesting and intriguing, I also really liked how the characters looked like real people and not super models. But then, after about the 4th episode, things starting going a little bit too slow.Especially by the time the 3rd to last episode rolled around, an entire episode that had nothing to do with the murder investigation whatsoever. It was just a filler episode. The show got so boring, they made it sound like it was this great new idea to have a murder investigation span on over a full series, but I think they could have done a much better job.The last episode was especially disappointing, I won't spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet, but I was honestly angry after I finished watching it and pissed off about the whole season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging 3 dollars just for HD - free at AMC","review":"I was pleased to find that Amazon VOD had the first 2 episodes of the killing - which I happily watched for free. For the third one however, they tried charging 1.99-2.99, when you can just stream if for free, completely legit of AMCs own website with good picture quality.Is HD worth 3 dollars for 45 mins? I don't think so.Oh btw, have I mention that they charge 79 dollars just to have VOD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Forbrydelsen instead","review":"This was not an \\"AMC original\\" even though they call it one. It was copied from Forbrydelsen, which is a Danish show, and the original was not only much better but this AMC version doesn't reveal who killed Rosie. Every poster and ad for the show asks \\"Who killed Rosie Larsen?\\" but then AMC never reveals who killed her. Good job, I think I'll pass. Why did I waste my time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Log Lady when you need her?","review":"One review on this site called The Killing \\"Twin Peaks\\" Minus The Extravagant Quirkiness. They're exactly right, which is why this overrated show is so dull. There are no likable characters; a workaholic who neglects her child, an absent mother who neglects her child, a violent, racist father, an ex(?)junkie who falsifies evidence, at least two politicians (say no more), etc. Yes, yes, tell me about how these are Real People, not stereotypes, and I say here is a perfect example of why not everyone merits their own television show. The only thing this show has done is make me not care in the slightest who killed Rosie. Seriously, go buy Twin Peaks. The Killing is just stealing the pedestrian parts of that show, and making a good hour wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have been 5 stars but for the bad sound.","review":"Seriously, this absorbing but hard to follow series is made harder to follow by the muddled sound of the dialogue. Not easy to overlook in a show that is so well done otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"No End","review":"Be aware, when you start watching the first season, you will not find out who did it. There is an episode of padding thrown in, instead of a resolution. I understand that season 2 will not show a resolution until the end of the season. I resent this type of manipulation of the audience. Starting a new mystery, before the end of the first one, would have been acceptable to me, but not drawing out the ending for so long. I will not be watching season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whaaaa!","review":"Oh please lady calm down.

What sickens me the most isn't the fact that you have adult costums at a kids toy store, or the fact that you would actually put this costume in your store, but that my son just asked me what a bastard was!!! What are you thinking??!!!! It is also kind of ironic that in the review guidlines for posting a review states that you can't include profanity or the review will not be posted.

It was, as described, very lightly worn. The price I paid was more than fair but best of all it was available. As a Colorado resident since 1950, I became aware of the Colorado Cache Cookbook when it was originally published and I purchased an early copy. My original has fallen apart. I am in many different groups of women and naturally the topic often centers on food. Over and over, I have heard women talking about their sadness when their Colorado Cache cookbooks have fallen apart. I am enjoying telling about getting a replacement so inexpensively. I compared books and NOTHING is missing. Even the page numbers are the same in the two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-functioning!","review":"The battery did not work on arrival, the links for returning both required that I return it and told me it could not be returned.

I got a working one from a different vendor so my little mowbot is humming along on its own again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition","review":"I bought this product because it was intended to be a gift. With the folded arms it's easy for transport and storage, I get it. So I figured my little brother would love it. I opened the taped up USPS package and there it was. The product was in a blue plastic case and it reeked of oil. I proceeded to open the blue package and noticed the grease stains all over the lug wrench. What makes it worse is that \\"UCOSTORE\\" charges for return shipping! I wouldn't have been so upset if I didn't pay $ 20 for a USED product.I gave it one star for prompt delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've taught using this book","review":"This is a nice collection for the 21st century, including lots of new voices while still maintaining enough of the canon for a good survey course. It's a big, heavy book (for a paperback) that might have been easier to read in two volumes, but as far as content goes, this one has Norton's beat by miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped in half...

I can't find the info to call them back and let them know, but these tasted like they had gasoline in them, an incredibly chemical taste, blech. I've had lots of sugar free chocolate so I have a good amount to compare to. These tasted horrid to me.

Be warned: this album goes downhill right afterthe third number. If you are still keen on getting this CD, make sure you know what you're paying for by starting your sampling from track 4 instead. Rating: *one star for the first three tracks *another star for the (gorgeous) inlay card design"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great musical moment.","review":"There are records you have to listen to several times before you get completely hooked up. Anyone that says the contrary isn't sincere. I have listened to this album several times (first impression wasn't great) and I just can't find anything particularly seducing or catchy in it. Tracks one and two are just \\"o.k.\\", but then, each track is linear. You listen to 30 seconds and you know what the other 4 minutes are going to be like... That goes on from track 3 to track 10. Just listen to track 7 for instance and listen to the lyrics : \\"all my love is just for you, all my love is just for you, all my love is just for you.....\\". All this makes of this album one of the less relevant in its genre released during 1999. Unfortunately for the Braxton Brothers, who look like they're good fellas.If you really want a good sax in this style, go to Gerald Albright or even Kirk Whalum. And a bass ? well, Marcus Miller, Brian Bromberg, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"some good stories by no means the best","review":"While this collection offers a wide selection many of the pieces are not specifically related to boxing such as Ralph Ellison's piece which is about a fight, but has nothing to do with the sport.

I found it to be one of the best of Saint Etienne's collection. This is one CD that gets played over and over again, it is hypnotic, spacy and romantic...saintly but seductive indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't to visit these places too often","review":"Maybe Saint Etienne is working too hard. If you're expecting six solid pop songs, you'll be disappointed. It's more like four mediocre pop songs and two one-minute bits of fluff. \\"52 Pilot\\" was released as a single on 12\\" vinyl complete with a b-side. Why? It is nowhere near single material. The band attempts to rescue the rest of the album's lack of structure with the stale \\"We're In The City,\\" which no doubt will end the career of mixmaster The Trouser Enthusiast. \\"Artieripp\\" was probably meant to be a b-side for a single never released from Good Humor. \\"Half Timbered\\" hints at something lovely, but abruptly ends before it gets started. All in all, these places to visit are pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans only.","review":"A major disappointment. Most of the tracks are basically dull-but-not-unpleasant instrumental excursions. Particularly loathsome is \\"We're in the City,\\" which not only has some of the most inane lyrics I've ever heard in a St. Etienne song, but that most tired of dance music cliches: the 909 beat, complete with hi-hat and handclap. \\"Sadie's Anniversary,\\" on the other hand, is passable, but still nothing spectacular. For fans (like me), I guess it's worth your seven dollars, but otherwise stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Etienne disappoints.","review":"As a long-time fan of the wonderful St. Etienne, I was disappointed to find that Places To Visit is just a collection of 'better-left-in-the-studio' tracks. Of course I will listen to it ad infinitum as I do everything by the band, but nevertheless, I had hoped for at least one or two stand-out tracks. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Visiting Hour Over Yet?","review":"As a fan of Saint Etienne's music, I cut the band slack that I wouldn't apply to other music. If St. Etienne releases a song that's a little tedious, that's okay. I find something in it that I like, I appreciate it, and I move on.Then there's \\"Places to Visit.\\" Oy.Listening to this, I thought to myself, \\"would I be listening to this if it weren't Saint Etienne? If this were an unmarked CD that a friend gave me without explanation, would this still be in my Discman?\\"The answer was a resounding NO.Let's face it. This is an EP of toss-offs. I'm not quite sure why they released it, except maybe to have something to promote for the second part of their tour. Why not continue to promote \\"Good Humor\\"? It's a fantastic, melodic pop album that needs more exposure.Not for nothing, but \\"Places to Visit\\" is more like \\"Places to Sleep.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"This album just isn't that good. I am guessing the only people who are considering this album are big St. Etienne fans, like me.There is basically one good song on here. Otherwise, this album is ok for background music you would play over drinks, but only if you don't really care what you're listening to.I tried to like this album, but the songs are pretty underdeveloped. I would bet, the remnents of most of these will show up with lyrics in their next full-length album."},{"rating":"2","title":"hopefully a sign of more good tunes to come...","review":"this ep has more warm analogue sounds, and minimalistic melodic tunes that continue the saint etienne vibe. sadie's anniversary is the gem of the bunch. can't wait to see 'em live!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I take my last Review Back.

I hope the seller sees this and next time responds.This is me being naive.This thing is really well built, it will last forever. I use it for a dish soap dispenser. It looks great on the counter and it's super easy to refill since the mouth is so big.

Apparently the author feels that in order to reach young people, he has to write like one. Someone with an Ivy League education should write at a level higher than that of a high school student. He also writes about people who save the world while he himself does nothing. It seems that people do it for him and he takes credit for by writing a book or by signing checks (as Sierra Club president).

Adam is without double an accomplished individual. But for someone who has achieved so much in life at such a young age, his writing is very superficial. The book fails to truly educate people on environmental issues and appears to be nothing but a promo for his own accomplishments. Instead of fairly presenting both sides of the story, Adam's book is just a rehash of extreme environmentalist philosophy. He does not encourage people to think for themselves, to do research on issues they believe in or to look at issues from different perspectives.

In response to questions from a young journalist, Hope remembers her three husbands, two of them leading artists in the Fifties and Sixties. As this interview progresses, the depth and texture of Hope's reminisces-most of which are complex ruminations she does not share with the journalist-transform what is a well documented period of artistic breakthrough into an art scene alive with people and their complex dependencies. This is a narrative that imagines a person's experience in artistic history, not a thinly veiled history of art told through the eyes of an imagined minor artist (as certain critics have asserted). \\"Seek My Face\\" is another great work from one of our greatest novelists."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP Twinpack 97","review":"Didn't receive what I ordered.

Well, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is...and that expression was never truer than with this product. Each cartridge lasted about 1/4 of the time that the \\"same\\" cartridge from the store worked...and there were print quality issues throughout the short lives of both cartridges, as well.I've seldom regretted a purchase from Amazon, but this is definitely the exception!

This CD is a Must Buy Product for Classical Music Fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Lessons","review":"Beauty can easily be taken for granted until you are reminded in the simplest ways that nature can bring a tremendous sense of comfort and excitement. This is exactly what Jim and his brother learn as they work another fall season with their dad as tourists come to take part in their beautiful autumn leaves. The story is brought to life by James Ransome's vibrant acrylic paintings as the two boys mock the joy of the visitors as they gasp and photograph the scenery that the boys are surrounded by year after year. As the season comes to an end and the leaves disappear yet once more, the boys are amazed by the simple beauty of the bare trees against the black canvas of the sky. It is in this moment that the boys learn a beautiful lesson and begin to appreciate the amazement that the Peepers get from viewing their leaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I appreciate the biblical focus of this book on Spiritual Warfare. So much of what is taught on this subject today is mere speculation based on one's own reason and experience. The so-called experts in spiritual warfare refer to their experience to give authority to their words, going into extra-biblical teaching, doing just what the apostle Paul says we are NOT to do: \\"not to exceed what is written.\\" 1 Cor.4:6 The authors of THIS book base their teaching of Spiritual Warfare on the correct interpretation of Scripture - and Scripture alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a bully can change","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends ALLEY OOPS as a funny & emotional read about how JJ so torments Patrick that he stays away from school. You kind of get the picture of a ferocious little terrier dog, barking at an elephant's heels.Then JJ's father tells him a story about how he too was a bully & what happened to the boy he tormented. Impressed, JJ goes off to Patrick's home to sort things out, only to discover how alike they are, especially in their passion for arm wrestling.Pretty soon, they come up with a way to win friends & influence everyone at school, JJ is going to be Patrick's, the \\"Hammer Hand\\", manager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis' Best Album","review":"This is a great mix of music! It has everything, from the light-hearted \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" to the heart-wrenching \\"No Son of Mine.\\" Genesis has out-done themselves with this one. It's perfect. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Phil Collins or of Genesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis Living Forever","review":"Well unlike other reviewers i thought this album was great, i haven't heard any other Genesis albums but i think this is a great album. Highlights would be:-Dreaming while you sleep, Driving the last spike,No son of Mine,Hold on my Heart and Fading Lights. I'm usually a Pet Shop Boy fan but maybe i could be switched to Genesis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil Collins and Genesis","review":"...This is what it should have been credited to. It's very Phil-heavy, but yet, all still seems to work out. Of COURSE you can't compare it to Lamb or any of the other Gabriel inspired incarnations. Why? Because it's a different dynamic, and a different decade! Phil and his backing band (OK, so it's not very flattering, but that's the impression I get) have put together a fine album here, which should stand on it's own merits, and not be compared to earlier, edgier Genesis. Buy it if you like Phil."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can do without this one","review":"I hate to give albums one star, especially from a band that I love so dearly, but this one was pretty weak. There were two decent songs here, Fading Lights and Driving the Last Spike, not the greatest thing they've ever recorded, but still not bad.But overall, this album's pretty boring. Makes very nice background music, I'll give it that. But there really is nothing of note hear. There is an over-abundance of sappy love songs and various elevator music filler. It's hard to believe, from listening to this album, that Genesis was once an edgy prog rock band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough of Genesis","review":"Why did Banks and Rutherford insisted again with Calling all Stations, I'll never know. The band took five years since Invisible Touch to record We Can't Dance, and if this was the result, it should have been obvious there were no reasons to stay together. Not that I dislike Genesis' radio hits phase -in fact, I'd go with Duke or Abacab anytime over the old, pompous symphonic-ish rock albums. But WCD is tired, dull pop, the kind it gets worn out after a few weeks of radio exposition. A pity. But it seems that Genesis -like most bands- couldn't help the temptation to go on just a little too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Can't Dance Anymore","review":"Since the 1970's, Genesis came a long way from a British cult band, to one of the most explosive rock acts of all time. But for Phil Collins, the dance finally broke away.The 1991 album We Can't Dance, was the cornerstone of an era for Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford. The songs of We Can't Dance are simple and strong, with a little mix of experimental music aside. Songs like Hold On My Heart, Jesus He Knows Me, and No Son Of Mine, still pack a punch within the band in whole.Although We Can't Dance remains as the final studio album of Genesis, with Phil Collins, the album is still as dynamic and ridged as you could predict from the Land Of Confusion. While many people still wrote off Genesis after Phil's departure, the music will remain the same."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-0707307a"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/8.md","filePath":"people/8.md"}'),R={name:"people/8.md"},j=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{G as __pageData,j as default};
