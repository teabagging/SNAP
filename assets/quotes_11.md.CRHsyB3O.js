While this book was set in the same place, I could not decide what the story was about. Was the story trying to be a silly version of Stephan Donaldson's not-hero, or was it suppose to be a Sprague de Campe-like light comedy about a dimension hopping hero that used a magical shoe scale? The wonderful world created in the first book was shredded apart by Mr. Stackpole's insistance on applying a friend's story to his own.

I can still feel the clackers computing in their warehouses and feel the whoosh of pneumatic data. Tie-ins to such wonderful gizmos as the Jacquard loom provide an appropriate scientific backdrop. It's also short and easy to read, definite assets in my opinion; in this way, it contrasts with books by authors such as Vernor Vinge or even Greg Bear (the latters Blood Music excepted), who also introduce wonderful new societies situated among thought-inspiring technical gizmos. The pitting of London against Paris is more in the style of Agatha Christie than John Le Carre; surely an intentional move which gives the book a nice uncomplicated feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than the sum of their faults","review":"Gibson and Stirling write such wonderfully crafted books that you have to wonder how together they wrote THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE into the ground. The characters in the story act as if they are the ones who are gear-driven automatons. The plot consists of winding their keys and letting them wander aimlessly around a seedy and unconvincingly technological Victorian Englnd. Gibson and Stirling eventually let their story wind down and have to conjure up a disappointing ending before all of its momentum is lost. Whoops, too late.I am amazed by the number of people who like this novel. It is flat and tedious especially when compared to their other great works, such as Gibson's NEUROMANCER and nearly every other book Stirling has written.

It was long, the many details didn't go anywhere like they do in Gibson's other (wonderful) works, and the story never seems to come together. When I finished reading it, I just had to admit that I didn't get the point. I'm very disappointed. I can read all of Gibson's books over again and still be intrigued, fascinated and delighted with the worlds he creates, but I had a hard time getting through this one even once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Gibson's finest, but worth reading","review":"I have to admit that I'm much more of a William Gibson fan than a Bruce Sterling fan. For me, the book was very uneven-- parts of it were fascinating in their speculative detail, while other parts were straighforward and flat out dull. The setting was far more interesting than the plot. Still, I thought the interesting parts made the boring parts worth wading through, and the author's unique vision remains in my imagination years after having read it. If done right, it would make a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly his worst book ever","review":"Gibson wrote many great books.He may even deserve credit for having the entire cyberpunk genre spring to live as everyone was trying to imitate Neuromancer.This is by far the worst book by Gibson I read. Yes, there's a decent description of live in an alternative past. And even a memorable scene. But overall the book is boring, the characters are uninteresting, and the peculiarities of this alternative past just don't lead to anything.If you haven't yet read Neuromancer, Count Zero, Virtual Light, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Idoru, Pattern Recognition, etc. why would you read this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Count Me Among the Disappointed","review":"How could you go wrong with a plot based on the What If of Charles Babbage's difference engine actually being built, working, and changing the course of human innovation by bringing about the computer age as a realized steampunk past?

I forced myself through it, I had to get to the end regardless how many other things I'd rather be doing at the time. The characters didn't engage my interest for the most part and in the rare case that one did get into a bit of interesting tiff, the authors shortchanged me by going away to a different and less interesting storyline.

This is the only book which I have ever physically thrown, and it deserves it.Part of the reason is the run on sentences which drag on and on repeating parts without punctuation which you'd really think would have been dealt with by an editor but for some reason made it into the book and exist there to torment the reader for pages at a time until at some point the authors forget how the thing started and simply put the sentence out of its misery.This isn't the worst book I have ever read, but it is the only one to go flying across the room. I eventually picked it up and returned it to the shelf. After spending several years cooling off I asked myself if perhaps I hadn't been a bit hasty in my judgement, and picked it up again.It wasn't long before it again went sailing across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"Well, I'll try to be fair, but it is hard. My reaction after reading the last page was \\"Well, I'll never get that time back\\". I can possibly see why some might find this book entertaining, if they were VERY familiar with 19th century history. The detail is very good, and the premise is interesting. However, I have not read many books I have been more disapointed in. It drags, meanders, teases, and finally... leaves you completely flat. IMHO don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"well drawn, but too clever by half","review":"An alternate future past of 19th century England is thorough and believable. The intricacies of plot trip over themselves trying to be cryptic though and ultimately it wasn't a very satisfying read. Many plot lines and alternate histories are supposed to converge, but I really don't think that they do. Imagine the deliberate muddiness of Pynchon but with neither the underlying purpose or humor. Despite liking Gibson's other (admittedly opaque) work, if I had it to do over again I wouldn't have read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many cooks spoil the soup","review":"I'm guessing the creation of the book went something like this:Gibson: Hey Bruce, want to write a book about steam powered computing?Sterling: Yeah, that sounds really interesting.

How did your research go?Sterling: That's funny, I wrote the entire book too. Why don't we throw dice.

I saw no Difference.","review":"As I plowed through this story, I alternately had feelings of amazement and bewilderment. The authors' over indulgence in festooning us with fine details that were pretty much gratuitous, while totaling forgeting about telling us a story with some sort focus or meaning, was quite annoying.

Whatever happened, the result is an unstatisfying clash of styles. The story lacks focus, often jumping between different characters for no good reason.

The ideas behind the story are good. His descriptions are visibly good, but it reads neither like a good story, nor like a tech manual.The problem isn't isolated to this book either. \\"Artificial Kid\\" also reads slowly. I can't even pinpoint exactly what it is, other than Bruce Sterling's writings are VERY slow to read and hard to stay focussed on the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viva la difference","review":"A fascinating yarn woven around the idea that Babbage's \\"difference engine,\\" the precursor to the computer, was put together despite the actual limitations of the time. Using real historical figures-- many of whom are forgotten--Gibson and Sterling depict a London of the 1800s which is heavily polluted and corrupted by \\"thinking engines.\\" Gibson's style and prose are surprisingly dulled in this collaboration, whereas Sterling's ecological and sociological ideas abound. The work is not for everyone, but whenever you are starved for some original Gibson or Sterling, then give this book a whirl."},{"rating":"1","title":"great cinematography, poor acting","review":"A tour-de-force in which an incredible imaginary world is created for no apparent reason. \\"Full of sound & fury, signifying nothing.\\" The detail is breathtaking, the archaic vocabulary is a bit belabored, the characters are two dimensional and could have been lifted from much mediocre Victorian / Edwardian fiction.

Although the story revolves around the intriguing premise of Babbage's engines achieving a pervasive historical prominence, this premise alone is not nearly enough to sustain this work. The Difference Engine ultimately falls prey to its own overcalculated storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"A neat idea that never finds a voice","review":"Being a big Gibson fan (less so of Sterling, thought Islands in the Net was a waste of time), I liked the premise of this one a lot but wow what a disappointment. There is no real storyline, just a pointillist outline of a world where the computer revolution happens in the steam age, and the story, such as it is, flounders and flops until suddenly in the last page the writers decide to call it a day.It doesn't wrap up, it doesn't conclude, it simply stops. I can't recommend this book.Great premise, execution failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"Despite having a great idea for a story, the characters and lame attempts at 19th century slang made this book unreadable.

I had forgotten who I lent the book to, but I remembered having purchased it it the past.A few years later, I gave up on finding the book and bought it once again, being intrigued about the premise of a high tech in the not so distant past and all that.While I read it, I did not find that the storyline adequately answered my expectations. It reminded me of the sort of thing I use to watch in a cheap 30 minutes animated character television program when I was a kid.I was bored, I did not like it. Maybe its just my science fiction side that was screaming for the alternate universe where computers (even based on steam engine) appeared about 100 years ago that was disapointed. Can't argue against the characters, the rest of the storyline fits well on its own, it just does not appeal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunity Lost","review":"I started this book 3 years ago and put it down because the dialog and the slow pace was not what I was looking for at that point. I started it again this week and finished it. I still think the authors could have cut out about 150 pages and not lost anything.The book does deliver some interesting alternate history ideas. The new roles of historical figures kept me reading. I felt as though the authors had a great setting for this book and ample opportunity but somehow chose the dullest story line possible.Although I read the book fairly carefully and understand much of the underlying message, I still get the impression that the authors meant for me to see more than what I did. If they did, I didn't get it because the execution of the story was just so monotonous it was distracting. I would have to read the book again to better understand the ending.

However the ending was disappointing / anticlimactic and a bit hard to understand since it was told in a completely different style than the rest of the book (via newspaper clippings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Excellent alternate history book. But first a history lesson. In the 19th century C.E. a man by the name of Sir Charles Babbage (hardware man) designed a mechanical, steam-powered calculating machine (World's first computer). He was aided by Lady Ada Byron the Countess of Lovelace (software woman; Ada programming language is named after her).The Difference Engine takes place mid 19th century, and is a story in a world where Babbage's analytical engine is reality.

Unfortunately, the execution was horrible. I can only assume that there was conflict or poor planning between Gibson & Sterling. The characters were boring and there were many pages and even chapters that could have been ripped out without anyone noticing. The plot sputtered through the whole novel and eventually just died about 50 pages from the end. Overall it was confusing and unfulfilling, and I felt that the unique setting and story idea was wasted on a failed collaboration between two writers that are used to being on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaguely related vignettes masquerading as a novel","review":"Two of today's best science fiction authors collaborate on a fascinating concept and produce...a book with no discernable plot, no central characters, no apparent theme or message, and as if that wasn't bad enough already, it has no ending, but simply stops at a more or less arbitrary point. One of the biggest disappointments of recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of blah with no payoff","review":"I'm not trying to make myself sound like an idiot, but this book was just too full of 19th century jargon for me to be able to comfortably read it. I seriously had to keep dictionary.com up and ready while reading. I read it cover to cover and never did feel like I got much out of it, except perhaps a rather bland story. I've never read anything else by Sterling, but I've read other Gibson works. While Gibson does always tend to use unfamiliar terms, some of which Id swear he makes up, this book takes the cake. I would read 5 boring pages of rather useless information and wonder where in the world they were going with it! It was a frustrating experience to read this book and I'm just glad I'm done with it. I'm giving it 2 stars because of all of the painful, and presumably accurate detail they conveyed throughout the book.

The book says that the Mexican American War never happened and Texas is still independent. Yet the American Civil War happened even sooner than in our timeline and the South won. One of the causes of the Civil War was the dispute over whether the newly won territories captured in the war with Mexico would be free or slave states. If the war with Mexico never happens it stands to reason that the Civil War would be delayed or prevented all together. In the book Karl Marx is claimed to have seized control of New York City during the Draft riots during the Civil War and one of his followers is presented as a supporter of slavery. In the real history though Karl Marx supported the Union war effort and opposed slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for US DVD Players","review":"I was terribly disappointed with this DVD.

If you watch Fellini's films in the eighties he also changed of course but his films always manage to be very interesting in their own way.

It has come through time and again. He swears the Brown Bread I make is exactly like his Mum's but I got it straight out of this book! There's a little bit of everything; from simple sauces to soups, vegetables, main dishes, breads and desserts and more complex recipes (like traditional Christmas cake that takes a couple of days to make!).My one \\"complaint\\" would be that this smallish book likes to close by itself especially when I've got my hands in the flour so remember to weight it open beforehand.However, I give 5 stars because you get a bunch of really great recipes for a reasonable price. So worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIY","review":"Anyone who owns a car needs this sort of book; it gives you an idea about how stuff works and a better informed driver is a better driver/owner/responsible so and so. For less than a lunch, you can have a wonderful resource at your fingertips when things go haywire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"Yes, it does pump up, but after just limited use (may 10 times) it is bent and the rubber feet fall off and are torn. This is a terrible product that does not seem as if it was ever made to last. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after third use","review":"I should have known better given how inexpensive this was. Turns out cheap is cheap.The pump broke badly on the third use. The metal that supports the foot pedal bent to the side, making the pump unusable.The pump was awkward to use even when it did work and squeaked loudly -- making it annoying -- but I did not expect it to break so quickly.Definitely avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Race to the bottom hits tire pumps","review":"When you take this out of the box it feels flimsy. When you open it up it springs open suddenly. When you put the hose onto your tire valve, its grip feels dubious. When you step on the pedal, you hear a squeal like a tortured piglet. When you release your foot from the pedal, it jams in the open position with the piston rod hanging crookedly out of the cylinder, until you unhook it from the tire and start over (in other words, the pressure inside the tire, even when low, is enough to jam the piston because of poor fit).I was expecting it to break on the first use, but somewhow it didn't. But I'm sure it's only a matter of time.Oh, for a solid American-built tire pump!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk broke on first use","review":"When I first opened this package, I noticed the item's box was beaten up. Hoping it was not a sign of the quality of the product I kept it anyway. When I first tried it, I noticed a hissing sound and the gauge didn't work. I got my front bike tire pumped up. On the back tire, the tube connecting the pump to the valve completely broke off. It was supposed to be screwed on, but the screw was too small for the hole. It wasn't stripped or anything but wouldn't stay put. Needless to say, I returned the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliced Right Through a Chicken","review":"I bought these to prepare spatchcock Chicken and, wow, the difference between using these and struggling with a knife or dull kitchen shears is amazing. They sliced right through the chicken bones with no trouble at all.They are also very well designed--they clip keeps them securely closed while they are in the drawer and the spring is completely encased in the metal so you won't pinch your fingers or get food particles in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"These shears are expensive and do not hold up. I have used a lot of different types and brands of shears for work. These are not the pair to buy. They broke almost immediately and for the price, I would have liked them to last a lot longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author has no clue","review":"I grew up in the very area the author has placed this story. Some of the discriptions in her book were lifted from my home town.. what a pity she has no clue... it would take longer to fly to NYC than it would to drive from the fingerlakes. I had quiet a few good laughs over the silly things she assumed. This is a warm fuzzy romance. That is not realistic. Making wine is a costly almost never run at a profit business. I dearly hope women never behave as silly as the woman in this novel did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Branch; a legacy to all fantasy/historical fiction works","review":"Red Branch was the best novel I have ever read, Morgan Llwelyn was my favorite author before, but I had no idea she could write like this.

I usually finish a book like this in a week, max. I'm actually a great fan of the Tain and related tales but I just couldn't get into this book.Two stars because it isn't actually BAD, I didn't want to throw it away or anything and I actually would like to finish it, someday.Plodding is the best description I can think of. I did't care about the characters or the plot, I just got bored reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice change","review":"I've enjoyed every mxpx album, including their more poppy Everpassing moment. It was cool to here that they'd becoming out with some harder stuff, however. The cd contains nine songs, six which are harder/faster than their last major release, and three which maintain the sounds of the Everpassing Moment. All in all it's a good cd with a good variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics","review":"I have been a big fan of MXPX for a while. This album represent some of the old stuff while blending in the new sound. Thier last album was pretty weak in the terms of hardcore, fast sounds, but I did enjoy the change of pace. This release reminds me of the early release, life in general. The album itself is pretty short, but its just an EP. I would recommend this album to hardcore fans, but not to a casual listener. BY far MXPX is a great live band, with the energy and sound that can only be heard live. I think a lot is lost on thier albums. By far there best album is MXPX LIVE. It almost captures the energy of seeing them live."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm letdown","review":"I am a big fan of Mxpx, i have every cd. I didn't like this one.i bought \\"take off your pants...\\" and the renaissance ep at the same time, and forgive me for comparing the two, but i like the blink album much more. MxPx has been in the music game a long time, and have the capability to pull lots of tricks out of the bag; i recognized lots of those elements. however i didn't feel the same energy as in past albums. The songs on the renaissance ep are raw, but not catchy. i'm suprised at their choice to release on fat wreck, but i wish the songs had the same charm as before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Attempt","review":"This is MxPx worst album since their early days of Pokinatcha. They have fallen apart after their peak during the days of Life in General / Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo. This cd could have been written and recorded in a couple of days. Having Mike mix the songs is really present in some songs where he drowns out the guitar and puts emphasis on his lyrics. Mxpx needs to not sell cds according to their name (Fat Wreck Chords) but because of music quality. Make me proud Tom Mike and Yuri. Oh yeah this stuff doesn't seem much harder except Track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a let down","review":"When I heard MxPx was going back to their older style of earlier albums, I had to pick this up. One of the best punk bands out. I have all their albums including the controversial Ever Passing, which I didn't really care for. It seems like this EP is almost like that, with the exception of like two songs. It still doesn't sound like MxPx. Just because they add on two harder sounding old style punk songs, doesn't mean they're returning. They just aren't catchy, they sound the same. The first song I heard from this album, from their site, before it was released was \\"Letting Go\\". That's a good song, kinda like others, it's catchy. The others just sound the same and don't catch like previous albums. I don't know, it may be just me, but I thought \\"Yuri Wakes Up Screaming\\" is just a waste of time on the CD. Could've come up with a better song that. Kinda copying Slick Shoes with the title it seems. Hopefully they'll come out with better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great EP","review":"This is an amazing EP. This, along with \\"the decline\\" by nofx, is probably the best EP I own. And remember do not expect a half an hour album this is an 18 minute classic EP. When I first got this CD it stayed in my CD player for weeks. I couldn't stop listening to it. You have to buy this CD and where is lacks in quantity it makes up in quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh.....I love this one.","review":"The Renaissance is such an awesome album! I love Lonesome Town, Party, The Opposite, and Yuri Wakes up Screaming. I really recommend this album to anyone who is a MXPX fan. It rox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT CAME FROM FAT WRECK!!!!!","review":"This is a great album with some catchy songs and great lyrics. Mxpx are a great band, and one of the best live bands I've seen, their really nice guys and really down to earth. I think it's stupid that people slag them because they belive in God, I mean does it really matter?? Anyway it's a great album, one of my favorite MxPx albums(althougth I like all their albums)GREAT RECORD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MxPx needs to get back to the old school sound","review":"Lately, MxPx has been sounding like all these pop punk boy bands. When are they going to get some stuff together like the good old days, back in '92. None of this la la la junk, let's get louder and faster already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Old...","review":"Mike (the singer) talked about how this is a sort of new sound for mxpx, a better change, and so on. I am very dissapointed with this for the simple reason that non of these songs are that good. Lyrically, they're just so-so, and musically, nothing stands out signifying how they have this new begining on this EP. For the die hard mxpx fans pick it up to add to your other cd;s but if not have a listen first or dub it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Michaelangelo handle the Renaissance........","review":"I thought Mike could have had a better job with the cover art on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD!","review":"I have several children's CD's but this one is the best! It has a wide variety of beautiful pieces spanning a large number of musical styles as well as ethnic backgrounds. There is everything from German, Irish, and Jewish folk songs to a Native American piece to Classical Baroque. This has become part of my daughter's bedtime routine. It is soothing without being flimsy and trite.

For us pragmatic Norm the woodworker, blow-dried Steve the host, and spendthrift Richard the plumbing/HVAC guy are like family. This magazine provides occasional coverage of the project house you see on PBS which is a bonus for fans.

It's mostly a read-and-toss sort of magazine. If you're really interested in home building and remodeling, there are two far superior magazines: Fine Homebuilding and Old Home Journal.

This author's work is far superior to much of what is being produced in the \\"fantasy\\" genre, and I really appreciate any effort by him. I actually prefer The Last Light of The Sun over The Sarantine Mosaic, which I think had too much going on it. This is a rather simple story told in a very elegant way and there are very few author's that can compete with Guy Gavriel Kay's story telling abilities. So I would eagerly recommend this book to whet your appetite for this author's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AMAZING, INTRICATE TALE OF LOVE, REVENGE AND REDEMPTION","review":"One of the best quasi-historical novels I have read since \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".

You will not want to put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could go back to Fionnavar","review":"I liked this book. It eased my hunger for Kay's writing. But it's just not enough. I want the epic battles from The Summer Tree and The Darkest Road. I want to weep when Diarmuid sacrifices himself for Arthur. There were moments in Last Light where I felt like it almost happened again. I wouldn't mind reading about the first battle for Bael Rangat and the imprisonment of Rakoth Maugrim. I could also live with finding out what happens on Earth now that we have a Seer. What about Green Ceinwein's child with Davor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and uneventful","review":"First, I usually love Guy Kay's work and have read everything he's written. And this book is Kay--it puts you in the past, makes you feel the world as it was believed to be, the magic and gods truly living and influencing the world. But, unfortunately, not much is happening in that world. Too many characters are introduced it's hard to keep track of people, and takes longer to get to like anyone.I'd say if you liked all his work, in particular if you found A Song for Arbonne \\"gripping\\", then you may like this one. Otherwise, find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Time Kay Fan Disappointed","review":"I anticipated this book eagerly - what a HUGE disappointment!Seems like negative side-effects of too much Harry Potter in the marketplace - Kay never wrote like Rowling - and he doesn't now either.This book misses out on much of the vivd imagery and sensual and relationship insight and intensity of his other books.Its like someone tried to make it more G rated fora wider audience - and killed much of the soul and poetry that his other books share,If your a fan of Kay's work, do yourself a favor, and skip this one - re-read Tigana or Arbonne instead,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who edited this thing!?","review":"My friends highly recommended Guy Gavriel Kay, so I was excited when I bought his latest book, The Last Light of the Sun. What makes this already-tepid fantasy unbearable is the rampant overuse of ellipses (\\"...\\"), which Kay apparently uses to attempt mimicking the cadences of real speech. But they are so frequently and gratuitously used that I constantly wondered, \\"Who is this guy's editor!?\\" The pages read like the work of a giddy adolescent, or an insecure amateur. A sampling, from just two consecutive pages:\\"Why did you...save me in the pool?\\"\\"They tell us...they tell us there will be Light.\\"\\"You've...seen them all these years?\\"\\"This one...is different, is often here.\\"\\"I had...tasks in the world, lad.\\"Not one of these sentences wouldn't be improved by omitting the ellipse.

GRATUTIOUS [Adult relations]. LOTS OF BIRDWALKING. FELT LIKE I WAS READING DISCARDED PORTIONS OF EARLIER WORK.

I have enjoyed GGK writing since the late 1980's, and at least once during each story, he makes me cry. The characters are always strong and vibrant and the stories are glorious. There are always just so many intricacies in his books that pull a reader in, and he uses words like a bard. His stories have always reminded me of songs of high deeds and adventures. I also like the way that he's tied his last three stories together (The Last Light of the Sun, Sarantine Mosaic, and The Lions of Al-Rassan). My favorites are still the Fionavar Tapestry, A Song for Arbonne, and Tigana, and for anyone who prefers pure Fantasy, I would start with them.

I purchased this copy of the book recently for a friend who just had a baby, and was disappointed at the big size. I did not see any specifications on the order page-----if they were there I did not see them. It has a nice story and I remember how much I loved reading it to my child who was snuggled in my lap.

The writing is so scattered. The book seems to consist mainly of quoting other authors and half-baked ideas, written in a style that is so dry, so disengaging, it's hard to get through a page, let alone the entire book.Interesting subject are given a line, maybe two, then followed up with quote after quote and study after study, statistics and percentages followed by statistics and percentages.For a subject as poetic as water, this is about as un-poetic a book as is possible.

They had an old song called Before The Break Of Dawn, and it was incredible, but these songs on the full length totally slay everything they've ever done. This is probably the best cd I've bought since Through The Eyes Of The Dead's Bloodlust. A while back, I heard they got signed to Mediaskare and were putting out a full length. The first song I heard off of it was Strife (Chug Chug). This the definition of \\"metalcore\\" or whatever people are calling it now-a-days.

Too many vocals. The instrumentals plow little or no new ground. His first half-dozen or so albums remain my favorites. However, to see him perform live is still a tremendous pleasure, regardless of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky in a not-so-great way","review":"My guess is that neither Leo Kottke nor Mike Gordon would brag about their vocal prowess, so why would they both stress vocals over instrumentation on this short (42 minute) collaborative CD? Some of the songs are whimsical and harmless, but both these performers have recorded some truly marvelous performances in the past. I was hoping that the sum of the two parts would be greater than this.After Kottke's recent \\"A Shout Towards Noon,\\" I was expecting more of his technical mastery with Mike Gordon providing support. But it is only on Kottke's compositions here and on the collaborative track \\"June\\" that one will find anything approaching the classic Kottke six and 12-string styles. Gordon's solo compositions seem repetitive and shallow, including the title track.This is a pairing that has lots of potential, but they didn't reach it on this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the humanity","review":"The instrumentals are good, but the vocals are dreadful!

I'm really disappointed. I can't give it but 2 stars since there's no way to give 2-1/2 that I can see. There are far too many vocals: eight of fourteen cuts are vocals. Seven of the eight are either inane or insane! Neither Kottke nor Gordon can sing worth a damn. I have always thought that Leo's self-description of his voice as sounding \\"...like geese farts on a muggy day...\\" was actually quite charitable. The six instrumentals range from mediocre to pretty good, though nothing earth-shaking. I hear bits and pieces of older stuff. I liked the album photos. For one thing, they show Leo as starting to show his age rather than a perpetual 28-year-old. Maybe having his birthday on September 11th might have something to do with this. I wish Leo would just Shut Up And Play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop with the vocals","review":"Good instrumentals, but the vocals are dreadful.

A few songs were pointless none sense that Phish would have tried to pull. I understand the new generation really loved Phish. For me I was glad to see them break. Mike Gordon is a great bassist but should never be allowed to write or sing. Save your money unless you are really curious as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clone Alone","review":"As we all know, Leo's style just can't be pinned down--and with the help of Mike Gordon, he's found a friend with whom he can share his tilted sense of melody, rhythm, and lyrics. I admit I was dubious at first--but the more I played it, the better it became: it almost took on a life of its own. So why can't Leo's followers just accept that he's taken a different turn--or that maybe this is a comfortable way of sharing his talents? Look to his CD \\"Standing in My Shoes\\" for an idea of where he was going--this is comical, laughable, and most of all, as whacky as can be. Mike Gordon isn't trying to steal the show or turn this into a Phish-like disc; if anything, he's the perfect foil. Besides, Leo does a nice turn with his voice on \\"I am a Lonesome Fugitive,\\" so kick back and enjoy these two characters at play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Clones","review":"I've been simply smiling since the first time I put this on. Kottke's picking with Gordon's bass lines? Kitchen implements and other instrumental oddities? Instrumentals and skewed lyric pieces?

This is just a fine cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very unique collaboration","review":"I'm a big Phish-head and a bass player, but i'd heard a little Leo before and was aware of his history.

I have a paper copy but wanted to add a digital copy for ease of use. Simply, the e-book does not open as the sort of e-text I'm used to. It's as though each page were scanned seperately as an image but not OCR'ed into text. I could do that myself and get a better result. The lower quarter of the page does not show and it is impossible to resize. Even if it were possible to resize, as displayed, the text is too small to read. It is equally unusable on my android tablet. Not only am I sorry I bought the thing, I'm afraid to buy anything else from Kindle. I do not have money to throw away on unusuable junk.

It explains it well and how to say it with nice exercises at the end of each lesson. I am not all the way thru but i would suggest this book as a good starting foundation for teaching yourself. The only knock i would have against this book is that it doesnt come with an accompanying CD ;) highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best self-teaching guide","review":"By the time I decided to buy this book, I had read a few other books and spent a lot of time trying to teach myself.

It contains no information useful to anyone who has the slightest experience with automotive mechanics. It is typical of so many automotive books, and especially magazines, which contain only the most basic and generic information rather than addressing the difficult technical aspects of the subject. Any one who could find the information in this book useful and informative should NOT be attempting to build a kit car. My qualifications?

The piano in the beginning of the song is one of my absolute favorite musical pieces in the song. The strings were also excellent. \\"Wipe Out\\" went excellent with the war scene. The piano in the opening title of the song was composed excellently, adding the strings created a classical masterpiece all the way to the end. My last favorite song was \\"Brother\\". The same pitch & tone from \\"Drifter in...LAX\\"and \\"On the shore\\", but a few extra notes made it the best in the last scene with Kitano. All-in-all, this is the best CD to go out and purchase.

You will not learn about the artist and you won't see much of Daniel Craig (yes, he's naked in the tub, but is that alone worth the purchase price?). What's more, you won't likely be engaged as there is nothing even closely resembling a story arc. Perhaps the film-makers forgot to take there ritalin during production?! Too frenetic, too disjointed, and just...too much of nothing to connect with."},{"rating":"2","title":"To either love or hate as a film","review":"The question is whether you're viewing this as a lover of Bacon's work or to enjoy what is simply a fascinating cult film in itself. A few of the intermittant shots are not the most original and the storyline might not be to all tastes, but the Jacobi-Craig clash and borderline humour of supporting characters combine for some wonderfully twisted dialogue that brings it alive!

If a vendor were to sell their product, they should at least provide the correct pictures, because it makes the customer doubt if the correct product was received. But these were what I got, so I used them.Second of all, the ovulation strips never gave me a positive result, even though I tested twice a day. I know I ovulated because the ultrasound showed my erupted follicle already released an egg, and my blood test also showed that I ovulated. I know I have a short LH surge, which is why I test twice a day. I had NEVER missed my surge ever since I tested twice a day, until now.I had always been impressed with internet test strips, so I thought I'd try these ones because they were cheaper than what I had purchased before.

The test strips can be hard to read so I used these along with digital tests to confirm. I did it this way so I could test more often without spending a fortune on just digital tests.The Ovulation strips were pretty accurate, but I sometimes could not tell if the lines were the same, darker, etc. I tested twice a day so I would not miss anything; once in the early afternoon and once later in the evening. Once I noticed two dark lines I would just confirm with a digital Clear Blue Ovulation test I ordered from Amazon too.The Pregnancy Strips detected about 6 days before my missed period. The line was so faint though I could barely see it. If you do see any kind of line though, I think it means positive. I started seeing the faintest of lines starting on a Tuesday and the line got darker as the days went on.

The first two months, the ovulation predictor was positive at the right time and only once, so it seemed they were working. When the ovulation test was not positive at all the next two months, I began to get worried that I wasn't ovulating. Later when my period was late, I used the pregnancy tests. After about three which I thought were negative, I looked closer and noticed there was a faint positive line. I got a First Response pregnancy test 3 pack and took those (of course all three!), and all were positive. So I got pregnant when I was starting to worry I had ovulation problems!

They didn't for me... I had some ovulation strips left over from the previous month, that I bought at CVS (for like 10 times the price: $20 for 20 strips). For kicks, I thought I'd try them simultaneously. I was pretty amazed to see that the ones from CVS clearly showed me as ovulating the 3 days (I didn't test daily over the ovulation period), while these FAILED to show any ovulation for those days, or any other days. For me, it was a waste of money. Clearly, I won't trust their pregnancy test strips either.

When Wondfo gave a negative result according to their directions ( test line lighter than control line), Clear Plan gave me a straight up positive.Don't waste your important TIME with these.

They are much cheaper than the big name brands. I have been using them for one month. The instructions are on the packaging and pretty straight forward. When I first started using them (op strips), I really thought they weren't working because I would see a faint line all the time. I became really discouraged until one day, the line was exactly the same shade as the control line. So, my advice is to just keep taking the tests and disregard any line that isn't DARK. I'm going to use them again next month, so like I said, we'll see:) I also used the pregnancy strips once and they worked the same way. The line is either there or it isn't. These tests are extremely straight forward.... no frills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too sure about these","review":"I have had the best success with First Response 6 Days sooner. I tried these and A) I never got a true positive on the OPKs and B) the pregnancy tests kept coming up negative even after my period was due; a week after it turns out I was quite pregnant (per my doc), and then and only then did I finally get a strong positive on these. Word to the wise: most women that order these kits I presume its not your first rodeo, and as such many will want an answer asap. If thats the case, spend a little extra money and get the digital OPKs and a 3 pack of First Response tests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and worked perfectly!","review":"It's true what the other reviews say about the package being simple and nothing fancy. The ovulation strips and pregnancy strips came in a ziploc baggie.

The LH line showed up dark pink one day and we did our thing and I just took a test today and guess what, it's positive!

I read most other comments and the instructions and found it pretty basic and straightforward. I'm on my second cycle, and even thou I'm not pregnant yet (waiting one more week to see if I am), I have no complaints about the strips. The second line is faint until you get a positive result. For me, when positive, both lines were relatively dark and the same color.

Contrary to other reviews I had read, my kit did come with instructions and were extremely easy to read and use. It accurately predicted my ovulation period, because we got pregnant on the first try!I also used the pregnancy test. The only thing a bit annoying about these was that you have to wait until your urine was room temperature. But other than that, the result was very clear. It said I was pregnant one day after my missed period (I didn't check earlier than this) - but the result was extremely clear.If you're looking for a cheap and easy way to monitor your ovulation and/or check pregnancy - look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I used these religiously when TTC and the test line was never as dark as the base line. I thought I wasn't ovulating. It would get darker as the days went on, but never matched the base line. According to the directions, that's a negative. A friend of mine was seeing a fertility specialist and said he told her to use the Clearblue tests as they are by far better. They are not cheap, but I tried it for a month and I did get a smiley face, which is a positive result. I then took these again to see if I would get a positive and I still did not. I luckily was able to conceive that month that I got the smiley face with the Clearblue test. These seem to work for a lot of people, but they were not accurate for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"These worked great for me. As a suggestion to those gals that got a line that was close to the test line, I got that too. However, I tested again about 8 hours later and got a positive test (lines were the same color). I actually thought the gradual increase was helpful. Maybe testing twice a day when you think you are close is a good plan. Anyways, they were packaged well in a plastic bag.

After 3 months of use, I have never received a positive test. The first month I was using a copper IUD, but that really has no effect on ovulation. The past two months-nothing.

Clearblue digital gave me a positive LH surge result and the Devon Medical still said negative. As a side note, the product says that if the result line is faint in comparison to the quality control line, that the result is negative. This product DOES give a faint line when tested at the same time that other tests give a positive, so the product does seem to work, but it isn't perhaps as sensitive as others on the market at detecting LH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative reading when POSITIVELY PREGNANT","review":"I took the pregnancy tests multiple times because I had a feeling that I was pregnant.

You find yourself rooting for Indiana, who is strong but naive but especially for Ralph, that strong, silent type. The ending is very odd but the book reads quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lay It On 'Em Girls - Big Time Sarah","review":"Great music for hanging out. Sarah belts it out large and her lyrics are awsome.

To that end, I spend weekends listening to the blues show in our local radio. I heard one song by Big Time Sarah and the BTS, and really wanted to hear more. This CD is the bomb! Big Time Sarah belts out one fantastic song after another. This is a really bounce type blues, as opposed to some artists who are more on the sad side. The first song, \\"I make love\\" is so full of life. The rest of the album follows the this theme. I love \\"Boogie Woogie Woman\\", \\"The thrill is gone\\" and pretty much the rest of the CD. Each song is terrific and Big Time Sarah and the BTS Express are a joy to listen to. I feel this is a great introduction to this artist and would highly recommend it to modern blues lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE POWERS THAT BE","review":"Call girl Marja's involvement in a well-publicized murder case turns her already topsy-turvy life into speedzone. Author Harold Robbins goes through the mesirable life of this woman with a fine-tooth comb and succeeds in delivering a humanized portrait of a lost soul who's personal and professional havocs push her to the limits of self-destruction. Her path to there is a no holds barred, gritty contemporary read that is destined to become a one sitting read.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst closet rod","review":"This rod is too skimpy & could NEVER support the amount of garments that it's extended length accomodates.

However there were only 2 actors that could act, there was not enough of a story to go with it. Sure, the overall plot was acceptable, but there was no real drama or hook that draws you in, begging for you to see the next scene. There was very little character development and of course the CGI was (I'll be kind) lacking in anything remotely resembling a great monster impression. Bottom line, If you like a stale story, horrible special effects, and 7 sex scenes randomly placed within a movie for no reason at all, then this is the show for you! However if you like actual character and story development, real drama, and a longing to know how it will turn out, then please do not waste your money like I did. This movie was not worth the $3 dollars I lost to watch it. Please learn from my mistake, do not watch Animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rawest sex scene ever!","review":"All in all as a movie production goes, I would give \\"Animals\\" 2 -3 stars.

Where has she been hiding that body?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Urban Romance Novel","review":"I picked up this movie after finding out it was put out by Maverick Entertainment Group.

Some notes about the cover: I never saw a hot red-head in the movie, and the scene on the cover has nothing to do with anything. That's fine: it reminds me of Evil Dead's cover. This, however, is no Evil Dead. I love a good B-movie as much as the next gal, but this film was riding that line where it was neither good enough nor bad enough to be worth watching. It reeks of mediocrity, and the \\"plot\\" just seems to be some pointless and badly acted conversations or killings interspersed with the very awkward and unconvincing sex. Suspension-of-disbelief was not invoked.

In particular, there are multiple images of bergs and growlers that are breathtaking.However, those of us interested in the story of the trip, its preparation, the re-creation of the ship, the research of the itinerary and, in general, in knowledge about either vikings' shipbuilding technology or seafaring will be greatly disappointed. The text provided in the book amounts to a few lines per page in very large font, and does not attempt to describe any of the research associated with this trip, or even any of the details of the trip itself. There is so little text across the whole book that it can be read in 10 to 15 minutes...If you intend to buy this book, be aware that this is a coffee table book: pictures only. I was interested in knowledge rather than photography - for me it was a total letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pages and Out of Date","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to the Unix philosophy and gives a good sense of the development of the Unix tool set on any platform. Unfortunately, the code in this text relies on compiler specific adaptations that were common with Fortran IV processors, but which strict Fortran 66 and 77 compilers are unable to handle, (Fortran 66 compilers are a rarity anymore). This text is only useful as a reference, but is an interesting read, especially in comparing with Software Tools in Pascal and The C Programming Language. If your intent is to learn the software tools with code that can actually compile, get Software Tools in Pascal.6 pages (145-150) were missing from the copy shipped by Amazon (27th printing).

In addition to a good textbook and atlas, I would highly recommend this book; it provides excellent clinical scenarios and applications of anatomy. (I would not recommend using it as your only book, however.) It is a lighter, easier read than most anatomy texts, and the jokes are often very useful for helping you to remember specific clinical details for your anatomy exam!

She asks to watch it multiple times every day. Sometimes we have to hide it. She laughts at Elmo and really relates to all the animals and babies that are shown in the segments.The video is divided into 3 full length segments of Elmo's World - one on babies, one on dogs, and one on farm animals. My daughter loves each one. Plus they are very educational. If there is a new baby on the way, I DEFINITELY recommend this video as a tool to teach your toddler about babies. It discusses how to play with babies and what newborns are like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many animals, too few babies","review":"We were really disappointed with the Babies section of this DVD.

It makes bottlefeeding appear to be the norm (certainly NOT what I want to teach my child)! It also refers repeatedly to \\"babysitters.\\" I would never leave a baby with a \\"babysitter\\" and I certainly wouldn't want to teach my child that babysitters are the norm either.

Elmo learns about what babies eat, how they behave and the joy they bring to their families.Then Elmo learns about dogs and how to feed and take care of them. Mr. Noodle is along as he does one of his usual silly routines as he walks a pretend dog much to Elmo's and kids delight.The last part of the DVD deals with farms as Old Macdonald joins the fun teaching Elmo all about life on a farm. Elmo learns about taking care of farm animals and growing vegetables. This was a fun and educational DVD for kids from toddler all the way through early elementary school, done with the usual Elmo flair, songs and silliness. A classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Elmo....what can I say","review":"Another great series of Elmo's World \\"stuff\\". While my daughter loves this DVD as much as the other Elmo's Worlds, my only comment on this particular DVD is that it doesn't have the same learning potential as the others. She loves babies and dogs (as most kids do)so that is why it is entertaining for her, but she really isn't getting the lessons out of this one that she does out of the others (like brushing your teeth and puting your shoes on and reading books).

The store where I worked sold it, I'd never heard of it before. All the cashiers used it. It used to be fairly hard to find, but I think its popularity has caused the manufacturer to make it more widely available.It's slightly greasy, but not too much. It leaves a nice \\"sheen\\" on your skin. It lasts a long time too.My only complaint (and it's a minor one) is that the scent, while pleasant, can be a bit overpowering. There is NO need to wear perfume if you're using Razac. It would only clash and/or be overpowered by the scent of this lotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff is great especially for the price!","review":"It smells good and it moisturizes very well, Razac lotion also compliments ANY fragrance you are wearing. At first it smells like a perfume, but as the day goes by, someone always ask me do you have on baby powder or what is that you're wearing, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time user","review":"Razac hand and body lotion is a product that I have used for atleast 15 years. The first time I used the product I wasn't sure of how good it really was until other people would ask me, \\"what is that you wearing\\", as if I had on some expensive cologne. As a man it's important to me to be well groomed, moisturized and smelling good. Razac covers both, and not only that, it mixes with your body chemistry, so no two people will smell the same.

From the physical presentation --- the book comes wrapped in a thick cover with a nice inside-flap folded over, like a hardcover --- to the content, this is a nicely done production. It is not just fiction writers interviewed here, either. Janet Malcolm, the journalist, was interviewed, and her piece inspired me enough to purchase her book, THE JOURNALIST AND THE MURDERER. And the writers talk about more than just fiction: they cover philosophy, the art of writing, politics, feminism, current events, you name it.If you're an aspiring writer, this is a very fun, enjoyable book to read when you're tired of reading fiction for inspiration but want to become inspired by other means. As mentioned in the notes, (to paraphrase), \\"...all of the interviews are long.\\" They all, also, inform and inspire.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"No response to email of damaged product.","review":"I bought a seasoned DVD from this user and obtained it pretty quick.

He describes customs through the eyes of someone who has no idea what's coming his way and takes all his misadventures in stride. Everyone who has - or doesn't have - interest in that part of the world should read this book and learn from it, especially now that the United States is entrenched in war and reconstruction in several countries. Generally, we think we can understand the Arab cultures by acknowledging that there are different ways of dressing and different foods. Most people don't grasp the very fundamental differences that set us at odds with people from that part of the world. Horwitz bridges that gap with humor and insight. My favorite chapters are those about Yemen, the birthland of Osama Bin Laden. No one should ever be tempted to measure that beautiful land by the standards of the Western world.This book is a fabulous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my All-Time Favorites","review":"Tony Horwitz manages to do something many writers strive to do and almost none succeed at: Telling a farcical tale of his travel experiences and not only making it both believeable and hilarious, but doing so in such a way that you feel you have been there yourself. This is one of the few books I reread on a regular basis. You can open it to any page in the middle, start reading, and truly enjoy it. Each Middle Eastern country is dealt with differently, presenting different challanges and adventures, from the fundamentalist Iran to the poverty of Sudan to the totalitarian Iraq to the apathetic Yemen. He brings us an entertaining view of the many differences in a world we have previously thought to be homogenous. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the deepest laughs from a travel book.","review":"The book that got me hooked on all his other travel books.Incredibly funny when writing about some of the encounters and experiences he's had with the people. Good light reading if your planning on going to travel in the middle east."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp and insightful","review":"Although this book seems cobbled together from news reports that did not get published at the time he wrote them, the essays offer an interesting picture of the Arabia behind the headlines. Horwitz offers sharp insights on a region of the world which remains an unknown to so many of us in the US. Author Horwitz brings out the contradictions and the humanity of the Middle East."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top journalist of our time writes an enthralling book","review":"I strongly believe that Tony Horwitz is the best journalist of our time. His detailed descriptions bring to life foreign scenes in a way few others can. He dialogue and rapport with people all over the world make for great anecdotes and deeply moving stories. He provides a rich and powerful account of life pre-Gulf War in the Arab world. Although much of this information is probably outdated today, I would love to read a follow-up by Horwitz about how it has changed. I highly recommend everything he's written for a better look at the world around us and a better understanding of ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate & Funny","review":"I read this book shortly after returning from Egypt. Horowitz is quite possibly the bravest (or dumbest) author I have ever read. His stories about running around the middle east are told with an accuracy and honesty that is offset nicely by his sense of humor and wit. The Arabian Flights chapter is my personal favorite. Especially if you have ever been to an airport in the middle east. Even though his account is about 10 years old it has retained a relevance that can still be appreciated today."},{"rating":"2","title":"so clever","review":"great to have the three plays together to see how beautiful and clever the construction is - very funny and very human"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thunderbird U.","review":"Thunderbird - the American Graduate School of International Management, is where these two guys graduated from with M.B.A.s.

With an open door policy, we could show the people in Communist countries that our system is better and in every way gives people security and pleasure. The worst thing to do is, as Dulles advocated, to to fight them head on. Dulles must have contributed a lot to the utterly crazy Cold War tension and perhaps the Vietnam War.

That's quite the normal setting in any self help book. However, I do like the author's clear, logical and straight to the point writing, without the excessive and tedious examples anonymous commonly found in most self help books. The five page Chapter Eight, so named a synthesis: putting it altogether, (the seven set of factors were grouped into seven individual chapters), simply tells how \\"to the point\\" the author had been. In a word, a very good read.p.s. I like the saying in front of each chapter much.

I'm ordering a set of replacement blades today."},{"rating":"2","title":"peanut","review":"Introduced to the peanut by nursing assistance who also does hair. What a wonderful clipper set.

They're really made for general hair clipping, but work great on my beard with the smallest guard. They're sturdy, powerful, professional grade clippers. They even travel well, although the cord is nearly as bulky as the clipper body. I use mine primarily at home. You can only choose lengths from the clipper guards, but I'm happy with the small guard length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"A little wider than I thought but work great. Quiet and cut clean. I just got them and used them once so don't know how they will last. It was a plus to get the extra trimming combs with it. I took quite a while using them as I am just teaching myself to groom my own Shih Tzu. They did not get warm so you can use them a long time. I would recomend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"The clipper does a fair job considering i am not a professional. Its small and handy. I use it to trim my mouthstache and beard, which is quite effortless. I only wished that it came with another comb to cut my hair lower, safely; being of African decent that type of cut is ideal. After 1 year its still operational as new, no issues with workmanship whatsoever. Would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs a punch!","review":"Very powerful little trimmer.

I use it for head 'shaving' and the wife uses it for trimming the 'personal area'. For my balding dome, we use it without any attachment - I can't shave my head because my scalp is too sensitive and the follicles get infected - which is also the reason why I keep the blades meticulously clean (once a month, I wipe down the blades with an alcohol-soaked Q-Tip and then add a drop of oil). The smallest guide produces a nice uniform trim of the lady parts, and you can use it without the guide for a nice sharp line if that's your pleasure. Note that the guides are fragile - drop the clipper working-end down from even a foot or two and guaranteed, you'll break the guide ($8/set). Bottom line: take care of the Peanut and it will take care of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty sweet","review":"Nice and compact, trims well, just the right attachments. Only negative aspect is the lack of height adjustment for the \\"no guard\\" trim as is found on many larger clippers, since I like a length less than 1/8\\" but more than the bare minimum for clippers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trimmer no good for sensitive toddler heads","review":"We purchased this trimmer on recommendation because it was supposed to be easier on sensitive toddler heads. Instead, the trimmer seems to be getting louder over time with stronger and stronger vibrations. The last time I tried to cut my son's hair, he absolutely refused to stay still and screamed bloody murder non-stop. These clippers might be good for older kids to use, but it is useless for sensitive toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I could've hoped for","review":"Honestly, it's perfect.

Wahl is such a good brand so I knew I was in good hands, plus the high ratings from everyone else really helped sell me on the purchase. It cuts so effortlessly and fits in the hand perfectly, much better than normal clippers. The guards are easy to apply and you don't have to worry about adjusting the blade height or anything, just pop on the guards. It doesn't seem to clog and really does an even job. The only thing I would say that worries me a little is when I am using it for a longer period of time, the trimmer sounds like it is slowing down (possibly because of overheating?) but I couldn't really tell a difference in the cutting performance.Overall, this is a great trimmer that is light and compact, powerful, doesn't clog, and cuts evenly. Buy it! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corded trimmer...","review":"This trimmer is very good for face and feet, but is does have a tendency to burn if you are not careful.

Only con is the attachments do not give you much of a selection in terms of height adjustments.The trimmer is very light weight. Even if it was heavy, it is still a performer.

I definitely recommend this trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good power, small package.","review":"Lots of power for a small shaver. I use it for my head and I love it.

I heard good things about the Wahl brand, but am disappointed with the Peanut. Every haircutting session from day 1 involves me oiling the blades at least twice per cut, and having to constantly remove hair from the blade. If I don't do it, the clipper jams. Continuously having to remove the attachment in order to pull oily (from oiling the blades) hair off while also keeping the blades oiled... and yet still having the clipper (painfully) pull hair instead of cutting it... nonstop fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"It does what it is expected to do... fine trimming for my beard, sideburns and underarms without causing any pinching sensation.. like this product.. thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"I saw Laura opening for Josh Ritter in SF last week. I was listening only fairly casually, but rather liked her performance--at least enough to buy her album from the merchandise table.As it turns out, Laura's album is absolutely beautiful. One of my favorites of the last few years. The songs are crafted in such a way that their scenes are only sketched in collectively by the fairly minimal lyrics, melody, and instrumentation. Laura's vocal style is compelling: phrasing varies all over the place, and she mixes sustained and clipped rhythms in a way that keeps things interesting (Cat Power came to mind for some reason).Nightwatch in particular is amazing. I also love Hands in Pockets, Small Town Parade, and Country, Country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing litter box","review":"I've had mine for nearly two years and it's the best. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment, and keep it in the spare bedroom, which I also use for exercise. The first few months I had it, I kept going into the room to clean the litter, forgetting I didn't need to do it daily. I now set an appointment on my calendar to remind me to clear it out weekly.I have two cats, one of whom is afraid of pretty much everything (people she doesn't know, vacuums, my Roomba). I was worried she'd have a hard time with it, but she took to it right away. They both did.It is quite large, so be prepared for that. But it's definitely one of the favorite purchases I've ever made.

Although it was quite easy to set up, it never worked right and after three weeks, it doesn't work at all. Initially, it would go through its cycle just fine, but for some reason, the waste would not end up in the collector tray. Then the motor jammed and I can't find any visible problem. To add insult to injury, my cat has decided he doesn't need to go all the way in the hole in order to pee - he just stands in the entrance and pees on the floor...I have not yet called customer service so I can't comment further.

Both of my cats (one adventurous male, one finicky female) adapted to the Litter Robot immediately. I was afraid it'd take some coaxing, but they warmed to it at once.Pros:-eliminates odors-no more scooping!-large enough for bigger cats-comes nearly completely assembled; set up consists of literally setting the top bubble piece onto the baseCons:-a little expensive-quite a bit larger than a regular litterboxIn my case, the pros completely outweigh the cons.Also, just a quick note: while the litterbox is not silent, I was pleasantly surprised at the sound it produces- I had a read a review that compared it to a blowdryer, and was expecting a loud motor. I think it's much quieter than a blow dryer, and when it's cycling, I can't even hear it from one room over."},{"rating":"1","title":"get this only if you have money to burn","review":"all was well with the litter robot.

Once I got our 2 cats to use it life was good. Unit easily cleans litter as described for a week before needing litter tray emptying.The problem is this thing relies on motors, power supply, and a circuit board to operate efficiently daily. When most cats urinate they keep they're 2 front paws out of the box, occasionally some of that will spill over in the front. This has happened with our unit and destroyed the improperly sealed circuit board.I have spoken with customer service and just like you might expect they assume everyone is stupid and try fixing the unit starting from the cheapest component. I have waited over a month for a power supply which I know will not fix the unit because I'm sure it was the urine.Just know you are taking a chance with this thing and for $329 you won't get much piece of mind if you have problems even though it comes with an 18 month BS warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!!","review":"I had given up on so-called \\"automatic\\" and \\"self cleaning\\" litterboxes.

Then I stumbled across this bad boy - more expensive yes so I took a huge gamble and man did it pay off!!! I have been using it for more than a month now. My fairly large Bengal took right too it (I just filled it with his normal clumping litter and put it in the same place as his old box). This litterbox NEVER jams or sticks and is very quiet. The sifting and tumble system is awesome ... the litter always looks brand new!!

The Robot seems to be it. With the exception of the cats chewing threw the flimsy out-of-the-box cord that comes with the unit (I don't see why the $20 \\"cat proof\\" cord isn't just standard), the Robot has been virtually 'hands-free'.

The first lasted three years with two cats, so I felt it was well worth the purchase price and decided to buy a new unit when the old one died. $350 and one year later the electronic part of the machine died. Just had no power one day. I called the customer service number and left messages since no matter what time I called no human answered, but my calls have not been returned.I liked the product but spending even more money for a machine that only lasted a year seems like a foolish waste of money.

The smell in her room was so overpowering that I could not stand to go in there without holding my breath.Once we got the Litter Robot the smell went away and we are living happily ever after.

When the robot \\"cycles,\\" it smears poop all over the interior of the globe. Stinnky, stinky, STINKY!! When it's ready for the cat to use, the space where there is actually litter is less than one foot square; I don't see how a bigger, full-grown cat could aim itself any better? I have wasted lots of litter, due to needing to throw everything away, wash the globe, and start over.

My cats took to it the first day with no trouble at all. They had previously been using a Litter Maid Mega that does not have a mega tray. With three cats changing the plastic tray became an every other day thing. That gets expensive over time.The Robot uses plastic bags that you buy in the grocery store so forget buying the trays which aren't cheap. I don't have to change the bags but every three and sometimes four day. Life is a lot simpler and the extra money for the Robot is well worth it.Having said that I cannot tell you how great the folks are to work with. The globe on my original Robot broke and they replaced it at no charge. Now I have up graded to a whole new one at a discounted price for being a long time customer.So my advice is that if you think it's too much money, think again. You will save in the long run in time and supplies. I love the Robot. What more can I say?Happy in CT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"At first I wasn't sure if our cats would use this (we have 4). They have never had a covered box and this was way different than the Littermaid they were used to. It took a day or two for them to be comfortable with it but since it's so much cleaner than their old box, they use it more reliably than the other. The reviews for the Litter Robot are what sold me on it. Yes, the cost is alot more than the Littermaid but I've gone through 4 of them in the last 6 years so it's really cheaper in the long run. We used to have to empty the waste containers every day but with the Robot, we only empty twice a week!

It has not been the panacea that I had hoped for. I have 2 kitties. My newer one was refusing to use any litter box that had been used, so I got this for her. The robot had nice instructions for how to introduce cats to it, but she is still too skittish to use it. Fortunately, she has become more reasonable now in litter box habits anyway. My other kitty is 10.5 lbs. He will use it (reluctantly), but doesn't quite fit so gets poop on the outlet area. So, I think I should have saved my money.

If something dies you can get parts so you do not have to purchase a new unit. The people I have worked with at the company are wonderful and if you have a problem they are there to help and this is obvious right from the beginning.One thing is they cover the entire unit for 18 mounts so you do not have to have a unit that dies the day after the unit fails.

The cats kick litter out and litter catches in the small dumping doors and piles up on the floor on both sides. Sometimes a clump will get caught in the doors and the doors won't close.

All this led to a non-functioning 299.00 litter box that is a pain in the tail to clean out (manually). I have left messages for the \\"Customer Service dept\\" but no calls back.!! What really angers me is that I initially spoke so highly of the product two of my close friends purchased the same product. At this time I would recommend you not buy this product on-line, MAYBE at a local pet store etc that you can easily return it too if there are problems.

I have only ever had a problem because of my own laziness-i.e. I didn't empty the base, add more litter or use the right kind of litter. With Four cats I empty every two days but can wait for 3 days if I don't use grocery bags (the litter liners sit deeper and can collect more waste). There is only a smell right after the cats have used it. I've moved this unit through three apartments, stored it for two months, transported it from SC to NY on the back of a truck and it still works LIKE NEW. I have one heavier cat that fits into the \\"globe\\" without any trouble. It is large but the benefit of having a fresh smelling, more sanitary apartment completely makes up for any size issues.

When I cooked on it the right way, easy as clean up can be on cast iron. I started to deglaze with the pan was smoking hot... spent an hour cleaning it (my fault).

Also, executables in the encrypted area would not work. I was also not able to get the properties of encrypted files, such as date created, or time the file was modified. The file list is a specialized form, not the standard Windows format. I emailed Verbatim Tech Support and got a prompt response. I downloaded the software suggested by Verbatim, and it didn't work.

It only covers the core of Ada, but it gives very thorough explanations, with illustrations of both recommended and problematic techniques.

What was up with all the sub-plots which go nowhere...ej. The government guy and Megan, Thibideaux and Ricci..... The story dragged on and on and finally picked up at the end, but it was too late to salvage this story.

You never really have any reason to fear them.The story goes like this... The villains develop a deadly bio-engineered virus. They plan to make a fortune by selling it to other villains. They also use it to infect the head of a multi-national technology firm. He just happens to be a kind, caring man from a working class background.

The most interesting character to me in the book was the cunning freelance agent, Lathrop, who managed to pit rival drug lords against one another and benefit in the process.

The story moves at glacial speed with incredibly stupid content. Example: At one point in the book two people are soaking in a HOT tub and eventually have sex. The conversation is ridiculous and aggravating. But the REAL kicker is the author is so stupid that he describes the water temperature as 180 degrees. Water boils at 212! I was also pissed at Tom Clancy for puttng his name on it. If I put my name on a book I didn't write, I'd at least make sure that the book was well written.

Spewed lots of green stuff around."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY SLIME TIRES!!!","review":"The slime in these tires will clog the valve and make the tire impossible to inflate or deflate.

I was sorely disappointed. I'm not sure why, but I have had several flats on every bike I've put these on. I haven't treated them roughly - I just ride to school and back, about a mile each way. I keep the bikes outside, but I'm not sure what difference that would make. The tubes appear to be particularly vulnerable around the valve, and when something goes wrong smelly green stuff gets oozes out around the valve.In short: try something else! This is a great idea but has been horribly executed by the Slime guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slime has gone downhill","review":"I used to swear by pre-Slimed tubes - I used them in my bikes for at least 5 years - but I've stopped using them because they've become unreliable.The idea behind pre-Slimed tubes is great. The tubes come with just the right amount of an anti-flat goo already loaded in them so that the tire can fix itself if you get a small/medium puncture flat. This self-sealing action lessens the risk of a sudden flat that throws you off your bike since the tire deflates slowly. You'll probably be able to make it home before being forced to change the flat.I used these tubes for years and everything was great. Unfortunately, this year I've gotten a series of tubes that all failed at the valve stem within a few days of installation. The tubes were installed properly, one even by a professional. I wonder if the company that makes these changed their manufacturing process (cheaper! faster!). Anyway, I can't use something that I can't rely on.Therefore, one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"False sense of security","review":"I've been stranded twice by these tires. Sure it can fix some flats but if you get a pinch flat (common in the rockies) it doesn't work.

I was wrong. Rode my bike regularly for awhile, then a small thorn punctured the tire. The slime did virtually nothing to stop the leak, so i went and bought a patch kit from a hardware store. The patch kit works wonderfully! Makes me wish i had just bought those originally instead of the slime tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"I had to walk my bike home twice with these. And as if that isn't hard enough with a normal tire in the heat, the \\"slime\\" tires are slower than a normal one. I could hear a \\"slosh\\" sound and it felt like I was dragging lead.

Once the puncture happens they leak green goo all over the place, making a complete mess of your tire. They don't work to seal off the leak at all. You might as well just buy regular tubes without the green goo in it. I am going to try liners next to prevent flats.

Hate fixing flats so about twelve years ago I tried Slime tubes and have kept on using them ever since. More than once I've had a flat and I mean FLAT tire that I've pumped up and that tire stays inflated because of the Slime filling in the puncture. My experience with the Slime tubes is beyond satisfactory but I'm here looking at reviews to see if anyone else has had troubles with the Slime that is added to a normal tube. I've tried it once or twice and have not been happy with it but can't remember why. I've got a new bike Forge Sconset Beach Cruiser Bike - Skyscape Blue that hasn't even been outside yet and I hate the idea of removing the wheels and taking out the brand new tubes, I'd way rather keep those tubes in place and add Slime to them.

As stated in other reviews you can not patch them. Also in my experience you can't replace the air in the tire to the maximum recommended pressure after a puncture. What they have done for near 2 years is get me to work and home again without replacing or patching the tube during the ride. Good enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks like a sieve!","review":"I used two of these on my garden cart because I got tired of repairing leaks. Within two days I had two leaks which could not be patched. The holes are smaller than 1/8 inch. But...I expected more and got less.

Listening to Cory trying to sing \\"One\\" and \\"Easy to Be Hard\\" was so pitiful it was actually painful to hear. Chuck was such a MAJOR part of this group that \\"It's just no good any more since he went away!\\" And actually, he didn't go away. He asked to rejoin the group after he finally kicked his drug addiction nightmare, but the other guys made his re-entry terms so humiliating, that he turned them down. Shame on you, Cory! Shame on you, Danny! What THE THREE OF THEM had was magic--without Chuck, no magic. BTW, Chuck sounds great as a solo act now. True 3DN fans should check him out."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Dog Night","review":"How disappointing, without all three lead vocals, this is not Three Dog Night.

They should have used the original charts for the songs. It was a great set, however, as a LIVE Concert there were too many superimposed images that appeared to be added in post production. I believe the interviews and flashbacks should have been placed on the DVD as an extras. The gallery had no sound at all.

Still a good companion, but won't run. Don't get me wrong - Danny and Cory can belt out a tune with the best of them.

Let's talk about moving on in life. Ok, one new song, otherwise they are still living off of 30 years ago. Pathetic. They should be talented enough (even withut Negron) to come up with some new material. Negron has, why can't they? My advice, skip this piece of junk and get Negron Cd's and his Live DVD.

For those who are familiar with Roger Corman productions let me assure you that this movie delivers everything you've come to expect from a Corman production; low budget production values, laughable special effects, cheesy soundtrack, comic book dialogue and sub-par acting.Despite all the negatives there is a spirit to the film that eventually captured my interest and kept me watching until the very end. Whether that \\"spirit\\" aforementioned is something to be attributed to Corman for infusing into the film or something nostalgic residing within myself is uncertain.

This video was very bland when contrasted with the her previous two. The workout was not challenging enough and I was disappointed with this one.

At some point he makes the claim that Fragonard's \\"The Bathers\\" is \\"the most powerful composition in the world.\\" Seriously? According to the author, art gets derailed in the 19th century, and what we need to get back on track is a unifying purpose.

I strongly suspect this is a Roughnecks: Starship Trooper DVD.As far as the rating system, I give the Roughneck series 5 STARS and then some. What I'm rating is the seller's lack of willingness to answer the question whether this is truly the BBC Roughnecks and am putting the one star to, again, sound a note of caution to any buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roughnecks : Starship Troopers Chronicles","review":"I have to say that I usually do not watch cartoons whether they be celluloid or CG but I make an exception here. Not only is this an action packed series but it also has intelligently written scripts. The characters are believable and you do end up actually caring for them and hoping that they don't get skewered by bugs. I have watched every episode to date except the last Chronicle which has yet to be released, the Zephyr Campaign was just released last week so we're almost there. I recommend this entire series to anyone who loves SST or sci-fi for that matter and I know anyones children will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks ...!","review":"It's unfortunate the DVDs were not released in the right order, but can't complain!

Goodman in his Fourier Optics, E.L.O'Neill helped consummate the marriage between communication theory and optics.This book is not an introduction. In under 200 pages, It covers geometrical, fourier and statistical optics without patiently deriving the formulae in small steps. It feels to me like a train ride over a long distance, with many stops where the conductor points at important scenes and tells good stories that I did not know before, even for the places I previously visited. For example, page 26-27 talks about contrast reversal in a most direct fashion in real space, much more elucidating than treatments in frequency space only.The range of the topics in this book is close to 50% of combined (Warren Smith's Modern Optical Engineering + Joseph Goodman's Fourier Optics & Statistical Optics), the depth is about 80% of that combo, while the thickness is only 10%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large and colorful","review":"Item is colorful, but is large so make sure you look at deminsions.

What I was a bit surprised to hear (and this is where my inexperience with lil' ones comes into play) was how much she engages with the toy - she grabs it, squeezes it, pulls it, chews on it - to hear its crinkle, rattle, etc. My brother also thinks the bright colors have a lot to do with her attachment.Using my niece as the standard, I'm convinced that Lamaze has really done their homework when it comes to creating toys for babes.

I very good book. I don't care much for the way that it is told; however, with how it switches so randomly from one character to to another, all in 1st person. It honestly took me a few chapters to realize that it was in fact different characters. Then again, I wouldn't be able to think of another way to tell this tale and get the same feeling out of it.I liked how it focused on each character through thier trials, and how each character had their own way to speaking and feeling about things.

I would have liked this book better if the author had lightened up on his anti religious diatribe. I'm not particularly religious but I got tired of the same message being repeated over and over again in the story. Mr Modesitt made his point quite nicely early on in the story. His continual repeating of it throughout the story left me wondering if he had written the book to entertain or to send a message. I ended up feeling somewhat insulted, it was as if he thought I was too simple to get his point the first time he presented it and I needed to be told a few dozen more times before I would grasp it. I would have preferred a book with more plot and less preaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and OK","review":"I found this book very confusing, as the author continually changes the charecter he is talking about.

As the story goes on they become mere cardboard cutout players. In simple - Mystery planet requires long expidition to discover alien stuff. Some run of the mill space wars and some rather dull exploration of the planet all added up to not much. You are kept turning the pages on the expectation that something exciting will happen. But it don't. The mystery planet turns out to be full of nothing and the characters turn out to be uninteresting page fillers.

I gave it 2 stars just because of that. As far as I know this is the only attempt at bringing any of Zelazny's work to the screen. IMHO it ranks somewhere down alongside the Dr Strange movie; not what we want, but it's all we got. It has been described as being loosely based on the book and although Zelazny pulled his name from the credits because it was a bit too far off the mark for him, you can still recognize it as such. It's not as completely fabricated as the Bond movies, but it isn't especially faithful either. It's also a product of it's generation... you will recognize the cast from old TV shows like A-Team and Airwolf... so be aware of that shortcoming as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a \\"Damnation alright!","review":"From a very poor script to laughable acting, this slice of cheese about a super truck traveling the roads after world war 3 looking for a \\"safe zone\\" is just a waste.

In a 70's way, the performances by all main cast members is beyond acceptable. If sci fi/ post apocalyptic stories are of interest to you, you will not have a hard time forgetting the real world while watching this movie. It's a fun flic.To me friend Arthur R.

Jazz critic, historian Dan Morganstern contributes interesting historical facts about the Los Angeles jazz scene; here they splice in part of a Dexter Gordon interview. Although they advertise Dexter Gordon as part of the film, his segment is from elsewhere and not really filmed specifically for the film; it was not necessary to include this and was the only part of the film that was lifted from elsewhere.

As touching and insightful as the poems themselves are, it just wouldn't have been the same without the illustrations. I haven't been able to find anything else by this author, hopefully Portraits of the Healing Heart will be out soon. If you are reading the review and haven't read this book for yourself, you are missing out.

Didn't finish it, in the 30 or 45 minutes I watched, there was only one tune, Celeste Aida, weakly sung. The ballet at the idol was ridiculous. The direction was by the numbers. The aplause from the audience was as reluctant and meager as I felt listening.

This guide can help you keep from wasting time and getting frustrated.For 1, it gives a detailed walkthrough of the story, with helpful tips and maps of everywhere a long the way. You can find where an item you were looking for is at, or see how to get from place to place, or learn what to expect. It tells you what pokemon would be good for what battle, and what items you might need with you.The post story guide tells you how to get some legendary pokemon you may have not known existed.

PhantoM's Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire Version Strategy Guide Review","review":"Honestly, since they are given the information of the game, this guide should have been a lot better. The best quality about the strategy guide is the berry guide, the stats of the Pokemon, and that it suggests that you should start off with a Torchic.It does not show hidden item locations, not to mention it clusters what you can do from the beginning with what you can do after you obtain cut and such like that. It doesn't give you levels of Pokemon in the wilderness, you don't really get told about how much money you'll get from battles or what Pokemon which trainer uses.Overall, I personally think you should get an emulator and play through the game with every last detail, and make your own strategy guide, it'd be more resourceful and with the print screen button you might actually get somewhere with getting every last hidden treasure that's waiting to be found.J.W.I.

Now she's 6 months and really grabs it, bites on it, and moves the wings around making crackly noises.We renamed our firefly 'Fiona' as we had a noted lack of female stuffed animals in our household.

There's so much for her to grab and chew on, and she loves the rings on each end. It now travels everywhere we go - I attached a few linking rings to the handle of her carseat and stroller, and I can snap Freddie on the end very easily. She happily plays with it at home, and we even bought an extra one for her to play with at my mother's house (daycare). I will now be giving this as a baby shower gift to all my pregnant friends. If you're trying to decide which lamaze toy to get (as I was) - BUY THIS ONE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"my son is 8 wks and loves looking at this toy.

Now, at 4 months, it's his favorite toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows with your baby","review":"I received this from my registry and hung it over the baby's changing table from day one.He never paid it much attention, or so I thought, at first.Until he was 4mos we left it hanging there until one day I saw him looking at it very purposefully. I'd previously wiggled it from time to time for him, but his eyes would wander after a minute or two.The day he 'looked' at it, I took it down and his eyes got so wide like he couldn't believe it was possible for this thing to come nearer.He shoved the face in his mouth.Now it's part of his regular rotation of slobber objects. He loves the face for mawing on and likes the thin wings for gumming. He's also totally into grabbing the red bug and the rings.I'm sure any one of the Lamaze toys could be just as loved, but this is the one we happen to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite toy","review":"My daughter is three months old. She has more toys than she needs thanks to older siblings, hand-me-downs, and grandparents excited for a girl. This, however, is her absolute favorite. It could be her only toy and she'd still be happy. I like that it has the thin rings hanging low so she can grab on easily. It makes lots of crinkly noise, and captivates her for over an hour. I love lamaze as a brand, and highly recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first toy my daughter smiled at, but the mirror might as well be tinfoil","review":"My daughter has loved this toy since she was a month old. Once she developed the social smile, I would catch her smiling in response to the firefly's smiley face.Now she is almost five months old and she likes to grab and chew on various parts of the toy, but does not find the teether particularly interesting.I did give Freddy the firefly a bath in the washing machine in a mesh beg and cold water without detergent, as it makes no sense to give to your child a cloth toy that you know she will chew on without washing it first. The crinkly stuff still works, even three washes later.I am not fond of the mirror. The only thing it has in common with a mirror is the name, otherwise it's just a shiney surface, which, I guess, is ok, since it's a safety mirror on a toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son's Favorite Car Seat Toy","review":"My son loves Freddie.

My friend ordered this toy from Amazon and it was shipped to our home directly. Within two weeks of getting this, it became my 2 month old's favorite toy. She kept playing with it all the time. Still, I'm giving it just 2 stars because it is of very low quality. In just a month 1/3rd of the stitching around the squeaker has come off. Now it has become a choking hazard. The squeaker is ready to fall out. It is very disappointing and scary too. How can they compromise on quality in toys for babies?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy has it going on!","review":"I bought this toy for my 6-month-old after we lost her Sophie the Giraffe toy. I have to say, at half the cost of the Sophie toy, Freddy has 10 times as much for her to enjoy. It has a variety of textures for her to explore, a mirror, a teether in a pocket, cellophane that makes a great \\"crinkle\\" noise, a squeeker, black-and-white designs perfect for newborns, teething rings, and a clip to keep it from getting lost. Such a bargain. I love this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 7 month old girl does NOT like this toy.","review":"My 7 month old girl does NOT even touch this toy.

The Chinese have such a horrible track record in their manufacturing protocol; I would even go as far as to say they have a total disregard for the safety and integrity of their products.the import to the U.S.I wasn't expecting this from the Lamaze company, and am very disappointed to discover that these cute critters like Freddie the Firefly are possibly compromised. Lamaze should know that toys for babies must have impeccable safety safeguards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean fun for the little ones!","review":"What more is there to say except my daughter LOVES this toy? It was her favorite as an infant and it still hangs out with the stuffed toys and gets a bit of attention though not as much now that she's a toddler (still, I doubt she'll be very happy to let go of it when her little sibling comes around!) I have absolutely no safety or durability concerns. It's just FUN all around - from the beginning when she could just look at it hanging from her carseat handle or play gym arches, to a little later when she could grab at it and make it rattle, to even later when she could better manipulate the parts to really get the most out of them. So colorful and cute and friendly, too. Has held up to a lot of chewing and general kiddie abuse.It would be even nicer if it were machine washable. I wonder what would happen if I tried, though the instructions say \\"surface clean only.\\" I've done fine on other toys I cared less about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"My 3 month old daughter absolutely loves this toy.

I didn't even notice the embroidered ladybug under one of the wings until a couple months of Sofia using the toy. She loves, loves, loves this one... even though she didn't get really interested in it until about 3 months of age. She is now 5 1/2 months and still loves to play with this.Her favorite part about this toy is the crinkle noise it makes, so we have bought many, many other crinkle toys. Still, this is her favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Infant Toy","review":"When we first had my son, we had Freddie the Firely and the Lamaze Bug toy, and they were two of the favorite things to have around. When he was just a few weeks old, he used to look at the back of the firefly (black and white patterned) and eventually grew into playing with the crackling wings and teething on the rings. I was hesitant to purchase such an expensive toy for an infant, but it has been worth every penny. This will be my \\"must buy\\" for all baby showers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of baby's favorites","review":"As soon as I hung this on my baby's activity gym he was fixated on it for a very long time and loved to grab the rings at the bottom. This is by far one of his favorite \\"hanging toys\\" as there are lots of contrasting colors and black/white on the back. I also like that the firefly hangs just long enough so he can grab the rings, it has helped my little one learn to open his hands more and try to grasp things. I highly recommend this toy over a lot of other ones, baby loves his gym that much more now because of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Loves It","review":"This is one of the first toys my baby really got into feeling. Other similar items would be placed in his hands & he would let go. He would hold on to this one...and as he developed, there were more and more interesting pieces to hold his attention. We recieved this as a gift...and truthfully I thought he was a butterfly & I created a whole song about the butterfly fluttering by my baby...perhaps I'll think of a new Firefly song! All in all, it's a good attention grabber & makes the babies reach out, grasp & explore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Toy EVER!","review":"I purchased this toy for a \\"santa\\" gift for my 1 month old. I thought she would be to young for it but we didnt want our 4 year old asking questions about why Santa didnt leave the baby a gift. First off this toy is so cute! It is very bright and the fabrics are just great. I am also impressed that this toy is a decent size. It is actually pretty large which I prefer. It hooks easily to her play mat and to her car seat. It has great textures along with the colors and the crinkle noises, squeaks, rattles ect. Anyways, we took it out of the box and showed it to the baby and she sat there staring at it. She wouldturn her head to look at it even. I know they say babies cant see color until 4 months or so but she was facinated with this toy all the same. In fact we thought it was so great we also ordered the Lamaze Peacock and Mermaid to give her later! If you are looking for a great toy that will last your little one from infant on up this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's favorite toy","review":"This was the only toy my daughter was truly interested in playing with for her first 4 months.

I've given a half-dozen Freddy's and have had strong positive feedback every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy, but my 4 month old doesn't like it much","review":"This toy has crinkle sounds on the wings, a mirror, a squeaky button, a fuzzy ball for baby to touch, a teether, rings at the bottom and lastly the center 'body' rattles. Perhaps when my baby is bigger he will appreciate the diversity of features on this toy, but for now he just wants to put it in his mouth and he gets frustrated that it's too big. The sounds do seems to capture his interest a bit. Like the concept but I think it's overrated personally. It is a good toy, just maybe better for an older baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"All 3 of my babies have loved this.","review":"I don't know what it is about this thing, but all three of my children have been infatuated with it. I think we were given this toy 6 years ago when my first child was born. My third child is 5 months now, and like her two older siblings, she is nuts about this toy. It's been the favorite for each of them. It's easy for them to grip, even at only a couple of months old. She won't stop manipulating it and crinkling it -- if there is any negative at all, it's that we can't give it to her at church or anywhere where we need her to be quiet because she's constantly shaking it and crinkling the wings. Nice teether toys, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool toy!","review":"This thing is really cool. It has lots of colors, makes lots of noises and has lots of textures. Baby is teething now and really enjoys the cookie it comes with. Very good buy. Would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring read","review":"This book was really boring story! The author did not make her story interesting at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm & Inspiring!","review":"I could not put this book down from when I picked it up! It is an amazing story of Maria's journey to find her natural past. It is an inspiring account of a woman's determination and strength to dig into the unknown, combined with the unfaultering love and support of her family and faith. It not only delights with a happy ending but is proof of what can be achieved with courage and persistance. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"UK Diva costume exactly what I expected.","review":"The costume is exactly like the picture. My daughter loves it.

He had another mouthpiece saver that he had purchased from the band instructor at school. The one we paid for from the school was flimsy and cheap plastic and was about the same price as this one I purchased from Amazon.I am very impressed with the quality of this product and the durability of the design. Since it is being used by my son, I wanted something that would not break, would serve the purpose and would protect our investment in the saxophone. Well, this is a great product and I strongly reccomend it to anyone that is looking for quality and durable design at a reasonable price.Very good product and design! 5-stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RETURN","review":"The thermometer I received had a fatal flaw: the clip is made of aluminum, a soft metal.When you clip the thermometer to the pot, the aluminum bends open.

I used it for the first time to make toffee. It wouldn't stay clipped to the pot, and the tip broke clean off after I took it out; on top of that, the temperature reading was wrong, and the candy didn't even turn out right!

The top was cut away and a smaller silver \\"can\\" was placed inside, then the area between the smaller, silver can and the Dr. Pepper can was filled with a heavy, solid, grey material. The only slight problem I had with this is that whatever this grey material is...it stinks. Everything placed in this can comes out smelling like the stinky grey stuff. Fortunately this grey stuff is slightly absorbant so I put a couple drops of scented oil in there and that has cleared the problem up (except that my son complains that his money smells like roses now though).This looks exactly like a can of soda.

The book was written back in 2001 and I was disappointed with this book for a number of reasons. The book is not organized as a serious text and it is way too generalized to be of any use to a serious student. The book does not take the reader from the basic specifics and then integrate this information into the bigger picture. The author drifts around the world of ham radio touching briefly on a variety of areas. The glossary is inadequate and the do-it-yourself projects in the rear of the book aren't even detailed enough to take seriously. Its almost as if the author was afraid to get serious for fear of scaring people away from amateur radio.

If this is your first Negotiation book then it may be useful, however if you are a professional in the field or intend on gaining some new insights from this book you will be greatly disapointed. This problem is made worse by the fact that, the author constantly promises to introduce new tactics 'later' in the book - many of which he only spends a line or two on.In short, the author promises a great deal on the back cover and introduction, but fails to deliver on most of them.

Mr. Kershner has a easy to read and follow style that has helped me tremendously on my way to getting certified as a private pilot. Whenever I was having diffuculty learning a particular aspect of flying I referred first to this book and got the straight and skinny on the subject. Mr. Kershner obviously has a grasp on what a student pilot goes through to understand the technical jargon and concepts of flight principals, navigation, cross country flying, flight instuments, and landing an airplane.The illstrations are clear and concise. The photographs are very good.I highly recommend this book to any student pilot as a supplement to ground school, or anyone interested in what it takes to learn to fly, or anyone who flys in a light plane as a passenger and wants to learn more about what's going on in the cockpit and the pilot's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"This was a great tool for my flight instruction.

Also, the firmware for this product is not updated as often as the Wireless routers (latest is August of 2007), which makes me think this product is not used as much as the router and does not get the same level of support.

All in all I am going to keep the rest of the sockets in case the error was with the specific socket and not the set in general.

So great product! Beware curious kiddos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well designed and efficient","review":"The sweeper is a bit narrower than I expected, but I'm impressed by how much it picks up. It can get hair, small pieces of leaves, and even chunks of material on both carpet and bare floors. It's very easy to clean.

The Stanley (or Fuller) sweeper works great. With four black cats and a very hairy dog the living room rug needs touching up often. This sweeper is ideal for the job. I also like its construction. Other sweepers we have had had handle sections that were just pressed together. Any number of times I would have to take the handle off and bang it together to try and keep it from falling apart. With the Stanley sweeper each section of the handle is threaded so that once its together, it stays together. The price is high but at least I don't think that we will need to be buying another one for quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!","review":"It's a totally useless piece of junk that picks up nothing on carpet - nothing!

Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Small","review":"The head of this sweeper is smaller than any I have had in the past which meant I had to go over the floor almost twice as many times since it only picked up a few inches at a time. In addition to that, I had to really push down to get it to pick up anything on hard wood floors. It worked marginally on industrial carpet and not at all on a rug with a pile. Very limited use.

It was not exposed to harsh chemicals.I contacted Fuller Bursh and they told me that since it was only guarenteed one year, they would not repair or replace it.

The movie soars like \\"Rocky\\" in its underdog and come-from-behind sequences and then boogies like \\"Dirty Dancing\\" only with far superior storytelling and plot devices that keep it fresh after repeated viewings. The principals are uniformly fine, fresh faced and passionate dancers, and Luhrman paces his show with remarkable staidness and simplicity - certainly nothing like his later edit-a-second epics. \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is a model of restraint but dares to tell its story with guts.

There is almost no back story to the whole plot, it barely touches on the past of this dance foundation or whatever it's called.This could have been much better.

It's just a crazy counterpoint to the sweet love story. The two leads are very appealing, and everyone else is plum looney. A bit dark, and low key, but very nice.If you are a huge Moulin Rouge fan, check this out to see what Baz carried over to that film."},{"rating":"1","title":"this version is terrible!","review":"This dvd version must have been a direct transfer from a video, or a bootleg by someone sitting in the theatre because the quality is absolutely horrible! The distributor should just throw these babies away because they are not worth even a penny. If I had to choose, I would just go out and buy the video version. This dvd records all the pops, clicks and faded images, and is it my imagination, or is the film constantly shaking? If you like Strictly Ballroom (and it is a wonderful film), buy the other dvd version - or stick to the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics are want-a-be actors","review":"I was a theatre owner in south Florida when this film was released. The critics tore this film apart, maybe because it wasn't an American film. I had a 1000 seat house and i paid 45% of the gross to the studio and we made a bundle of money on this film. Three shows a day for total run of 6 weeks. If critics read this DO THE MATH!The film is wonderful and is way beyond anything that Hollywood could possibly dream of. The actors are ALL great and know that acting is far more important than special effects can ever be in a movie.I bought the VHS version some years ago and have now ordered the DVD and i can't wait to see it again. It's a super good, feel good movie with great music, the audio is well mixed, the colors and costumes are sharp and brillant. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry in motion!","review":"This script is a poem, set to music. The dialog is written with a distinct rhythm and tempo to match the awesome music! The direction is absolutely brilliant with images reflecting the mood of the dialog. For example, when Scott is meeting with Barry Fife in the kitchen, the chef comes along and grabs a large piece of raw meat from in front of Scott - showing that the Dance Federation is treating Scott like a piece of meat, rather than as a person. This movie is filled with imagery such as this, making it an absolute incredible work of art! I've seen this movie well over 100 times, and I still get chills whenever I hear those wonderful opening notes of The Beautiful Blue Danube. This is an awesome movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Dance Movie","review":"Quintessential dance movie! Unique storyline about a ballroom dancing club in Australia that hosts a dancing contest. The old hands want to limit the steps used but the young dancers want to experiment. Great tension and just unbelievable dance moves. Thorouhly entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not oscar material but ...","review":"What a kooky, lovable, sometimes just much too silly movie. I absolutely love it. It is one of my favorite movies of all times. In fact, after seeing it, I immediately began learning Salsa. I'll pass on the Pasa Doble, thanks. Though \\"Scott\\" is supposed to be the focus of the film, \\"Fran\\" steals the show after she washes her face and puts on something nice. In fact, she and Scott's father (both rather pathetic characters) steal the show. Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! I think I'll put the DVD in right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"costume drama\\" and so much more","review":"As a theatreical costume designer, I found the whole movie fascinating, visually rich, fun. It pokes fun at design obsessions I also hold dear and takes them to an etreme levelin costumes, setting, characters. The sarcasm and wit of the story are charming, charming, charming. The characters of Scott and Fran are people we 'know' in our own lives. . .heck, maybe they are US. And who hasn't questioned their parents' wisdom at some time in their lives? Embarking on the 'road less travelled' is a good risk, this movie says. And, of course, \\" a life lived in fear is only half lived\\" encourages us all to take those good risks. Did you know that this movie's beginning were in a design class at the Royal Academy of the Arts in Austalia? Bravo to that risk-taking designer and to those who took that project to this extreme, lovely level, too. SEE THIS FILM, you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favourite Aussie Movie","review":"This movie is my favourite Aussie movie, bar none!

A+! yay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectatular Early Baz Luhrman","review":"This is actually my favourite of Baz Luhrman's films, closely followed by Moulin Rouge and miles ahead of Romeo and Juliet. The story is simple and predictable, but that only adds to its charm, rather than detracting from it. The joy of this film comes from all the little moments, like Scott and Fran's father dancing beside the railway track, or flashback's to Scott's parents careers. The sets and costumes are great, and in many ways this film is a kind of prequel, or companion piece to Moulin Rouge. The performers are for the most part dancers before they are actors, but they are all perfectly competant. The dance numbers really make the movie with wonderful music, slow motion, and slightly less frenetic editing than Luhrman's other movies. The great, funny, romantic, sweet movie, to enjoy time and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, DVD is not too bad","review":"I'd seen the seen the movie several times before getting the DVD. Watching it on DVD does enhance the experience. The background music blends in a lot better. Little things like the loud tapping of feet and a whooshing sound effect when Scott is doing his \\"crowd pleasings steps\\" are nice extras that Dolby 5.1 brings to the experience. Luhrman's commentary is nice although he tends to go off on tangents which can be frustrating when you really want him to concentrate on the movie and give his insight on certain scenes.The documentary is nice side dish and overall a good effort for an independent film and a good effort by Mirimax giving this movie proper justice releasing it on DVD, finally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strictly fantastic!","review":"What can I say but great things come from down under.

I purchased these and paid $23 rush ship for them. They looked great from description and pictures. However, in reality they are constructed of several panels of very thick fluffy stuffed material each sewn together with a very tough stitching. I have soft, ulcer prone tissue on my heel back. There are seams running down the center of the foot and up the middle of the heel through the achilles. So, despite all the padding the heavy stitching presses sharply into my delicate skin. Cannot use these and will be returning. Too bad because if they'd use wider cloth panels and had thought intelligently about where to place stitching would be a very useful product. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning becomes interesting","review":"this is book i really like, it give you input in language teaching/ learning method and as a teacher i found it very amazing you learn a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This book was a requirement for my language acquisition course for an upper level class and it was horrible. I had previously taken a class in linguistics at another university and if I hadn't kept that textbook to use as a reference I would have been at a lost. It does not go into much detail and doesn't have very good examples or scenarios of real life cases. If you are getting this book for your own interest, DONT.

Having been a loyal Yamaha component buyer for 2 decades, this item is my last. It was a warranty replacement for my previous Yamaha DVD player, which went on the fritz soon after purchase. At first, the service shop in Anaheim sent me a lower grade replacement, without some of the features of my original player. After sending it back (at my expense), I was then sent a DVD-C750. Playback is actually OK, with good picture quality. Where this doorstop of a DVD player has problems is with accepting commands from the remote. It will freeze, ignore commands, and even refuse manual attempts to power off. I need to literally unplug the thing to unfreeze it and attempt to make it work again.This is not rocket science technology, Yamaha. I've had it.

It suffers from long chapter outlines, poor explanations, and many errors both in the explanations and answers to problems. Nevertheless, this book does provide a lot of good practice problems with answers.

That's not to say that I don't enjoy or appreciate Dennis Cooper's work; in fact, I'm an avid fan - having now read all but one of his novels. Still, Cooper tends to be predictable in subject matter, theme, and plot. This time, however, Cooper has done something completely new. The plot is innovative, creative, and haunting. The story itself is still Cooper-esque, disturbing and a bit sick, and it is still an examination of death. Except, this time, rather than death as a scientific experiment - in body function, sensory reaction, sexuality, etc., Cooper is explaining death through grief and love - the loss of a child and how his already troubled father tries to cope. Truly brilliant - I read it in one sitting, in a matter of 90 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ...!!","review":"I bought this cd hoping to listen again the fabulous album issued by Magnet Records many years ago.

The projects are much harder than they need to be. I realized that in the \\"compare workbooks\\" project.If you are an advanced Excel VBA programmer this book might work for you.

Mankiw's book requires only algebra; this one expects you to be familiar with rudimentary calculus, but keeps the math out of the way when it isn't necessary.

The charging unit and hear rate monitor go in a zippered pocket or checked bag as they all will not fit with the sunglasses in there. Without the glasses, they all fit though just a bit cramped.All the previous reviews regarding the case are very accurate. It's sturdy, ventilated, holds the device securely and is exactly what I wanted it for.

It was a great trip down memory lane for me: Jeffrey Jones did the fantastic covers for many of the swords-and-sorcery paperbacks I read while growing up. In addition to the artwork for stellar talents like Robert E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, Jack Vance, and Karl Edward Wagner, Jones' beautiful paintings also brought class to less distinguished (but still fun)books by authors like Lin Carter and Gardner F. Fox. The wonderful artwork for many, many of these books is included, as well as a ton of great illustrations based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan adventures. The cover illustration is one of the best (and most understated) pieces of vampire artwork I've ever seen. The paintings are enlivened by Jones' personal reflections on his career, and the book concludes with striking samples of Jones' non-commercial art.

THE ART OF JEFFREY JONES is a beautiful showcase that effectively traces Jones' transition from a Frazetta-wannabe in the 1960s to the truly gifted painter of the 1990s be became.And I must disagree with Manfred's complaints and comparisons to previous Jones books: not only are Jones' earlier books long out of print, but THE ART OF JEFFREY JONES includes a great deal of work not included in any other collection (along with unpublished art credited as being painted in the '90s). While the text most certainly could have been expanded, I believe the editors have revealed more about Jones as an artist and person than any have previously and I came away with a better appreciation of this eccentric creator.

What is even more astonishing is that after this guy violates her, he has the audacity to keep trying to make conatct with her. I am amazed at Wilson's strength and fortitude.

But no more.I only used this handycam 3 times.When I went to use it the 4th time the LCD malfunctioned and recorded jibberish. Of course it was just after the year warrantee expired.I contacted Sony and was told it was outside of the warrantee period so it was my problem.No more Sony products for our family.We were going to buy a Sony vaio laptop for our college freshman but bought a Dell instead after this experience.My husband wanted a Sony Bravia HDTV, but we bought an LG instead.If you buy this, make sure you buy an extended warrantee as Sony will not stand behind their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Recording Disabled","review":"Product was ok for about a year.

Then I learned that Sony is a slave to Windows and isn't compatible with Macs. I was hugely disappointed and plan on returning it to get a Mac-compatible Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad experience","review":"There are two major problems with this camcorder. It's incompatible with mac and the quality of still-image is extremely low.1. If you are mac user, as I am: don't bother buying. Sony is a slave to Microsoft, so the output files (vob file format) are basically useless. Not only you can't import them to iMovie, but also you can't PLAY your footage on your Mac. Unless you download semi-legal software, rip the file (30min process), and are ready to sacrifice audio, the camcorder will be useless. This is a huge disappointment.2. Still-image function is a joke. I first jumped on this option (we spent 2 months traveling in Europe this summer), because the perspective of carrying camcorder and camera at the same time was unpleasant. I downloaded the pics onto the computer only to learn, that I captured our beautiful memories with cell phone like quality pictures.This equipment was nothing but a sad experience. I will never buy anything by Sony again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony DCR-DVD108 uses mini DVD's","review":"This camera uses a mini DVD disc that is not compatible with most DVD players and computers.So, if you want to be able to shoot something and then with-in a few minute be able to view the images via a DVD player do not pick this unit.My solution was to sent it back for a refund, a very quick and easy solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handycam Camcorder","review":"I purchase a Sony Handycam Camcorder as a christmas gift.

It is easy to use and creates wonderful scenes full of color and detail. I have had this camcorder about a year or so now and am still very happy with it. Of course, when I bought the camcorder it was much cheaper and offered by Amazon (free shipping). All I can say is it is a wonderful product for those starting out. The 40X zoom is the best part of the camcorder. The zoom is so powerful I was able to film a family of foxes from far away. The footage looked as if they were right there. Wonderful cam!!! I am one happy handcam mom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurs beware!","review":"It's a splendid camcorder, but it's quite a trick to copy your videos over to a computer and then edit them. The camcorder records in a special format, then you need to find and download a \\"codec\\" for your computer to read the files, and then I've still had all kinds of compatibility problems. The software that comes with the camcorder really isn't much help. Be prepared for a major project in figuring out how to make it all work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Amazon.com Customer Service","review":"I agree with all the reviews that am extremely happy with the camcorder.

I've ordered hundreds of products from Amazon.com and without exception, service has been stellar! I've had several dealings with Customer Service and they have always been responsive and courteous! I have NEVER has a bad experience! Amazon.com has earned my confidence and respect.For the record: I am not associated with Amazon.com in anyway other than a customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good camcorder","review":"I used the camcorder to record my entire Hawaii trip with my family. This is very handy, easy to use. I used -RW 's from Sony. Also I used dual layer RW's from JVC. They work great. Dual layer is better, because you can record upto 1 hour in standard mode. This is my second sony camcorder after 11 years and I love it. Finalizing the DVD is very easy, except that you get a warning not to vibrate the camcorder. I could connect the camcorder to both TV as well as my notebook. Haven't done any editing on the recorded movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buen producto - Good product","review":"Otro producto sony que complace al comprador funciona muy bien solo deberian de optimizar el sistema para abrir la tapa del dvd es un poco complicado y desesperante, presionas el boton y no sabes cuando se abrira"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it unless you don't care about the eiditing stuff","review":"I used several DV camcorders before and very interesed in editing the videos than just simply shooting. This SONY DCR really pissed me off since it's not compatiable with my Mac system, which means I can't eidit the video using my Mac. In addition, many features, such as touch screen and Carl Zeiss Lens, exaggerated, but have nothing to do for the good qulity of the video. Zooming is rediculously awkward to use and it's almost impossible to make stable shootings while using the zoom function.Recommend for those who just do the shoot and show. For those who really want to make impressed shooting and editing things, you are almost insane (like me; I got it when I was out of mind) to consider this cheap but stuipid thing SONY ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camcorder...","review":"This is a good camcorder for its price. The still camera is a bit grainy. I'll rate this as average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"It's so easy that even a caveman can use it. Really, it's so simple. You can pretty much take it out of the box, charge the battery for two hours, load a mini-dvd in, then start recording. If you use a dvd-rw you can take the mini-dvd out anytime you like and insert it into a dvd player then put back into your camcorder and start recording again. I really recommend using the dvd-rw's because there is no finalizing involved and you can use the dvd's over and over again.The zoom is more then you will ever need. The night vision is really cool, but a little creepy.I haven't used the film editing yet but would like too soon.Overall, a really nice and easy to use device. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this camera","review":"Although this product did have good zoom and sound quality, the picture quality was horrible. The colors were very dull and dark. It was not cooperative when opening the disk compartment and it was very small to hold. You need to use a tripod or get sick while watching your video. You also have to use the touch screen to do most tasks and that sucks down the small amount of battery life they provide you with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camcorder","review":"This camcorder takes really good pictures, but I find it difficult to understand the operation.

Just recorded a full day of footage of my children in various places with them saying things to our mothers. Were going to make a Mother's Day video. Had 2 discs full of video.Had been recording and playing back on the first disc for a whild. Near the end of the first disc, got a yellow icon with a line through it. I thought this meant we were almost out of space, so I swappped to a new disc and recorded more.Now ALL the footage is gone from the first disc. It says movie recording disabled, the icon is back, etc. It was all their before but is gone now. It's 9pm and my husband wants to edit the video but we lost the majority of the footage.Did a google search and found many other complaints of the same things happening.Went to Sony's support site and the instructions were to try a new disc. Can you believe that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I bought the Sony 108 thinking it's a Sony should be good. We are coming from an aging HI8 and thought it was time to replace. I did not like going from 2 hours recording to 30 minutes but with a 1 hour option that would be ok.Well we used it and my wife said the colors were muted. Normal indoor light light conditions cause the colors to be muted. Also the picture quality is awful compared to my Hi8. When there is motion there are line and the images are grainy.The camera images are a joke at 680 Pixels. Most Cameras are 2 Mega Pixels now.Also researched that the DVD recordings only last about 5 Years and you need to back those up to another media.I guess I will be going to MiniDV since I cant get a HI8 anymore.I will be returning this and paying a 15% restocking fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sad:(","review":"Same disappointing problem as a lot of people. \\"movie recording disabled\\" This is the forth time it has happened.

And we didn't use it that much. Screen just went static, then blank. Now, it just won't go on. Sony's Help desk couldn't figure it out over phone, so we've got to send it back for a $160+ repair. I've tossed it and am looking for a new one. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"No service, warranty is a Sham!","review":"The unit workered fine until the LCD screen failed. The camcorder was still under warranty for parts and labor. (90 days) I only got the run-around from Sony. They had me send it to the repair center at my cost to reair it. After numerous phone calls, they refused to fix it under warranty. They thought it was damaged by being dropped. All I did was turn it on and it failed without physical damage. That was their out and wanted to charge me $211 for labor. I will never buy from Sony again because of their lack of service and warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"Takes nice pictures but it is a pain to get from the camera into a computer where you can actually edit the footage. I have had nothing but trouble when it comes to this step, usually because the computer will not recognize the disc, and will not pull up the file when it is connected to the camera direcly. Overall I like Sony equipment but I don't think this is a great product, and I would not recommend it.Why would you sell a camera that won't load it's information into a computer ? I am running Vista on my newest computer (like we have a choice?)and still have an XP computer so I am going to try that to see if it works any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST PRECIOUS FOOTAGE!!!","review":"Lost great footage of a family reunion to an error that read \\"recording disabled\\".

I received the camera at my vacation destination (poor prior planning on my part). Other such equipment always arrives with all the necessary equipment to begin use immediately. This camera did not. I had to find a store with compatible recording disks, which was not all that easy. I could only find a disk for the movie application but not the still/digital camera. Also the formatting for the downloading is quite involved and not really intuitive. Downloading the applet also called for me to remove my CD burner applet - not a happy camper on that since I have not found a way to burn CD's again without reloading my burner applet, which may impact the movie capability.Good camera - poor planning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CAMCORDER!!!","review":"I have had this camcorder for a couple of weeks and have done several videos. It picks up sound from a very great distance and the video quality is incredible! Very easy to use. The zoom is awesome. The touch screen makes it very easy to navagate through the options. I did my research well. This is THE BEST camcorder for the money! You won't be sorry. The one downfall is the editing software. All it lets you do is trim it (cut out bad stuff). So you should buy good editing software."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST perfect!","review":"We purchased 3 of these camcorders for our adult children for Christmas. This is a great little camcorder but the package is stripped down. I expected to purchase an extra battery, but the batteries have to charge on the camera while TURNED OFF AND PLUGGED IN. Therefore an \\"optional\\" battery charger has to be purchased which is really pricey ($40. for the Sony charger which only worked in the house, not the car) I finally found a charger that works in the house and in the car for $18. By the time I purchased extra battery, charger, pkg of DVDs, and the Sony Duo Stick for the camera memory, I just about doubled the price of this camera. So be sure to count the cost of ALL the needful \\"options\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"MoneysWorth","review":"The camcorder does a decent job of recording, the 30 minute disk limits what can be done with the camcorder. It's fine for family gatherings, etc. The software that comes with the camera was a real disapointment, I have not been able to combine disks to put on a regular dvd. I guess it is good for the money you pay for it. The 40X zoom is a plus, it allows a good picture from farther away. Betty Haith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Sony fan but this is a winner","review":"I research the daylights out of everything. So I wind up usually buying a menage of names since I don't believe any manufacturer is good at everything. Since my college days in the mid-80s, I've hated Sony products. I've always believed they waded into far too many product lines and their quality suffered. So, up until this purchase I've owned nothing Sony for 20 years. Based on the reviews, though, I just purchased this camcorder and broke it in during a trip to Berlin. You cannot beat the price for the quality. Superb zoom (optical really counts as digital blurs the picture and is artificial), easy menu, great night shot capability. All in all, a wonderful purchase. Do not hesitate to buy this Sony. Tip: get a pack of DVD+RWs to play with since you can re-record and get a pack of dual layer Rs once you're comfortable because they have much more recording space but you CANNOT re-record on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better quality gets the job done","review":"when it comes to buying camcorders, i personally like the one with the build in memory. but after using this camcorder i was forced to change my mind.unlike other sony camcorders, first of all, it offers upto 40x zoom which is a lot. its a good use of your money. you can have it for under $400 and still works better than a lot of choices out there. easy to use, touch screen, takes still photos, has a good speaker so it's easier to record video and voice, fits into your palm so to speak, and if you use rewritable mini dvds, you wouldn't have to worry about go out of memory.so when it comes to sony camcorders, i would say the better quality of this one would get the job done properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable camera - DON'T BUY!","review":"This is an easy camera to use, but it's not feature loaded. It's convenient to store footage directly to mini DVD disks. BUT - there seems to be a systemic problem with this camera and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING IT. I had precious stuff recorded on one disk, and then the camera informed me 'Movie Recording Disabled.' No more video could be recorded to the disk, the footage won't play, and it could not be extracted into a couple of video editing software packages that I have tried. OK, maybe the disk was bad. Not so, as exactly the same thing happened with the next disk (Sony brand DVD-R). I recorded some stuff, and now it is lost!

These were things I use when traveling, like an 8GB flash drive and a portable hard drive.It does have a small jack on the side that is probably for a power supply, but no supply is included or mentioned in the documentation.I will be returning this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"so sad","review":"Like f. welsh i have collected slim's songs since the 50's.

A must read for anyone who is interested in Pacific cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice magnifier","review":"I got this to be able to read the entries in my compact OED book - it does a great job and is easy to use.

This satisfied my need to see Vampirella in a film but that was about it. Talisa Soto as Vampirella was the only good acting in this whole movie. She really did a good job (but then she always does). The rest ranged from unbelievable. I really find it hard to believe that after spending several thousand years on earth the head vampires would be this stupid. Unless you have a penchant for Ms. Soto or the Original character this one isn't going to tak eyou anywhere, I wouyldn't even recommend it to general vampire movie fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny","review":"Vampirella is far funnier than they wanted it to be and that makes it very entertaining.This kooky campy comic-strip concoction might be up your alley if you love movies like Plan 9...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"I am a fan of vampires. I am a fan of vampirella. I like to try to convince myself that essentially awful movies about the things I like are still good movies. However, such action was utterly IMPOSSIBLE with this film. I cannot believe that some people have given this movie over one star. That's the truth. This is the most horrendously sickening movie ever to tarnish a video tape. The direction could not be worse. Ditto for the acting. I was tempted to hit myself for watching this movie. The plot SUCKS, and only an unseasones moviegoer (or a blind, deaf person) would say otherwise. ALL the actors sucked, even Miss Soto. Don't even get me started on Vlad. Avoid this at ALL costs. They should pay you for watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing...try Vampirina instead","review":"What a disgrace to the Vampirella series.

I had the film on for maybe fifteen minutes and could not watch anymore. Huge fan of the comic books, from Warren to Dark Horse to Harris pub, and happy to call many involved in creatives my friends I could not bear the campy feel; and I think that's bad considering I watch many B movies and Toho Studios offerings. For the true fan at heart I guess and will try again to see if my opinion changes."},{"rating":"1","title":".....well,it is a B movie after all.....","review":"It's everything one would expect from a B movie : bad special effects and horrible acting.

I was originaly impressed by the cover, I am a big horror/vampire movie fan. After I found out what the movie was by reading the reviews on amazon I watched the movie in fast forward looking for cool parts in the movie. Other than two topless scenes I fast forwarded through the whole movie. It was of very poor quality. Don't get me wrong I love B movies but this one was just bad. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the comic instead.","review":"I rented this movie and it was a total mistake.

Nice try, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absoloute worst movie I have ever seen and ever will see","review":"This is without a doubt the dumbest movie to ever be allowed to hit store shelves. What a waste of anybody's time.Drakulon? You have got to be kidding me. And don't get me started on the camera work.The scene where the truck drives off the road, is the most horrible cinematics I have ever seen.My friends and I spent half an hour rewinding that and laughing at how cheaply that was done. And at the end where the villain is struck by lightning, you can see the protective gear he was wearing. If you put the scene where they transform into a bat in slow motion you can see that the bat is mearly a squiggly line. This movie simply shows that I could pull any idea out of my rearend and turn it into a movie no matter what the idea was. I have never seen such a bad movie in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did they invest my money?","review":"I purchased this subscription in December and it now shows I won't start receiving it until April.

The magazine has specialty information on the art of sewing without being too redundant or traditional. The articles are solid and never fluffy, unlike a lot of magazines targeted at a primarily female audience. I remember several of my favorite articles: couture sewing vs. regular sewing, how to deal with common fitting issues, and how to preserve old garments. Although I am an inexperienced sewer I feel that the information in the magazine is also useful for more intermediate or even advanced sewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed format/contents","review":"I have always enjoyed every issue of Threads in the past. The new format / contents does not appeal to me. Threads is now a beginner sewing magazine like many others on the market. Thread's was once a great magazine, the only one on the market for the intermediate and advanced sewers. The projects were wonderful and I and other's I know kept every single issue. Not now, there isn't really much in Thread's for the wearable art/advanced sewer. I will really miss the couture finishing techniqes and other articles with new ideas. These articles were much more detailed than any book. Because of this detail a sewer with some experience could use these articles to become an advanced sewer more quickly than buying many books. I only gave the 2 star's because it is a nice beginner magazine. If you are new to sewing this is a good magazine, but the more advanced sewer's should pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't What It Used to Be","review":"I used to look forward to each issue of Threads. There were always features that took sewing beyond the basics. They showed new creative ways to use fabrics and stitching. And there were articles on refined finishing techniques and pattern fitting.Well, Threads just is not what it used to be. I no longer subscribe.

I am currently seventeen years old, and even though it was more than ten years ago, I was still able to vividly recall to my sister (who is thirteen) all of the wonderful images of the fox, donkey, and alligator that I had enjoyed so long ago. She also began remembering different parts of the book since I had shared it with her when we were younger, and we excitedly spoke about the clever dentist and his antics.This is one book that has stuck out in my mind as a childhood favorite (even though I still am somewhat of a kid) and I'm sure your child will come to love and cherish this book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read for Children and Adults Alike","review":"We stumbled onto our copy of Doctor DeSoto in the bargain bin of our local thrift store. It's about the best dime I've ever spent.My daughter (3.5 years old) loves this book. For weeks it's been her favorite, she just can't get enough. She now insists that we call her Dr. De Soto, which may suggest some deeper pathology, but nonetheless is quite a hearty vote for the appeal of this book to young children.The great thing is that, like many of Steig's books, it's a pleasure to read too. His animals are so fun, so lively, and capture the essence of their human counterparts so effectively.Steig has an indescribably fantastic way with words. The fox doesn't just wonder if he should eat the De Sotos, he wonders if it would \\"be shabby of him.\\"After reading this book, we researched Steig and ordered a whole slew of his books. After all, if you enjoy what you're reading to your kids, you will read to them all the more. This book is one you can't go wrong with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book for toddlers soon to visit the dentist","review":"We read this to my daughter before her first visit to the dentist. I thought it did a good job of preparing her for what to expect at the dentist. At the same time, it's a funny book- for everyone! Also, if you think about it, it's the dentist who's scared- not the patient, so it helps to allay a child's fears about the dentist. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone who is unsure about dentists...","review":"This book describes pulling a tooth pretty graphically (complete with blood dripping off the tooth) and then the dentist tricks his fox patient by telling him what is really glue is a treatment to prevent toothaches.I'm sure older kids who are already familiar with their dentist would like this book, but it is NOT for small children or the faint of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining story","review":"Dr. Desoto is a humorous well illustrated story of a mouse dentist and how he solved a problem in an unexpected way.

Parents will appreciate Dr, Desoto's desire to maintain his professional integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty at just the right time","review":"Dr. De Soto is a mouse dentist who is very good at his work. With the help of his assistant, who also happens to be his wife, he sees patients of all shapes and sizes. He draws the line when it comes to dangerous creatures though, even has it on his sign. When a fox in excruciating pain begs for help, the de Sotos will surely give it, but they will also come up with a clever way to prevent the fox from using his new tooth to make them his first pain-free meal. The mice outfox the fox in a way children can appreciate and understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. DeSoto was a pretty good book.","review":"I liked this book because the pictures were well drawn.

NOTHING MORE. The idea here is that there are 476 two beat phrases that can be individually put together in any grouping. It is a mathematical, systematical chop builder. No musical information or application is motioned. This can be great for the beginner to learn basic drumbeats (hence, the five star reviews below) or a large disappointment for someone looking for drum information and guidance.

The fuel adjustment lever is a silver-painted plastic part: it's lower portion is a toothed ring which easily falls off the (true) metal gas flow gear inside the torch housing. There's no retainer nut to hold the ring on the gear, only friction, and far too much mechanical play. Once the ring comes off the gear the torch is unusable. After 2 uses the housing had to be taken apart to re-mate the parts and adjust the locking button, a process that has been required several times in the past 18 months. The igniter also stopped working after the first repair.I went out to use it today and found it broken again, and that was the last straw. I don't have 30 minutes to fix the tool each time I want to use it, so into the garbage it goes. You'll need all 4 of these to last a year.

I love the fact that I can slip them on tiny feet so easily. My baby boy always curls his toes when I try and put other shoes on him such as lace-ups or velcro closures. It's almost impossible to get shoes on him. But Robeez are a breeze. I find that they work best until they start walking, especially outside, then they can be worn as an indoor slipper. My kids always really scuffed the toes up when worn outside after they began walking. Love Robeez, and these ones, with the train design are great.

The stories are written with great clarity so that you can experience the sights and smells of the Alaska and Canadian area in which they take place as though you are actually there around a campfire or in long-house, at their FIRST telling! Each story has an illustration of a character from the story that brings the story to life, some stories have several illustrations. The stories contain an introduction to help set the background for the story. Condor, a Native American, has lived for many years in the area he writes so well about. I highly recommend this book as a very enjoyable read and anxiously await to hear more from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book for All Ages and All People","review":"I am a Native American and I was just thrilled to read Condor's book.

His command in being able to translate the different cultural's analogies into something that all people can read and understand is exceptional. The phrase \\" it looses something in the translation\\" dose not apply to these stories. All ages and all people will find this book entertaining, enlightening, and exceptional!I have recommended this book to everyone that has asked me how I can better understand the Native American people.I have recommmended this book to my local library and Boy Scout and Girl Scout organizations.

He probably wants to blast someone who won't bite back and he knows Ms. Somers isn't likely to knock on his door. If you were to read a book on personal reflection and growth, wouldn't you want an author who has been through struggle and emerged victorious? Well, Ms. Somers grew up in a home with alcoholic parents, was a teenage mother and had been arrested for shoplifting. Now, she is one of the most enduring performers in show biz as well as one of the most beautiful and fit actresses and has one of the longest running marriages in Hollywood. I think she knows a thing or two about how to survive and thrive in an environment that isn't always so kind to women.

In total, 55 graves were discovered, from which the remains of 367 individuals were removed. The book deals with each grave individually, although in most cases the description consists of little than a short paragraph. Included are a number of figures and plates.

When he came up with the concept of duals, he had a winner all the way! At first, it was a little difficult for me to envision two separate people living in one body but once it became clear to me, I wished I'd thought of it. This is more than multiple personalities; it is two distinct people, each with their own personalities, living inside one body. And the explanation for that duality is absolutely believable. The reader learns to like each of the duals and when they are in danger, the suspense is high.I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a little fantasy in their diet. Even if you don't, give it a try; I'm sure you will agree that this book is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly an Entertaining Read","review":"This was certainly an entertaining read. The concept of duals is quite interesting and well done here. However, it seemed quite a lot of emotion evolved in the relationships in such a short time that it was somewhat unrealistic. It was even commented on in the book, but no real substance supported why it happened or why the reader should buy in that it was true love. That was my one complaint though and I could certainly look past it when considering how well the story was told. I certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work","review":"Dont waste your time or money on this.

He does it by allowing his chords to overlap and grow, making what is almost like ambient music at times, especially in some passages of Sands' title track. This new CD is yet another striking collection of guitar instrumentals, similar to the previous two Lanterna discs but with a couple of differences. One is the greater use of the acoustic guitar, giving the disc a pastoral feel at times (on \\"Fields,\\" for instance). Sands also makes good use of Steven Day as a rhythm section on cuts such \\"West Side Highway,\\" which is the closest Mr. Frayne has come to doing a straight-ahead rock 'n' roll instrumental. Whatever, the ten tracks on this CD are at various times mesmerizing, ethereal, and even moving. As long as this guy keeps making music, I'll keep buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gently plodding","review":"2 1/2The pastoral sounds emanating from Frayne's hypnotic strumming is, at best a glowing pulse of subtle melodic flux, and at worst a deadened, repetitious bore. Most of this album unfortunately carries both extremes. Lanterna certainly appreciate the intricacies needed to pull this sort of introspective songwriting off, though certainly coasts by with a luke-warm predictability as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby food music....","review":"Sorry folks, but I don't get it.

It is not only a time-capsule of 1970's TV film-making, but it is an excellent adaption of Thomas Tyron's book. If you remember watching this movie on TV around the fall as a child, you will be terribly disappointed by the hatchet job done to this movie on the video store version. Not only have great scenes been cut out, but so much has been chopped the story is intelligible. Here's what the video is like:Wow! Look at those people in old fashioned clothes farming!Wow! Let's buy an old house here!Hey! I don't think I like it here very much. Let's move!No! This is where I am staying!Wait! Stop! No! Please no!The end.Roll credits.Hideous.

I couldn't wait to get off work to watch it. What a disappointment. It didn't make any sense and completely cut out some of the important characters.

However, should the powers that be EVER decide to release this in all it's 4 hour glory, I would definately buy it again. This could really happen in real life. That is what makes it so Creepy.

This speaker set is IDEAL for situations where you need a solid and economical close-range audio solution for your iPod or PC. The satelites have decent range and the sub performs nicely. Currently, I have the audio from my DVD player in my living room run through these. No, it's not 5.1, no, it won't rattle the windows, but it provides a nice bump in audio quality from the built-in stereo speakers in my TV and even without a remote, I honestly have no gripes, not even about the power switch being on the back (I actually like the robust feel of the small rocker switch, it feels like the power switch on a good guitar or bass amp) . I generally just leave it on and the volume at consistent level. For under $30, can you really complain?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"For $11.11+10.30S, you can't beat the value. My only complaint would be the wiring on these types of units. They tend to solder the connections into each piece instead of using connectors (probably saves them a few cents) which makes it harder to route them where you might want them. For instance, if you wanted to drop the wiring thru a desk hole and back up another, you couldn't do it because you can't disconnect the speakers from each other. I'm quite happy with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to turn on and off","review":"What I hate about these speakers is that you can't turn them on and off from your desk. The switch is awkwardly placed behind the subwoofer which they suggest putting under your desk. Everyday I have to crawl under my desk, then feel behind the subwoofer for a switch I can't even see. Other Altec Lansing speakers have an on off switch on the actual speakers so I don't know why they did this. I wish I had bought different speakers it such a pain turning them on and off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect, low-cost solution for low volume","review":"My new motherboard on-board audio did not have enough oomph to drive my desktop speakers to a useable volume.

Instead, garage rock has come full circle and pulled up to Jack's stop once again.Passionate but straightforward rocking covers of \\"Search And Destroy\\" and \\"Dirty Water\\" feature fellow Syracusans turned Beantowners Ducky Carlisle, Paul Armstrong and Mark Doyle. More impressive are the other two tracks, collaborations with producer and multi-instrumentalist John Fannon. \\"Get Off That Corner\\" is Lipton's take on urban gospel, while \\"Trouble\\" boasts a great hook, melody and harp-driven chorus...great, gritty pop soul by way of latter-day Ian Hunter.

However, Fallows' tenure at U.S. News has thus far failed to deliver any of the reforms he touts in his book. A recent study I did of U.S. News articles for 1997 shows that most articles regarding American politics still follow the \\"Game\\" schema. That is, the focus is on who's winning and who's losing rather than what the issues are. To be sure, Fallows has brought a bit more coverage of the issues themselves, and more significant change may take time. Still, Fallows is quick to criticize journalists turned television pundits in his book. Yet Gloria Borger, a U.S. News columnist, points out at the end of each and every column she writes that she is also a CBS political analyst (read: pundit). Fallows has some good ideas, but as he is learning first hand, when trying to put theory into practice, things sometimes get lost in the translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make what's important interesting","review":"James Fallows' \\"Breaking the News\\" is especially timely considering the challenges currently facing the news media.

The author does a very good job of filling in the details.To be fair, the viewing public is part of all this. People pay attention to fluff and sensational nonsense. There are still people with an appetite for substance. But I also don't want to be stuck in front of C-Span taking notes and having my congressional representative on speed-dial.Where do you go?

I have (and still enjoy) the VHS copies of \\"Giants among Men\\" from the 1986 season and \\"True Blue\\" from the 1990 season. While they give a game-by-game replay of those seasons, the America's Game set goes into the personalities, the challenges, and the triumps of some of the key players on those teams. The AG series is a celebration of the humanity of the players who are encased in so many layers of padding, we do not experience the personal highs and lows they go through - not only within the game, but with each other on and off the field. Steve Sabol has rectified this with an excellent new approach to the game, its players and coaches.

If you use the FM modulator you have to be pretty close to the stereo and that picks up some feedback. Also, the mic picks up alot of breathing noises so I put some foam from some cheap headphones over it secured with a rubber band.

Your singing volume and the volume of your music can't be adjusted independently, so you end up with the music always being too quiet and your voice always being to loud. I originally bought this for my girl friend so that she could sing along with her music on long car trips, but since you are completely surrounded by speakers in the car, the feedback is deafening. Even using it at home wasn't practical, because in her small apartment we couldn't get far enough away from the speakers. If we turned it up loud enough to hear the music, the vocals were blaring and caused feedback. If we toned the volume down enough to reduce feedback then you couldn't hear the music at all.Not worth the money.

As soon as the print dialog goes away (about 2 seconds), the LabelWriter Turbo 330 starts rolling out labels. It is great for printing folder labels one at a time.Also, I like the fact that it does not take a print cartridge, so i dont know how long it will last, but I've been using mine over a year with no problem.If you are kind of obsessive about having all of your file folders organized and labeled neatly, this is the printer for you.

Van der Meer does a very good job of creating a mood that is by turns eerie, nostalgic and foreboding. However,if you enjoy a well-developed plot to go along with your character development, don't waste your time. You walk away from the book being able to point out the characters on the street. But the tantalizing question of the identity and motivations of the grey caps is left largely unexplored.

I am reevaluating the value of that friendship. This novel is an object lesson for anyone who thinks that conceiving a gimmick is a sufficient reason to write a novel. The author is an imaginative man, but a poor writer. He does not have the technical skill that would be necessary to pull off this novel's central conceit. The novel is structured as though the main narrator has written an afterword to her brother's book. The brother then annotates the script of the main narrator. The main narration is poorly written, and the annotation does not differ stylistically from the subject script.

I used them equally and this is the only one left. This mixer cleans easy, is durable, and does a thorough job in mixing. My only grief with this product is the maximum capacity is only 16 oz.

Unlike City, Simak's best known work, the stories in this collection are often optimistic in tone. This collection has several stories that have become my favorites: Crying Jag is a fun commentary on one of the things friends are supposed to be good for, and New Folks' Home is one of my favorite short stories of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good work for TV stars","review":"Really, that's not entirely fair. Bill Mumy is first and foremost a musician, and he wrote everything on this album (With help on a few songs, true...)All five of the artists have pretty good voices. Claudia Christian has two other albums out, and Bill Mumy's actually a professional musician. You can tell that Andreas, Peter, and Mira might not have been trained as musicians, but they certainly do well with their songs, and make a good showing.This is first and foremost an album that fans of Babylon 5 will order, but if you like well written blues, give it a shot.And you HAVE to listen to the last song on the album - funny as I've heard in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan Love","review":"The only place this could be bought previously was on Bill Mumy's website with the option of an autographed copy.

Right when I cracked the can open it smelled like medicine. But so do most energy drinks do. I took a sip. It tasted pretty alright not good but not bad. But a cupla seconds later. The aftertaste came in. DANG. That was the worst aftertaste ever in an energy drink. I gotta say. It got me wired. But it had a crazy bad nausia feeling. I didn't even finish it.My advice: If you drink it fast and can down a bottle of Pepto. This drink will be pretty alright but other than that. Just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is actually quite good","review":"I've tried a number of energy drinks and hate the \\"raw aspirin\\" taste of most of them along with the massive amounts of high fructose corn syrup/citric acid in almost every one of them. \\"Lightning Bolt\\" is actually pleasant to drink and actually tastes like a fruit energy drink and not an acidic checmical concoction that burns the esophagus and tweaks out the brain with randon neuron firings...I've seen other reviews, but can't say I experienced any aftertaste at all. Seagal jokes aside, (I could care less about him,) this is actually a good drink. The cherry charge flavor is slightly sweeter and has only a barely different taste than the \\"Asian Experience,\\" which is (in my opinion) the best flavor. What this IS: good tasting, natural, and gives a nice little boost with natural ingredients. What this isn't: a raver's drink/mixer beverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, but not quite his best","review":"As always, Byther Smith puts at least three stellar brooding/bleeding/beaten songs on his album; nobody does real downhearted blues better.

I found this DVD very boring for several reasons. First of all, the audience is very small making the show look a little bit artificial. I prefer shows where the audience play a more active, vibrating role. Second, Rob always says something between the songs (the guy will not shut up and simply sing the songs) which I don't know why some people think is interesting. Third, Rob sings acoustic version of some of the band's greatest hits, which in my opinion did not have the same vibe as the original version.Regarding the sound quality, no doubt it is great. However, this is a very boring DVD.My two cents..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real ...kickin' boogie!","review":"From the opening cover of Rose Tattoo's \\"Bad boy for love\\" to the final hoe-down of \\"Plastic Jesus\\" this album grabs you by the scruff of the neck, shakes you about and drops you on the floor gasping for breath.Boss Hog on bass and Da Count on drums provide an incredibly solid foundation for Crackers lilting piano licks and Curleys swirling slide work. Add to this Berties typical, no-nonsense, balls-out vocals that range from a superb southern sneer to an all out rebel yell and you have a dynamite cd that explodes into life from track one.Berties choice of song is as impeccable as ever and he never fails to deliver, whether it be a slice of Kentucky Headhunters southern boogie or a low-down, dirty, swampfest a la Omar and the Howlers, each one brilliantly crafted into the Flatts own, trademark style.

It does have lots of Foxfire-type info on building a cider press, planting an orchard, choosing cultivars, etc. But there is no real guidance for fermenting cider beverages.If you have a farm and want to press sweet cider, this would seem to be a good book.

Matthew's adventure through time, back to the eleventh century, is shared with his two young cousins, Rory and Morag. The three children have a great time in the court of King Malcolm III of Scotland and his kind-hearted wife, Margaret, where they rediscover more than just lost time. This is a cracking read, thoroughly absorbing and highly recommendable to adults as well as children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart warming read for everyone.","review":"Sabine Muir has captured the essence of childhood pondering. 'Matthew and The Highland Rescue,' delves into adventure as no other juvenile novel has yet to broach. Muir has brought back a wholesome feeling as Matthew questions if God really listens to him. Her imagery is excellent, set in 2005 as three children are transported to 11th century. Her factual information not only teaches, it entertains as well. The plot expands as the lead character Matthew finds the two things most dear to his heart then transported back to current times.

I wish they had an interview with the genius behind the madness, John K., who is also the creator of Ren and Stimpy.I think kids won't find the show as entertaining as kitsch/nostalga loving teens and adults.

Although each Alzheimer's/dementia case is unique, there are still many similarities. Numerous times I found myself identifying with the various scenarios.The author accomplishes the goals set in her prologue: to help you, the reader, make sense of your struggles; to assure you that you are not alone in this nightmare; and to help you see that you have not failed your loved one.A refreshing change from clinical books on the subject, I feel it increased my knowledge and awareness of the disease.

This is not a book that you read from cover to cover, but one that you pick up from time to time and read something edifying, grotesque, or engrossing.

Roads, fields, buildings all completely swirling white.Well not only is this the perfect compass for my purposes it comes with an alarm clock! Bonus! It also works as a handheld compass although I have never used it that way yet.

Like other have found, the switch doesn't turn on until the toggle is moved near half way and then the light comes on somewhat bright. However, once the light is on you can dim the bulb to the point where the filaments are just barely glowing by moving the toggle back toward the off position.

The signal, which was slightly better than the 900 MHz when I got it, is prone to interference from microwaves, tvs, you name it. Also, the handset volume has gotten fainter over time, to the extent that it is barely usable (and there's no indication that the battery is low).The answering machine was a huge disappointment - the digital recording is so murky that you literally cannot understand messages, no matter what the volume or how close you place your ear to the speaker.When I tried to find information on how to troubleshoot this equipment, I discovered that casio does not have a website anymore, at least not one that offers any product support...All in all, I'd avoid this model like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"the weekend","review":"it,s slow and boring......... it goes on and on about nothing....

I tried it out twice just to see, but this product is a joke. With this flimsy plastic stake, there is no way you can stake it to the ground unless the ground is soggy and soft. And guess what? You would never have to use a sprinkler in the first place if the ground was already soggy, soft and wet! All I was able to do was to get this thing into the ground about an inch, and when I turn the sprinkler on, it would slowly come off of the ground and start bowing backwards within 10 minutes of watering.

Much more powerful, is the powerful message of a woman whose voice was previously unheard. Castillo's internal assonance, her skill as a poet to make the most difficult moves look easy on the page is among her assets as a poet out of this generation of activists. The fact that Castillo's later success with her novels \\"seemed so easy\\" is actually an indication of how she perseveres.

The machine' remote suffered a melt-down after being used for two months. After conferring with Toshiba's customer service about warranty support for the remote I brought it to their designated service center in my area. -Remotes are not serviced, they are just replaced.- After replacing the remote (under warranty) Toshiba changed the text of their warranty and decided that they weren't going to honor their previous warranty and had the service center bill me (...) Beware the service and get their promises of support in writing. If you never use the equipment, it will never need service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after three movies","review":"It worked fine for the three DVD's I was able to watch before it died. Approxiamately two weeks after the warranty expired. The authorized repair people said the repair would be about $230. Just what I paid for it! This may be the exception but I thought that I should warn others of my experience. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice for a DVD Player","review":"I did a LOT of research before buying my first DVD player. After reading reviews on a ton of sites, I focused my attention towards this model and the Sony 560. I finally chose the Toshiba based on price and the dual-tray feature...and I have not been disappointed one bit with my decision. There is no sound from the DVD player while spinning the disc, the picture is great, the remote control features are plentiful, and the dual-tray is a definite bonus. Definitely consider this model if you are looking for a great player for a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 2 years","review":"Worked great until it decided to no longer play anything. 2 years old. $400 at the time of purchase. Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO issues","review":"I've had this DVD player since 2001. I've never had any issues.

However it has been less then 3 weeks of movie viewing and after freezing up a few times, it finally stopped reading any kind of disc and is currently in the shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, til it died!","review":"Worked great for a couple weeks, and up until that point I agree with the other reviewers. However, skipping got worse and worse, then it would freeze, and finally, after inserting a disc it would tell me to insert a disc. It stopped working entirely on any DVD or CD. Too bad. My old SD2107 never gave me a problem in over 3 years. Maybe I just had bum luck, but another reviewer noted needed it cleaned after several weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bang for the Buck","review":"I bought this DVD player largely on the reviews found here on Amazon and on the fact that we recently bought a Toshiba TV and wanted a player from the same manufacturer. Setup was quite easy. Picture with component video cabling is remarkable; sound is also very good. The two trays are very helpful for watching movies in serial (such as Superman I & II) or 2-disk sets in which one has the movie and the other special features. I found the remote to be fairly easy to use, if a little on the small side.Its main drawback is the lack of CD-R, CD-RW, and other home-recorded digital media playback. If you mix/record a lot of your own CDs then you'll want to hang on the your CD-player or look elsewhere for your DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing along...even though it's in German!!!","review":"The songs on this album are incredible! You really don't need to understand much German at all because the music itself is wonderful and you can sing along with the sounds if you choose! I'm learning German and it helps me with it a lot because I'll remember random phrases and know how to use some other words. You forget that they're singing in German and just enjoy it. Their music is so fluid. It's hard not to like any song of theirs! Pur rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great album","review":"I have been a long-time fan of PUR and I must say that this album is excellent. The music is upbeat and the lyrics are very clear.

Then the power supply failed! Absolutely no help or advice from Vizio. They just said it's my problem. Apparently, the set is only supposed to last one year.

Thank goodness my wife and I were both at home and I was able to put the fire out very quickly. Talked with Level 2 Tech Assistance - they had a guy come out....said: yep, looks like the power supply burned up. Vizo was going to ship a power supply Tuesday, a week ago, and they said they would send it overnight. I have yet to see it. Why bother with sending a new power supply, the darn thing is toast anyway. Dumb people! Anyway, please do yourself a favor. If you have just bought one - quick take it back. Oh...and yes it is a Vizio 32 inch HDTV. Just one more thing...NO...I did not have a power spike. IT is plugged into a data shield as is my laptop and my receiver. The laptop and receiver are just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I bought this TV in March of last year for my bedroom. I wound up using it very little. In October I couldn't get it to turn on anymore. So it went on the blink with minimal use. My husband said the problem seemed to be in the power supply. I looked online about customer service and found lots of bad reviews which said good luck with getting these things fixed. I decided not to fool with getting a repair because of those reviews, and returned it to the store for a full refund. Don't waste your money on this cheap brand, it's not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Vizio!","review":"This is not an inexpensive TV. This is a cheap TV! Do yourself a favor and stay away. It is guaranteed to fail (perhaps repeatedly). I've yet to meet anyone who has had one of these go for more than 3 years without a failure. Mine failed twice in 18 months - naturally the second failure was 30 days out of warranty! Oh and Vizio will scold you for not buying the extended warranty rather than apologize for a crappy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video broke within a year","review":"For a fairly expensive item, I would have expected the VCR portion to work longer than it did. We only used this TV for long car rides, so it was used maybe 10 times before it broke. With only a 90 day warranty, we got very little use out of it and are out of luck. Would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple story of deceit and murder.","review":"The movie picks some momentum during the first half, but runs out of puff during the second and culminates with a fairly dull end. It is essentially a 'a day in the life of' kind of a movie.

The surround left, right, and rear RTi6 speakers are mounted on log walls at almost ceiling hight. A powered subwoofer is located behind the corner cabinet. All is driven by an Onkyo TX-SR575.

The pixels are huge and the image is grainy. The colors are okay, but color convergence and moire are pretty prominent making the picture look pretty bad overall. DVD's play okay when a player is hooked up, but the image is still pretty blah overall.The flat screen was nice for about 5 minutes, and then I realized that a regular \\"bubble tube\\" CRT television actually has a sharper and more well defined picture than flat screen. You don't notice the size of the pixels as much and colors seem to come out better in a bubble tube TV.Again, I urge you to look elsewhere and avoid this Toshiba Flat-screen TV. The only flat-screen TVs I would seriously recommend are Sony Trinitrons which are excellent quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fel-Pro 61357 Exhaust Pipe Gasket","review":"This gasket did not fit properly. I had to use a rubber mallet to get the gasket onto the pipe. Normally this type of gasket should slip on with little effort. For some reason none of the aftermarket exhaust companies seems to have the correct gasket for a 2005 Toyota Prius. I tried many other brands and all were too small. I had hoped that this one was correct, but once again very disappointed and frustrated. I would probably recommend purchasing a Toyota gasket instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out for me","review":"I bought this to use with my table saw. From the description, I thought this switch would allow you to step on it once to turn the power on, then step again to turn it off. This isn't quite the way it is.To turn on, you press the pedal with your toe and to turn off, you have to press with your heel. That would probably be OK if the pedal was longer or flat, but it's much shorter than the foot and it's set at an angle. Because of that, it's easy to switch it on, but when you're trying to switch it off, your heel can get hung up on the floor. You can switch it off by pressing the rear end of the pedal with your toe, of course, but that means you have to reposition your foot while you're sawing, which is hard to do without taking your eyes off the work.I wasn't able to find a way to use it that I felt comfortable with. I wound up buying a Delta 40-050 Lectric Air Foot Switch, which has worked out much better for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Low Carb dieters","review":"I have been on Atkins now for just under 1 year and the one thing I never could find was something to use with dips. I ate celery by the handful, but honestly, some dips call for something else. Luckily, while searching for other low carb items on Amazon, I came across these. I find that Just The Cheese \\"crackers\\" are really good to dip - they have a strong cheese flavor but tend to be dry if you eat them plain. I LOVE them with cream cheese! They are also excellent with any sour cream based dip. I have also tried the white cheese ones, don't care for those - The pizza ones I definitely recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for anyone interested in getting to know Jazz","review":"No matter what any one says about this book, it is still without doubt an essential purchase for anyone interested in pursuing Jazz music seriously. I've read reviews complaining about the Keys of certain songs being different to previous editions, which for me isn't really much of an issue. The ability to transpose a song from one key to another should be part of any Jazz musician's repetoire. That said, I've not come across any songs in the book yet which are in \\"unusual\\" keys. In short, buy this book if you want to pursue Jazz music; its realitvely cheap and its to the point; It doesn't have any frills but that is why I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful surprise that I could play a song immediately","review":"The Real Book should set the minimum standard for all fake books.As a beginner, I was timid about purchasing this book. What a delight to see large clear type, a song for each page or two page songs that face one another. I even discovered that I could play some songs immediately which was not possible with the same songs in a book such as \\"This is the Ultimate Fake Book with Over 1200 Songs.\\" In that book the print was so small that I had to squint constantly to try to read the notes.

(And, by the way, it's not returnable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsuited for gigs","review":"Due the slow index, multi-line titles, and a search method that results in anything but what you wanted, the kindle version is terrible for use on gigs. It takes forever to get a song up and once you do it opens to an empty page except for the copyright notice. You must then turn the page to get to the song. The design for kindle is a complete failure, stick with the paper version (preferably the old 5th edition). For kindle I suggest making your own charts and loading them into your kindle as pdf documents. It's worked great for me.

Even though the song selection is very similar, it is different. The purpose of this is to replace all the 5th edition real books; it is not here to replicate it. The reason I give this four stars is because gigging musicians who need to replace a worn out 5th edition cannot go to this book as a replacement.

I'm sure it's just me not being a very good dancer and I've only tried it once so far. Having a hard time finding more time to do it. It's still fun, just hard to get a hang of, for me, anyway. Still pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow, Great for beginner's","review":"Very informative. You will definitely want to play each section one at a time and then over and over again because some of the moves look deceptively easy but are difficult to do correctly, unless you practice,practice,practice! My muscles weren't hurting very much afterwards, but as a Mom of a preschooler it's very likely that all the bending, reaching and picking up that I do in a normal day, has already conditioned me to a point. I did however work up a heat and I felt more limber and flexible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Instruction","review":"Easy to understand, delightful to watch.

There is sufficient material in the video to give you a decent workout, and the perfect amount of instruction such that the moves are easy to learn but can still be practiced by someone who is no longer a beginner but would like to brush up on their form. She introduces some more advanced moves in addition to the beginner moves and has sequences at the end to practice, making this an option for more intermediate level belly dancers as well. Overall, one of the best belly dancing video purchases I've made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amira's Belly Dance 101","review":"This is a great video for beginners! Amira is very detailed in her instructions and the video is easy to follow. She begins with posture and covers the basic moves a beginner needs to learn.

I think EVERYONE should include drilling the basics into their bellydance practice and this DVD really helps with that.... I look forward to her next project!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, not helpful","review":"I wanted to learn how to belly dance, so I bought this based on all the good reviews. However, I found them very misleading.The way Amira teaches is not interesting or engaging. I was very bored, and I've never been bored dancing before. I'm a beginner, and even I found this to be way too easy. Dancing should be fun, yet this DVD makes it incredibly dull. Amira's instructions were not clear, and she talked a little too much about irrelevant things. I like it best when instructors are concise and to the point. It was very hard to get through the entire DVD.I would not recommend this to anybody. If you are new to belly dancing, this will most likely turn you off from it. It sure did for me, though I hope to find a better DVD sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Building Blocks is a Delighful Read; fails as a solid reference","review":"While I am greatly enjoying Nature's Building Blocks by John Emsley, I am sorely disappointed in not finding an index for this wonderful book.

This route was in fact the same route taken in 1992 when they won it all that year. This video does an excellent job of giving a complete summary of the two final four games and the championship game pitting Duke agaisnt Arizona. Still I found this video to be a let down due to the fact it does not show the complete NCAA championship game. This video is over seventeen dollars but is only fifty four minutes. If it had shown the entire championship game it would of been worth the cost but it did not.

At the end, my first thought was, \\"That's it?\\"If you are looking to complete your personal shrine to Duke Basketball in your parlor room, then buy this video.

Yes! There is a DVD included, but NOT ONE MUSIC VIDEO, which over the last couple issues has become a coveted part of the collection. In fact, this is the only reason why someone as avid a collector as I am would pick it up.I love the music, but if you're getting this for the vids, STOP right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed!","review":"I was very disappointed in the CD.

So far, I really like the unit. I have had the lights flicker several times and the APC boosted the power to correct the low voltage situation. Now, the bad part... It's pretty noisy when it is correcting the power. The relays are much louder than I expected. I hadn't seen it mentioned in the reviews I scanned, and being a home theater unit, I just assumed that there would have been more attention to being quiet / unobtrusive. If there are no major power problems, it's near silent. But if it does what you bought it to do, the clicking relays are annoying. I don't mean to bash this unit, I think it does a good job.

The free CD is full of strange files, that whilst probably very interesting to the author, prove to be quite pointless. My advice to anyone really interested in learning the art of movie making the quick way is firstly get a subscription to Moviemaker magazine. For less than $30 you get up to date, useful info. and a free copy of Moviemakers own, \\"Guide to making your own Film\\". Then look for the only other books I could recommend, \\"Rebel Without a Crew\\" and \\"Roadracers\\" both by Robert Rodriguez.

And last month, the 1 stopped working on 2 more handsets. It's a great phone as long as you don't need do use long distance or have a friend with a 1 in their number. Grrrr.

I had to exchange the handset right away because it wasn't working properly, the base unit didn't recocnize it. After that issue was resolved everything worked fine, other than the slight annoyance that you can't turn the ringer off.....About 6 months ago the #1 stopped working on the handset which is more than just annoying it makes the handset virtually unusable, except when answering calls. I've resorted to using the caller ID/redial feature to make calls to phone #'s with the #1 in them...I can see now from reading other people's reviews that this is not a unique problem & is obviously an engineering flaw. I'm going to contact Panasonic Customer Service & see where that gets me (hahaha).

The sound quality is often poor. The mobile unit often can't find the base station (even when you're standing next to it). And just last week the #1 stopped working on one of the handsets (which makes it kind of hard to dial long distance).Even the design of the phone is screwy. Who designs a high end phone without a mute button on the base or handset? And why give only two ring options (2 rings or 5 rings) before rolling into voice mail? And the whole configuration of auto attendant v. voice mail box is just down right odd.Panasonic ought to discontinue this phone and start over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful phone","review":"This has been the best phone system I have ever had.

The great feature of private conversations was great as there are snoopy people here(at work)and if there was a phone of the hook,(we have the same numbers at my house, my parents house and our family business), all I had to do was pick up one of my phones and I automatically knew if it was off at my house or not and same at work.

I could hear every single note in the music which was not possible with my previous speakers. They do have considerable amount of bass if we increase the volume a little. but it depends on persons taste. to me adding a subwoofer will be like noise, because i like the soft bass coming out of these speakers. One difference that i observed with these polks and the newer polks but of different series ( not the rti series ) is that, newer tsi models tend to have more mid range than these, but rti sound clearer i.e. if there is bass and guitar at the same time in a song, you could hear each of them clearly using the rti.

This is my 6th palm that I have purchased, but this has to be one of the poorest cases designed for this particular device. They should have put a rubber grip inside the case. Half the time when I extend the screen - it pops out of the case. I have dropped the palm numerous times when just holding the case because the 2 small hooks holding the palm in does not lock it securely. This case gives you little security in protecting this device..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so bad...","review":"I had bought hard cases for my previously owned Palms (V and 500) because without one, they were always getting accidentally turned on in my purse, draining the battery. Palm T3 doesn't have that problem because of the placement of the on/off switch. I didn't have a problem with the T3 coming loose from the case, and found it functional - just bulky, a bit heavy and not needed. I'm far happier with a slim leather case that also holds my credit card and 2 expansion cards. But if you are looking for a hard case specifically, I don't think this one is so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This case has a case of the dropsies...","review":"As others have mentioned, the case does not consistently keep the T3 fastened down. When carrying the T3 (within its case) in my coat pocket or in my briefcase, the movement apparently loosens the T3 from the clips that were designed to hold it in the case. Thus, the case doesn't do its job. Unfortunately, I didn't realize the problem for a while, and now it's too late to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful case, AVOID","review":"I bought this case on Ebay at .99 + shipping... it costed more or less 5.50 altogether.

After having a tight-fitting case for my old Handspring, I expected nothing but the best for my new T3.The Palm doesn't stay tight in the case and thus, half the time it falls out in my purse or briefcase.I will be looking for somethine else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so tough!","review":"This hard case for the new Tungsten T3 is not as tough as it looks! Yes it is sleek and attractive, and it will protect your Palm from inadvertant key strokes, scratches and light wear and tear. It has two downsides: 1) despite little latches to hold the Palm in place inside the cover, the pda pops loose rather too readily. I generally carry my pda in its case inside a purse, briefcase or tote; as a result of normal jostling of these items, I often open the hard case to find the Palm \\"floating loose\\" inside. This has forced me to make some rather atheletic \\"saves\\" as I open the case and the Palm starts to slide out and fall. 2)The case itself doesn't have a secure closing. I discovered this when it fell from my desk, popped open and I watched my pda slide across the carpet (thank goodness it wasn't asphalt!)So this case gets high marks for style but low for substance. Let me know when Palm comes out with a case that will afford real protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish you had a \\"zero star\\" category","review":"This case has been discussed at great length over on the user forum on the PalmOne website. It all boils down to one thing: the case does NOT protect your T3. In fact, it won't hold it in at all. You can try to bend up the springs a bit, but this doesn't solve the problem entirely and eventually the springs will break. I'm really surprised that this got by their quality assurance testing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Case NOT Hard to Resist","review":"This case is very poorly designed, and I am highly disappointed with it. It does not securely fasten the palm inside, so it is always falling out in my pocket or my purse. The actual face of the PDA is covered, but the button to the microphone on the side is exposed, as is the on/off switch and all the beaming mechanisms at the top. They end up getting pressed and scratched and debris can get down into the area where the memory card slips in. No protection whatsoever! The case has a flimsy and cheap feel to it. It is not the quality product I expect from Palm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm Can Pop Out Easily","review":"I agree with most of what the other reviewers wrote with one exception. My case has a very secure cover latch. It is spring loaded and closes nicely. I don't even mind the large cut-out. The T3 is held in place by a leaf spring on the bottom of the case that pushes up VERY GENTLY on the palm and allows the two plastic hooks on the back of the case to engage in the mating slots on the back of the palm. In my opinion, there simply isn't enough pressure to keep the T3 secure. It frequently pops out, making the case a temporary solution until I find a better one. I rate myself 1 star for not reading the reviews, like you just did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree--a turkey.","review":"Cheesy looking faux plastic, instantly waiting to spring-eject your palm through its humongous top maw.I would like to add that it is also very difficult to open the T3 up to full-size with this case: You have to dedicate one hand entirely (typically the left hand if you are right handed) just to holding it in (I should say \\"on\\") the case, and the other to gingerly extending it out without unseating the device from the case.A disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $$$","review":"Jeez, what a waste of money. I have to mirror the other reviews (and I wish I would've read them before I bought this piece of crap): The case rarely holds my T3, it's flimsy and badly made, and, frankly, I doubt it would protect my T3 if it were dropped on a pillow.

It is so obvious this book was written to cash in on the noteriety of what at that time was current events. In fact, no one will probably ever read this review, because I doubt there is any interest left in this little girl. Let's get something straight. Kelly Flinn was not persecuted by the air force. She was warned - the air force was wrong for letting her get away with it the first time. The military doesn't use adultery regulations against women only, or disproportionately against women - if more women are prosecuted, perhaps more women are breaking the rule.

Flinn makes yet another compelling case for why women should be excluded from military service. Though a graduate of the Air Force Academy (which I believe ranks somewhere below USCGA, Norwich, VMI, and the Citadel as a military academy), Flinn didn't seem to pick up on the fact that officers are not supposed to sleep with the spouses of enlisted personnel, disobey direct lawful orders, or lie in official documents!

It wasn't until less than an hour ago we discovered that this film-residue problem was directly related to this filter. One writer put it this way: \\"The metal filters don't trap the fine residue found in ground coffee as well as paper filters.\\" We tested this by pouring 4 cups of recently brewed coffee directly into and through a paper filter. Voila! No oily residue in the cup, but the paper filter was black with the oily debris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"It's not much to write about it - it's good quality and precisely fitted my Mazdaspeed3 exhaust.

The video outputs (3) can all be used simultaneously (so you could feed your whole house off this one machine), and the audio outputs allow for connection to any home theater receiver (Dolby Digital and DTS).

Toshiba gave me two options- send them [money] and pay to ship and insure it the unusable player for some kind of replacement (unclear on model, new or refurbished) OR take my chances with a repair shop that said it would cost ... and take 4 weeks just to diagnose the problem. At the original price..., Toshiba could do more. My advice? Stay away from any Toshiba product. Maybe you won't have any problems with your player, but if you do, don't count on any help from Toshiba."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME DVD Player","review":"Both my parents and my grandparents own this dvd player and they love it. My grandparents have had theirs for a year and my parents for 4 months. The great thing that impressed me about the dvd player was the quality of the picture matched with a price you can't beat.

I knew I didn't want to spend over $200, but I thought I'd have to settle for a lesser quality player. I still can't get over the quality of the Toshiba for the price. Great picture, great features, and a great price. I would caution buyers (with this or any other DVD player) to check the connections on your TV, especially if it's not a newer set. You may be required to purchase a converter box.

So what you get here are ten songs that are for the most part acoustic, sung by a woman with a good voice and also excellent lyrics.

Not a bad price, but the same thing at WalMart is just under $8 per bottle ($7.97 I think). So you pay an extra $4 for the convenience of having delivery to your door. This disparity can be reduced by ordering more than one unit, which is two bottles of 500, at a time. Check the postage chart the company supplies, do the math, and it could be worth your time. Of course this only works if you are a heavy and regular user of ibuprofen. Still a way better buy than name brands no matter what you do.

The love triangle has really taken a backseat(Kikyo was barely in the season). Totosei, Myoga, and Kikyo had reduced screen time, and the total lack of Naraku made things a little less exciting.

An inactive member becomes reinterested due to the new activities director in the singles ward.

Most of his humor fell totally flat. Perhaps the European English speaking market would find him \\"funny\\". For a host in a foreign country, Ian has a thick local dialectal accent, uses too many colonialisms and non standard words, and speaks too fast. However with that said, there were a few moments that were amusing, and at the end Ian did take a swim in the ice water. If he came off as a goofball, at least he wasn't the ugly demanding arrogant tourist.After watching 4 globe trekkers there is nothing educational about them, there is no way anyone would plan a trip or learn enough about the countries to gain practical advice.

This is because it broke new territory - and I must admit the special effects are really impressive. However, the most serious flaw is that the movie never seemed to combine the special effects with the kung-fu action, which I was screaming for all the way through. What a wasted opportunity! There is too much boy meets girl type nonsense going on for my liking. Maybe if they had a Jet li or a Donnie Yen on board they could have done something with this, but I doubt it.

I can't imagine what kind of woman would enjoy and give a good review to a book where the heroine was raped. And, yes, it was rape no matter what flowery term you put it in. Neither the \\"hero\\" in the book is unlikable and selfish. And later in the book, you find the heroine's first husband, who happens to be the brother of the hero, turns out to have had an affair with a girl while the heroine was waiting for him to return to her in France.

Maybe a callous, insensitive brute would do such a thing... but a woman would NOT enjoy it and beg for more, certainly not one who just lost her husband!

This entire book was written in VERY POOR TASTE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT her best book!","review":"Ok, I LOVE Lisa Kleypas, and there are very few of her books that I dislike, but this is one of them. I really hoped for more with Justin and Phillipe's story. I did like parts of it, like when Justin was wounded and Celia took care of him, even though he treated her badly. The story just seemed to be too much of a stockholm syndrome story for me, and Celia seemed too vulnerable as the heroine. Granted, she had been through alot, but there is something a little to icky about the whole concept of the story. But that is probably just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disturbing","review":"I generally love Kleypas's ability to create faceted, interesting lead characters whose lives intersect in an original story. This book, however, is a bit troublesome. Celia and Justin, the main characters, come together in a first sexual experience that can only be termed \\"rape.\\" Celia repeatedly says \\"No,\\" though with decreasing fervor as Justin persists. Kleypas writes it delicately-- as delicately as possible given the forced nature of the interaction-- but it is still upsetting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Snuff for Lisa Kleypas","review":"I couldn't get into this book at all because not only was it somewhat predictable, I did not like the characters. The heroine, Celia, seemed spoiled, sheltered and overall boring. There was nothing special about her and I didn't like her. Also, this book read too much like so many other romance novels where the guy is a complete jerk and womanizer at the beginning only to turn into a sensitive one-woman man at the end of the book. Lisa Kleypas can do better than this. I know it. Her story of Dreaming of You with Sara Fielding and Derek Craven was, by far, one of the best books I have ever read.

But I have read the book over and over again because I find it so entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave it on the shelf","review":"I normally like her books, but this one was not only hard to read, but mildly offensive. I have always enjoyed her books because they show women as strong, capably people- this one does not.

Yes, the woman was conflicted by being attracted to the \\"evil\\" pirate, but she was more than willing. She was torn between her fear of him, and her desire for him...but that doesn't constitute rape, and the character never stated that she felt raped.If you read the entire book, you will see the evolution of Justin and he becomes a very lovable character.My only disappointment with this book is that the heroine is not so lovable. There was nothing particularly wrong with her...she was just rather boring.Overall, I think this is one of Kleypas' keepers."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est Bien","review":"What's up with all the mediocre reviews of this book? Having read almost all of Ms Kleypas books, I find Justin Vallerand to be one of, if not 'the' most interesting characters she's come up with. I find Celia's behavior (that of a naive French Catholic girl) completely in keeping with the way her character is meant to be portrayed. This book also contains a more thorough plot than most of her other books. I think anyone planning to read this one, should first read, 'When Stranger's Marry' (same as 'Only in Your Arms').It helps tremendously to understand what transpired earlier.Both contain that dialogue of French & English which is truly genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a new age muddle","review":"T J MacGregor is a good writer-- it's too bad she didn't have a plot to match her writing.

It all ends in a fuzzy feel-good New Age pep rally involving dolphins and flutes. If you want to read a (somewhat) better novel on this theme, check out Wilson Tucker's Ice and Iron.

Reading this book for class has been one of my most painful experiences and so time consuming because you have to re-read everything multiple times. The glossary seems like an afterthought and many words that should be in there are not. The index also is lacking and incomplete. I am incredibly disappointed with this book. Professors,please do not pick this book for your classes! I would give it zero stars if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop at its best!","review":"This cd is hot, hip hop at its rawest and best.If you are looking for a cd that can be played all the way through, then read on, but if you are looking for mainstream rap, stop reading because this is not what this cd is about. This is what hip hop is right here, and what it all comes down to: skills and hot beats, which this CD has. DJ Hi-Tek shines on the beats, and Kweil drops knowledge on every track he spits on. This is a cd that you can play all the way through, and the things he says will make you rewind it and say \\"did he really say that?\\" This album will be a classic for years to come, and this is just the tip of the iceberg from Talib Kweli. A hot cd from a hot artist. Get this if you are sick of all the bling bling and 20 inch rims that have corrupted our music nowadays. Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rawkus continues to grow","review":"Reflection eternal is exactly what a Black Star, Mos Def, Spitkickers Tour, Rawkus record fan would expect. In lieu of all the hardcore unrealistic rap, this is an honest representation of hip-hop. I felt the beats and rhymes were exceptional. The only criticism is that Talib Kwali's voice is difficult to follow through some of those beats. The album is creative, honest, and reflective. It is definately a must have album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip-Hop for Respect","review":"With so much focus on \\"ice\\" and cars in today's mainstream hip-hop, it is certainly pleasing to my ears, to hear mc's like Talib Kweli and dj's like Hi-Tek, bring some respect back to hip-hop. Their debut album, Train of Thought is everything I expected and more. Kweli never ceases to amaze me with his lyrical ability. His articulation accompanied by the his smooth vocal tone put me at ease and remind me why it is that I listen to music. Hi-Tek presents Kweli with the perfect production to compliment his rhyming style. The two show that they can produce a well rounded album of upbeat party joints, such as, \\"This Means You\\" featuring Mos Def and \\"Soul Rebels\\" featuring De La Soul, as well as laid back songs such as, \\"Too Late\\" and \\"Memories Live.\\" If it were up to me, these two would be nominated for a Grammy. The future only looks brighter for Kweli and Hi-tek and any success they recieve is well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Hip-Hop albums of 2002","review":"I still listen too this album today.

Every hip-hop fan should pick this up. Kweli spits excellent rhymes while Hi-Tek lays down some terrific beats. Some of the top tracks are Move Somethin, The Blast, Too Late, Down for the Count, Ghetto Afterlife, Love Language, Soul Rebels, Externalists, and Good Mourning. Kweli's lyrics have a message behind them, but don't come off as \\"preachy\\". There are also some good guest spots by De La Soul, Mos Def, Res, Rah Digga, Xzibit, Kool G Rap, and Les Nubians, among others. There really isn't much I can add to the previous reviews except to say this is an excellent album which will become a hip-hop classic. If you are a real rap fan, pick this album up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Train of Thought - An express train ride, from beg. to end","review":"Train of Thought is for Hip-Hop enthusiasts who can remember Hip-Hop albums that were straight plays, from beginning to end. This album will not have you itching to skip tracks. There are no fillers in this incredible twenty track album. Reflection Eternal's debut album is at the forefront of a Hip-Hop Renaissance, made possible by the likes of Common, Mos Def, the Roots, Slum Village, and Outkast to name a few. I'm not going to do a track by track review of Train of Thought, since every track is beautifully produced by Hi Tek and made complete by one of the most talented and conscious emcees in the game, Talib Kweli. A well deserved five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Talib and Hi-Tek release best album of the year","review":"This is definetely the best album released this year for the true hip-hop fans. While other albums have enjoyed commercial success this one puts them to shame. Talib steps out of the shadow of Mos Def and secures his place as the better lyricist of the two. Talib Kweli makes you think about what he is saying instead of the Ja Rule's who only talk about Murda. This album is a definite relief for fans who have been waiting for an album that has no wack tracks. Hi-Tek produces head nodder after head nodder while Talib spits his best lyrics yet. This is worth ever penny and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":".. to be proven a classic.","review":"This cd, in my humble opinion, will become a classic. The beats are super crisp, as expected from Hi-Tek, and the flow/lyrics are unwaveringly tight. Kweli rocks da spot with his insight into \\"Ghetto\\" philosophy and the mindset of his bretheren. With most cd's these days you have to compromise between tight beats or wicked lyrics, and thankfully this album comes to plate with both. Truly an essential part of any hip-hop collection.That's all I need to say about this right now.RespectKader"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Just Can't Listen to It Once...","review":"This CD is a refresshing change from the \\"get-money\\", \\"booty shaking\\" redundant watered-down for the masses hip-hop.

If you love Hip-Hop you'll love this (forgive the cliche but here it is true)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Talib Kweli is the hip-hop artist of the CENTURY!","review":"I first heard about Talib Kweli in the Fall of '99. It was Mos Def and himself and I loved it! Then when, this album came out, I bought it! I listened to it from start to end, and continued to do this until I couldn't hold my eyes open. Talib's views are ones that I myself agree with and the way he states his opinions is absolutely untouchable! His knowledge of life and liberty are ones which I would consider to be that of a mentor's! His album entitled, \\"Quality\\" is just another example of this! Superb vocals, awesome effects and beats, and such politically incorrect statements one can't do without!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT TRIBUTE TO HIP HOP","review":"This cd is genuine. Talib Kweli's lyrics flow so well with DJ Hi-Tek's beats. I reccomend this to anyone interested in experiencing great hip hop. Talib Kweli's intelligence eminates through his lyrics, and his roots in hip hop are deep. I bought this cd only knowing of \\"Move Somethin\\", \\"Too Late\\", \\"This Means You\\", and \\"The Blast\\", and I listened to the cd 3 times through when i got it home because it was that good. Just check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop the CD presses!!!","review":"There should not be another hip hop album made until the rest of the world hears this album!!!

It's a must buy for any serious Sublime fan because of it's rare quality, it's awesome cover art (by Opie as usual) and it's tracks that are not available on any studio albums. The tracks are as follows:1. Badfish - The classic. The same version from 40 Oz. To Freedom.2. Don't Push - The Original. Same version from Second Hand Smoke.3. Untitled Dub - An early, rare, live version of Pawn Shop, way before the self titled album was released.4. We're Only Gonna Die For Our Arrogance - Live version of the track from 40 Oz. To Freedom.5. Roots Of Creation - This previously unrealesed 1998 studio recording is the highlight of this EP. This track is one of Sublime's earliest (and best) recordings, with similar instrumentation to their song Romeo from Second Hand Smoke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"Earth Surface Processes by Philip A.

Nothing in here that you can't learn for free on You Tube, and the tiny oval pans just get in the way, I just don't know what to do with them. My biggest complaint is for all the course kits, several of them have the exact same tips, mats and lame cake stands in them. You would think each kit builds off each other, but instead each kit assumes you don't own any of the others and comes with stuff you already have. So keep that in mind when getting these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Their are so few books dedicated to the darker side, so I snatched this one when I found it. Good descriptions, of the dark god/godesses are given-but hey, why were the Celts left out? Also, how the author managed to put a newage happy twist on goddesses like Kali and Hecate is beyond me. Overall it was ok-though I wish someone who actually worked with \\"the dark side\\"of the Dark side would have wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUSPENSE AT ITS BEST!","review":"this book was great! Intrigue, glamour, suspense, a \\"can't put it down\\" reading! Mr. Leman writes with great description, I felt like I was there. The characters are well defined and the mystery weaves you through the story unfolding bit by bit. One of my favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I would not recommend buying this chair and ottoman. The quality is terrible. The ottoman was broken on arrival due to the use of particleboard instead of something more durable - the screws tore right out of it leaving large holes in their places. Since sending it back was not an option for me, I had to rig up my own solution using pieces of plywood and glue. At first, the chair seemed not too bad, but now just a month later, it creaks and clunks something awful - hardly a calming device when it makes all this racket. Since I knew I could not send it back, I purposefully chose a chair/ottoman set that was in the mid to high range for this brand, a plan that definitely backfired on me. I suggest you save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"My wife and I received this chair as a gift for our baby shower. It is a comfortable chair, but that is where my good thoughts end. Within about 2 weeks of use, the wood started to make creeking noises. Noises so loud that it was annoying to watch television while using the chair. Also, the bearings in the actual gliding mechanism were no longer smooth. We are very frustrated!! Especially when we tried to return the chair. NOBODY GOT BACK TO US. Knowing that mostly these chairs are bought for expecting mothers, you would think that the Shermag company or anyone who sells it would want to BACK it. At this point, I am not sure it is safe enough to use while holding a baby. Don't waste your money. Spend $500 to $600 on a chair at a quality furniture store, it will most likely last a lot longer. REMEMBER.... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this chair.

First after very little use when gliding the pressure from the person on the seat would make the glider lock in place. My husband did not want to bother with trying to return such a large piece of furniture so he tried to fix it himself. Well with the new baby he kept forgetting. Finally he tried taking off the \\"teeth\\" where the seat would lock into, but the locking mechanism would still get pushed down and the chair would ride on the rails. Then he used plastic ties to keep the springs from hitting the pressure point, that lead to one of the springs popping out of the wood work while I was trying to nurse the baby one late night. I would not buy a Shermag again, I wish we had just spent more on a Dutailier."},{"rating":"2","title":"great chair great price","review":"Love the chair, sturdy and comfortable great price.

Anyway, Amazon has already replaced my glider once, and it's broken again. The locking mechanism has failed, jolting the chair into a locked position when I'm rocking it. (It's such a jolt it should have a \\"Caution: Whiplash Happens\\" sign on it) So I HATE this chair. As far as I'm concerned, I would throw it down my stairs if it wouldn't do a lot of damage to the walls and stairs. I emailed Shermag about it and basically told them I hate it so much there's no way I even want a replacement. It's horribly uncomfortable as well.Oh - ETA and the bolts come out of the ottoman once or twice a day. Even with DH screwing them in as tightly as he can.Shermag = FAIL.

We first selected the \\"Pecan\\" colored chair, but when it arrived, it was very orange in color. We sent it back and ordered the \\"Cherry\\" color, and by no surprise the chair that arrived was MUCH more red than the chair in the photos. We even went to a local store that carried the exact same chairs and verified that the chairs sent to us did not match the Pecan or Cherry color chairs that were in the store. I work in the woodworking industry and completely understand that color variation is just part of the game, however, these are completely different colors than what is shown in the photos. I presume that the chairs that are being sold by AMAZON are bad color/quality batches that the manufacturer is attempting to dump at a discount. As for quality... it's made in China. Figure it out from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is deceiving","review":"I researched hours on this and other websites before making this purchase. Even though I wanted to purchas an espresso finish, reclining rocker/glider, I chose this chair because the padding appeared to be much thicker than any other and the price was reasonable.

I am debating whether to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered twice, ottomon missing both times and big crack on log","review":"I Ordered this item twice, ottomon was missing both times and the 1st time around there was a big crack in one of chair legs.

The assembly was a little challenging - but it came together without too much trouble. The chair and ottoman look beautiful - the wood and material are very nice. However, after a couple of weeks it became clear this chair just wasn't going to work for us. The arms are very narrow and high up - making it very difficult to breastfeed or bottle feed. I found myself feeling very restricted in the chair. Additionally the ottoman is significantly lower than the chair, which was very uncomfortable for me. The back cushion also stuck out too much at the top and hit me in the middle of my back. I am 5'3, so it might work better for someone who is taller. While it is a good looking product, a price, and a nice enough chair to just sit in - I found it to be a bad fit for a nursing chair. We returned it without any trouble and found a chair that is wider and lower to the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"$200 cheaper than BRS!!!!","review":"Originally bought a cheaper version from Walmart and returned it as color was not per the picture and after sitting oin it realized that I really needed one that you could lock when reclined.I am 5\\"2\\" and slider is a perfect fit for me.

I was concerned at first, because they are priced separately at Babies R Us, but only had one price on Amazon. But, no worries, both the ottoman and the chair come in the box together, for a single price. They are very comfortable and are very true to the description listed. The color of the maple wood is slightly warmer than pictured, and matched the maple bed set we purchased exactly (not whitewashed like the picture). Both pieces were fairly easy to assemble out of the box, and don't take up much room in the nursery.

My legs hit the sides and it just felt small overall. I am only 5'4\\" and I was unable to rest my head on the back of the glider because it was too short.On top of that, the seat base was broken. When my husband put the chair together, the wood base was cracked on both sides, right where you sit. UPS picked it up today and it is being returned.

The + / - designation was a bit small to determine how the batteries should be installed.I left it on charge for the specified period but it would only work with the USB cable attached.I then tried my phone charger to charge the batteries, and lo and behold the mouse worked without the USB cable.I haven't experienced the problems on waking up the device as other people have reviewed the product. A simple movement of the mouse or a single click wakes it up from sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse","review":"I've had this mouse for 3 years or so. Works great. I travel and am happy with it. It does go to sleep occasionally, but if I am working steadily it is typically no problem. Beats having a dongle. I did have to update the Bluetooth drivers on my Dell D630 and I have had to re - pair it once or twice. Again, no big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"TARGUS MICE - Bluetooth AMB03US","review":"This product is one of the best I used from Targus. The DPI is 800-1200, the response is quick and reliable. I like the grip, and it perfectly fit for laptops. I recommend this product.Cons: No customizing options like the new generation ones (logitech-nano)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work..","review":"I just got this mouse and have been trying to use it with a Macbook Pro. Initially, the mouse would connect via bluetooth - but the cursor would jump all over the screen regardless of whether I was moving the mouse or not. It was effectively unusable. Now, just a few days after receiving the mouse - it won't connect at all. So it's completely unusable. My experience may be different from others - but imo this is totally inexcusable. And a flat-out terrible product. I'll stick to Logitech and Microsoft mice from hereonout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for Me","review":"Despite the many negative reviews about this mouse, I decided to go ahead and get it. I haven't regretted it. I've had it for a few weeks now, and it is working very well. It seem over-sensitive when I first started using it, but I got used to it fairly quickly, and it's great. The \\"sleep function\\" that everyone complains about isn't really a big deal to me. It takes a split second to wake up most of the time, and I've had that same behavior with other bluetooth mice. The Battery life isn't the greatest, but it's decent, and it's very convenient to have the charging cord when it runs out so that I can continue working while it charges. I used my own higher quality rechargeable batteries from the start, so I don't know what the batteries it came with are like. For anyone that wants a really good bluetooth mouse, I would definitely recommend this one. It's really nice, good size, and easily portable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reliability","review":"I've owned two of these mice. The first died within a year, so I got a second within the warranty. The second died within two years with regular, but no, and I really mean NO abuse. Targus would not replace the moouse. When it works, it's super. However, as others have said, the build quality is very, very, poor. I cannot recommend this mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"I'm not very happy with this mouse.- Very, very laggy. Presumably to improve battery life, it goes to sleep constantly. You're always having to wiggle to wake it up, even after just a few seconds' typing.- Charges batteries slowly, and does not work at all when batteries are dead, even with USB cable plugged in. So you'll leave it on the shelf for a while to find the batteries are dead, then need to plug it in for a long time to get even the minimal charge needed to use it.The one pro is that it's quite precise, and has a precision-enhancement mode with even higher DPI, but that's all for nought since you're having to fight its narcolepsy all the time.Size is just big enough not to fit easily in a tiny part of a bag, but still small enough to be non-ergonomic. The worst of all worlds."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"mini-sleep mode\\" is terrible design flaw","review":"Gateway Bluetooth users be warned as well. This very same model mouse is being sold by Gateway (with a black and grey color scheme and a Gateway logo in place of the targus logo) for use with their Bluetooth enabled laptops.Gateway's model number is 7005803R. Targus lists it as AMB0302USZ. But it's the same exact mouse.The \\"mini-sleep\\" mode design flaw outweighs all the other benefits. especially if you're a gamer. No way you can afford to have to wiggle the mouse to bring it back to life in a heated battle.And even if you're not a gamer, it's just damn annoying. Targus and Gateway offer nothing to help either. No drivers or utilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep mode makes this mouse virtually unusable","review":"Everything about this mouse was great. It's built well, feels great in the hand, tracks awesomely, and looks great too. However, beware! This thing goes into a sleep mode after about 5-10 seconds of inactivity and then requires a button click or mouse movement to bring it back. Waking up takes 2 seconds. This is so annoying that it just makes the mouse unusable. You type something on the keyboard, you try to move the mouse, and it sticks for 2 seconds before it moves. In addition, if it sleeps for more than about 15-20 minutes, it goes into such a deep sleep that it is hard to wake back up. It can take 5-10 seconds to wake up. If you think this is quick, sit and wait 10 seconds staring at the computer. I tried to like it but these flaws are fatal. The documentation says it sleeps after 5 minutes of inactivity, but this is simply not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"I also made the mistake of buying this mouse","review":"Like a lot of other people on this site I have to give the targus mouse 1 star... I made the mistake of buying it from a store before checking out the reviews on Amazon, and other places.. It seemed great, but the auto-sleep that everyone is talking about just destroys the usefulness of the mouse ( yes it really goes into sleep after 5-7 seconds, people are not joking). I thought I could live with it, but after only 2 days I had to go buy another mouse...I ended up buying the Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse instead, and it works great....Trust me and the others on the site, the delay is very, very annoying.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Mouse","review":"Great feel and features. Unfortunately it is not useable. Ditto all comments about losing connection. Do not waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"gets stuck","review":"I don't know if mine was defective, but if you left it alone for 3 seconds then it would get stuck, or go to sleep, I don't know what was happening, but you would have to move it around for a second to make it start working again. Other than that it seemed like a great mouse, but that defect was so incredibly annoying I returned it and can only give it 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it to work","review":"I ordered this mouse as it's feature set seemed great! I didn't check the reviews here before ordering (I used some AMEX points) but really wish I would have.From day one, the green light comes on, seemingly with a mind of it's own. I've never been able to get the mouse to get picked up by any of my Macs or Windows laptops, it simple hasn't worked at all.Unfortunately (for me) I went on vacation and by the time i got back, the return period had expired and so basically I have a mouse that doesn't work.Bottom line: Don't buy this mouse, it sucks and has some serious flaws, even though some people here did manage to get it to work. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Worst Mouse Ever DONT BUY","review":"In spite of everything negative that had been written in other reviews about this mouse, I took a chance on it anyway because it was rechargeable and had a nice form factor.Well, it connected a total of 2 times to my computer's via bluetooth. It would then sleep after a few seconds of no use and would not come back to life for a few more seconds. Then after a few minutes of use like this, it stopped connecting altogether, even though it had fully charged batteries.Again, basically everything negative written about this mouse in the reviews came true for me. Save yourself the trouble, DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"This mouse sucks","review":"I tried to use this mouse with my laptop at school, and the thing wouldn't stay connected for any amount of time. I had to keep repairing it to make it work again and it would just stop working after a few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"This mouse brought nothing but trouble. For one it has terrible battery life, however it's easy enough to plug it into the computer and recharge (you can still use it as it is charging). Also, it disconnects after about 10 seconds of not using it. You have to shake it and it connects in about a second or two. I know that doesn't sound bad, but it gets annoying. My dad got one too. His came as a Gateway mouse (nice, right?) and now appears broken after a month of use. On the up side, it was cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with OS-X Lion","review":"First, the product displayed is shown as Targus, but the product I received was branded Gateway. It was, however, a Targus AMB03 OEM device. It is also a bit larger than I expected, but not full size.The mouse would not pair with my MacBook Air running Lion, so after troubleshooting I contacted Targus support via chat. I was informed that this model is NOT supported under Lion. The agent double-checked and then stated \\"The only mice that are verified compatible wtih Mac OS Lion are as follows. AMB09, AMU75, AMU76, AMU80, AMU89, AMW50, AMW51, AMW55, AMW56, AMU81 and AMU83\\"I am returning this device and will buy a Logitech.

Now my laptop won't even recognize its signal. I've tried re-installing, changing batteries, etc...but to no avail. My advice is to look elsewhere and stay away form this product.

I haven't compared it to other LP forced air heaters, if there are any, but ones that use diesel/kero burn much cleaner and it's no where close to a catalytic block style heater.

The fluid is just distilled water and is not anti-static, the felt pad takes ages to dry for a second session of cleaning and in combination with the water does a poor job. Try it if you want 3 needles, but you'll be looking for something else to clean records with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself money","review":"Ordered this for my Grandma. It came in a timely manner but she was not happy. You are paying close to $40 for a wooden block with some material on it, 3 plastic needles and a tiny bottle of distilled water (literally). The bottle that comes in the package doesn't say \\"cleaning solution\\". It says, \\"distilled water\\". Save yourself some money and buy just the needles. You can buy distilled water for $1 at the grocery store and a piece of soft fabric from you local craft store for next to nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it says it is","review":"I got this for my wife for Christmas this past year, as our original turntable was handed down from her grandmother and was beginning to insist on not working anymore. We entertain quite a bit, have a good collection of vinyls from older artists (Count Basie) to modern (Vampier Weekend, Modest Mouse), and decided we wanted something that would encompass all of our musical tastes. Looks great too.Definitely recommend it. Some reviews have mentioned that the volume doesn't meet their preferences.

I used to use another brand made by our natural store chain that was orange flavored and it tasted divine. I was forced to purchase this more expensive product one day when the store brand was sold out. This stuff tastes disgusting. Yes, it tastes like pina colada, but nasty, rotting, fermented pina colada. Ignore the instructions on the bottle to mix it with water and drink it. That just prolongs the suffering.

I was expecting something similar to Kinky Boots- a funny story with a message underneath, but this just made me depressed! The acting was great, but I really did not find this to be funny in any way. Bree's story was touching, but I found little growth in her son (Toby's)story. I felt dirty by the end of the movie (not by the TG issue- by Toby's life within the sex industry).Basically, this movie had great acting and the stars deserve praise for this. But this is by no means a comedy in my book. By the end of the movie I felt depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Impressed","review":"I thought the acting in this movie was wonderful. It was what I thought it would be but it just did not do anyhting for me. I wasn't impressed with it at all.

It's all a bit too \\"Wong Foo\\", if you know what I mean. If you need to pat yourself on the back for being open-minded, then this is the film for you. Me, I'll be rewatching _Hedwig and the Angry Inch_ for the umpteenth time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with the cover art?","review":"This is the Transamerica DVD, not the Desperate Housewives DVD! Why have the glamourous picture of Felicity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than I thought it would be","review":"Despite a script that has everything but the kitchen sink thrown in, Transamerica still manages to pull off the impossible. On any given weekday, the characters in this film could be found on the Jerry Springer show and you would just be left shaking your head at the screen. However, the strong performance given not only by Hoffman but the entire cast successfully draws you into this strange story. I truely like this road trip much more than Little Miss Sunshine and am glad I took a chance in watching it. Highly Recommeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This movie was great. I must admit, I was skeptical at first, but the more we learned about the characters (especially Stanley/Bree) the more I loved the movie. It was about finding yourself and acceptance, but not the way you think. I think that the tolerance the Bree showed her/his son and the love that was given, unconditionally, spoke volumes about her character. And this movie also taught me that the things that you want most in life may not complete you the way that you think.I can't really review this one without giving away spoilers....BTW - Until I watched the bonus features I had no idea that Bree was being played by a woman.

There was a lot of buzz about Felicity Huffman's performance, and certainly a lot should be said about her poignant portrayal. Without Huffman there wouldn't be a movie; however, the script is amazing too. There are twists and turns to the plot, and just when you think the characters have hit their lowest point, they manage to do something even more heartbreaking. This movie is an experience to be partaken. And maybe, in the process of watching this film, we all learn something about each other and those around us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing team should be ashamed","review":"Inappropriate use of Ms. Huffman's television persona in the cover art to market this film.

It did well in portraying several issues that transgender people face. However, it was not the most accurate movie.

The tunes are OK, but i'm sure they could have almost randomly picked any good live performances and slapped them together on a disc and have a commercial success. My main beef with this album is that they include the Zero yang to the exclusion of the Zero yin. They include the chord progressions, lyrics, and set up the song, then at 5:30 they fade out, leaving the listener deprived of the jams. Kinda like listening to Skeletons in the Closet.

The poems again and again invoke the great modernist arts of jazz and photography as grand, continuous, integrative conceits. As one explores the work's peculiar synesthetic depths, one finds oneself drawn back and forth from poem to poem, sensing a life's worth of reading, listening, thinking, and feeling condensed in them. One poem in particular haunts, \\"A Simple Metaphor.\\" Where in our time has poetry come so close to the Poundian ideal, \\"language charged with meaning to the utmost possible extent,\\" so close to fixing life itself in words we can speak?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book! It is great for a beginner!","review":"I bought this book because I am studying astrology, and I needed to look up some words I didn't know the meanings of because, you can't find them in a regualar dictionary or encyclopedia. But it also lays out a step by step guide to how to begin studying astrology. He writes a list of which things to look up in what order for you to be able to understand it best. It really is a great book and I recommend it to anyone studying astrology. Or anyone even interested in learning more about your horoscope you see every day in the paper, but never knew what the terms meant. It is a really fun subject to explore and I love this book!This book also has a lot of beautiful illustrations.

I really don't know how old some of you are or what ethnic background you are from, but this type of music is typical for a young West Indian male to make for this day and age. I am of West Indian descent and also twice his age and I think this young man is very talented. He will have a second, third and hopefully a fourth album. I hope he continues to use his West Indian roots and work with his uncle Buju and others like Elephant Man, Beenie, Sean P, Sizzla, Machel Montano, Rupee, Rihanna and all of my Caribbean Bredren and Sistren.

His lyricism on \\"Beautiful Girls\\" is so pathetic that it makes Weird Al Yankovic seem almost serious, and of course there's the issue of the sample, which is never a good idea in the first place but especially bad here, because there was never a damn thing wrong with \\"Stand By Me\\" by Ben E. King (who should be having a huge fit every time he hears this).

Unfortunately, he fails.Not that it takes much musical talent to be a pop star now-a-days, but hearing the main song from this album, I had expected more from the rest of the album.

This guy has no vocal range at all, he is fat n fugly as hell, its really sickenin to see people that think this is real music. The only thing that this guy has is catchy annoying slogans. And the fact that this guy is related to the great Bob Marley is truly unbelievable, u have a legend like Bob Marley and u have this guy.......its obvious that not only hip hop is falling but also reggae music. a lot of people are goin to hate me but f887 ya'll, this is the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it now!","review":"Finally a CD worth every penny!

Don't expect a big lather with this in fact, it's actually a good thing it doesn't lather too much (it's just right) because that can be drying to your skin just as they say you don't want an uber soapy shampoo that lathers too much because that can strip the oils from your hair drying it out.

Second it has a weird smell. Third it doesn't work. I'm delusional in thinking that a few months using the product will suddenly make my fine lines disappear but there is no difference at all.

The concept of this cleanser is great; it sounded perfect for people like me in their late twenties or early thirties who still deal with mild acne. However, my skin immediately started to break out. I continued using it for about a month hoping that my skin just needed time to adjust, but it just got worse. I didn't get any of those deep, painful zits, but I did develop small bumps all over my forehead. Also, my skin just didn't feel clean after using it. I agree with others who said it was slimy and would slide right off your fingers into the sink. I did find, however, that if you rub it around in your hand to create a small froth first, you can avoid that problem. I guess one positive of this cleanser is that it didn't dry out my skin like Proactiv. Alas, the search continues..."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"I've used it for 2 months. Does not work.

I use Neutrogena products and normally love them but the anti-wrinkle moisturizer or whatever clogged my pours and caused me to break out only in the places I used it. It does warn of this on the package and claims that if you keep using it the break outs will go away - after a month, I really don't think they're going to. I didn't notice any change in wrinkles - I'm only 33 so it's not like I have a ton but I swear the one I have which concerns me (around my mouth) actually got worse.

I prefer not to use products with sodium laurel sulfate, either. I'm a mid life person, but still fight the occasional whitehead and greasy face mid-day.This product was AWFUL. It made me break out in huge pustules, and also made my face very tight and dry at the same time. It's taken almost a month without it to get back to normal.And folks weren't kidding about the creepy smell. Closest I could describe it is like hospital smell, or purell.

They don't hang together as a unit, nor move smoothly or logically from one to the next. The instrumentation is flat and unimaginitive, unlike the first CD, where every note sang.It's a mish-mash of whatever was in the cupboard - and the cupboard was pretty bare.It's the first time I've fast-forwarded past a previously unheard song on a new CD - and I did that on several. The title track is bloody awful. Again, hit the FF button once it got to the speech bits.

I had read a previous customer review on this site and almost didn't read this book because of the negativity. All I can say is that she must have been female. As an educator of 33 years who is vitally concerned about the growing gender gap in boys' literacy in our schools, I am glad that I did. This slim volume certainly carries with it keys that could unlock a boy's mind to the possibilities of the written (and spoken) word.

The poetry has little to no thought in it. At least they could be humourous, but they're not even that.

It's a fine studio recording, 100% done in Havana's Egrem studio, from two sessions in the 1980's and 1990's. Great liner notes in what is a simple product package added to what Acosta had already said about the band in his book. A laid back Iraquere, in three words.

Highlights include \\"Heimlich Maneuver\\" which turns a \\"Rescue 911\\" segment into a humorous, funky song with a James Brown-esque breakdown, and \\"Truckloads of Bibles\\" which pokes fun at protestant missionary tactics.Other songs offer intelligent commentary, including \\"Turk Song\\" which begins with a sample of Ronald Reagan, but then goes into various quotes from Thoreau's \\"Civil Disobedience\\" read by an Irishman. There's also \\"Beyond Names and Forms\\" which consists mostly of samples of Joseph Campbell, the theologian.This is not an album of music in any traditional sense, but I've owned it for several years and have always enjoyed it immensely. If you like The Books, then this would probably be a good addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"people please!","review":"This has got to be the most poor pop artist out there.

The handle is also the right length. However, I could not tell from the picture that the handle is metal, not solid. Using a handle that is essentially a piece of thick wire bent in two feels uncomfortable and unbalanced in your hand. It also makes unwieldy to use. If I had known the handle was actually a metal loop instead of a solid material, I would have never purchased it. Because I like the brush head, I just wrapped the handle in duct tape. Not a perfect fix, but better than the original design of the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"I have really bad dark circles under my eyes, I think its just genetics and was hoping this would work but I really dont see to much of a difference. i think it would work for someone whos dark circles arent as bad or just have the puffy eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Hype!","review":"This product was without a doubt the single most misleading product I have ever used.

I can't imagine that anyone who has watched this far into the series hasn't been sold on it yet but I know some people who weren't wild about the first story arc so if the series lost you early, this is another great chance to get back into it with minimal information to play catch up on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butterfly Corkscrew","review":"My daughter called and asked if I had a corkscrew as her husband had broken theirs and before she bought a new one, she wanted to see if I had a spare.

She said it was well made, solid, and the gears meshed well. Everything is metal with no plastic parts. It works perfectly. She said it feels like it will last a long time - not like her previous one that was of poor quality and one of the gears cracked.

I own both, and found Mechelle's Way 1 to be confusing and disorienting: the workout is taped with Mechelle Smith's voice dubbed over the routine. It's obvious that the voice you hear does not fit Mechelle's mouth moving in the video, and sometimes the moves are ahead of her instructions. I found this distracting, and did not get a good workout. BUY MECHELLE'S WAY 2 INSTEAD -- it's FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitness thru self defense","review":"This is a great video. I have recommended Mechelle's Way to several friends. While working out with this video for the past 3 months, Mechelle's pacing and words of encourgement throughout the session have made me feel like I have a personal coach training me and keeping the routines alive. The exercises push you to a certain point and then move on to the next muscle group. The repetitive cardio-kickboxing moves help you to develop a natural response instinct. It motivates me to concentrate and improve each time I do the workout because I know I am learning new skills. This is not an ordinary exercise video, it is helping me to build agility, strength and confidence. Mechelle\\"s Way is in my VCR 4x a week, while other fitness videos I own are collecting dust somewhere. You owe it to yourself to try this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt, the best book on competitive shooting.","review":"I've shot with Mr. Enos (hell I even beat him once, with a ton of luck), and I kinda grew up with him as a shooting guide. This book should be called \\"Practical Shooting: The Bible.\\" It covers the fundamentals early on, and no not the fundamentals such as how to grip the gun or how to draw, but how to *think* and *view* shooting through your awareness and thought processes. This is the major difference between Enos and all the other greats, even TGO himself. Enos knows how to *think* shooting, and this book helps you get there too. I would recommend it to the D class shooter just getting started, the C class working on moving on up, or the M looking to perfect the art.I'm picking it up just to refresh my skills, it's one you can read every few years and still learn something from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I had got a copy years ago and misplaced it, I decided to get another one recently. I have learned and developed my shooting to a higher level and this book was the basis for it. I dont think there is one book I could recommend more to someone at any level of shooting. All the reviews should tell anyone to not pass it up. Thank you Mr Enos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is an outstanding book by a shooting master, it improved my skills a great deal. Its so good, I've referred to it several times.

The text in this disorganized book just rambles and rambles, to the point where so far I can't stand to read it long enough to learn from it. This may be a problem with me as much as the book, but I have this voice in the background constantly saying \\"Man, get to the point!\\" when I try to read it.I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Essential reading if you want to know both the mindset and physical skills required to excel in this great sport"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside the Mind of a Shooting Genius","review":"Brian Enos is one of a select few people who changed the sport of practical shooting forever. He just wasn't successful; HE CHANGED THE WAY WE DO THINGS! This book is your opportunity to get into his head. That said, this isn't so much a nuts and bolts \\"how to\\" book; this book deals more with the mental aspects. Also, you'll get more out of the book if you've been shooting for a while.One of the most interesting ways to use this book might be to read it once earlier in your shooting career and then read it again when you've reached another stage in development."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you care about speed & accuracy, read this book","review":"Many shooting books give technical advise on the best postion, grip etc... This book does include some technical advise, but mostly it pulls you out of the technical mind. \\"Freeing\\" your mind to take in the whole environment, and noticing all the things you do when you are shooting ( good and bad ). Once you can clearly see the big picture, you can start fixing & impoving details.I'm only half way through the book and I now see how much room for impovement I have. This is an excelent book, anyone who really cares about technique, speed and accuracy should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different Type of Shooting Book!","review":"I was looking for a good book on shooting; beyond the basic mechanics that most books cover. This book certainly fills that requirement. First of all, this is not like any other book I have come across on the subject. Brian Enos is describing a freedom in shooting that most of us who are struggling with the mechanics of shooting can't yet understand- but he does show the way. The approach has definitely helped with my mental approach to shooting- the strongest attribute of this book. There are also a lot of fine points about the mechanics of the presentation, grip, sight picture, etc. that are offered that will help fine tune your shooting, but not until you have the fundamentals well ingrained. I would describe this as an introspective approach to shooting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This is an interesting book, but it is not exactly what I was looking for. In some ways, I feel the title is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stock photography plus text","review":"If you are looking for a gift for a father-to-be, please don't get them this book.

Why the heck did I move away? But after leaving the islands, the love for the island way of life leads invariably to nostalgia, and that's where \\"Hapa\\" makes its place in my life.This CD gives me serenity and peace of mind when I'm stressed or otherwise just looking for a way to reconnect with all the beauty that is Hawai'i. The smooth sounds of Barry and Keli'i are so melifluous and peaceful that, however fast-paced and crazy life gets on the Mainland, you can close your eyes, listen to the island rhythms, and swear that the smell of the Pacific surf returns to you, with its instant ability to calm.I have spent many a night in bed drifting off to this CD. It truly is a must-have for anyone who wants to be able to experience the beauty and tranquility of Hawaiian music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indescribably Beautiful","review":"I first heard the music from this CD on a helicopter tour of the NaPali coast on Kauai. They piped the music in through the headphones and I was entranced. The scenery and music are eternally linked in my mind now and both are breathtaking.I have several Hapa CDs, but this one is BY FAR MY FAVORITE. I was living in Atlanta when I visited Hawaii and first heard the music. Upon returning, as soon as I bought a copy of this CD I'm certain my neighbors wondered at the music from next door. I called everyone I knew and played it for them over the phone. I just wanted to share this amazing music.Melodic, harmonious, relaxing and energizing both at the same time.

I bought these for a stereo setup to listen to music 90% of the time and to watch movies the rest of the time. I'm something of an audiophile with a Pro-Ject turntable and a Harmon-Kardon receiver. I listen to a wide variety of music from jazz to hip hop to punk and heavy metal on vinyl, cds and mp4s. I will say these speakers do have a lot of bass with the dual 8inch woofers, but it sounds muddy and clumsy. The highs are distorted and the mids are weak. the overall sound of these lacks warmth. I ended up going with Polk Monitor 60s. For only a little more dough these are a world of difference.The JBL speakers look ridiculous too. They look kinda cool in the picture but once you see them in person they are huge (10 x 40 x 15\\"), the silver looks like imitation aluminum, and the silver grilles are really cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great experience.","review":"I was concerned about purchasing through a third party source however everything went very well!

I'm just not a Shortcake fan. My attention was yanked back when I heard a character in this episode use the word \\"hate\\" multiple times. Most of the S.S. videos are good, but I threw this one out. My daughter will most likely be exposed to hate in many other places. I don't need to hear it on her children's videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE- quality control issues!","review":"These are sweet and cute videos, but watch out! The quality on many of them are horrible. I now have three SS dvd's that appear shaky and the movements of the characters appear choppy and disjointed (the first time we watched it!), yet when I try to exchange them, the new copy is the same. In most cases I am stuck, since many stores do not accept returns on dvd's, only exchanges. My daughters are huge fans of these videos and toys, but I don't think I will purchase the videos again.

Both stories revolve around characters who are behaving very badly in their whole attitudes. Eventually the characters learn their lessons but they have a lot of temper tantrums in the mean time. Unfortunately these bad tempered mouthy little girls are the ones my daughter has decided to model and now when she's mad she recites these tantrums back at me word for word. So we don't watch these anymore. She does like them though. I'm sorry to have had to take them away.

I bought it after I discovered the $20 FSO guide straight from the registration site was just a practice test, but now I know I was better off with the first one. This book is full of badly phrased questions, spelling/grammar errors, and a few things that aren't even applicable to the subject matter based on the two official practice tests I've taken. It's not updated for the new format of the test either, as a previous reviewer mentioned. The only potentially useful thing about it is the Oral Assessment Guide, which demystified the process a bit for me.Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book is awful. I took the FSOT twice and have a solid background in international relations. I thought surely with my education and just reviewing this study guide I'd be fine. Wrong, I failed. Everyone I saw going into the testing room had a copy too, so if the vast majority of test takers are still failing the exam obviously this isn't that big of a help. Honestly, the material is just too basic and incomplete to really prepare you for the FSOT. This wasn't even worth the $6 I paid. I rented other FSOT books, the few that there are, from the library and they're not much better. So I guess in a sea of awful this is the best. However, if you're serious about passing (and I hope this is allowed) I wouldn't waste my time and just spend the money on a course from fsotprep.com . I spent 2 weeks with their course and passed with a VERY high score finally. I'm now preparing for the second round of interviews. I can't recommend them highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"False sense of security.......","review":"This study manual's only saving grace is its grammar section; otherwise, you can find something better. Truth be known, the FSOT is a 3-hour exam that I completed upon appointment at a testing center and it was a myriad of standard questions that cannot really be studied for. Why? The multiple-choice test covers several current events and past historical events, including a map section and a one-essay section. The section on biographical information was difficult as you only get 30-40 words per questionaire section.The most challenging section on the FSOT? Grammar and essay hands down. Get yourself a literature/grammar textbook and study THAT as well.

The camera and sound were far better than most bellydance DVDs and you could clearly see the moves and understand what was being portrayed.

The first half of the DVD (it seemed like about 3 hours, but was probably 45 minutes) consists of Ms Tigue seated, unmoving, with folded hands, staring directly into the camera and reciting a carefully memorized lecture. The camera angle never changes. To be fair, Ms Tigue articulates well, and she does not abuse the English language as do so many nowadays. But, several times, I found my mind wandering, and I'm afraid I didn't retain a great deal.In the second half of the video, Ms Brown demonstrates cooking techniques and recipes, while Ms Tigue nods approvingly. In this segment they employ a second camera positioned slightly higher to demonstrate chopping and mixing and slicing. Ms Brown also articulates well, but overworks the word, \\"actually\\".I'm sure the stars of this show are competent and perhaps even talented, but they should have hired an equally able film maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bond game next to Goldeneye!","review":"This is one of my favorite titles that the Gameboy had to offer. Not a 007 fan? do not fret. This game is unique for a bond game because it uses a Zelda/RPG formula rather than your typical FPS (First-person shooter) game, which in my opinion is a very neat and different approach. Most of the game you will find yourself collecting items, discovering secrets, solving clues, and fighting bosses. The game has a decent storyline and casts iconic characters from the series along with music inspired by the films' theme song which adds a nice touch. This is definitely one to add to your gameboy collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"james bond 007 from Sayda","review":"okay i like the game but they are VERY MISLEADING(lying) about the shipping price. i paid 3.99 for shipping but on the package it say it cost 0.44.... am i mad about them price gouging? no because even if the price really was 4.70 i still would have bought it. none the less shipment was fast and the game is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mop for Small Bathroom","review":"This mop is great for a small bathroom.

Luke Breit has pulled off a wholly engaging romp through the Second Coming - only this time instead of a hardened tax collector, His best buddy is an agnostic political consultant. With a great deal of sly humor that the author uses well to serve his very serious observations, and some unexpectedly moving sweetness, the story moves along at a crisp clip to an end that is thoroughly satisfying to those of us who object to a certain political party's self-defined stranglehold on the approval of the Almighty."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, completely different from the movie","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation, so finally I found a copy of the book and was real excited.

The only thing the two have in common is partially the bird hunting trip, and the fact that a man named Mr. Hobbs took his family on a vacation, but the similarities end there.

She is not some pre-packaged record label product....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, terrible mastering","review":"This review is limited to the recent two-CD remaster. Calling the Wild remains one of Doro Pesch's better releases. The music runs mainly toward melodic hard rock with a few ballads, and one cover song. Unfortunately, this edition was undercut by appallingly poor mastering. The main problem with the engineering is that the bass tones are raised so high in the mix that they completely dominate the songs, almost drowning out Doro's vocals. There is also too much compression and bass distortion, so that the instrumental backdrop becomes an undifferentiated mass of sound. Even on the acoustic tracks, the bass is up so high that the vocals and lead guitar are almost buried. By comparison, the original version of this CD, which has much better sound quality, rates four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doro fan from the beginning","review":"I have loved Doro since I first heard her with \\"All We Are\\" on what used to be HeadBangers Ball..........This album is first rate Doro, her vocal style bekons to the wild in us all......check her first albums...you'll love them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-documented and exhaustive","review":"Jerry Clark has demonstrated himself to be the leading historian of UFOlogy with the two editions of his UFO Encyclopedia.

I can hardly believe that the most famous case of a \\"UFO landing\\" has little material, while he describes the Hill case (less witnesses) in such a detail.This book is too expensive for what it offers.

This CD is insulting to me(not to mention very tacky sounding), because I am someone who thinks that the 20's style JAZZ Ukelele player/singer needs to be preserved(the music of Cliff Edwards, et. al.). One person who is doing it very well in the 20's tradition is Janet Klein & Her Parlor Boys, she can play the Uke(I don't mean Hawaiian style, I mean ragtime, and jazz) and she sings in the Annette Hanshaw, and Jane Green tradition.

It will detect K band radar only when you are within 400 feet of the gun. It is virtually useless in detecting Ka band unless you're within 50 feet of the gun. It also falsely detects Ka band very frequently especially on sunny days when it has been sitting on the dashboard for 15 minutes. The laser detector also goes off quite often. The X band detector went off so often in business areas (even with the x band sensitivity set to poor in city mode) that I disabled it.Escort advertises the following on their website:\\"Long-range warning for all radar signals: including \\"instant-on\\" X-band, K-band, and SuperWide Ka-band. Patented Digital SignalProcessing provides long-range warning distances, without increased false alarms.\\"I guess their definition of \\"long range\\" is a few hundred feet.So save your money and don't waste it on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent electronics, with a useless mounting scheme","review":"While the detection features work well, the -hardware- (I use the term loosely) used to mount the contraption to your windshield is poorly designed. The design flaw is a failure to account for the earth's pesky gravity feature. The mechanism uses an L-shaped bracket. The lower end slips into the top of the detector and upper end has suction cups that attached to the windshield. The lower end depends upon an upward force (unobtainable by normal methods) to hold slits in the bracket against bars on the bottom of the housing. It would work much better if the bars were on the top, then gravity would be your friend. This results in the eventual inability to mount the damnable contraption. However, the electronics work very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an average detector","review":"My first detector was a Bel 890, i enjoyed its ditgal voice message, free the drive from have to look at the detector. I only bought this one because it was a cordless and thinking it would make driving in VA or DC easier. Little did i know that a cordless has far less detection range. The difference in the range with or without the optional cord is like night and day. So i had to purchase the optional coiled power cord. I would recommend anyone who wants a detector with the cord out of sight to by a normal detector with straight power cord or direct connection cord and not this cordless detector.

Sometimes BBW stuff is so overpowering, you know? It is very creamy, NOT greasy at all, and lasts all day! I even use it to moisturize my face because it doesn't irritate my skin.The best part is the price: the large 21 oz. pump bottle is usually around $8 or less, and it lasts for at least a couple months! Compared to an 8 oz. bottle of BBW lotion for $11, you're getting 2.5x the product for around 30% less! You can even do what I do: put a squirt of Jergens and a squirt of BBW and apply them together.

I like the snaps vs. velcro that I have had on other towels like this and it's a good size but still lightweight enough to carry in a gym bag. However, it only comes in white and due to the nature of the fabric, EVERTHING sticks to it and doesn't come off. If you have pets, this towel will inevitably become covered in cat or dog hair. Anything else that may be on your carpet/bed/furniture is also going to stick to it. Also, the feel of the fabric before you have washed it several times is kind of creepy. It kind of sticks to the skin on your hands, especially around your cuticles unless you have just moisturized.

Regardless, I still wish that I could be here to hear it all. The artwork fits the tale perfectly, which is a rare thing. Not since \\"The Adventures Of Captain Jack,\\" by MIKE KAZALEH went out of print have I read such an entertaining book. Not since Gaiman's \\"Sandman\\" have I read one so thought-provoking. Truly worthy of the term \\"Graphic Storytelling.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful beginning to an excellent series!","review":"This is the first collection of a b&w comic that is simply excellent. An epic fantasy that lacks a sense of pretentiousness towards the topic. A marvelous story, told well. The art is similar in some ways to Miyazaki (Nausicaa) -- simple, manga faces that express volumes. The backgrounds of the city and surrounding areas are incredibly done, both in detail and design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering and mazelike","review":"I tried to follow the story here but it seemed to constantly veer off in other directions. There's magic and fantasy and time travel and psi-hunters and the names...why do authors feel compelled to create words that cannot be either pronounced or remembered? Za'arain, Jhoramon, Szarth, Xtian, Kiriy.The story involves concepts like live time and dead time and people(?) who could control one of these and who - guess what - fall in love. We are also dealing with a prophecy that has been around since the dawn of the Universe it seems and all this becomes a hopeless mishmash toward the end. Not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it because of the author ...","review":"I have everything she has written under all of her names and let me tell you, THIS IS THE WORST! I like to read just about anything and I love Sci-FI, Fantasy, and Romance. But, I just couldn't get through this one. I tried multiple times and finally today I decided it had to be me, so I went on line to see what others thought to make sure. I got 3/4 of the way through it this time and I still don't understand it. I like the concept that another reviewer explained to me, but I don't know how they derived that from this collection of unpronounciable, unexplained, lengthy composition. Save yourself a headache and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish there were more futuristic titles by this author.","review":"Hi, I've read several of Ann Maxwell/Elizabeth Lowell's books, but the books that I've enjoyed most were the FUTURISTIC ones. I really enjoyed them because most \\"futuristic\\" romance writers just transfer the me-babarian, you-sex-slave approach found in historicals to a different planet and call it \\"futuristic.\\" I really enjoyed the Ann Maxwell futuristic books because the heroine was strong and admirable instead of some wimp who would sell her freedom for good sex. Once again, I would like to say that I really wish that Ann Maxwell would write more FUTURISTIC books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for newbies without the headaches of C or VB .net!!!!","review":"The idiot that gave this book a one star and screams that you should learn a \\"real\\" programming language is a total moron and misses the point entirely. This book is not about teaching you program languages like C/C++ or VB .net or how to make $100K a year. It is meant to teach you the basics of programming in a fun way by using games as examples. If you have no experience and pick up a book on C++ or .Net or Java, etc. you will quickly become overwhelmed, you will lose your interest and quit. This author prevents that from happening to you!!Get this book, learn the basics, have fun and use this inexpensive book to help you decide if you want to spend a lot more money pursuing your dream.

My biggest issue is that you cannot run the programs from the book on another computer. If you want to do that, you have to log on to their web site and pay a lot of money for it. The fact is that I can get a semi-professional IDE from Microsoft's web page for free. This will compile and create EXEs that I can run on any computer. I can also program in C++ which is the language that almost all video games are programmed in. Microsoft's IDE also has an excellent debugger. If you are serious about game programming, or programming in general, I recommend learning and practicing on the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"Haven't read the book - but the intro chapter I can see online tells me this 'BlitzMax' language requires you to buy the compiler from the author's website to get the full capabilities. Otherwise you can't really make programs, game or otherwise, except on your own machine. And I see from a few other comments here that the demo (limited) version of BlitzMax that comes with the book expires after a few uses?! This isn't mentioned anywhere in the book's description...I'm a programmer myself, shopping for an intro text for my nephew. You can get a free compiler for just about any modern programming language - no one should have to pay for a compiler. I can only guess that the author wrote the book to help sell his BlitzMax compiler.

In reality you get some limited time shareware and have to purchase another $80 to $100 dollars of software from the author. In reality this gets to be an expensive proposition.

The top shelf was covered with brown stains that looked almost like burn marks. I ended up throwing the shelf out just to be safe.

We are making a small secure cubby and plan to bolt it through the bulkhead to a stainless steel backing plate.

Perhaps we don't learn enough about him to be able to ward off uncomfortable feelings. An older man who allows unwanted teenagers to live in his house without paying rent?

I did go through my two-year old's toy box and got rid of all the toys that don't require any imagination, and his ability to stay with one activity increased dramatically.However, I wouldn't recommend this book because I feel that his advice is archaic and unsubstantiated. He recommends making your child feel like he or she is no longer the center of your life, that you are the center of theirs. I see his point, but I have a hard time with that. What's wrong with a child feeling so important to a parent? Also, I'm just not comfortable with letting him roam the house unsupervised for extended periods of time.

She said that the author promotes numerous \\"old-school\\" practices, including letting toddlers cry to exhaustion and spanking (instead of using natural consequences and/or talking when behavior problems occur). She did say that there was one decent chapter that discussed research on birth order and child spacing. Fortunately, I bought a used copy that she can recycle with her old newspapers. There are so many other approaches to child-rearing that promote cooperation, responsibility, and self-control in little kids--WITHOUT spanking. Please don't rely on this author's advice. Fear of getting hit by a large person probably works well, but that should NOT be how to teach a young child how to behave--e.g., spanking him/her while loudly stating, \\"Don't hit your sister!\\" (A little hypocritical, huh?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"He thinks spanking is OK","review":"While I have to admit I did get a few good ideas from this book, when he started talking about when it's OK to spank, I couldn't believe it. Then he went on to suggest a few pages later that you allow the babysitter to go about 50 yards in the car with your child not buckled in (when they were discussing a problem with the toddler not wanting to get in the car seat with a car pooler).

Sorry Mr. Rosmond, but things weren't all that peachy 70 years ago. And the world we live in today is a far different one from the pre-WWII era you idealize in your book. The author is totally dismissive of any and all modern ideas about parenting. His outright condemnation of daycare and casual acceptance of \\"popping\\"/hitting a child turned me off completely. If you're looking for some helpful advice on dealing with the challenge of teaching a two year old to (eventually) become a responsible, considerate and happy person, then keep looking. You won't find find it in this reactionary tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti love and family","review":"If you have any respect for the loving bond between a parent and child do not purchase this book for any advice. The author makes negative remarks against several respected childcare experts including Dr. Sears.

He makes psychologists seem like a worthless bunch of idiots. I was enraged after reading only the first chapter. Trust your God given intuition Not this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"making the terrible twos terrific","review":"What a sad idea of parenting. This expert would have us think that nurturing involves abuse (even subtle abuse). Spanking, leaving a baby to scream until he tires and no longer trusts his parent and other power over tequniques will not change the world into a peaceful place but further a divisive culture.

The very thing that makes Hellboy so beautiful, the simplicity and elegance of design, means that looking at a Mignola sketch is exactly like looking at a finished comic book panel, except you can see the India ink brush marks in the black areas, and there is no supporting narrative thrust to give the picture meaning. The same goes for his pencils (of which there are few included- I don't think this guy makes a mark on paper without inking and publishing it). There is not even a discussion of Mignola's sources or inspirations, no bibliography of the occult (oh, I forgot, we're living in post-literate America).

It wouldbecome one of the most popular songs ever and recorded by hundreds ofdifferent artists in the past fifty years. Los Lobos' version made it tonumber 1 for 3 consecutive weeks. Ten years earlier these guys recordeda number of traditional Mexican songs like La Bamba called \\"Just another bandfrom East L.A.\\" whose original tapes have been recuperated in 2000.What a treasure! Beautiful songs from ranchera to bolero and fromjarocho to a traditional Bolivian and Cuban song. An incredible bandstill making great music today as Los Lobos or taking part in projects or groupslike the wonderful Los Super Seven."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I bought this pan for my daughter's birthday party. I decided to test it out prior to the \\"event\\" and I'm glad I did! I used Pam, but the cake totally stuck. I then tried it again (boxed mix, both times) and lined each individual section with parchment paper (a REAL PAIN), PAM'd that, and it was a little better.Now, my daughter has her heart set on a butterfly cake, and I'm going to have to make this work out somehow. I will try it with a cake from scratch, as suggested by another reviewer...hopefully it will help! This pan is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes cute cupcakes.","review":"This product is very fun for kids. I tried it the first day I got it with just a boxed cake mix and I only sprayed the pan a little with PAM. The cake stuck and it was very difficult to get out of the pan. The second time I used it, I made a homemade carrot cake and sprayed a lot of PAM on the pan. I think the pan needs a more dense cake such as a homemade cake, opposed to a boxed cake mix. The carrot cake came right out at the first try. My kids loved to help decorate the cake. It was fun for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the typical user","review":"I was hoping that this book would provide the typical user with more insight into using excel efficiently. I consider myself to be computer savy and have used excel for years. I felt like this was aimed more at people who had more of a computer programming background.

The math behind isn't that complicated (it's actually all sumarized in his equation 1.13 on page 31).For the people having trouble to apply this method on backtested results, I advise Thomas Stridsman his book (How to build winning trading systems).

She likes lilies.2. Because it had a cord instead of a metal chain (some metals cause an allergic reaction).As another reviewer mentioned, the pendant is heavy, but I kind of like it that way...it doesn't feel cheap or shoddy, and my wife has never complained of its weight.However, reason #2 for buying the necklace is nullified because the back of the pendant itself is a cast metal; the stem of the flower extends around the bottom of the pendant and is held in place by this metal casting. My wife solved this problem by coating the back with clear nail polish so the metal doesn't directly contact her skin. I just wish that more sellers would include pictures of ALL sides of their jewelry, even if it isn't pretty.But with that problem taken care of, my wife loves the necklace and I'm rather impressed with it myself.

She isn't preachy and you don't need to be a history major to get the point and follow the story. Her use of the same main characters and setting in Seneca Falls makes you feel at home with each book. I find these mysteries a welcome change."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining historical mystery","review":"Set in Seneca Falls, NY, at the time of the first Women's Rights Convention of 1848, author Miriam Monfredo has chosen a particularly intriguing setting for her mystery series starring librarian Glynis Tryon. Monfredo introduces a lot of information about women's rights, the area and the lifestyle of the times without awkwardness, and the book is readable for that alone. The heroine and her friends are realistic and likeable, though Glynis is definitely not a confident feminist, and I look forward to reading other books in the series to see if this changes. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the most famous resident of the town, is not a main character but she does show up occasionally and that is fun. The mystery is okay but not dazzling, so all-in-all I'd say this was a promising beginning to this series, and I intend to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Historical Mystery","review":"Seneca Falls NY was the site of the Women's Rights Convention of 1848. Against this backdrop we are introduced to Glynis Tryon, a spinister librarian, who stumbles into a murder mystery. This is a cozy mystery, with most of the mayhem taking place off the pages of the book. An entertaining read, and a very interesting heroine, who chooses to be single, at a time when that was very difficult. The mystery wasn't too difficult to solve, but I enjoyed all the history and the numerous real life people woven into the background of the story. A good first entry in what promises to be an enjoyable series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear writing, nice history, but little entertainment or humor","review":"I typically enjoy historical novels, and I was particularly interested in both the NY state region as well as the suffragist movement. Despite clear writing and a rather interesting mystery, I found the book pretty dull. I didn't find the main characters engaging, and there was absolutely no humor to lighten up the story -- seemed more like a bleak look at the plight of women in Seneca Falls, with no silver lining, just despair and helplessness. I read it to find out how the mystery was resolved, but I won't be reading another. I prefer mysteries with more humor, spunk, and character development (Amelia Peabody, Vicky Bliss, Daisy Dalrymple, Charlotte Pitt)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock'n'Roll","review":"Some of these bands are just loud, but most of them have pure rock'n'roll spirits flowing in their veins.

The reader, Anna Fields, has a voice that is annoying. Her pronounciation of certain words like \\"recipe\\"......calling it \\"receipt\\" was particularly aggravating.

It was all I could do to finish this book--and I only did so it wouldn't be a waste of money. Many, many, eye-rolling moments, overly hokey dialogue and as usual, overly romantic descriptions of everything from the color of the creek mud to dogs to bugs. Emily might as well be a six year old child rather than an almost thirteen year old due to her extreme childishness, and LuLu emotes several times about how she'd just \\"die\\" if she had to leave Sweetwater Creek.

This was not a story that screamed to be written. There was no uplifting message or eye-opening resolve. I can't understand why a talented writer would waste her valuable time writing it or why I wasted my time reading it. The characters aren't sympathetic or real enough, the story manages to be syrupy and tawdry all at the same time, and the ending wasn't an ending - just more of same.

I've read other books of hersand enjoyed them, but give this one a pass and go re-read\\"Gone with the Wind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought","review":"This book started out well enough but soon veered off into sheer silliness. It was difficult to suspend my disbelief and accept the fact that Emily, the book's heroine, was only 12 years old. Her thought processes and behaviors were those of a young adult. The section where Emily is decked out in velvet and emeralds in order to hostess a large social gathering was simply ludicrous--as was her trauma at witnessing her adult friend making love in the great outdoors.Ms. Siddons seems to pine for the \\"good old days\\" of slavery--waxing rhapsodic about slave-made foundation bricks and portraying each and every menial as a faithful black family retainer.I have not read this author since the execrable \\"King's Oak\\".

There's a blurb on the jacket that says you don't read her books, you live in them -- and I lived in this one. I buried myself in it for two days --putting off finishing it simply because I was enjoying it too much for it to end.As one who also loves and needs the sea and the marshes, her descriptions are perfect and incredibly evocative. I think even someone who has lived in the Midwest will easily conjure up the beautiful landscape of the Southern marshlands. The main character Emily is well-drawn and someone with whom you become involved very quickly. I've read all of Anne's books -- and have had the pleasure of working with her several times on the Atlanta Writers in Concerts -- and this is one of her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and unlikely","review":"A truly disappointing book from a talented author. She writes from the point of view of a 12 year old who has decidedly middle aged thoughts and opinions.

The story was slick and the book was a decent read but the \\"tactical\\" plot was a definite stretch. I had a feeling that the Cunningham would be going up the Yangste after the first couple of chapters! and lo and behold up she went."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting alternative to Clancy/Brown/Coonts","review":"This was the first book I've read by Cobb and I have to say I enjoyed it. It did get a little tedious at times (though not nearly to the extent that you find with Clancy) but I managed to make it thru. I do plan to go back and read the first book in the series, as well as the subsequent ones.The story was believable, as were the characters. The author also seemed to know his material. All in all, I enjoyed this book and look forward to more work by Cobb."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker","review":"There are so many errors in this book that it is laughable. By the time I stopped reading it, I was convinced that the only thing Mr. Cobb knew about the Navy was that it had ships. I finally stopped around page 42 when he talkes about \\"0100 in the afternoon.\\" Someone should tell this clown that 0100 is always in the morning. Next time he would be well advised to do some basic research before he starts writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good radar detector","review":"I have owned the 7500 for 7 years. The quality is high. I have had no problems with it. It is prone to false alarms in the city, but for the routes that I drive regularly I am able to learn the difference between false alarms and real ones. The highway sensitivity is very good. The \\"safety\\" message feature has proven to be useless. Occasionally a strong radar source will cause an errant message to be displayed, though it does not happen often. I would buy another escort product if I needed a new radar detector."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your money","review":"I bought 2 Passport Detector's 1-7500 & 1-8500 and both of these at the 1st beep you better be on the brakes,if not you may end up like me doing 86.1 in a 55 zone (i was in a rush) I will never buy a Passport again and yes i have own other brands but im selling both of them and im going to drive the speed limit from now on.The $140.00 ticket i had to pay with the 4 points i do not need (yes the cop lowered the speed on the ticket)and it was my 1st ticket in 16 years,my auto insurance is cheap and i want it to stay that way"},{"rating":"2","title":"not so perfect","review":"the item is good i used in the highway it worked, but it more likely to work well with the automatic door signals. liked it but not so much"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Industrial","review":"These tongs are exactly what you expect from China - cheap imitations. They are not made with points shown in the picture. The points are straight sideways instead of with a return as shown. This makes it much harder for them to keep hold of the log. The biggest problem is how weak the bars are at the pivot section. I have been using a size smaller made by another company from my sawmill operator that are twice the thickness in the hinge area. I turned my tractor around and in the process bent these Northern Industrial tongs beyond repair. These tongs are a headache to use compared to the blue ones I referred to and not very sturdy. These were a big disappointment after using the others that worked like a dream. Make an investment in better quality for something that will work and last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly speculative...","review":"Vasholz's inability to differentiate between fact and speculation skews the information presented in his book so much that this book is a disappointment to the scholarly world. Building off of unsupported initial assumptions, Vasholz's conclusions disintegrate under any serious scholarly evaluation. For instance, Vasholz claims to have proven that the Biblical authors were conscious of the idea of canonicity from the onset of writing the Hebrew Bible. However, this idea is poorly supported by four arguments that have connections to canonicity, but in no way prove canonicity. This book should not be used as a historical reference, and should instead be regarded as a conservative's attempt at unsubstantiated speculation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality, but lack of features kills it","review":"The leather is higher quality than most cell phone pouches, but this product is fairly useless to the average user. The magnetic clasp has to be seated *just* right or it doesn't hold. You can't use the phone when it is in the pouch. The thickness of the leather can muffle the vibrating alert to the point where you might not feel it. Lastly, while it says it is a \\"large\\" pouch, the phone will not fit if it has a battery larger than the factory provided one."},{"rating":"2","title":"More beautiful and amusing than any other physics lesson","review":"The Super String Theory in a manga? Only Fujishima sensei would try to pull this off -- and actually be able to do it. This is the real deal, I had my physics obsessed sister verify for me, so you actually can argue that you're studying while reading manga! Besides this little lesson, Terrible Master Urd is full of the incredibly gorgeous art you can expect from Fujishima sensei. The story does have some very humorous elements to it, but this is a deeply dramatic tale. The ending is so sweet and the insight we get into the characters is really wonderful. You'll be glad you have the graphic novel and can read without stopping because this is truly a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid and hard-hitting salsa romantica trendsetter.","review":"Willie scored a massive success with the huge salsa romantica hit \\"Anuncio Clasificado Damelo\\". Despite the album's romantic and sensual mood, Rosario and his band still swing hard- as a result, this album strikes a compromise between his solid, swinging style and salsa romantica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, entertaining, a good \\"trip\\"","review":"We borrowed this as a VHS from library and loved it so we were glad to find it offered on DVD now. A really fun trip, we laughed at Mr. Wright's antics. He meets people so well wherever he goes and children seem to love him as he plays with them. The sting rays were awesome - \\"kissing\\" a sting ray - wow! We will watch this one again and again so are happy to add it to our collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugo by Hugo Boss for Women Toilette Spray","review":"This is a nice spray perfume. The scent stays on longer that others. My husband liked it, too.My teenage daughter snuck some when I wasn't looking. I liked the price, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have not got it","review":"I think this perfume should be really nice but unfortunately I cannot evaluate it as I have not received it. Thus I paid for perfume but got nothing and the costumer service is going neither to make a replacement nor to pay a refund. So I just wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good","review":"At very first spritz, its not so bad, smells like fresh flowers.But then...as it settles on you throughout the day, it just smells like dead flowers.It gives off this really unpleasant smell after being on the skin.I don't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like I remember","review":"Arrived in good shape on time. I used to have this perfume long time ago and finally decided to buy it. The price was really good.

Looks like a good idea, but not for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente guia","review":"Este libro es sumamente util no solo para los estudiantes de medicina, sino para todo personal de salud que tiene que lidiar con imagenes médicas. Las ilustraciones son excelentes, muchas de ellas a colores. El material es bastante conciso. Incluye un buen capitulo que explica la fisica de todos los procedimientos radiologicos. Muy util para los ingenieros biomedicos! Tiene buena información de tratamiento oncologico. 100% recomendado"},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympus Camedia Lens Adapter","review":"I got this adapter because I found it cheaper than Olympus' version, the CLA-1 adapter. However, when I put it on my C-3040, I found most of the pictures I took demonstrated vignetting (hazy shadows around the edges). Despite the fact that this adapter did physically fit on my lens, it did not do the job I needed it to do. I have since returned it and purchased the CLA-1 adapter and have had not problems with it yet."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-b0fc805e"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/11.md","filePath":"quotes/11.md"}'),j={name:"quotes/11.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
