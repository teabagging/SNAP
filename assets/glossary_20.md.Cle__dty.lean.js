It's particularly strong on the psychedelic side of the Stones with brilliant songs like Dandelion, We Love You, She's A Rainbow and 2000 Light Years From Home. On top of that, it contains their very first single Come On and some excellent covers of Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry compositions.

Like Hot Rocks, it also deserves 7 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Rocks","review":"More Hot Rocks suffers from the little brother syndrome. The first Hot Rocks release contained all the Stones classics, while this one has the band's lesser hits and album tracks.

The inclusion of several songs that were previously only released in England and two unreleased tracks make this set mandatory for any Stones completist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another wasted opportunity","review":"Thanks to the first volume's extremely short running time, there were plenty of hits and classics left over for a volume two. This is it. The original side four of the vinyl double album collected a number of UK-only Stones sides; none of them are essential. Sound is variable -- the early tracks are rather bad, but from 1966 on is okay. Surely, though, it's time this rather expensive compilation and its companion were deleted in favour of a new set which made use of the CD running time and featured rather more intelligent selections and sequencing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More honest than Hot Rocks","review":"Whoever chose the songs for this compilation got it right. The one that came before it was great but radio has dulled it and the Stones were a blues band with a piano player.

As stated in previous reviews this is a very good volume for the learned person. Wistrich will bring you up to date and refresh your memory of past details.

Collins is a decent enough writer but here he takes on alchemy and produces too much hot air. Comparatively, Steven Coopers biography of Fante was at least workmanlike and based on interviews with Fante's widow, Joyce, and Fante's family. Conversely, Mr. Collins' effort appears to be fundamentally realized by intellectual assertion and personal specualtion. Having know Fante I cannot recommend this work.

The tragedy is this release is no better than the bootlegs it's trying to combat! It's essentially, an \\"official\\" original Star Wars bootleg DVD.Very sad to continue seeing George Lucas and Lucasfilm treat this trilogy with such disrespect.The Special Edition DVDs are included here as well (and yes, they are still the \\"Special Editions\\" that have been hacked up with slapstick CGI and storytelling gaffs, even if they don't say \\"Special Edition\\" any longer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theatrical Version Worth It!","review":"Only reason I bought this was for the Original Theatrical Version and I'm content with them.

First of all it was called Star Wars. Isn't Mr. Lucas rich enough? I have not been able to find the original version from 1977 on dvd, you know what that mean Mr. Lucas, it means you don't get my money. I don't want the new edition of a classic film. Time to get a life and move on George. It is a shame that such a talented director got stuck for so long on the same theme. So many from Hollywood have opinions about corporate greed, well they should know. New versions of old movies, new scenes, changed scenes, basically a different film. Spielberg has the same problem. Making new movies is great but changing past movies and ensuring that you can't get the original reminds me of what George Orwell said about controlling the future by rewriting the past.

It's really disappointing that they are non-anamorphic and since it seems to be inevitable that they will be re-released at some point with anamorphic transfers despite the fact that Lucas says otherwise. If I was still using a standard television set for my primary device to view DVDs, this would be fine for now I suppose, but having just purchased a widescreen television in January, non-anamorphic DVDs are not attractive to me at all.So a warning to all, if you don't know the difference between anamorphic and non-anamorphic DVDs and unless you don't mind buying these again to get anamorphic transfers in the future, I suggest you go do a search on the web to see for yourself what the difference is so that you can make a more informed purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"I told you so!","review":"I would like to refer you to my review of the original trilogy dvd last year:\\"These are great flicks (I was born in 1971, so Star Wars was my life!), and I will buy the DVD, but I anticipate shelling out another 100 bucks in a couple of years when you issue the super expanded version which contains the directors edit as well as the original theatrical version (ala \\"Aliens\\") \\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Thank goodness that Lucas is finally releasing the original and best versions of these movies.

Many kids and young adults weren't even around with the original Star Wars was released and don't know what the hype is all about and frankly many of them don't care.

Star Wars is not a great movie. I think it's pretty stupid. Yes, I did see it and The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. And guess what? I wasn't impressed. Sure, the special effects were good, and the sound was very high tech. But ya know what? The acting is terrible. The plot was shallow. And there was no character identification. (Unless you somehow identify with people wanting to take over the universe.) This movie was an exploitation of special effects. I'm serious. If you took all the special effects out of the movie you would be left with trash. Take Titanic. It had wonderful special effects. If you took them out you still had a wonderful story with human emotions. Star Wars may be fun, but it's also a kiddie movie for adults who haven't yet grown up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waaaaaaah!!!

I believe, no I actually am 110% POSITIVE that these are being released, again, and in this way, NOT FOR PROFIT. How much more money can he really be that desperate for!?

Hans Solo starts out as a \\"what's in it for me\\" smuggler, with no conception of working for a greater good and with no hesitation to kill. Over the course of the trilogy, he transforms his character into a willing participant in the rebellion for the right (\\"honorable\\") reasons, not just for the joy of killing the enemy. If Hans doesn't shoot Greedo first when we first meet him, there is no transformation to take note of. It's called character development, people. It's what creates a good bit of the story-value.

To make matters worse, the sound and picture are better on my bootleg copies from VHS than his shoddy \\"bonus\\". Let's face it, the man has taken our childhood, twisted it into something sub par, and made it harder to watch than a 9/11 documentary and then, as an after thought, thrown the original back in our faces, using the latest technology to make it look like crap, so he can make us believe that he has done us a favor by destroying what we so dearly loved as children."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\\"","review":"...there was a director who pioneered the \\"space opera\\" and revolutionized the way we see and hear films.

I would suggest everyone who owns a widescreen TV to steer clear of this.

Star Wars is an epic story that unsurprisingly to me, has lived on stronger than most (not all) stories. I agree that much of the acting is not oscar worthy (and so it didn't win an oscar for acting, so what), the plot is very simple, but Star Wars is an endearing epic that is known on a global level. It has an enormous fanbase, larger than any other movie I know (if you don't believe me, you should look a bit deeper before dismissing this offhand). The faults that may be present in Star Wars are far outweighted by its ability to render the strongest of emotions from an audience. Star Wars (all 4) are my \\"favorite\\" movies of all time. Remember, someone's \\"favorite\\" movie does not necessarily equate to \\"best\\" in terms of acting, plot, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flic","review":"George Lucas' epic classic had been made even better in the new Special Edition.

You know, the one I grew up with -- the one without all the glitz and CG crap that was put into the \\"special\\" editions.But like the title says, Amazon reviews are fairly reliable, because they're written by people like me, who generally care about products like this one.I sure hope someone from Lucasfilm is reading these reviews. Let me summarize: if you release the theatrical original movies on DVD for really reals, people will buy. If you try to slide something half-arsed by us, one or two people will buy, then they'll write reviews on Amazon.com, and then nobody will buy.I'm gonna buy Lego Star Wars instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite film story...

The opening scene has to be one of the best ever. It's instantly obvious that there is a mighty battle raging, that the good guys are in great peril, and it will take a near miracle to save them. That miracle comes along when Luke Skywalker appears and eventually saves the day.Great movies have great villians, and Darth Vader has to be one of the all-time best villains. He commands respect (or else), and you actually feel fear when he's onscreen. He epitomizes evil, and for a long time it sure looks like evil's going to win out.Contrast that with the boyish, almost meek Skywalker, and it's no match! How could he possibly win? He's completely overmatched against Vader, yet somehow...Don't miss this one!

If you don't like the fact that they're not enhanced by 16x9 TVs, don't buy them. I'm not, because I already have the boxed set that came out in 2004 and that's all I need.

I wouldn't mind if Lucas re-digitized the video from the original film as he did for the special editions, but after that, he needs to drop it.

I don't need to pay money for that.Personally, I think we'll see the original theatrical versions again in the future.

However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character \\"Biggs\\" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length.

This means those of us who own widescreen TV's have to either watch a tiny image to get the best quality picture or zoom it out and lose quality. No thanks I'll take the chance and wait.The quality of the disc 2 original is OK, but you need to know that the picture is not anamorphic.

These are better than Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pointless cash-in DVD from Lucas...","review":"I love the Star Wars movies. They have proven to be the greatest Sci-fi movies ever and I love them.I own the movies DVD and VHS. I own the 1977 versions on VHS AND the 1997 versions. And trust me, the 1997 version was NOT needed, yet they still proved to be good.Now there's this \\"2004 Special Version\\" that was relesed over a year and a half ago. This is NOT the special edition, IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE THEATRICAL 1977 VERSION, just with bad CGI effects added in.Lucas, STOP CONTRADICTING YOURSELF. Us fans have already seen the 1977 versions and we don't need another cut. You just want our money, no matter what currency. We already have seen what we need to see.Now, I own 2 VHS sets and 2 DVD sets. I feel I wasted my money on the 2004 Special Editions. Plus, the other DVD set showed the films the way they were meant to be seen: 5.1 Surround Sound, Anamorphic Widescreen, and amped up picture.In Closing: DAMNIT LUCAS, LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Bought Them - Very Poor Quality :-(","review":"They were cheap, and I wanted the original unaltered trilogy, so I picked them up. SADLY they are very poor-quality. The Special Editions look perfect (as you'd expect), but the Original Editions are recorded in very lo-resolution. For comparison:Originals = 540x320 = 180,000 pixels (copied from an analog laserdisc master - letterboxed)Special Editions=720x480 = 345,000 pixels (digital dvd - anamorphic)The originals are only recorded at 50% of the DVD's maximum resolution. Very poor quality, and it clearly shows on my large-screen tv in the form of blurry scenes/faces. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Movie!","review":"In this movie George Lucas' dreams and imagination is put to film. I thought this movie was great the special effects. Harrison Ford plays every ones favorite smuggler Han Solo. Carrie Fisher plays a princess that sometimes forgets her manners (most of the time when specking to Han Solo). Mark Hamill plays a whinny, but one the bravest characters in the Star Wars galaxy Luke Skywalker. You will have a great time going to a galaxy far, far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAR WARS Episode IV: A New Hope","review":"This is the film that introduced the world to STAR WARS. The classic story of boy on Tatoonie who becomes a powerful Jedi Knight and begins to deliver the galaxy from the wrath of the Empire over a period of a few years. We all know how it begins. Stormtroopers fire pistols at the door and break in. Blasters raised, rebels prepare to fight. After a short battle scene, Darth Vader walks onto the screen, a squadron of Stormtroopers on his heels. STAR WARS was like nothing that ever appeared on the bigscreen. Now, digitally remastered and uncut, you too, can join the battle! I would recommend buying the bundle with all 3 in the Trilogy series. May the force be with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas now lives in another galaxy far far away...","review":"Lucas has repeatedly changed and damaged one of the greatest film franchises in history by making lame special editions and continues to slap those fans in the face with this new release.Without a doubt the original Star Wars (Episode IV)in its original form was one of the masterpieces of the 20th centuty. Unfortunately restoring it apparently doesn't fit Lucas' artistic vision.Well Mr. Lucas, by looking at these reviews, isn't it obvious that fans are tired of your \\"new\\" vision of Star Wars? I can safely say that you have lost touch with what made Star Wars great. Not only that you continue to ignore those fans that made you what you are today. Sadly you are no longer a great storyteller or movie maker. Nor the George Lucas that made great movies like American Graffitti and the original Star Wars Trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile.","review":"I hate that the 'spotlight' reviews are so negative on here. Granted, I never bought any previous releases of the films. I didn't mind the little touch-ups so much, but frankly the stupid CGI Jabba, Greedo shooting first, and the entire prequel trilogy made me feel like an idiot for ever liking Star Wars to begin with.So finally, here's the original cuts packaged with the rerelease ones, and while they're not updated for people's ultimate home theater systems, they ARE the original cuts. If you have that much of a problem with it, you probably have some bigger issues that need addressing.For the rest of you, go ahead and enjoy some classic entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i am the biggest star wars fan on the face","review":"i am going through a sad inability to imagine a way to come close to describing the wonder of this movie. i have seen it over 500 times no doubt. the best movie, ever made, nothing can top it.

This is not a science fiction film but a fantasy adventure which in 1977 set a new standard on how special effects could be used to push the boundaries of our imagination (much like the Wizard of Oz decades before). At 13 in that year I thought I would see much more of this to come but I have been disappointed ever since by the lack of imagination Holywood has had in its use of special effects. The new revisited edition is welcome and maybe necessary so that new generations of viewers can enjoy this classic without the limitations of its original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This one is the ultimate \\"You've gotta be kidding me!\\" They finally offer the theatrical versions on DVD and they're LETTERBOXED?!?!

A terrible transfer, even the oldest widescreen movie I own works well with my dvd player and automatically sets up the correct widescreen ratio--not this disk, picture on my old vhs copies look better and they also have a better sound.

The bootleg DVDs I purchased years ago that were burned from the laser disks look better than the movies on the bonus disks. Kinda shocking, actually, because I can't figure out how that happened! Re the non-anamorphic transfers, I am not personally disturbed because I do not own a HDTV. Still, for those who do, and since I might purchase a HDTV in the future, it is more than very disappointing that Lucasfilm didn't spend the approximately $100,000 it would have cost to do anamorphic transfers so that the films would fill up the widescreen without distortion or loss of picture quality. I'm not concerned about the Dolby 2.0 because, as has been noted, that's what was available when the films came out. If Lucasfilm had just done the anamorphic transfer and made sure that the films were no worse than the old laserdisks, I would have been happy. But unfortunately, I am not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't tell you how upset I am...","review":"Purchased the WIDESCREEN ADDITION and the WIDESCREEN only applies to the remixed/over-enhanced vesion of the movie and NOT the ORIGINAL film.

And now he disrespects the work of all the people that helped him make Star Wars a success in the first place back in 1977.I bought a DVD player originally so that I would own the original Star Wars on DVD. I got an HDTV compatible widescreen TV to see it in at least standard 16x9 anamorphic resolution. (like 94 % of big movie DVD\`s out there..)Now I realise..

But it shows you that the movie really needs Harrison Ford and probably not Mark Hammil. Good special effects and mix of fantasy and science fiction (with some biblical references easy for a preacher's son like to me recognize). Lightsabers are an interesting weapon for fighting. I think Obi Wan Kenobi was a more important character to this movie than Luke Skywalker, who's kind of a dorky farm boy. I know what I'm talking about doesn't really have anything to do with anything, but bear with me. The characters are kind of black and white--either totally good or totally bad--except for Han Solo who was a smuggler or something. He's still my favorite character until Liam Neeson joined the party.

Yes, the updated versions are more in line with what he wanted, but you know what, when I saw them in the theater, they didn't have the extras and I still made sure I owned them on VHS. I'm sure George didn't release them because he needs the money, but because there are a bunch of anal purist fans like myself out there that wanted our Star Wars movies back, unmolested.

Technically, there are three versions of each film: The original, 1997, and 2004.

Now, it may not annoy you but it does annoy me. Also, when Han confronts Jabba after that, Han tells Jabba he's a wonderful human being. Now we all know Jabba is not a human being.

Empire and ROTJ are a bit better but there is some sort of echoey slapback that occurs sometimes and the compression drags some stuff up to the front of the mix that really shouldn't be there.Apart from that, the films look and sound great.All that said - it is awesome to finally have the original, untarnished versions on DVD and now that I have them (I was given them as a gift) I am very pleased indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT digital remastering","review":"It plainly states on MY copy of this CD that Phil Spector chose to master this in analog, NO digital remastering.

The door is held at the right height by tiny plastic rods that fall out if you look at them funny and good luck finding them if they do fall out. Which they will. The ethernet plug has to go at the exact right angle or it won't stay. And if both of those plastic rods fall out -- which they will -- you're going to have to wrap wrap some tape around that door to keep it at the right position. This is not the sort of thing you expect to need to do after paying $80 for a two-inch-long device! Has to be the poorest physical design for a network device I've seen, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond stupid","review":"OK. So I'm stupid for having bought this thing in the first place but a stupider design I can't imagine. I guess I assumed, when I saw the cover on the USB gadget that they actually had a plug you could insert the cable into. However, it stays \\"attached\\" by way of the little plastic cover that comes off at the slightest provocation - like, say moving your DVR back into place or the cable moving...at all. I contemplated duct-taping everything together but instead, chose to return it. Don't BUY THIS DESIGN....any model. Linksys, get a different design."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS ADAPTOR!","review":"As many of the other reviews here have stated, the thing falls apart very easily. Mine worked until I had to move the Tivo. The little hinged door broke right off. Now the cable is attached to it with electrical tape. Even that doesn't do the trick. I've been shopping for a replacement, but TiVo only recommends this one, or a wireless one that forces me to \\"dumb down\\" my wireless security to WEP. Grrrr....How could a crappy product like this actually get produced?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fragile","review":"I do not recommend this in a setting that is industrial, involves a lot of movement i.e. on a laptop, around kids, or even pets. One wrong pull or tug at the precarious 45 degree angle you have to snap your jack into will render this device totally useless. The small hinged door is poorly engineered and if you have to get an adapter, I recommend the Netgear version B00006CJMP that is not only less expensive, but allows a straight plug in."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT","review":"As others have noticed, fragile design. I broke it, and I was being gentle. Had to replace it with same model, though, since USB to Ethernet adaptors are not easy to come by (TiVo, thanks a lot for making customers go through this).I long for TiVo's next generation, when I hope they'll have an ethernet plug in the back.If you're stuck getting this one, like me, be *extremely* careful plugging it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the flimsy construction","review":"This product works fine as long as you do not wiggle the ethernet cord. Too much wiggle, and the ethernet cord will pop out, along with breaking the little door that holds the RJ-45 connector on. It is *impossible* to fix.Another reason not to like this product is that it is USB 1.x, and not USB 2.x. This is OK if you are only working on a 10Mbps (Mega bit per second) ethernet; but most people are now going to 100Mbps (and some to 1000Mbps) where USB1.x is totally antique. USB2.x at least has the speed to work with a viable 100Mbps network.Having had to replace TWO of these because of the top reason, I cannot recommend this unless you have your PC/Tivo/whatever bolted down, or rack mounted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Packaging","review":"I received this item as a gift and had to return it due to the plates being broken.

HOWEVER, I ordered a set for a gift, and they came in the Pfalgratz box inside of a larger Amazon box. The dishes in the Pfalgratz box were in no way wrapped--they were only separated by cardboard dividers. Predictably, several pieces were broken, so I sent them back and requested a replacement set (and even called Amazon to request that they package them more carefully this time).Yesterday, the new set arrived, packaged the exact same way and--surprise--several pieces were broken. If you could find them in the store, these dishes might be worth buying, but until Amazon learns how to package fragile things with care, I highly recommend AGAINST purchasing these dishes, unless you want to make a mosaic with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plates would have been nice IF THEY WEREN'T BROKEN!","review":"DO NOT BUY PLATES FROM AMAZON!

I love Newhart, but Berman did it first.As far as risque goes, Berman was pushing the boundaries of public performance and comedy in these recordings. This and his second Lp covered a few subjects that were extremely toungue-in-cheek metaphorical and caught me completely off guard. He was doing this stuff in 1959.

The dancing number and the whole jabba the hutt surroundings reminded me more of sesame street than science fiction.

Every time he started his ugly howl i just wanted to get into the tv screen and chop his head of with that kind of \\"cool\\" laser sword.Star Wars may be of historical interest.

Luke becoming a Jedi master on Degobah. Then the amazing third act. Luke and Vader's final battle, the battle on Endor with Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Ewoks against the storm troopers. And of course in my opinion the greatest space battle of the Star Wars saga. I remember when I was a little kid, watching that space battle and how I was amazed by it.

It reflects Lucas's contention that he didn't really make the movies the way he wanted to (then, why DID he make them?). Any other DVD of similar chronological date has at the very least had a 5.1 soundtrack - not these (despite the totally bogus and misleading representations on the DVD case).All this does is showcase the wanton money-making greed of George Lucas and 20th Century Fox.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!

Oddly enough, the big problem the new series is suffering from is that most of the material in-between the high-energy, effects-laden action sequences drags, and drags pretty badly. That's a flaw the original series didn't suffer from, at least not until Return of the Jedi, which is (tied with Ep. 1) my least favorite of the entire series. It's not as enjoyable as the other parts, lacks the sense of freshness, but does admittedly have some thrilling action sequences, particularly the three-way battle, which is still marred quite a bit by the Ewoks annoying interference, easily the lowpoint of Star Wars canon period."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"These are NOT the OT versions you're looking for...\\"","review":"2004 Version?

Over sentimentality and bad writing just don't cut it, and anyone who critically evaluates this movie and gets over the greatness of the first two films will see that it is really not that great. And the emperor was the stereotypical evil old man. Nothing original at all. Like I said, for children, not people who appreciate good writing, good acting, and real drama, not a commercial sell-out.

So if you've still got an old 4:3 ratio TV this will be OK (and thats all), but for those of us with widescreen TV's this means you either have to watch a tiny 4:3 image or use your TV's zoom facility to get the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. However if you do this you are reducing the image quality.Of the original 3 films this is the weakest by some margin, however if you're happy with the digitally enhanced anamorphic version then go ahead and buy if you like the film.

Well mine kept popping out and wouldn't work properly in my Toyota van. Even when I thought it was secure my dog even managed to step on the button and release it! Not something I'd trust while driving with a window down. I ended up just putting the belt through the loop instead. I just didn't like the design of the product.

The story is nothing great, but I won't be spoiling anything if I say there are lots of explosions. Pity the rest of the movie isn't explosive.I found FIRESTARTER 2 to be slow, long and just not very interesting.

I find it hard to describe the piano playing here other than it sounds rather juvenile.Beyond that, however, Vanessa Carlton really can't sing--at least not on this particular single. She sounds like she's trying too hard to sound \\"soulful\\", or something. At least she's on pitch, but her vocals here are very annoying to me.The song itself isn't too bad, though the subject matter is common and overused and the lyrics aren't particularly inspired.

It washes so nicely. When we bought it, it came with metal scrubber to prove that you can clean it with metal with no problem. You need to use tiny bit of oil, but not much. I went on their website to try to buy more when I learned that it uses some teflon inside, but only in temp 500-600 degrees it gets released. So it should not be released in food. For complete purist-time to go back to cast iron or steel. However, I am still using this pan--what can I say? When something works so well, do not replace it! It was worth money we paid for it.

Every single one has failed to perform as promised. Within a year we noticed the pans were no longer non-stick. Soon after that, we noticed the pots were pitted and showing places where the non-stick finish had eroded or flaked off. We never use metal utensils for cooking, and we never put the pans in the dishwasher - we always handwash them. For the amount of money we paid, we are extremely disappointed, and we will NEVER buy another ScanPan again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nonstick","review":"After I purchased the large Scanpan fry pan, I was convinced that this is the best nonstick pan you can buy.

I was disappointed to see that the thickness of the basic aluminum structure is now significantly thinner than my old pan. The old pan strongly suggested cleaning by putting cold water directly into the hot pan, letting the resultant boiling and steam self-clean it. I used that process with great results. The directions on the new pan omit that recommendation, probably because it's thinner. I rated the old pan 5 stars, but can't give that rating to this lighter construction. Otherwise, the titanium surface is still really scratch resistant (even with metal utensils) and highly non-stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!!","review":"Unfortunately, this pan did not live up to it's reputation.

Well, I did taking advantage of this deal on Amazon!! I am happy to say it is the wisest decision I made.I cooked eggs in them and washed the pan and found no trace or smell of the eggs! I usually hate the smell that you get from frying eggs, so I was pretty pleased. Then I sauteed veggies and that was great tasting and cleaned up real quick. No elbow grease.I think this pan is a great buy. The one piece we shd really invest in for eggs.Reasons1. does not stick2. u can wash it when warm whcih you cannot wth NS3. u can use metal utensils4. you still get some browningdo you want any more?? well, will come up with some after a while, I guess:))To sum up this is a great introduction to the world of scanpan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money - bad product - no warranty help","review":"I fell for it, bought a large set back in 1999. Three products lost the surface coats, the handle on a fourth broke off half way down - not at the joint next to the pan. Company did replace pans/pots with the new and improved a couple years ago. New and improved is worse than before. Gets a scumming black coating no matter what you do. Company must have lost a lot of money - no longer honors warranty.Worse yet, I bought a Scanpan lid which fractured into tiny pieces in a 325 degree oven. Nothing burned. Juice from the roast still in the pan. Dangerous. Even though the lid had no warranty, I thought I would email them with pictures thinking they both needed to know the health risk and possibly replace under the circumstances. No response at all.Next stop is Consumer Reports - cannot believe the high ratings there - which is why I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Extra","review":"I've been using a (red dot) T-Fal pan of this size for several years, and that one is a better heat conductor. The Scanpan is to be used with low heat, but it takes much more heat than the T-Fal to heat up - at least medium on a gas stove. I aim to use low heat with any non-stick pan. Due to this issue, there has been a learning curve for me in using this pan. I ordered it because it is supposed to be healthier to use. It seems like a durable pan, and I expect it to serve me for many years. It is convenient to have a second pan of this size.

Obviously this is a manufacturing issue & Scanpan claims to have a lifetime warranty on manufacturer defects. I sent it off to the factory & they refuse the claim due to lack of cleaning...I work in a freaking research & development department for cookware. I know how to clean a fry pan. Their \\"claim\\" is a small area on the lip of the pan - FAR AWAY from the main bubbling issue - & an area I didn't scrub completely because once I noticed the bubbling, the pan is useless to me.This is a complete joke & their warranty \\"policy\\" is apparently: unless if falls out of the manufacturer's box in 10 pieces all while catching it on camera with a factory representative on hand, we will not cover.Roll the dice if you choose. This pan is so expensive, for them not to treat warranty claims with the respect they deserve is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scampan will not honor warranty","review":"Scanpan was good for a few years, then the finish went bad and the company claims it is a cleaning problem. They will not honor warranties. The kitchen store I bought it from has had issues and no longer carries this brand. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"WON'T TAKE A LICKING, AND SOON STARTS STICKING","review":"Like several other reviewers for this pan or other Scanpan pieces/sets, my experience with this cookware has been awful. I've tossed a complete set out after just four years of use. I'm aware there is a warranty, but why replace bad with bad? Besides, the process for warranty replacement has less appeal than a root canal. It's a joke.YOU REALLY OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check around on the Internet for consumer feedback/reviews on this overpriced and overrated cookware. Again and again you'll read about how the nonstick surface eventually discolors, then forms little bubbles, the surface degrades, then finally loses all its nonstick qualities. Take the time to read customers' 1-star ratings here on Amazon for both sets and single pieces, and you'll read the same thing over and over again. SERIOUSLY, FOLKS, THINK TWICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"After extensive research before our wedding we decided to register for Scanpan products to fill out our cookware. Just over three years later the three pieces we use almost daily are all failing. Two fry pans and a saucepan all have extensive bubbling or breaks in the nonstick. Particularly irritating is the saucepan - we frequently put a steamer basket in it for vegetables and the stainless legs (with rounded, polished feet) appear to have worn a circle in the nonstick. This was evident at a year ago or earlier. Frankly not worth the premium price. When we replace them we'll probably go with conventional cookware and give up on non-stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest pan","review":"I've never fallen in love with a pan till now.

So much for the hyped durability - it lasted no longer than Teflon pans I've had. My local vendor has ceased to carry the Scanpan line because most of their customers have also experience coating failure. Scanpan is certainly NOT worth the premium price.[Following note added several months later]Or, maybe it is. After I returned the pan to Scanpan, they sent me a new one to replace it.

While not awful, there is no reason for anyone who isn't a personal friend of a band member to add this to their collection.

The op. 5 set by Handel is peculiar in many ways. Some of the \\"trio sonatas\\" are really five and six-movement suites and not trio sonatas at all as we have come to know them via other composers. Additionally, music in Handel's day was usually sold in sets of three and six so how did op. 5 comes to have seven sonatas? The answer is discussed in the notes. The music is all recycled from many of Handel's earlier works. This, in no way, diminishes the CD.The BSB play with a sparkle and shimmer that would have made old Handel do a dance himself, if he could. The sense of ensemble is outstanding on these period instruments tuned down to a=415. Intonation is impeccable throughout and the notes, written by the group's cellist, are informative and interesting.If you have any interest at all in baroque music , get this set. These ladies really rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet more wonderful George Frideric","review":"Here of late, I have been enjoying a great deal of Handle's instrumental compositions that he wrote for small instrumental combinations (aka chamber music). This superb recording of his Trio Sonatas Opus 5 has certainly been a highlight for me mainly because the playing of the performers, The Brook Street Band, is so very good. Playing these four (4) and five (5) movements delightful compositions on \\"original\\" instruments, the aforesaid group's playing is so rhythmic and tuneful. I can just see people in 17th century drag sitting around small candle-lit rooms listening to the dance movements (Gavottes, Gigues, Burrees, Minutes, etc. along with andante, larghetto, and allegro movements. This recording is so atmospheric capturing, to me, the era splendidly.

Then there are instances where both are nearly perfect and they work even more perfectly together. That is the case with Ratatouille. Both score and film are deserving of Academy awards.

A huge portion of the novel dealt with Lancelot and Guenevere's love affair, which was rocky to say the least. It seemed like every 50 pages she was sending Lancelot away for something he had done and the Guenevere would call him back and then send him away again.

Worse, Ms. Bainbridge focuses too much time on the dialogue between the main characters.

It's nicely written but has sacrificed character development or plot for technical description and, 'look at my research' detail. It's hard, I thought, to care about any of the characters at all and our exorphic knowledge of the ship's imminent fate led me to feel apathetic about the characters' fate rather than sympathetic. It doesn't seem to be ABOUT anything and, as we already know what happens, it's not a potboiler either.Bainbridge's prose is neat and clear but, ultimately, this is a novel less than the sum of its parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child's kangaroo costume","review":"I was very unimpressed with this product.

Then the 30 days to return had passed by 1 day when I finally got in contact with them. I filed a claim with Amazon and they had said I didn't do what I could on my part and I am now out $45 and a costume that fits a 12-18 month old.

The first three songs \\"Not Fade Away\\", \\"Route 66\\" & \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" (later made famous by Foghat) all show the raw energy of the band. \\"Tell Me\\" is a fine original composition. \\"I'm A King Bee\\" sets up the Mick Jagger persona of the sexual lothario and \\"Carol\\" starts the trend of having a Chuck Berry cover on their first few albums. The album shows off the band's potential and although it doesn't always hit, \\"Can I Get A Witness\\" and \\"Walking The Dog\\" to name two, it is a solid debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut album","review":"This is a pretty good first album.

It's a gamey 88-page volume of generalizations, paraphrases, and horrid little cartoon drawings of Plath (as herself and as Lady Lazarus -- in G-string and pasties!). Because the book can't quote more than five lines from any of Plath's poems, it paraphrases, which isn't the same as explaining how any one poem actually works. (The author says you must have the Collected Poems alongside.) It also contains proofreading errors and misinformation (Did you know Esther Greenwood was a 'country girl' and that's why she hated Manhattan?). Example of its prose: \\"The artist needs to fly the roles but she is tied down and a person.\\" What a disappointment.

I was disappointed. The part where they actually attack the denier's arguments, are very short and exclude several of the misunderstandings about the Holocaust, like the crematories, and just include the most popular ones.Their explanation of historiography, however, was a great add. As well as the difference between revisionism and denial. Most deniers should really read that part. Buy this book if you are a newbie when it comes to this.I have done my own research and I do think deniers are full of garbage, but if you are looking for a book that will definitely refute all those arguments, this is not the one.Do your own research, look into the subject the reviosionists attack, and get your own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy research, childish name calling","review":"If you are interested in the Holocaust in any way, stay away from this book.The research is very poor. It relies almost totally on second hand research. Much of which is inaccurate. For example, they claim Pat Bucannan wrote in \\"A Republic Not an Empire' that we never should have joined in WWII. No such statement exists in the book. Instead they cite a secondary source when they could easily has read the primary source.Their study of historical issues are also laxed. When they write about gas chambers the continue to refer to Zyclon B as a gas. Zyclon B is chalk pellets. They clain the Nazis protected themselves by using gas masks. But Zyclon B is absorbed through the skin and has nothing to do with breathing.Most of the rest of the book consists of petty insults. They refer to Nerunmberg critics as belives in aliens and that Elvis is still alive.This book contain no new or serious research and is a waste of time for anyone on either side of this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book available on Holocaust denial","review":"Holocaust denial is still a small movement in the minds of most Americans. Many have heard something about it, but haven't really given it much thought. However, the number of Holocaust survivors grows smaller every year, which helps the denial movement. There is not a lot written about Holocaust denial (relatively), and in my opinion the best two works are the two that are the most famous now, this book and Deborah Lipstadt's Denying the Holocaust. This book is the better book. Lipstadt's work is very good and presents an introduction to the movement, but Shermer and Grobman take it one step further. They address the arguments made by the deniers, and demonstrate why the arguments are weak. Lipstadt does not really get into that much, which does not make her work bad, but it does make this work better. If you want to learn about Holocaust denial without studying the topic extensively this is the best work avaiable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Holocaust as Fact","review":"This is a tremendously important response to and study of the Holocaust denial syndrome, whose psychology constitutes one of the puzzles of historical perception and false interpretation. The authors, among other things, demonstrate the basic facts about this event, conclusively proving its existence. In the process they summon up a few of the strains of historiographical theory that have been warped to a false usage in service of complex sophistries of denial. While the analysis decisively settles the issue, one must wonder if presuppositions so irrational are open to refutation. In the end they are. And this work is an important step in that direction, and quite apart from anything else important reading for any student of historical theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the paper it is written on","review":"All you have to do is watch Michael Shermer on Donahue to see what a clown this guy is. When David Cole points out that the gas chamber doors didn't lock, Shermer says \\"you dont need doors that lock, you can slam boxes against the door to keep people in\\". Do you really think the Germans, with their knowledge of physics and other sciences came up with a mass extermination plan and didn't have a clue how to build a gas chamber that was airtight?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Read","review":"While this book started out a bit slowly, by the end I was hooked and couldn't put it down.Sadly, I don't think this book will convince Holocaust deniers, although not through any fault of its own. Most will write it off as an attack, not bother to read it, or claim that it didn't \\"prove\\" the Holocaust while they refuse to accept any evidence that does not perfectly dovetail with their theory.Still, as someone who has no doubt that the Holocaust happened, it was a good look at how history is \\"proved\\" and also made me think of the broader picture of history beyond the Holocaust.I also appreciated the look at how the Holocaust evolved and how so many normal men and women were led to perform such evil and disturbing acts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse into Twisted Minds","review":"This book is excellent. I am a student studying the holocaust in depth for humanities. This book was very helpful and insightful. Often times historians would like to ignore this portion of society. However, their numbers are growing and the best way to deal with this threat is to acknowledge them and than shoot down all of their claims. Indeed Shermer and Grober recieved mass amounts of criticism for studying this subject in depth but by doing so the authors are able to dispute all claims of Holocaust denial. As a bonus the authors also address the issue of justifying any historic event and how readers and students can tell the difference between history and psuedohistory.

Fascinating accounts of what happenened to the men taken POW. Well worth the time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Misleading","review":"Not as pleased with it as I thought I would be. I think the author tries to cover too much - he did a credible job with the beating the 106th and other units took the first few days, and I think he should have stuck with that and expanded it. He does very little on the countermoves and attacks, and what he did was done sketchily, I thought. He should have titled the book - The Bulge: The First Three Days - or something to that effect. He covers the captivity of those captured well, too, but the other parts - counter attacks - are glossed over - for example: 'The Second Armored Division, joined by the 3rd Royal tank Regiment, smashed a significant piece of the 2nd SS Panzer Division toward the western end of the Bulge.' That's all? Would have liked more on the I & R platoon's stand those first days as well. And then he includeds a section on Patton's attempt to free is son-in-law. Out of place. Worth the read, but set your expectations lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"Yes, this is a collection of stories, some of which are interesting and nice to read. Annoying, however, are the many mistakes which make one doubt Mr. Astor knows what he's talking about (Waffen SS infantry wear black? Panzer IV Panther?). Some select individual get to tell us about their life before the war, who they married, what their father did, etc etc, rarely anything interesting to know.

As a fitness instructor, former marathon runner and paratrooper, I can personally attest to relieving back pain using Dr. MacKenzie's methods. The price of the book is cheaper than a single visit to a physiotherapist. Not recommended for people with no background in physical conditioning, therapy or fitness.

I only have to turn up my volume about 3/4 for the sound to be good, but when they don't, I have to sit near the front and turn the volume up all the way.

I use it mainly for my class lectures, and now I don't have to sit around and edit the audio clips after each session. I can review the lectures right away. I mainly sit up at the front of the class, and that seems to pick up most of what the professor is lecturing about, but it will pickup sounds/noise from neighboring students.The one con I have about this is that the clip on this device is plastic, isn't very stong, and it comes off too easily.

The program crashes for no apparent reason -- whether during movie review, editing or just a repositioning of the cursor. While, commendably, the program more-often-than-not remembers the last set up and position, you maybe repeatedly stuck at that particular point if the stars are not properly aligned. Also beware that each time the program crashes, Pinnacle wants you to file report; after the third time of the day dealing with them, the reporting screens become just one more point of frustration -- especially since Pinnacle does not seem to acknowledge or deal with the problems.

The second, in 3 weeks, has done nothing but ask me to repeat what the first guy told me to do. I've uninstalled/reinstalled this program over 10 times, and it refuses to work properly. Unfortunately, that's the only thing the tech suppport guys can tell you to do . . . uninstall and reinstall again. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE HEARTACHE. Read the rest of the reviews, and I know you will make the right decision. I failed to do my research before buying, and am now kicking myself. Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"As a long time Studio user I was excited to see a further improved version, but that didn't turn out to be the case.

Just read the Pinnacle message boards and the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you smell something???","review":"Do you smell something bad??? oh wait! it is Pinnacle 10 software that smells so bad. Don't buy this crappy software. I have a super fast computer with a ton of memory, no dice. It has crashed 32 times to 2 days and the patch didn't do anything. Save your money and buy something else.

I spent (too many) hours attempting to produce my 1st DVD. Much of the time was learning curve, but much more was waiting and waiting, then killing the process and restarting after it froze. I thought my Sempron 2500+ was the problem, but after trying it on a new (HP) Athlon 3400, things didn't improve significantly. It just didn't freeze as much. Different than the last review the direct-to-disk worked the best for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This product should have never been released. Not only does it have so many bugs that you spend most of your time trying to fix a problem and never get to actually create any movies, but the best solution Pinnacle Customer Support has is to uninstall the program and then reinstall it. I have had the program for about three weeks now and have not once been able to succesfully create a movie. Your money is better spent on another piece of software."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is not ready for market","review":"Getting \\"Direct-to-disc failed, please try again\\" 10 or more times after 8 or more hours of running each time.

The company should print what kind of video card required.

I consider myself to be geekish and I couldn't make this product work on a top of the line machine. The average computer person has NO chance with this product. When I contacted tech support, the first thing they did is send me out a page and a half document of stuff to do: update ALL drivers (video, audio, DVD, etc) turn off all non essential software, virus checkers, spyware, etc...... it goes on and on. This product is YEARS from being ready. You have been warned! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"I never heard and used such a crap product in my life.I wondered whether Pinnacle team really tested and QA this crappy software before release in to its customer.Even after installing their latest patch, product is of no use.Better they should recall this product and refund our moneyNever ever think of buying this buggy product. Better spend your money on some thing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like they all say....","review":"This program is junk. Pure and simple. It has many nice features. The trouble is they all crash your PC. I am a programmer myself and would be ashamed to release software that is this unstable - and charge for it! Too bad, it's a nice interface that is quite user friendly. Simply put, the program is not worth a dime based on it's complete lack of performance and high crash rate.

Perhaps you'll get lucky and won't have any problems, but save often! Pinnacle also requires you to pay extra for the extra media included with the product.

Ulead and Adobe give you loads more free content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"I thought all these problems were just me. Wrong! I just read all the reviews below and they are ALL having the same problems I am having. This software is truly a MAJOR step backward from version 9. Don't waste your money unless you are reading this in the Summer of 2006 when, presumably, they will have released version 10.9.9 that finally has fixed all the bugs in this thing.The thing I wonder about is the Bonus DVD with 3+ Gigs of extra stuff - others are right that it won't load. A couple of the third party plug-ins have unreadable files. How do we get THAT fixed? Are they going to mail us a new disc? Doubtful. I am really disappointed and will be pulling out my old Studio 9 and reinstalling it until they get this thing fixed. I will be wary of future versions because of this debacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Very Careful","review":"In three days of using this program on fairly basic files and edits, I've had 7 complete crashes.

While I may not have the swiftest PC on the block, I do have a pretty good Pentium PC with 512 RAM. Apparently not near enough for Studio Plus V10.

More bugs than a July swamp party in the Everglades!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Software","review":"This application is not stable even after applying the latest patch. Version 10? How on earth could any company write 10 versions of an application and end up with something like this? And how could they release this awful piece of software in the first place?

Either they did not test it or they tested it, found the bugs and then did nothing about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER WILL ROBINSON","review":"I always read reviews. For some reason I didn't on this purchase. DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE! Version 9 was buggy and version 10 is absolutely useless. I have not been able to complete a single project.

DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even waste your time with this product.","review":"Everything said in the reviews is true - the good (what little of it), the bad, and the ugly. This thing is a waste of time and money.But because of it, I discovered Sony's Vegas Movie Studio, and I was blown away by that product. It doesn't crash, gives way more creative control, and the mpeg2 codec is almost flawless. Pinnacle nickle and dimes you, while Vegas HAS all that stuff right out of the box FOR ONLY $89!!!!!! AND IT DOESN'T CRASH!!!!!Oh, and as far as support from Pinnacle, don't even think of it...you're on your own. They'll take your money for a sale, but don't expect any useful (if any) help from them. Sony on the other hand was all over me to help get their program running. Never looking back. Pinnacle had a cool concept, but as another reviewer said -- how does a company get to release 10 and still have a crappy product?????? Vegas is at release 6.0 and it's ROCK SOLID - has not crashed ONCE since i've owned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Software!","review":"I have to echo what everyone else is saying about this software.

This latest steaming pile has a new feature in that after you install it, it takes over the file associations for all of your digital photos, so when you double-click a .jpg it launches a trial version of some software 1) I didn't want, 2) I didn't ask to install. Next, Pinnacle swaps out your DVD-ROM driver with it's own that in my case screwed up other applications that make DVDs. Third, it crashes so much I have yet to get a video out of it. Move along, there's nothing to see here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinnacle 10.X Plus is the worst upgrade ever","review":"Buyer Beware~ I used Studio 9 for the last few years with not a single problem. After the upgrade to 10 and all the fixes I have given up. I moved to Sony Movie Studio Platinum. Got it on Amazon for less than $100. Now I am a happy user and am creating great DVDs again.

Whenever I tried to open it I would get a message that the software shut down previously and I get 3 choices - New project / Open existing project / Continue.

And they've all had two things in common:1. When the program works, it's superb.2. The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out. Studio Plus v10.0 is no exception.Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price. At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice? Shop around. Google the competition. But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if it's free it's too expensive","review":"This would be the worst software purchase you would ever make.

I read it years ago and I can still recall how excited I felt reading through it. A total page turner. Pearson is well researched, I have always admired him and adored his work! He is great!

I totally recommend this one and his others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm in the minority","review":"I am only one of few critics who did not like this book. As far as I'm concerned this book had two disjointed subplots. I had trouble determining the connection between the two. At times the plot, if you want to call it that, went on ad nauseum with literally nothing happening. I was bored but was determined to not put it down. I gave the novel 2 stars because the last 50 pages or so were intriguing and fun to read. More of the story should have taken place in the labyrinth of streets and alleys known as The Underground.

Two women are missing. And a city employee dies during a watermain break. Daphne Matthews, a forensic psychologist, and Detective John LaMoia play prominent roles in this mystery, concerned primarily with the woman thrown off a bridge. Lou Boldt is more in the background concerned with the two missing women and the city employee killed during a water main break. A fascinating backdrop to all this is an underground Seattle from the early 1900's that was purposely buried to raise part of the city above flooding level - intriguing in light of Katrina and New Orlean's problems. A good read with lots to hold your interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"I have read all of the Lou Boldt novels, and this one was one of my favorites. I did not guess the killer -- Pearson maintained the uncertainty well -- and i enjoyed the history lesson. Even more, I enjoyed Daphne Matthews as the principal character, and having her FINALLY stop yearning for Boldt, at least for a while. Thought the ending was a little bit hurried and sketchy -- there's a loose end or two -- but it did not interfere with my enjoyment. One more thing -- it's time to deepen the repeat characters a bit, instead of relying on the sketches built up in prior books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boldt takes a back seat","review":"New focus on other detectives and some truly suspenseful scenes highlight this new entry in the Boldt series.

I hoped for something on the order of Parallel Lies, which I really enjoyed. Instead, The Art of Deception seems to be a scam pulled on unsuspecting readers. Pearson forgets that a sentence is supposed to have both a subject and a verb at the very least and the adjectives that he does use are used over and over again. This book is hard to focus on because the sentences within paragraphs are disjointed. The author has a great background scenario in the Seattle Underground, but he fails to describe it adequately. The budding romance, if one can call it that, between \\"LaMoia\\" and \\"Mathews\\" it dull and predictable.

He has one of the best voices in todays music world. He just gets better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"After Hours","review":"I have been listening to After Hours since it was released on July 17,2007 and I really love it. Raul Malo has the best voice of anyone today. He has such passion for his music and it shows in his cd's and in his concerts. His band is also very talented and were very good on this cd. They have taken these country standards and have made a cd that will be loved for years. I would recommend this cd to my family and friends. I think most people would be glad to have it in their collection of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"After Hours\\" by Raul Malo","review":"When 'After Hours\\" was released in Nashville, it confirmed what I had known for many years, Music Row CEO's love to hear Raul interpret those brilliant and masterful country songs.Only the 'Maestro\\" could do the real honors.....as usual....he did.......flawless.....fabulous record....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick back and enjoy!","review":"What a voice - smooth as satin and rich as chocolate... Malo takes on some country classics here on an effort that could have been recorded by Patsy Cline not so many years ago. Anyone wanting to kick off your shoes, sip a glass of wine, and cuddle up with the one you love is guaranteed to be more than satisfied with this one! And as I said before, what a voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Raul thinking?","review":"I love Raul malo - have most of his albums - and those of the MNavericks. But he has fallen off the wagon on this album. What was he thinking? The \\"over 80\\" market will just love this one - but not me. I've heard all these songs before - better performed and arranged... I gave it away to my 84 year old StepFather after only one listening - he loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 Steps Back","review":"I have purchased every CD,VHS and DVD of Raul and The Mavericks Plus Los Super Seven.Raul puts on a tremendous live performance.Having has seen him 6 times.But he has taken 10 steps back in this recent cd.Most of the songs have no feel or soul.If his new band members really cared about Raul,they would have voiced their opinion and STOPPED this CD from ever being made.Have to say this the first time I had ever thrown away a CD.Raul's version of most of the songs on this cd make me feel like I am having 32 teeth drilled at the same time without novacaine.Raul,PLEASE call Robert,Paul,Eddie and Jerry Dale,make up and then make a New Mavericks CD.Please don't become Estaban or a Washed up Pat Boone trying to make music/covers that just don't suit you.As a fan of yours for 16 years,PLEASE make a change and let me be a fan for year 17.Thanks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing...","review":"I've been a big Raul Malo/Mavericks fan for many years and I've got to say this one is a major letdown after his last solo effort. There are a few good moments with \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\", \\"It Only Hurts Me When I Cry\\", and \\"Husbands and Wives\\". But others like \\"Take These Chains from My Heart\\" and \\"Crying Time\\" lack that soul and feeling Raul puts into his work. \\"Pocket of a Clown\\" is an embarrassment and I'm not quite sure what he was thinking on that one.I would have given this at least two stars, but subtracted one due to the album is just over thity-seven minutes in length. Unforgivable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"class with a capital C","review":"I first heard Raul Malo's singing on the Gram Parsons Grievous Angel tribute. To say Raul Malo has a voice blessed by angels is hardly an overstatement. On 'After Hours' you'll find many a familar tune paid due respect by this gifted vocalist. Sincere adaptions one and all. Anytime, anywhere, it just has to be good listening.

This record is amazing, by this time you'll know that and this special edition is a perfect celebration for the best metal record of 2005. Excellent 5.1 mix and the documental is great, more than forty minutes inside the creation of the record an interesting interviews.The cover of Deep Purple is fantastic, excellent choice for a band that's open minded and with no limitations, great feeling.Ghost Reveries is one of the best experiences you can find in music out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still At The Helm Of Metal!!","review":"I bought this album because of the DVD.. and extra book pages and the packaging of this one hell of an album. GHOST REVERIES!! Indeed an astonishing album. My life have changed since the day I was exposed to Opeth in 2005. Then I realized I have been missing a whole lot.. I went to purchase all Opeth's back catalogues... Once you are a fan of Opeth you will be a fan for LIFE!!!!. I have a big Opeth's logo tattoo on my back.. and intend to get more.. I know Opeth will continuously put out quality music...Well as for this special edition.. I might say this is a great collection to add to your Opeth's library.. I don't even care much about soldier of fortune but appreciate it for Opeth's stepping out of their limelight and honored the legends. Opeth has always been a diversed group of people making music of diversed genre... Get a copy for yourself if you wanted to experience Opeth in 2006.

I've tossed a complete set out after just four years of use. I'm aware there is a warranty, but why replace bad with bad? Besides, the process for warranty replacement has less appeal than a root canal. It's a joke.YOU REALLY OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check around on the Internet for consumer feedback/reviews on this overpriced and overrated cookware. Again and again you'll read about how the nonstick surface eventually discolors, then forms little bubbles, the surface degrades, then finally loses all its nonstick qualities. Take the time to read customers' 1-star ratings here on Amazon for both sets and single pieces, and you'll read the same thing over and over again.

It failed before the store warranty ran out. One down. The replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and wouldn't boot. Two down. Sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free RMA. That one also failed. Three down. They replaced it with both a m230 AND a 2GB c150. The c150 hung after about 2 weeks. Four down. I have been using the m230 for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the c150 replacement arrives. I have gotten quite good at the RMA game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or I get one of those that other people rave about.I don't think I'll buy another SanDisk - unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty.I suggest that everyone with a failed m230 to exercise thier warranty rights.

It does everything you want. It doesn't have a Huge storage, but I have 92 subscription songs plus a 6 hour audio book on mine. It's sufficient for the gym and casual use.no, it's not an ipod, but it definitely does the job. In fact it has several features going for it over any iPod. 1) FM tuner 2) Recording 3) Subscription Audio files 4)Replaceable Battery(!!!!).

But I actually sided with my colleague and gave this SanDisk a shot.The button size is great, allowing me to easily change tracks or adjust the volume without even looking at the player. The menu is simple and easy to navigate. The backlight is quite useful, and the amount of time it is active can be adjusted. The included radio is a nice touch as well. The number of hours of operation from a single AAA battery is quite impressive.My only complaint: It would be nice if the track names scrolled faster.This may not be as \\"glorious\\" as an iPod, but then again, music is music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal! even plays chinese songs","review":"I'm really amazed when I saw the title and singer's name displayed in chinese on this little mp3.

The exact same thing happened again. As I returned this model again, the store clerk privately told me that there had been many returns on this particular model and he advised me to try either Iriver or Samsung.

It basically works like a slow version of the ipod shuffle.3. The directions suck4. It says that you can have 20 preset radio stations but it does not even tell you how to preset them.5. The stupid instalation cd got stuck into my computer luckily i got it out.I got this because my other mp3 player which i bought cheaply broke after 6 months but i deciede just to stick to my portable cd player which i have had for 2 years it is big and all but atleast it does its job."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only prob is no stop button/function besides pwr off","review":"i love the mp3 player. sure there isnt a folder system but organized by artist is fine (with legit songs) for me. the big thing is not being able to stop the music besides pausing and turning off the mp3 player. is there some way around it like pressing two certain buttons at the same time or smth? lol i would rate it five stars if it was present (minor nusiance for some) ---so easy to use !! :-Di bought it from j& r music world only because there was a 10$ rebate (69.99-10.00= 59.99) and besides, i wouldn't have to wait for the mp3 player to arrive to my door; the downside of J&r; was the NY sales tax that came up a tad higher than i expected so my purchase came up to 75$ and after rebate it will be 65$ instead of less than amazon (with supersavings and tt long wait with supersavings). if only sales tax could be abolished!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I've owned this device since December 2005. If all you want to do is drag and drop mp3 files and play, it is OK for that. But beware! For virtually any other audio use, look elsewhere. For audible.com content the player injects static every minute or so making the listening intolerable. I've been unable to make it work with subscription music services, like Yahoo To Go. Every few days I have to reset the battery to basically cold boot the device as the buttons stop working.Also be aware that this device has two different modes, which I still haven't quite figured out, making it difficult to use on different computers.

The sound quality and loudness is perfect for me. I am able to download songs very easy (i use limeware). It is very simple to use. If I could do it over agin I would probably get the 1 gig player.

When you are trying to copy music on this player it takes forever. I guess, it's verifying some stuff, and in the end decides that I have rights to play this music, but it does that at my expense by slowing down loading music to maddening slow. If I would see DRM \\"feature\\" in the description, I would never buy that player. I guess, I was not attentive enough.Another defect of this player is that it does not plugs into USB port directly, but through a special small cable. It's standard (standard to mini), but it's very easy to misplace and it is never at hand when you need it.And last problem is again related to DRM. When I plug it into the computer, it does not show as a storage device, it shows as \\"audio device\\". Pardon me? It should be audio device in my pocket, not in my computer! In computer it should be simply a flash drive when I can copy the music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermittent problems....bad firmware?","review":"As soon as I received my m230 I began transferring music to it. During the transfers the m230 stopped accepting new songs saying it was full _and_ all of the files I transferred disappeared! When looking at drive properties the m230 shown it was 50% full. I ended up downloading newer firmware for the device which fixed the problem, I thought.A few weeks later when I powered on the device it said \\"device full...please remove 4mb\\" Again it wouldn't play any music because it said it was empty. When connecting the m230 to my computer it shown the computer was 50% full but there were no files visible!Even worse Sandisk wants you to pay for their RecoverPro software to recover the lost mp3's on the device.Again I ended up fixing the problem again with a newer firmware (2.2.5) that was just released. But how long before this happens again?Too many problems with the m230! Stay away from this device!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice for the price","review":"I have owned this product for over three months and I am very satisfied. So much so that I bought one for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. The only drawback that I find is that the display is difficult to read when it is strapped to my arm, (older eyes!). But since I know the button placement, which is very simple, I can find my way around my recorded music very easily. The radio reception is also good. Be prepared to change batteries, since I workout 4 times a week I go through a battery a month. Keep extras with you at the gym because once you are used to working out with music, and it stops all of a sudden, all the fun stops too! Great unit for the price.

It was Easy to use, and had NO PROBLEMS downloading Music with the Windows Media Player. Even if it Broke down today, WE have Gotten our moneys worth on this PRODUCT!

Find it to be a great value and excellent MP3 player for the price. I had bought the same model through Circuit City prior to finding it on Amazon and can confirm that Amazon has the much better deal. Great sound and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little MP3 Player!","review":"I have really enjoyed my Sansa. I use it to listen to Audio books that I am able to download from my library. I listen to it while I am doing housework, taking a walk, cooking.... ect. The only drawback is that it takes so long to fast forward through a file. The books I download are one long file and if I should accidentally loose my place in the file it does take a long time to fast forward or rewind to my place. Other than that I have no complaints at all. The battery life is good, it is real easy to navigate, easy to upload your files to it. Very good price for the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a first-time user","review":"This was my first experience with any type of digital music player so I'm no expert, but I have been very happy. It is easy to use, instructions are clear, and the sound quality is good. I don't know what an advanced audiophile would think, but I think it is very good for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"M230 Great Product But Backlight Uneven?????","review":"I got this during the day after Thanksgiving sale for $39.99. Cannot beat it for the price after comparing it to the pricer Apple product. I am an MP3 novice as I use this to listen to lectures recorded on my notebook etc. instead of music. Very satisfied with the size and functionality of the product. It could use AM in addition to FM though but have yet to see a player this size offer both. Question for those who have this product is how is the backlight on yours? Can someone who has one of these tell me of the backlight on theirs is a bit uneven? Light seems to be at Sansa logo end instead of SanDisk end and is brighter where the light is physically located. I dont expect laptop quality backlighting but I have a watch with Indigo backlighting and it is not ueven. Perhaps the light on my is crooked pointing up instead of directly toward the other end causing the uneveness? Is yours like this? Is mine defective? Thanks in advance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audible Users Beware","review":"I purchased this player to listen to Audible Books. Audible lists this player on their site and it came from SanDisk bundled with information about Audible Books. You would think that it would be suitable for listening to Audible Books. BEWARE! I used it in my car and stopped and started the player as I ran errands. Most of the time when restarted it jumped ahead about 4 minutes and I had to rewind and try to find my place. I contacted SanDisk Support and they told me that it was a \\"limitation\\" on the player due to buffering. I told them that any consumer would consider it a defect and would never purchase it for this use if they were aware of this \\"limitation\\". I asked that they provide me a player that was suitable for this use. They never replied to this request. I would avoid SanDisk products as they misrepresented this player and do not stand behind their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"MP3 Player","review":"I like this product for my use.

I used it for recording things and listening to them. It played back fine. And the radio was very good too. The only problem is, Why not AM Radio stations? Why not? Still I would give it a 4 star rating.I bought this Sandisk about August 2008. It's now Jan 2009. Again I would record on this Sandisk MP3 player. This MP3 player skipped a little bit at first. Now the skipping is horrendous. I sound like Max Headroom only worse. I have a clue as to what is the cause of this problem. Perhaps China could practice better quality control and perhaps treat their workers better and stop using slave (prisoner) labor.It is now 5 months after purchasing this MP3 player. Maybe Sandisk has corrected this problem. The question is am I going to plunk down money to find out?

It has a couple of quirks - like sometimes it freezes up on us and I have had to pop the battery out to get it re-started. It's really small, lightweight and easy to use. The instruction manual, however, is VERY basic and it's been trial and error figuring out how to download and edit songs. All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with it for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good player for the money","review":"I purchased this player for my son and we are both very pleased with what you get for the money. The sound quality through the earphones provided is terrific and the features are plentiful for a player that cost us about $63.My personal list of improvements would be a longer USB cable for data transfer and a slightly brighter backlight. I also have difficulties with obtaining a strong signal using the radio, but this may be more an issue with where I live versus the ability of the player. Overall, if you are looking for a solid player and not looking to pay the IPOD prices, this is a great player to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I found this product very difficult to use. Despite reading the instructions (over and over), I was unable to load my mp3 files onto this device. The instructions were way too sparse--I know this is an unusual complaint.

I spent 3 hours (or more) looking up online help, looking at the included CD, just randomly trying what works on my iPod, but to no avail. I became so frustrated, I returned the product and bought an iPod Shuffle. This was a gift for my 11 year old nephew and I was looking forward to it based on the reviews I had read.

This the first one we've had. The only problem we've had is we can't figure out how to set a playlist. The instructions that come with it don't give much information. You pretty much have to figure it out yourself. The product itself seems pretty good, but they should give more detailed instructions for us newbies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little devil","review":"This is a nice little Mp3 player. First one we have ever had, so can't say how well it stacks up to others. But, it is very easy to understand and use. Works with media player like a dream, didn't even have to have anything special. The FM tuner is pretty handy too. We live up on a hill, so we get really good reception for most of our radio stations that are even 25 - 30 miles away in different towns. It has never skipped, and we like the size and almost nothing weight. It is nice to slip in a pocket and has a key lock on it so you don't have to worry about hitting a button on accident. I would definately recommend it to others. We are considering buying another so my husband and I can both have one, and I guarantee it will be another Sandisk (maybe with a little more memory)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!!","review":"I purchased this product mainly for the radio tuner to use at the gym. They have tvs that use the radio stations, in order to listen to them. The signal is great in the gym, don't have any problems there.

I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, so so","review":"Honestly, you get what you pay for. From the minute I got this thing in the mail, I loaded it up with music, put new batteries in and was ready to go. Unfortunatly, the device was not. I had to keep playing with the battery to get it to turn on. When it did finally turn on, I listened for a bit and put it on pause.....when I did that, it shut off and once again, I was playing with the battery to get it to work. I've tried Energizer Lithium batteries and Duracell thinking maybe it was the battery but sad to say, it wasn't. Like I said, you get what you pay for...what do you expect for 20 bucks? lol. When it wants to work, it is great....but those with little or no patience are urged to stay away from this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny unit = Big music","review":"Can't believe how tiny this thing is! I've had walkmans and portable CD players and even 1st generation mp3 players (RCA Lyra - junk!) and this thing is truly \\"portable\\". You could probably fit 5 of them in your shirt pocket. It has an easy to learn interface. Comes with a cable to attach to a USB port on your computer. Then you can just drag and drop .mp3 files directly to the Sansa. No special software or .mp3 conversion functions required (like the Lyra, gah!). Even the tiny earbuds it comes with put out a great sound. Just wish the memory was portable so you could swap it ala compactflash. Holds plenty of songs but I used it every day so I swap the playlist a lot. I probably should have gotten the 1GB model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bargain","review":"This is a nice little MP3 that doesn't cost much. We were buying one each for a niece and nephew, so we didn't want to get into too much money. I had an RCA, but wasn't happy with that so I decided to go with a different brand.The transfer for this player is easy and it works well with both Musicmatch jukebox and Windows Media. The Sound quality is good, the headphones aren't spectacular, but how many MP3 players come with great headphones. The menu system is good and makes it easy to select what you want, but I also like the fact that it is not necessary. The player will start playing as soon as you turn it on.I don't know if I will still love it down the road, but right now it is great. And more importantly it is a great bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service at SanDisk","review":"Buyers BEWARE of doing business with SanDisk.....The MP3 player is great and easy to download on. Very easy to use, even though no directions are given in the package. My complaint is with SanDisk themselves. My MP3 player arrived in a sealed and non-damamged package- however the headphones had a short in them. You could only get music from the right ear. I registered the product with SanDisk and asked for them to please send a pair of replacement earphones. I was sent a response from them stating they would try to accomodate me, but the next time that I damage or lose an item- I would have to go to the local electronics store. The headphones are evidently poor quality and it is a shame that the company will not stand behind their product and then accuses people of damaging or losing items vs. admitting their headphones stink. I will not do any business with SanDisk in the future, as I now see how they treat their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing mp3 player","review":"Light weight, great design, great sound, easy to use... comes with armband and battery... it worths every penny paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage","review":"This thing was nothing but trouble from the get go.

The big issue was that it runs on batteries. Well, it DID run on batteries until it broke and wouldn't run anymore. For some reason, the programing on it corrupted. I would not recommend getting this version of the SanDisk Sansa.

However, the quality is great and the battery life is outstanding. The ear buds are amazing and can compete with any other headphones I have in my collection. I tried out the iRiver H10 with 40GB and it was too huge and although it could hold alot of songs, it was too time consuming going through all of them. This play now (the Sansa) is just right. I put all of my favs on it and just go. It syncs effortlessly and comes with a nice little case so your screen wont be scratched and you can run with it. I honestly toss it in my purse everyday and it still works fine. I would seriously suggest buying this if you're looking for a cost efficient device with more features than the oh-so-famous iPod.

I don't like to run with earphones when I am outside, but at least twice a week, I run on a treadmill. This MP3 is perfect for my indoor running. I stored about 100 MP3 songs and I am in my own world for 30-60 minutes. It is extremely light and comes with an armband. The battery life is long. When the juice runs out, then just swap the battery (it tells you how much battery juice you got left). It is a lot better than worrying about recharging.So, if you are a simple guy who just want some music while exercising, then this is perfect for you.

The manufactor does not disclose the fact it is not compatible with a Mac computer, until you call for tech support at SanDisk.

I use it daily and have had no problems with it. Like most people, I replaced the ear buds with some better ones that I already had. Don't buy this device for playing FM stations unless you are staying still in one place. The USB adapter cord has to be in place to get any stations, and the stations fade in and out with any movement. I've not used the voice recording feature. The USB mass storage device interface for moving mp3's to the device is a bit strange in that it doesn't show up in windows XP as a separate drive letter, but as a separate device under my computer. Also only music files can be copied to it. Even with the above comments, it does it's simple playing job really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No USB port","review":"It may have been my mistake, but when the ads say that this works with virtually all printers and it is becoming increasingly common that home printers come with a USB connection, why not make it clear that this will not work with those printers?

The quick-start worked for me without changing anything from the way it was configured from the factory. I know from past experience that setting up new devices, especially wireless, can be hit or miss- one small thing not quite right can lead to hours of frustration (as per other reviewers who were not quite so lucky). I had no problems this time and did not need to call Linksys technical support although I would not have hesitated to do so because they have been very helpful in the past.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed...","review":"This is a nice, compact, straightforward accent to our wireless network.

It was great to release the PC from it's print server duties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!!","review":"It doesn't matter how well a device is designed if someone other than the designer tries to write the user manual. It seems to me that in order to save money, Linksys had someone in India write a manual that's supposed to be written in English. They could have saved even more money by not including a manual at all and telling you to figure it out on your own. After spending the better part of a year off and on trying to set this print server up, I decided to let the dog play with it and buy something else.

The manual leaves a lot to be desired - there are several key steps in the set up that are completely missed. Tech support was fine, after the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so easy to set up","review":"Unlike most Linksys products that I'm fond of, the printserver was difficult to set up. Once configured, it worked as advertised, but as a person significantly more experienced with Wi-Fi than the average consumer, I was disappointed by how much networking knowledge was required.Also, it's important to know that each computer from which you intend to print, must have a new Linksys software driver installed. Once installed, you must run a configuration routine to handshake with the printserver (on each computer). I happen to also have an Adobe Distiller print driver installed on one of my Windows XP laptops, and it rendered it inoperable.I will still use the Linksys printserver because the alternative of running cable is not a pleasant one, but be prepared to spend some time setting it up. Better yet, find a knowledgable friend and ask them for help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but trouble. Returned","review":"First, I am a network manager with loads of experience. Instructions for installation were poor and confusing. You must install and configure in a total wired network. Get is working and configure the wireless section (not very good instruction here). Then, power down, disconnect the cable from the linksys and power up.Never worked. Spent over an hour on the phone with linksys tech support. Did everything 5 times from at least 8 different angles. Didn't work. Linksys said return for a replacement. Not me, I'm returning for a refund. Steer clear of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful with All in One Printers","review":"After trying to get any of the Linksys Wireless Print Servers to work for the last couple of days, I find out from their helpdesk they do not work with many of the multifunction printers offered . Be careful before you go through what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful what you choose as your SSID","review":"I have no explanation for this, but I could not get my unit to work until I changed my SSID. First, I wanted to use the SSID of \\"Enterprise\\". I could not get it to work in the wireless mode. I double checked everything including the 128 key with no luck. All of my other wireless cards worked fine with this setting. Just not the WPS11. So, I changed my SSID to \\"work\\" (along with the rest of my network including the WAP etc). Suddently, it was like magic. Everything worked fine! If your having problems getting this unit to work, try using a different SSID. Maybe it did not like how long \\"enterprise\\" is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, if it only worked","review":"If, like me, your computers are in different rooms than your cable modem and not every PC has a printer attached, a standalone printserver unit talking wirelessly to the cable/DSL network sounds like a good idea. However, after spending nearly 2 hours on the phone with Linksys Tech Support one Saturday morning, I gave up. Although the guy helping me was quite expert, we could not get the Wireless PrintServer to print a test page on either of my printers (an old, obscure Epson PostScript laser or newer Canon bubble-jet) directly connected to the unit parallel port. Nor could we load through a web browser or ping the DHCP-assigned IP address that was given the WPS11 by the Linksys Wireless 4-port Cable/DSL Router (which has worked perfectly, BTW). And that was over a direct *wired* LAN cable connection to the router, or even a crossover cable directly into my laptop. Nothing, nada, zip. So it's been returned to Amazon.com for credit. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperweight...","review":"It was advertised as being a decent little print server for the money... but I can't for the life of me get it working with a standard laserjet printer. Software is riddled with errors (lots of error codes) and when you can get it to find the print server, it can't ever find any attached printers. Let me add that the instructions mandate that the printer AND the print server need to be HARD WIRED via LAN to the router during install... a point not advertised. Kind of hard when you have a large, heavy printer on one end of the house and a router on the opposite side of the house. Product itself is crap... with more than ten years of networking experience, I can't figure it out... but the company was great in standing by me and issuing a refund on the order. For that, I'll definitely order from them again.... just not THIS product."},{"rating":"1","title":"hit or miss","review":"I ordered the Linksys Wireless PrintServer (WPS11) along with the 4 port router (BEFW11S4) and wireless network card (WPC11). The router and wireless card were easy to setup and work great, but I've had nothing but problems with the print server. After spending 90 minutes on the phone with Linksys support (very helpful and they tried very hard to help set it up) I was told the printserver was defective and to return it. I recently received the replacement and once again received another defective item. As I said previously the router and wireless card work great, and the tech support at Linksys spent a considerable amount of time on the phone with me trying to get the items to work, but I'm 0 for 2 with the print server. Looking back I would have probably purchased a router/printserver combo.I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bug ridden, and poorly designed.","review":"Troublesome from the very start, it has two ways to do setup, one is web based, and one is a setup client.This product is so poorly made, there are actually settings in the client program that are reversed in the web setup. (Netmask and gateway are reversed.)The online help is useless. If you try to use their support pages, they take you to the support pages for a previously released product. Worse still, they refer to features and settings that this product doesn't even have. (DIP switches!)Don't bother with this one.... get a real print server. If it has to be connected to your network wirelessly, just buy a wireless bridge and a small network switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems, problems","review":"Too bad, in principle a nice unit, meeting exactly my requirements for wired and wireless operation and connecting to a parallel port printer, but ...I've justed returned my 3rd unit and have now asked for my money back !

Returned the unit because Linksys thought I might have a defective unit. ... Again it did not light. After some time with another Linksys technician, we figured out that the unit must be at least 6ft away from the wireless access point for the WLAN to come on. Otherwise the only way things would work was hardwired. This is not stated anywhere in the manuals. ... Since I had a short hardwire cable the unit had to be close.

After reseting the unit 3 times I was finally able see in on the network in the admin tool, however after that one time, it was gone for good. The instructions are confusing and complicated.

I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy tech support and poor documentation","review":"First off, this item doesn't work with multi function machines. This minor fact isn't shown anywhere on Amazon.com, and was only revealed to me by Linksys after pulling my hair out for an hour trying to set it up on my own, and then another hour going through all sorts of things with one of their...techs.

That said, I spent hours, and subsequently I had my IT department spend days, trying to get it to work. The best we could do was have it work intermittently. We were using Cisco and 3Com basestations with WEP on and off in two different physical environments that each had successful wireless LANs up and running.Linksys help support is borderline abusive. Once they heard I was not using a Linksys basestation, they immediately dismissed all the problems and advised that I return the product. Now I can only hope that Amazon does the right thing and returns my money. Caveat emptor. And Linksys, if you are listening, many a company has faltered due to crappy help support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"BR>If I could give it less than one star I would. Tried two units. Three 2 hour+ sessions with the (very good) Linksys support line. Finally got the unit to recognise the wirless router, then found it willl not work with my Xerox XD100 printer. It will work with my HP printer, but that only has a USB connection. I asked if they have a list of approved printers and was told \\"not yet\\". If you could get it to work it's a brilliant idea, but it was NOT easy to even get to the stage where we could determine that my printer was incompatible. I agree with an earlier comment that it is probably too early in the lifecycle of this device to unleash it on an unsuspecting world. On the other hand, if it does work for you, as it obviously has for a number of people, then I am envious.

I have thus far ran it through a couple of different amplifiers, a Roland FP-3, a MIDI laptop setup, a 1975 Rhodes, and an electric violin and all of them were really fun to play with.

That said, I am also an enormous fan of Ronnie Spector and the Ronettes and dream of similar opportunities for them.This album was not a novelty effort like many others in the genre, but a most significant creative one.

The vocals are muddy, often being drowned out or at least blunted by the layers of sound over, under, and around them.

Mediocre vocals buried under the Phil Spector \\"Wall of Mud\\". A truly dismal recording that gets way more praise than it deserves. Not a good track on the record. If you want production done right get the Beach Boys Christmas album. Now those are vocals. Brian didn't learn from Phil, he bettered Phil.

It was a great Christmas CD. The songs were well chosen and right for the artist singing them. If you are a fan of The Ronettes and Darlene Love, this will \\"tickle your fancy\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in mono","review":"My copy of Sony's remaster of this Xmas classic arrived today. I have to say, this 2009 remaster from Sony is the best it's EVER sounded. My previous CD issue from the early 90s 'Back To Mono' box set is very flat-sounding compared to this new version.As for a previous poster's complaint that it's not in stereo, thank goodness for that! I have the stereo LP issue of this classic album and it definitely loses impact in that format. As Spector himself recognised, his 'Wall Of Sound' relied on one huge conglomeration of sound coming out of both speakers. With stereo separation of the individual instruments into separate channels, the Spector 'Wall of Sound' is effectively halved. The stereo mix is clearer, no arguments there, however in doing so, it destroys the very thing that Spector's original mono mix set out to achieve and succeeded in doing. So cats - go for it - Out with your old copies and replace them with this sparkling new version of one of the greatest Xmas albums of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"¡QUE CASPA MAS INMUNDA!","review":"La primera vez que tuve la desgracia de escuchar este CD fue en casa de una familia colombiana en Sarasota. En esa epoca yo era el manager de un conjunto musical llamado Voces Libres. El cuarteto fue contratado para tocar una serenata la noche del cumpleaños de la señora de la casa, y despues que los muchachos terminaron con su toque fuimos invitados a quedarnos para la rumba. Eventualmente le llego el turno a esta pocilga musical cuando el dueño de casa estaba tocando musica pregrabada. Las voces de los integrantes del Trio Vino Blanco sugieren que el trio deberia haber sido llamado Conjunto Cloaca porque realmente son horripilentas. Los arreglos son malisimos. Da lástima porque todo lo demas que sale de Colombia dentro del ámbito musical es muy pero muy superior. Vino Blanco no le llega ni a los tobillos a otros trios colombianos... como el Trio Martino, por ejemplo. ¡He dicho (en mi humilde opinion)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doughmakers quality is outstanding!","review":"The pebble design makes the baking experience the best.

All relatives told us that was not him as Great- Grandmother was his only wife. We have sence proved the book was correct and in his later life after Grand-mother was killed in a trolley car accident in Kansas City he remarried a third time but had lost all ties to our family. His Obit confirms this.This book than became much more interesting as it related the life and times of hundreds of Craigheads and their friends as they moved to and around this great county of ours.

I even have one holding up some of my son's popsicle-stick artwork with no problem.

In a few years we can go back to the elegant tiny rare earth magnets we used to use, but I'm sure we will still be using these clips for all kinds of thingsThe clip part is really strong. We've used it in a pinch to hold baby bibs on (the velcro goes fast). I took a pair of them on vacation this year for that and they also served to hold all kinds of other things on steel surfaces. The jaws aren't quite big enough to use these on bags of chips, though. Anyway, we've been sufficiently satisfied that I have ordered a total of 3 sets so far. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful","review":"Great clips with tons of uses, always easy to find.These clips live on our fridge, but get used for everything- cereal bags, makeshift bibs with a dishcloth, hanging kids artwork, calendars, and postcards on the fridge, two side by side hold up a pen on the fridge and the sticker chart at the same time.

The roaster's lid has no handle at its top; therefore, the only way to open it is by raising it from the sides. This way it is impossible to protect one's hands against the steam. Large amount of steam accumulates in the roaster during cooking, because the lid is heavy and no steam gets out of the roaster during the cooking process. This is good for cooking but bad for your hands. This defect of the roaster's construction makes it extremely dangerous for you.

There are some tribal music, middle eastern type music which I don't find particularly suitable for Yoga. Also, the music is too loud and I can't hear the instructions very well. If you are very experienced and don't need any instructions you should be able to turn down the music but if you like to hear the instructions, you will find very difficult to listen to.Overall, I would not recommend unless you are a very experienced with Yoga and don't need any instructions (so you can turn down the sound)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yoga workout","review":"I bought this after hearing about it from a yoga studio owner in Pennsylvania.

I WAS a beginner","review":"I tried this video having no experience with yoga before. I felt rejuvinated when finished. The cinematography is compelling, and the instructions are easy to follow. You can take this at your own pace and pause in between exercise groupings when you feel you may need a break without messing up the rest of the workout. When I was finshed I was a little sore, but who isn't after a first workout? I felt open, and a bit jell-o like when finished. The end is the *best* part. You'll find a calmer, newer you after you get into the rhythm. Just pay attention to your breathing and you'll do great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful to see and to hear, challenging and inviting","review":"This video is, as others have said, for those with some yoga experience, but beginners who persevere will benefit as well. The scenery and the music is very relaxing and helps you to focus on your postures. If you follow at your own pace, you will slowly progress and be thrilled as you become more flexible, more relaxed and more energized. I have several yoga tapes, this is my favorite. It is long (almost 1 hour) but I see that as a positive. We all need to slow down and this is a healthy and challenging way to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video for the beginner like me!","review":"I'm a beginner in yoga and this is the first video tape I bought. I'm doing it on almost a daily basis since 2 months now and I am really getting much more flexible. I couldn't do some of the poses at first, not like they do it in the video. But that doesn't really matter. Just go as far as you can. It get's easier every time and it feels great to wake up in the morning not being stiff anymore! I wouldn't want to miss yoga ever again! My only complaint is that the poses are hard to make out sometimes. I bought the book after 1 week so I know exactly where to place my hand etc. Oh and, I don't think it's too hard for the beginner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Difficult for those new to yoga with little instruction","review":"Although the scenery and bodies in this video are lovely and nice to watch,the yoga poses move quickly from one to another with very little instruction on proper form.I am 31 and exercise every day and take a yoga class for 1 1/2 hrs a week. i am in good shape and throughout the video I couldn't help thinking how many people have probably gotten hurt doing it.If you are very experienced in yoga, I would say go for it.

But you'd better be a very advanced student of yoga to even think of being able to keep up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found it At Last!","review":"Like many who have reviewed this video, I purchased the VHS a million years ago. However my story is that I stupidly \\"lent\\" it to a \\"friend\\" who promptly fell in love with the tape and moved out of state (Coincidence? I don't think so) I have searched for it again in all the wrong places, and after reading the mediocre reviews on other yoga DVD's I impulsively typed in Ali MacGraw Yoga, and voila!I have done studio yoga and also sometimes Rodney Yee on cable TV, but I always was pining for this beautiful yoga session. This time it is not leaving my living room, friend or no friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great bargain!","review":"I found this tape soothing and relaxing, but certainly challenging enough in spots! I was able to follow almost all the positions, and am confident I will master the rest of them as I continue to view the tape. Another plus-this tape is simple enough that you can begin to memorize the various routines, and incorporate them into your own workout, without having to turn on the tape. Definitely worth the modest price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Yoga Video!","review":"This is one of my favorite yoga videos. The music and movements make it fun and invigorating, not boring like some other yoga tapes. I think it is great for both beginning and intermediate students, just don't expect to be able to move like the advanced people on the tape do. It is nearly an hour long but the time goes by very quickly. I also love that you don't need any props to do the poses."},{"rating":"1","title":"too easy","review":"i suppose it is a good video if you are truly a beginner and are not very flexible, however i am not an expert myself and i wasn't very challenged. believe it or not the meager buns of steel power yoga video is a shorter but much more intense work-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but...","review":"this tape was not for me. I found the music distracting. I prefer subtle sounds so that I can just focus on the yoga.Also dissapointed that there were no mention of alignment in the poses nor were any variations given.

I am still relatively new to yoga, so the poses were too advanced for me, but I believe when I am further along in my yoga journey, it will be useful and pleasant to practice. It is about 50 minutes long. Not for beginners, but a good video overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely NOT for beginners...","review":"I was looking for a beginners video to \\"get my feet wet\\" in yoga. While I think this is a beautiful video and very useful to those already practicing yoga, it is definately not for beginners. The poses are impossible which is quite frustrating. There are no beginner variations for these poses either. It wasn't until I bought another video that I learned about \\"blocks\\". Had this video included this information it would have been slightly easier. I suggest purchasing a BEGINNER video and using the Yoga Mind & Body video as something to work up to. As I said before, it is a beautiful video and once I work my way up to it I am sure I will enjoy it. The scenery is wonderful, the voices are soft and calming, and there are men and women in the video, but those poses are impossible for a beginner. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empowering and all-consuming","review":"This being my first yoga experience I wasn't sure what to expect or what I would be able to accomplish but, it is an amazing 55 minute experience that I highly recommend.

And I'm really glad I went with it. I was unsure whether I would get the workout i wanted from yoga, but I found that with this tape i had nothing to worry about. I especially like it because I've been able to use it over a long period of time. The poses were challenging at first, but as i got better at them they became challenging in a different way (you'll see what i mean), so I didn't have to run out and buy another video immediately. I like to use it in conjunction with other forms of cardio, though. It feels best when you do it after a half-hour run. I would definitely reccommend it to people interested in trying yoga. Just make sure you have a mat or a carpet. Doing it on a wood floor with neither is pretty uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.. just not enough!","review":"I am a yoga instructor and a big fan of Eric Schiffman, which is why I bought this video. Schiffman is an excellent yoga instructor so this video is very good. I wish he could have included another programme though and the relaxation section at the end is a bit too short for my taste.The music is a bit too energetic but otherwise this is a very satisfying yoga practise video if you have been practising yoga for some time. Definitely not for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all relaxing","review":"There is no way this video is for beginners.

The poses were not appropriate for yoga beginners and I found McGraw's instruction to be, at times, annoying. The purpose of yoga is to reach personal goals in flexibility and in clarity of mind, not to be rushed into bending and posing without the proper relaxation. I was thoroughly unhappy with the video and do not recommed it to any prospective yoga participants!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this rated so high? Big disappointment.","review":"I don't understand it. Why on earth is this rated so high? I bought this DVD based on the great reviews here. I just wanted a good yoga video with a great instructor. I didn't find it here. This instructor (who looks strangely out of shape, why would I want to look like him?) doesn't instruct much. The middle eastern music is annoying. (I prefer new age music for yoga). I'm NOT new to yoga, but I'm just not that flexible and probably never will be. Where are the variations for people like me? Avoid this DVD unless you're advanced, don't need much instruction and can bend like a pretzel. I, like many other reviewers, found the music extremely distracting.

It is not made for people who are totally out of shape and want to try yoga to \\"relax.\\" Stay on the couch if you want to relax. Yoga is for increasing physical, spriritual, and mental strength, and can sometimes be vigerous or even difficult (like everything that can bring about improvement in ones life).

To know yourself you have to go to a place you can learn who you are. Yoga invites you to do this. I don't get into the deeper spiritual side, but prefer to indulge in the stretching and relaxing techniques.At night, light a candle and practise this session in the evening before you go to bed. In the morning you can push yourself a little harder and warm up your muscles for maximum stretching potential.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't slept or felt better!!","review":"I have osteoarthritis in my lower back and also problems with my left wrist. I started doing this DVD 2 weeks ago and my back and wrist are feeling 85% better. The exercises help put your body into alignment and also strengthen your muscles. By the end you are totally relaxed and feel like you have had a full body massage. I have been sleeping much better and night and have not experienced the aches and pains in my joints that I ususally do. It is an excellent workout for the whole body.You have to keep in mind that you need to work up to the level of the people on the DVD and only go into the twists and back bends until you feel a light stretch and slowing work up to it. Otherwise you my get injured. But you will not get bored as this DVD is something to keep growing with.It is beautifully and professionally done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe not for beginners","review":"I like this video a lot. Since I'm a beginner I can't do all of the poses but I'm not too worried about that. Patience. The one complaint I have is that there isn't enough explanation for each pose. I feel that beginners really need more detailed verbal explanation, especially since you can't look at the tv screen in many of the poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Workout","review":"My yoga instructor has been teaching yoga for more than twenty years. She is one of the most healthy, fit and enlightened people that I've ever met. This is the video that she follows several times a week as part of her own practise. I can't imagine a better recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!!","review":"I was introduced to this DVD about 6 months ago. I fell in love w/ it immediately. The beautiful scenery and Erik's soothing and calming voice inspire me to reach further into poses and perfect my form. The soundtrack is also a big plus (Dead Can Dance) and encourages me to open myself to the sky. I practice this DVD every evening (sometimes twice a day if time allows) and at least do the sun salutations after my morning run. I highly recommmend this dvd for beginners and anyone else that is interested in getting in shape both mentally and physically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but....","review":"The scenery in this tape is gorgeous (but on the other hand, who really concentrates on the TV screen during yoga practice?). During this yoga session, Erich Schiffman places emphasis on the emotions that accompany the physical sensation of yoga; the effect is wonderful. The downside, though, is that many important physical cues necessary to start your yoga practice off moving correctly and to get the most out of it are missing. It's too hard for beginners and missing too many elements (like sun salutes - they're on there, but far too modified) for more advanced practicioners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ali MacGraw Yoga","review":"Item was delivered in timely manner and was as described. The VHS tape was beyond my expectations and is a great tool for yoga beginners. Enjoy the environment where it was filmed - very calming. When I master this, I will be looking for other Ali MacGraw - Eric Schiffner yoga tapes or DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Yoga Workout that I STILL use all the time!","review":"I read in a prior review this DVD standing the test of time, and I couldn't have said it better myself. I bought it on VHS in 1994 and recently purchased the DVD. I have other Yoga DVD's I like, but this one ends up in my player over and over again STILL. Excellent music, with a workout that is good for a beginner and challenging enough for a more advanced practitioner. My only complaint is that there isn't MORE like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, easy, repeatable routine-- even for advanced students","review":"I do high-heat (Bikram) yoga pretty regularly, and on days when I feel too sore or lazy to make it to class, I pop this in for a relaxing and somewhat invogorating 40 minute practice. I don't think this could substitute for an advanced student's practice, but it provides a light alternative now and then. I don't find it boring after doing it so many times: the production is top-notch and the instructor has a nice (male) voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect Yoga tape","review":"From the very first moment, this tape is a relaxing joy to behold. The scenery of the White Sands desert is breathtaking, the music is mellow and soothing, and the instructor is a real pro. Not even the more difficult postures seem intimidating as explained by Eric Schiffman. McGraw was smart to abdicate to a true Yoga master. I only wish there were more of these tapes so you could alternate and learn more postures in this serene, enriching format. You will feel strangely relaxed, loose and invigorated all at the same time. They chose great basic postures for both beginners and advanced level Yoga fans to enjoy. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Yoga Tape! EXCELLENT!!","review":"I just ordered this tape the other day, and immediately used it the second I received it! WOW - is all I can say! I am a 3d-designer so I work with computers ALL DAY LONG, and get very ancy and anxious while working on projects. On top of that, I wanted to tone my body. Brisk walks and exercising relieves some stress...BUT YOGA WAS MY ANSWER!! The people on the video are so graceful, and the videotography was absolutely breathtaking! I felt like I had better posture and my muscles felt great the first time after doing it! Did I mention this was my first Yoga tape? If you do decide to try it - don't give up! I felt like I was playing TWISTER and was walking on a slippery floor the first time I used it..couldn't help but laugh at myself for being so \\"unbalanced.\\" But slowly, I'm hoping to be as graceful and spiritual as the people on the video. If anyone has found a better tape than this, please let me know, because I think I've found it already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye Appealing, But Don't Be Deceived","review":"I bought this video for my sibling, and it was soon turned over to me. I was very disappointed with the video. It is visually appealing - white sands, nice video effects, etc. However, very little instruction about the poses was given. Watching the tape several times, you can sort of figure out what to do, but unless you know these poses prior to the tape, it could be dangerous for your body. Precautions on the poses weren't given. Unless you are looking for a video simply to walk you through the yoga you already know, save your money and buy a different video."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR BEGINNERS!","review":"This is a beautiful tape. The cinematography is breath taking. For an intermediate tape, perhaps this video may be ideal. However, this video DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH INSTRUCTIONS for a beginner. Erich does not give alternatives for those who are not yet flexible enough for the poses. In addition, the beautiful sand covers the feet of the models, so one is unable to see which way to point the feet during the stretches. The shots of the clouds and the sand (albeit relaxing) detracts from the overall visual instruction of each pose within the video. Definitely not for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for all levels!","review":"I love this tape! It's great for beginners, and a nice break for the more advanced. I will continue to use this tape for years to come. Of course, I've always been a fan of \\"Dead can Dance\\", the group who's music appears in the background...and was pleasantly surprised with it the first time I did this routine. The scenery is peaceful and beautiful, and Erich Schiffmann is an encouraging instructor. BUY THIS TAPE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One to return to time after time","review":"Beautiful photography filmed outside in the a white sand desert of the southwest U.S. and engaging music make this a standout video for intermediate students of yoga. Erich Schiffmann is a master to emulate and Ali McGraw deserves note for bringing this video to us. Not really for beginners, but an example of what to work towards. My best tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic yoga dvd","review":"I'd heard of this yoga dvd for a couple of years. Finally I rented it from one of the online companies. I was really impressed. Even if you can't get through the entire thing it still will help you. It's difficult and does the Iyengar style of yoga (ie, lots of triangular poses). The triangular poses are great for people with*Hip problems*Hip bursitis*AnyoneI sweated a lot, dripping with sweat and I could only do 1/2 of it. I recommend this as you will feel fantastic after doing it.And as far as Ali McGraw is concerned in this dvd, she's just one of the 3 people doing the poses. She's not teaching it. Erich Schiffman, a reknowned yoga teacher, is the teacher. He has his own dvds so you can get his own dvds as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best produced yoga videos","review":"I really don't have a lot to add to the rest of the 164 reviews but this is really a beautiful yoga workout, good music , relaxing, just a little bit challenging . Not for complete beginners. 56 minutes.The DVD has a menu with chapter selection of every sequence of poses : sun salutations, standing, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"This was the first yoga tape that I bought and I loved it. I found the cueing to be impeccable and very easy to understand. I am fairly flexible, but even some moves I had to be patient with and keep trying. The scenery is beautiful, the music is soothing and invigorating and the instructions given by Erich I found were extremely easy to follow. I would highly recommend this tape to anyone interested in yoga; however, I no longer have a VCR...when are they going to put this on DVD?!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A steal!","review":"This video is great! When I finish it, I feel so incredibly relaxed and at ease. To purchase peace for less than $10 seems impossible, but it's great.I have gone to several yoga classes, but the experience is never as good as following Ali Macgraw in my own home. The privacy and personal space set me at ease. I need not impress any one and need not worry that I can't do the movements as Ali does them. Yoga is a great experience and my body feels so much more whole after I do this video. My only regret is not enough time to do it daily. Still, once or twice weekly makes a major difference in my stress level and attitude. The music, the scenary, the narrator -- it's all together an excellent production."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite yoga video of all time!!!","review":"I do this video every single day. It is stunningly beautiful to watch, relaxing, the voice of the narrator is so soothing, it flows beautifully. The level of the class is great too because even if you are a beginner you can do it, and as you get more advanced you'll simply increase the intensity of the movement. I recommend this video to all of my friends. A perfect 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for beginners who exercise regularly!","review":"I purchased this video a year and a half ago. It is absolutely fabulous! I am over forty, and have been excercising all my life. I run, lift weights, dance and play a lot of sports. I always felt like one piece was missing, and this was it. The scenery and pace is beautiful. I love the music, and the workout makes you feel great. I get up at 5:30am during the week, and do a half hour of SOMETHING each day, so several days a week I do HALF of this tape. On the weekends, I do the entire tape at least once. This is the first yoga tape I ever purchased, but not the last. Nothing else compares to it- I only wish Ali would make another one. I have four sisters and we are all hooked on this tape! Thank you Ali and Eric and the rest of the yoga participants- perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Workout - OK Poses","review":"I can't figure out why this video get such good reviews. The poses are OK, but the workout as a whole is terrible. The video is set in a staged desert environment - no mats - so you never know which direction to set your mat at the beginning of the workout. Also, the transitions are terrible - the video stops filming the people and shows the sand and plants - but the descriptions of what is going on is less than useful so by the time they start showing the people again, you are hurrying to get into the position the individuals are in. I much prefer learning the names of poses and then walking through them - with constant video of the individuals so you can see what is going on. This is terrible. My wife agrees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weight Loss ???","review":"Can you please tell me if this book helps you loose weight or just stay in shape after the weight is already lost? thank You"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Difficult","review":"This video was the most painful yoga workout I have ever done. I wanted something to help me relax and this workout just made me more tense. I had to go to a massage therapist to get out the kinks in my neck and my legs! I wouldn't recommend this tape to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"artistic beyond expectations","review":"artistically and visually stunning! excellent soundtrack. Eric is inspiring and pleasant to listen to. for beginners however, i feel that there is not enough positioning information to be totally safe. for those who know and love yoga, get ready to be charmed by this \\"film\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, no other Yoga video is in this league","review":"This video is superior to others for several reasons. The Yoga instruction by Eric Schiffman is clear, well thought out, and challenging. The actors doing the poses are unbelievable. They will inspire you to do your best. The scenery is stunning as is the production. The music (especially the songs by Dead Can Dance) is mesmerizing. This tape is entertaining enough to simply watch without doing any of the exercises!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Yoga video.","review":"This video is the best! The routines hit all the muscle groups and are very relaxing. I've been into bodybuilding and martial arts for several years and flexability has always been a problem for me. Doing these routines helps me with this problem more than any other method I have tried. I'm not sure if this is a good tape for the beginner. I have a few friends that wanted to start Yoga after years of couch sitting and they found these routines difficult if not impossible at times. Being in the video production business I can say this tape's production quality is first rate and the music is perfect.

Will Lee and Katherine Rule make a striking couple as protagonists against the Soviet Union's attempt to rule the world.Much like THE HUNT FOR THE RED OCTOBER but without the drama. It is a simple, well told in Woods' best style.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Self-Assessment Tool for Today's Leaders","review":"Gardner has done it again by writing an engaging and thought provoking guide on leadership principles. When you compare Gardner to the other great philosphical writers, such as Drucker or Bennis, Gardner's outline and nine principals fill in the gap. Leadership is not power but it includes power. Leadership is not status but it may include status. Leadership is a constant self-evaluation."},{"rating":"2","title":"thumbs up!","review":"It's a must buy, though i've seen it already i really want to watch it over and over again!the characters are easy to follow and add to the humourous addictive plot!it's about a police trainee (miriam) who fails in everything so she gets demoted to being in the \\"lost property\\" department. the police sign her to being an undercover agent *hence the title* because if she dies they have nothing to lose *she has no family, no boyfriend, no pets, no home*.Their target is the son of a rich triad *or something* and a little accident causes the son (daniel wu) to fall in love with her. Of course..the funny thing is..she's pretending to be a waitress and as he slowly falls for her she has to keep her indentity *which is pretty hard comsidering she's a bit dense*the plot is a bit obvious, but the jokes inbetween and all the sweet scenes between miriam and daniel's character makes it all up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"Excellect quality, after receiving my order of two black foam trucker hats, i ordered four more in other colors. will buy again from this vendor for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my size","review":"Didn't fit my head.

On this recent order, the crown is even lower and this hat fits more like a baseball hat. The bill is even harder and the material is even different.I ordered two hats, one white and one black and both of them were completely different from each other even though they were completely the same style in their description (foam mesh trucker hat)I now need to find another vendor to try to match the hat I got from these guys a year ago.Can I send you a hat that you sold me a year ago and replicate the exact fit/style/quality?

Very bad lighting made fight scenes, or any other scene for that matter, unwatchable b/c you couldn't see the people.

These blister/peeling bubbles happened within one to two years of normal use to all but two of the pans we bought. And we bought them based on the so called \\"lifetime\\" warrenty. Here is what happened. We packed up the blistered pans and paid $17 shipping to have them replaced, following the directions exactly from their website. Only to have the box returned unopened with a return shipping charge of $17! They did not even accept the delivery!! Do NOT purchase these pans, find another brand. What a waste of good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIGGEST RIP-OFF IN COOKWARE","review":"Based on my experience after after six months of use, ScanPan is probably the biggest rip-off in cookware there is. Yes, I was thrilled about the performance the first two months, which fulfilled the claims made by the manufacturer. However, I started to notice the pots' \\"nonstick\\" properties became useless after cooking in liquid, such as boiling pasta or soups, and was a huge struggle to make macaroni and cheese in. The food would NOT stop sticking! The only somewhat useful pieces were the frying pans,which retained the nonstick properties (because of cooking in oil?) Also, all the pans and pots took too long to heat up compared to other pots and pans. I had to start buying stainless steel pot to boil my eggs in and will eventually have to replace all my pots.For about $500 per set, I expected these to perform much better. Pots not being able to last after five times cooking in liquid is just too big of a flaw. I seriously got burned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Awhile","review":"We were excited about this set, but after a year, every piece but the pans started to bubble, and there was black stuff in our food as the bubbles popped. Next, the material in the pans wore off, exposing the metal beneath. The smaller pots not only bubbled, but at the usual \\"waterline\\" for the soups and sauces, the material simply flaked off. How much of this material have we consumed? I cannot recommend Scanpan. Even if you strictly adhere to each and every caution, the non-stick material eventually deteriorates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam Pans","review":"As others have written, my expensive ScamPans lost their non-stick properties after about a year. I didn't get the bubbles, but the surface discoloured and now is totally \\"sticky\\". I still use them occasionally, but I use a little oil when I cook in them. They are a nice weight, but a terrible waste of money if you expect them to retain their non-stick properties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I purchased my Scanpan 2001+ back in 1996 when this was a huge expense for me. The first six months were perfect - the best cookware ever. But then the non-stick surfaces began to slowly deteriorate. The smallest saucepan was so bad I threw it out. Now everything sticks.The two large casseroles are the only items that remained perfect, although one did warp in the oven so the glass cover no longer fits well. I now use those two the most, even for frying.I followed the cleaning directions to the letter, did not put them in the dishwasher and I was the only person using the Scanpan.I just got my things out of five-years of storage which is what brought the defects to my attention again. Maybe I'll try returning the damaged items as some of the other reviewers have mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in the beginning...wait a few years","review":"I bought my Scanpan set 10 years ago. I love it when it's new. It cooks evenly and it's truly non-stick. My issue is that after about three years of normal cooking, the ceramic coating starts to bubble and flake off. I now have to send this back to them on my dime for replacement. To me, a lifetime guarantee means I shouldn't have to keep doing this.I have recently replaced my entire set of cookware with another non-stick set. (Pampered Chef Executive Cookware) I bought a few pieces of the other non-stick three years ago at the same time I sent several Scanpan pieces in for warranty replacement (again). The other/new set of cookware is going strong and is not in need of replacement. My scanpan is now a very expensive, though nice, set of camping cookware.For the record, I hand wash my cookware, I don't use non-stick sprays, I only use nylon/plastic or bamboo utensils, and I never use high heat. The long-term performance of this cookware is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WON'T TAKE A LICKING, AND SOON STARTS STICKING ! ! !","review":"Like many other reviewers for Scanpan pieces/sets, my experience with this cookware has been awful. I've tossed a complete set out after just four years of use. I'm aware there is a warranty, but why replace bad with bad? Besides, the process for warranty replacement has less appeal than a root canal. It's a joke.YOU REALLY OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check around on the Internet for consumer feedback/reviews on this overpriced and overrated cookware. Again and again you'll read about how the nonstick surface eventually discolors, then forms little bubbles, the surface degrades, then finally loses all its nonstick qualities. Take the time to read customers' 1-star ratings here on Amazon for both sets and single pieces, and you'll read the same thing over and over again. SERIOUSLY, FOLKS, THINK TWICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam pans","review":"My husband and I spent several hundred dollars getting many of these pans. We followed the cooking instructions while using them and within a year the coating started bubbling and then peeled. With the lifetime warranty we wrote to the company and asked what we could to do to get our pans replaced. To our amazement we were told they would help us only if we had our receipt... So, now we are left with very expensive pans we can't use.. If I were any of you, I would really look at other options... We are very disappointed in the way we were treated and the quality of the pans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warrenty Means Nothing-Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I really liked the idea of non stick that could brown and didnt scratch. And it worked great-for 2 months. Then I noticed little bubbles. I called the company and the surly customer service person said that I would need to ship the pan to them, they would take a look at it and then if they deemed it a manufacturing problem-they would replace it. Of course I had to pay to ship my old pan, the new pan, and a handling charge. Forget it.

Perhaps not as elaborately staged as some of the British mystery series, an enjoyable evening spent with every episode none-the-less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Sound is Terrible","review":"Purchased the \\"Tommy & Tuppence: Set 1\\" as a gift. Picture quality was wonderful on all episodes and the sound quality on \\"The Secret Adversary\\" was likewise. However, the sound on the shorter episodes was non-existent. I contacted Acorn Media and they said that the master from the original production was in \\"mono\\", therefore not of high quality. Acorn Media suggested I change the television setting from stereo to mono to improve the sound quality. It didn't. Only turning the television volume up as high as it can go, are you able to hear any dialog. However, by doing this, you also hear an irritating \\"HISS\\" throughout the program, which is nearly as loud as the dialog/music. Forget it.I am going to return the DVD and get the VHS, to see if it's any better.[June 1, 2006]VHS is much better. Not a VHS fan, but you gotta go where you gotta go."},{"rating":"1","title":"great fun but poor sound quality","review":"Tommy and Tuppence are Agatha Christie light. Good fun and not heavy handed. But the dvd sound quality on two of the episodes is dreadful. To hear the actors the volumn must be turned very high and then there is background static. What a shame to ruin this as the picture quality is better than some Acorn productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body of Song totally great","review":"Bob Mould has embodied rock's dueling impulses-ugly vs. romantic, closeted vs. out, primal vs. tuneful-as fully as anyone in the 25 years since he launched Hüsker Dü and made hardcore punk sing. Lately, his hermetic electronica experiments have followed up on his involvement in the extroverted drag musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch. No new fans need apply here, but those who know and love his sound will find that this self-styled career summation (note title), a nod back to late Hüsker Dü with computerized updates, sprouts horns with repeat listens. Though celebrated for his guitar work, it's the plain and plaintive timbre of his voice that remains most distinctive-gnarled, questioning, hoarse with recrimination. It isn't what he says, it's how he labors it, then releases. Pushing harder than expected, it's the beauty of his unloveliness. Highly remmend it a wonderful cd by a fantastic artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next stage of Bob evolution...","review":"I was introduced to Husker Du in 1987 and have been a huge fan ever since. When discussing music with anyone I name Bob Mould as my favorite musician. With that said...This is a great album. While I respected Bob for his brave departure from the safe zone with Modulate, I was sorely disappointed. Body of Song's mix of Bob's trademark rockin' guitar, his awesome voice and evolutionary interest in electronic music work great and have a hypnotizingly unique blend. Sometimes dance-clubby, sometimes hauntingly melancholy, sometimes an angry freight train - Body of Song is successfull in being eclectically punk rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time","review":"I would place Workbook on my list of top 10 desert island discs, and I have been a huge fan of Bob since Metal Circus. I have greatly enjoyed the transitions of Bob's music over the years, but Body of Song is just a collection of throwaway songs. I really wanted to like this CD, but just couldn't stand listening to it after a few listens. No, it never did grow on me. Bob's worst effort to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"18 years and counting...","review":"that's how long it's been since i saw Husker Du bring down the house in New York in 1987 during their farewell tour. unfortunately, Bob hasn't come up with anything i liked since then and this is no different.

Great support, very comfortable (may take a few days to get used to them, but well worth it).

It has a money back guarantee! Try it first before customs. Also, they are extremely durable. If this product feels uncomfortable the first couple of time you wear it...that's because you're muscles, tendons, and ligaments in your feet aren't used to the change. You must adapt, as in anything else, before you see results. How good are these. Let's put it this way. I haven't bought a pair of any type of shoe (except Chaco sandals) in over 7 years that a powerstep wasn't put in to, while I was trying on the shoes.

The tension of that period, which many have now forgotten, is captured in his work. It is as if \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\" had been set to music in the 3d Symphony. This work first appeared on LP on the Everest label with Arnold conducting. Other versions of the work suffer from pace -- too fast. There is no better version available than the composer's own. Listeners unfamiliar with Arnold know him nevertheless: in the 1940s and 50s he frequently scored movies, among them \\"Breaking the Sound Barrier,\\" \\"Bridge on the River Kwai,\\" \\"Tunes of Glory,\\" and \\"The Key.\\" The superb brass work in his music reflects his own background: first trumpet for some of England's leading orchestras. His guitar concerto is an overlooked masterpiece. But anyone who wants to explore this remarkably versatile composer should begin with the 3d symphony conducted by the composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance and sound","review":"This is apparently the Everest recording that was first released as stereo LP SDBR 3021.

Instead, I found unsubstantiated statements sprinkled with sarcasm.Throughout this book Edwards makes many claims of the historical, but not once does he say where he gets his information. A man with his level of education surely knows how to footnote and endnote. Maybe what he says is true, but how are his readers to know?For those who want to understand the early church I suggest readingWill the Real Heretics Please Stand Up: A New Look at Today's Evangelical Church in the Light of Early Christianityby David Bercot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same thesis, better alternative available","review":"While Edwards' premises are factual, he does not document them, thus the analysis underlying his positions comes across as 'prideful' (as one reviewer put it).

I understand that Viola is a friend and compatriot of Gene Edwards; he has done a far better job of making the case, in my view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startlingly original dissection of first-date discomfort.","review":"It may not seem that the awkwardness of a first date between typically lonely New York City coworkers would hold much interest, but Tom Noonan's film has enough twists and turns to make it memorable. His writing and directing are incisive and original, but his greatest coup was the casting of Karen Sillas as the offbeat law office secretary whose seemingly mundane life masks some uncomfortable secrets. Sillas, an indie film favorite, is one of the best actresses in films today; the power of her performance as it builds in nuance and intensity must be seen to be believed. The movie will definitely make you think twice about having a first date in a 'neutral' (and public) location. Highly recommended. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment !!!","review":"Very!

However it still is an enjoyable mystery.I will say there are plot twists that pop up in other of the movie versions, which I won't give because I don't want to spoil it. It also obviously was a two part episode when originally broadcast, which took away from it. But still it was well acted.Most of the time, I don't figure out who did it but at the revelation I recognize the clues I missed. This one wasn't that way.

It is a very basic, single DVD with no real bonus features; however, the sound and video quality are excellent.It has English audio track in addition to a Japanese option with English subtitles. It played great with absolutely no problems on my cheap DVD player I got from Walmart here in America several years ago. No guarantees on how it will do in players in other regions.I don't normally watch special features, so this simple, affordable DVD is exactly what I was looking for.DVD two is here:Innocent Venus, Vol. 2: Blood of BetrayalDVD three is here:Innocent Venus, Vol. 3: The End of the New Beginning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Perhaps because I am newly divorced, i loved this story.

Your money and your time would be better spent on his earlier works, or on other Asian Cult Cinema releases like \\"Madame O\\", \\"Blind Woman\`s Curse\\" or Teruo Ishii\`s \\"Horror Of Malformed Men\\" - all of which are a lot more fun and enjoyable to watch, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazing Mr. Trunnell","review":"Written 100 years ago, a wonderfully written tale of the sea.

I tried Cephalon, Cuisinart, Le Creuset and this ScanPan. After two years this pan still looks brand new even tho I use it the most. I love the glass lid, it heats up in no time, cooks perfectly evenly and truly cleans effortlessly. I have never been able to burn anything in it. The Cephalon non-sticks I bought at the same time are now worn out and I am replacing them today with ScanPan non-stick. I have not tried the ScanPan steel, they are a different line. The Le Creuset dutch oven, by the way, is my second favorite pan. My mother always told me to buy the best pans you can afford because you will never get rid of them. She was right, throwing cookware in the trash is difficult for me, even when that it where it belongs. Save yourself the anguish and get a set of these, you will still be using them when they pack you off to a nursing home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit","review":"States it fits Walther PPK/S handgun but it does not.

Ababio shares his tale of trying to capture the American dream to find that the tradition and culture that shapes him and sends him is the very essence of what has drawn generations to this melting pot and makes it great.A compelling perspective of the immigrant's view looking in. We will all love our country more by reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Perspectives on Rural Medicine","review":"I am a student who will likely attend medical school in Fall 2009 for rural medicine. I loved this book, and felt that, while at times a little hard to read (this is no beach reading), it was interesting and thought-provoking. Each story of each physician working with a rural population helped me cement my interest in working with this often overlooked area. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Pennsylvania healthcare, rural healthcare in general, or medicine for underserved populations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational stories of rural doctors","review":"After reading this book, I have a greater appreciation and admiration for rural family doctors. As I read each chapter, I was able to experience the doctor/patient interactions as if I was right in the exam room.All of the doctors profiled in this book possess unique character traits that make them so engaging.What is unique about this book is that it not only gives you insight into the medical practice of these doctors, but it gives you an intimate look at their lives. It explores how rural medical practice is intimately connected to all aspects of life in a small town.This book was beautifully written and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute novelty","review":"Loved using this for corn on the cob.

William Hung is just so horrible that I'm going to leave it there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hung is always out-of-season","review":"Back for yet another album, and this time, a Christmas album, William Hung continues to make the music world appear to be a big, laughable joke.Sure, who hasn't seen that famous clip from Season 3 in 'American Idol' where William butchered Ricky Martin's 'She Bangs'? It's one of the most famous clips in history. And I confess, when I first saw it, I chuckled a bit.But the joke isn't funny anymore. Hung is tone deaf, but you already know that. So why buy his music? He's not funny. And since he's getting signed, as I've stated before, why isn't the tone deaf lady in the shower getting signed? I mean, seriously, folks, this has gone on long enough.Enough with the CDs and stupid inspirational messages, Hung!I can't recommend this to anyone. For the first time in my life, I wish I could give this 0 stars. Please, do yourself (and your ears) a favor and stay far away from this tone deaf kid we call William Hung.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Ho Hung (over)","review":"Okay, there is a point to this CD. It's about laughing all the way to the bank, and really, can you blame the guy? He's managed to turn being tuneless, unattractive and generally clueless into a lucrative business. Would anyone buy this album? Sure, why not, if you're looking to torment your friends and family. If it was less expensive, say $3.99, I'd be giving it to half a dozen people on my gift list, just for the pleasure of watching their look of horror upon opening it.Those who are recommending other albums instead of this one are missing the point. There simply is no alternative to this sort of unique item. It's the Chia Pet of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The anti-terrorism CD","review":"Finally we have a weapon of mass distruction to flush Bid Laden out of his goffer hole. This is a double whammy!

Hung, you had the fifteen minutes you didn't deserve, give it up, us and our eardrums are begging you. The joke has worn far too thin and gone too far-it is no longer funny, it's just annoying.

The ones who think it's total crap, and the ones who somehow think it's a joke. It is a joke. It is a joke on anyone who buys the CD.People, the record label saw Hung, saw people support him, and thought to themselves \\"Wow. We can make a load of money by giving him a CD and conning people into buying it.\\" There's no intentional humor, there's no fad or collector quality to it at all. It's blatant commercialism. William Hung should be ashamed of himself for this. The record label should be ashamed of themselves for not giving some other \\"Idol\\" hopeful who has talent a record contract.Bottom line, you wouldn't hire a plumber who didn't know what he was doing, so why facilitate the career of a singer who can't sing? Why put money in the pockets of record executives who have no respect for you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on people, it's a cheap gag gift!","review":"I'm amazed at those who gave it a single star: I'm assuming only those who BOUGHT the album are giving us opinions?

It's not funny and it's not even tasteful. Pardon my language but it just plain sucks.

This CD is just pure junk. His singing has improved, which makes the CD much less funny than the first one.

Sent overseas to our deployed and also my office mates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Mr. Hung is ugly and utterly lacks talent. The major reason for his appeal and stardom (if one can call it such) is because he plays off the stereotype that Asians are bookworms and nerds who lack commonsense. Thanks to him, it became that much more difficult for Asian males to break into the American entertainment industry. In response to those who argue that he was passionate/determined and ought to be rewarded for pursuing his dream, one can say those exact words about Charles Manson.Regarding the album, Mr. Hung doesn't pronounce words correctly, sings right through his mouth, and has made a mockery out of Christmas. I listened to Silver Bells and Little Drummer Boy and that was all I could take.Hung has become a joke that isn't very funny at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is he still relevant?

To say that he sings better on this release only says that his voice has perhaps been upgraded from horrendous to merely awful. And the backing music isn't even up to the quality of your average karaoke recording. The best thing about this album? The playing time is less than twenty minutes! This won't even make a clever gag gift for the office Christmas party. If they celebrate Christmas in hell, this is the album they will be playing this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone should have thought of the aftermath","review":"Hear me out people. The holidays can be a lonely and depressing time for many people. So do we really need WIlliam Hung to add to the misery? Could you imagine them playing this album in a Salvation Army soup kitchen on Christmas morning? I mean the suicide rate during the holiday season climbs high enough without Hung's help. You might as well find a lonely depressed soul and shove a picture of their ex in their face. A picture showing them with their new partner and smiles on their faces.If people can sue Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne for causing people to commit suicide, surely WIlliam Hung is next. And my God, why is there a hidden track of Queen's \\"We are the Champions\\"? I'd rather listen to Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\" album and that is the bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't feed the creepy famewhore!","review":"Honestly, wouldn't you be of more use feeding the truly needy and the poor than feeding his very creepy, talentless famewhore any more? Isn't THAT what Christmas is all about? His time is up and not a moment too soon. There are people starving in this world. There are people dying! Yet this jerk continues to annoy everybody with his bad singing. The world is bad enough. Let's hang Hung for Christmas. This useless degenerate is destroying the meaning of Christmas. His record label has sunk to new lows. Considering nobody bought his other album, why would you waste money putting out another one? That money could go to something more useful and righteous. That is what Christmas is all about. Instead it's going to the greedy record executive who needs to know when enough is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why is William Hung even releasing a Christmas album? Don't expect some department stores playing this album during the holidays, because it will scare some customers away! Hung's off-key singing is painful and distracting to listen to, and that very uneven Inspiration album is proof. He just doesn't blend with the songs or melodies, coming off disjointed. I think that this trend of bad singers making albums is not a good idea. They need to stop using the bad singer auditions on American Idol as a crutch to sign artists. Get Christmas albums by Vanessa Williams, Kenny G, and some past ones, PROVEN artists that have talent than ilk like William Hung!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear jerker for sure!","review":"This was a WONDERFUL movie!!

I'm sorry but it's really, really awful. The acting is awful, the plot is a little flimsy (how exactly did this wealthy woman end up penniless upon her husband's death & be forced to live with a foster family in a rundown house in the South?). And then there's the random \\"elderly\\" African American woman, clearly played by someone in her 20s, who appears at times with little bits of wisdom or criticism or I don't know what, but she is totally random, and it's just krazy. I actually fell asleep during this movie. It's just not worth it. Yay for taking in foster kids, yay for Christian films...just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let this one stay lost, not found!","review":"I was eager to see this movie because it was filmed locally and used some extras and scenery from the town where I live. People who are watching it for the same reason are the only ones to whom I would recommend it. I get the fact that it is trying to mimic the 'feel good' aura of Hallmark movies, but this one just did not work for me. The acting is not great, the film quality is terrible, the dialogue is stilted, and the plot leaves you scratching your head. Even fast forwarding through the story to get to the scenes filmed locally left me bemoaning the fact that I'd wasted an hour of my life that I'll never get back. Unless you have local ties to a person or place in the movie, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference book for Chrysler and Imperial","review":"Chrysler & Imperial 1946-1975: The Classic Postwar Years is a very informative book that covers ALL Chryslers and Imperials during this period, not just the ever popular letter cars.

I believe that initially it was only a US release that never came out in Britain. Only 5 songs were actually recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall show that the credits claim it's from. The rest are demos with dubbed in crowd noise,sometimes louder than the music itself.The version of \\"Fortune Teller\\" is really good though, and you can turn off one channel and here it minus the screaming girls.The actual live cuts were recorded by someone who had no clue how to record a live rock band at all;and at times most of the instruments are inaudible, and all we here are Mick and Keith's vocals. Obviously this was a record label cash in attempt, and maybe one of the worst live albums ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not as bad as I remember, but it still stinks.","review":"I just listened to this again and you can actually hear the band sometimes. Just to be able to hear Brian's backing vocals and guitar at a certain point was a treat. That's something. I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"What an oddity--an album of females screaming, with some faint sounds of a band not playing cohesively, in the background. Perhaps the record company had not yet figured out how to produce a live album. Within a few years there would be many classic live rock albums, with compelling musical content,including one by the Stones. This is a time capsule bit of trivia--it is in fact what it was like to see the Stones or other rock and roll groups on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 or 1965. Can you listen to it? Doubtful, although since some people apparently listen to albums of auto race car sounds, there probably are people somewhere who would listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No excuse for this one","review":"The Rolling Stones/ Got live if you want it!: Even the title seemed to warn us that this might not be what we really wanted. In a few years there would pop up some bootlegs from this period that were better than this.

Rock did not disappear, but this album should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just awful","review":"There is no reason to own this album because the music is drowned out by screaming girls and some of this was recorded in the studio with screaming overdubbed (WTF?) - AVOID.

I picked up an original vinyl copy of this record about 15 years ago, at about the time that I myself started to get together with some guys to play garage rock. I would make tapes of our little teenage band and then dub the scream track from the left speaker of Got Live If You Want It over our badly recorded, oversped, sloppy rockandroll. This is probably the closest we ever got to sounding like The Stones!! This album is intersesting as there are snippets of genuine live backing track which sounds like a band that's about to get pounded by thousands of screaming chicks!

Yes, \\"Got Live\\" is doctored in the studio in many parts, and \\"Fortune Teller\\" and \\"Been Loving You\\" are obvious studio songs with applause overdubbed blatantly. But this album has value in that 1) It features a live performance with Brian Jones instead of Mick Taylor or Ron Wood, and Brian's contributions hold up quite nicely--like the breakneck signature riff on \\"The Last Time.\\" I really liked this album when I first heard it about 1970, and in retrospect, after tiring of the \\"Ya Yas\\" album with Mick Taylor--he's good but not Brian's fire, to my mind--Got Live is kind of fun. Plus it documents a vital period in Stones history--they'd been amasing some cool hits like \\"Have You Seen Your Mother?\\" It's fresh and fun in 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very non Xmas Carols","review":"This CD sounds like a group of harpies attempting to lure Polish sailors onto snow covered rocks.

The band originals aren't up to much -- Surprise Surprise defines the phrase 'throwaway', and Heart Of Stone is basically a rewrite of Jerry Ragavoy's Time Is On My Side -- but the covers are pretty good and show off the soul groove Watts, Wyman and Richards were developing.

After receiving it, I would definitely recommend viewing the instructional video. It was a little redundant and the anticipation of playing w/ the Steadicam made me not want to watch it, but it was pretty informative and helped me get through the initial setup of everything. With a little practice I was able to get it down pretty well. A couple of particulars that'll take a lot to get used to: zooming and focusing. If you're in motion, holding the steadicam, zooming proves to be rather difficult (depending on the camera as well). It's more efficient to keep the camera on autofocus while using the steadicam. Overall, while I still have a lot of practice to do, I am very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"$$","review":"This steadycam is ridiculous.

This elevated the camera higher than normal so it took some time to get the balance and trim correct. But now it is very easy to remove the camera to change batteries. All in all this is a great device but it does take some practice to learn how to use it. Here is an example of what I've been able to shoot after a month of use <[...]>.

You might think this movie is awful and hideous, but it's truly a comical look about an action star kicking major stern as usual and a basketball player trying to be an action star. No, basketball players should stick to playing basketball or in this case, cross-dressing. Van Damme carries the ball 'n chain in this movie and makes it work, as expected. He fought a buffed out Mickey Rourke, a man with a knife in his toes and a tiger! Heroism! He was an agent who started fresh with a new agency and had to look for Stavros (Rourke). Rodman got in the way too much and actually made an airball. Terrible. Van Damme made fun of him and his hair, 'who does it? Siegfried or Roy?' Pure hilarity.

Worst of all,the idea of Jean-Claude Van Damme & Dennis Rodman teaming is weird and make no sense. I seen better team-ups in WCW during it's dying years.

However, it is extremely obvious (even to the untrained eye) that this recording has been edited, and not edited very well! The editing is so poor, I would have to advise against purchasing this DVD.Hold out - Chris is too good a musician for the record companies (you know them by their circling fins sticking just above the surface of the water) not to produce another DVD.

The 'Your Growing Baby' sections on week 1 and week 2 are patently, completely, unabashadly false. As this book reckons the pregnancy timetable (starting from last period and ending at 40 weeks), there is no baby present during weeks 1 and 2, unless the mother ovulated incredibly early (which would throw the book's other milestones all off anyhow). There is enough confusion and misunderstanding regarding fertility; we don't need a book telling women they conceive during their periods.In the end, this book fulfills neither of the goals it aspires to: it is too unweildly and large to take to prenatal visits, while the information it gives is scanty and misleading enough to make it a very substandard pregnancy book.

There were no ill effects, just no improvement when taken as directed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought intrigue","review":"A novel that pits Clan Ghost Bear against the Draconis Combine and Clan Hell Horses with Clan Wolf manipulating events in the background.The story is presented from the viewpoint of a ristar Elemental Star Captain named Jake Kabrinski, who contends with both internal challenges of a new command, and the external advesaries faced on the battlefield. This is the only Battletech novel I'm aware of that has an Elemental main protaganist, and while some light is gleaned on the differences between the genetically altered infantry and the standard mechwarrior, it's more ala carte to the meat of the story.The plot isn't linear at all, which provides a trememdous break from the norm; once you think you have the pace figured out, the next chapter does a 180 on you. All the twists and turns make sense and add to the overall effect; nothing is done haphazardly just to mix things up.Overall, Test of Vengeance was a fascinating read, Bryan Nystul is an author par excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"My girls love Angelina & this was a gift at Christmas.

Each poem, of \\"Domestic Work,\\" maintains delicate balances of \\"literal\\" meaning as well as \\"aesthetic\\" or \\"thematic\\" meaning. The thoughtful word choices, in Trethewey's work, depict vivid backdrops of sights, smells, textures and sounds. The well-chosen adjectives do not 'crowd' or distract from the themes -- both literal and aesthetic. With various foci and themes, the poems of \\"Domestic Work\\" truly beckon the reader to perform internal \\"domestic work\\" -- mentally, spiritually and emotionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"The debut collection of her poetry","review":"Natasha Trethewey has won the Grolier Poetry Prize and her individual pieces have been widely published in a variety of places. Domestic Work is the debut collection of her poetry and will well serve to introduce her work to a whole new audience of appreciative readers. Housekeeping: We mourn the broken things, chair legs/wrenched from their seats, chipped plates,/the threadbare clothes. We work the magic/of glue, drive the nails, mend the holes./We save what we can, melt small pieces/of soap, gather fallen pecans, keep neck bones/for sou. Beating rugs against the house,/we watch dust, lit like stars, spreading/across the yard. Late afternoon, we draw/the blinds to cool the rooms, drive the bugs/out. My mother irons, singing, lost in reverie./I mark the pages of a mail-order catalog,/listen for passing cars. All day we watch/for the mail, some news from a distant place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgia","review":"These poems seem tense, circumscribed, hemmed in.

It seems to be trying to do what Rita Dove's excellent earlier Thomas and Beulla did wonderfully. I suppose I should have figured I wouldn't like the book since it was recommended to me along with Louise Gluck's new book and something called Some Ether by Nick Flyn, both books pretty weak and vapid and self-obsessed.

I appluad this writer for being in touch with her past and her culture, but I question the literary value of a book that feels that bald, bland, and blunt lessons in race and ethnicity is all that matters in poetry. These are flat, unimaginative, expository poems, and it makes sense--unfortunately--that our former Poet Laureate, Rita Dove, would provide an introduction to this book, considering how badly her own work became after she assumed the role of token black female poet with her terribly shameful \\"Rosa Parks\\" collection.

Four of the songs are found on the much better collection Thru the Past, Darkly. The Stones version of the Temps \\"My Girl\\" is laughable. That leaves six songs to consider. \\"Lady Jane\\" is on the dark Aftermath, which if you're going to own the Stones catalog is much better than this album, even if it isn't one of my favorites. The only other songs worth having are \\"Sittin' on a Fence\\" and \\"Out of Time.\\" Buying this album for two or three \\"rarer\\" songs just isn't worth it. If you want a collection of off the beaten track Stones, look for Hot Rocks II (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies) which also contains the psychedelic single \\"Dandelion\\" and it's very good B-Side (and true Beatles turned upside down track) \\"We Love You.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Weeds","review":"By the simple expedient of butchering the Stones' UK albums, the band's American record company managed to churn out about twice as many LPs as the Brits did. Needless to say, quality control was not concern number one. Flowers collects 12 tracks without rhyme or reason; half of these had already appeared on the US versions of Between The Buttons and Aftermath, and as for the other half ... My Girl may be the single worst thing the band ever recorded; Jagger sounds like he was reading the financial pages of The Times when he did the vocal.

The live concert footage and sound is the lowest quality possible - like it was copied off a pirated VHS. No song is played in it's entirety. Instead you have a random collection of British critics, a couple of which aren't even fans of the music, making witless and uninformed comments for the most part over and between the low res concert footage. If you were expecting a career review, album by album, with some good live footage throughout Elton's career, this is definitely not it. It's a slapped together product to exploit Elton John's profile with none of the quality control that exemplifies his \\"officially\\" released material.

That DVD has one extra person giving commentary (the guy who brought Elton and Bernie together). This \\"Music in Review\\" DVD shows the same 1984 Sydney concert over and over again. It is cloudy footage to boot. I doubt I will watch it again. However, the critics who give commentary were very detailed. They appear again in the other DVD.

Tarnas has used his vast understanding of the humanties and history and attempted to correlate trends, themes, biographies and events to the movement of planets.Like all astrologers, he is attempting to merge the scientific and factual using his intuition, seeing corrlations and causes and effects when none exist. The intuitive connection between the scientfic facts and the \\"facts\\" of history simply does not work. The supposed correlations are simply subjective conjecture.

Then it goes right into hiragana but doesn't overwhelm you. After you've been introduced to enough material, you get a review. (There are tons of reviews and they all cover word examples that are practical to know for cultural or historic events.) Once you've completed hiragana, the book moves on to katakana.

The pianist, Enrico Pieranunzi, who played on many of the original Morricone recordings, is the arranger and band leader on this album. The pieces he chooses to cover are surprising--not always the main themes from the selected films; occasionally they're obscure tracks on already obscure Morricone albums. The result, though, is a beautiful collection of tunes that is very listenable.Joey Baron is one of the best jazz drummers working today.

I always enjoy HK's views on Eliot and FM Ford, tho I'm still not convinced that Charles Tomlinson was/is the heir apparent to the crown of modern poetry. Kenner wasn't a major fan of Virginia Woolf or WH Auden and it's hard to disagree with him there. OTOH, he champions Basil Bunting and that is only fitting. I now want to find a copy of Briggflats.

The only one into this project is Keifer Sutherland. The others basically coast through their parts. Darryl Hanna is virtually non-existent and Molly Ringwald does not have much to do.

After the movie I found myself moving around the house very slowly, so hypnotized I was by this director's excess usage of slo-mo. However, the sight of all those glistening strings of bull snot arching in slow motion across the screen ultimately kept me awake. My advice is skip this dumb movie and go see a real rodeo in real time. It'll keep you awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal lovers and easy cryers DO NOT watch this movie","review":"I highly reccomend that you DO NOT watch this movie if you are an animal lover, or an easy cryer.

I had to run out of the room at one part of the movie, come back in, watch a while, and leave again at the end. It is not an easy movie to watch, and does not have a happy ending. I think that maybe if you do not think that you shouldn't watch this movie, maybe watch Pure Country or something. Just not this.

Cassady really should have played the game himself and not listened to gamers that work for BradyGames. The Maps are in the back of the book, to start with this is truly a headache. The book was written so as to not spoil the plot, but you can read it and know how the plot is laid out, and specifics. The biggest flaw is that Cassady didn't give thourough advice on how to beat the harder characters. (I.E.-read the walkthrough on Diablos, it doesn't give a clear picture on what you are to do, and dont even bother using the guide on the higher level characters, its just plain useless.) So in summary, save your money for the next final fantasy game and print out an on-line walkthrough instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"When it comes to strategy guides, Brady knows nothing. Nothing. Oh, they also know nothing. I no doubt much prefer Kao Megura's strategy guide when he gets it written. Terrible maps. Some fool decided to put them in back. Even worse, some more foolish fool didn't number the pages. In many places they gave many spoilers (which I don't mind, actually, but in other places the lack of them left you hanging. This book is a perfect example of what happens when a fool gets bored. Didn't they test it? How could they have been so blind. This is how it goes. I'm reading and it says \\"Refer to map\\". What the hell? Which map? Where is this map?. I do find it after a while (all the maps _are_ there, 1 point for the away team), but(should I be suprised?) there are huge dots on this fuzzy, small map."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again, Brady's proven it knows zero about game guides..","review":"At first glance this guide appears to be great. Lots of information, item locations (sort of), info about the Guardian Forces, etc... However, once you get into playing the game, you realize what a terrible book this truly is. The item placement is not always correct, and even worse is that the maps are all in the back of the book! Now, this wouldn't be a huge problem if Brady had gone a little bit farther and included at least page numbers, but that couldn't be done either. Another problem I had with the book was the one thing that Brady always has, and always will, have; they give plot spoilers continuously! Be careful about reading this book, because Brady does not understand the concept of \\"give hints, not story.\\" So, if you'd like to know the plot without playing the game, the Bradygames Final Fantasy 8 guide is a great novel.. but as a game guide, it isn't even average. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its okay.","review":"I LOVE Final Fantasy 8. Its a great game. The stratagy guide was great while the first time playing the game. Although some things were confusing, I didn't really think about it. Later I noticed the millions of typos and missleading information. It seems to me, the people who wanted this book out, didn't care if it wasn't done. When it comes to important items (like the Moon Stone, which I still haven't found for Irvine's best weapon) you haven't a clue where to get them. And basic informaiton (like, who is Zell's GF) you never can find out in the book. I still use the book every time I play FF8, but I have also replaced all the wrong information I've found within the book with the correct ones.

The directions are easier to follow, and it includes a lot of important information. I would have liked the names of the Cards to be easier to read - dark font on a dark background is too hard to reference for anything - and the beastialityairy was too hard to decipher. But that's a small point when you compare it to the failure to continue with the total coverage in the FF9 book.

My waist is tight and trim now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tape annoys me","review":"Okay, so the exercises ARE good. The abs exercises on most of the FIRM tapes that have them ARE good. But I still think it was a mistake ordering this tape for two reasons:1. It's just a collection of routines from other, earlier FIRM tapes, so to me it pretty much seems like a rip-off. Also, get ready for some OLD ones there - from the time when instructors looked like Kate Moss and even guys were wearing pink and orange aerobics clothes. If you ever felt like you didn't quite enjoy looking at such things anymore - well, then you'll find this tape a visual disaster.2. Who is this Tracy guy, for heaven's sake?! All he does is introducing the sets of exercises - half naked and looking as unnatural as a diamond ring on a homeless guy's pinky. He's ridiculous, but he's actually too annoying for me to be able to simply laugh at him.Altogether, this tape was a disappointment and the two stars are strictly for the exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had the video memorized, but saw little results","review":"I bought this after having my third baby. I did it so often I had the video memorized, but still did not see results. The instructors move quickly through the movements without informing you of propper posture, so its easy to hurt your back. The video is misleading because the hot guy on the cover, the \\"guest trainer\\", talks for about 30 seconds, then you watch a room full of women exercising. The guy comes back at the end and says, \\"That was tough, see you tomorrow.\\" And that's it. I finally got rid of the video because in the workout room there are some \\"artsy\\" paintings of topless women on the walls. The pictures are not real graphic, but I didn't like my older boys seeing them.

Though this tape does have 5 day workouts for the Abs, I find the exercises themselves to be outdated and not particularly safe for anyone with lower back vulnerability. The majority of the movements do not allow for stabalizing the lower back while doing them. They don't seem to isolate and direct the exercises as efficiently as I have found other video instructors tapes to do. The plus to this tape is the 5 day varied exercises/Firm instructors and a -pre workout demonstration for each series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This book was a big disappointment for three reasons: 1) it doesn't have a proper focus. Author wanted to cover everything and that's why the book is making sloppy impression, i.e. too wide and not too deep when it is necessary; 2) it doesn't help you as a quant in the everyday quant life. It doesn't show you how to backtest models, it doesn't tell you how to use all this knowledge in the practical way, it doesn't even tell about the robustness and out of sample testing; 3) it is an arbitrary collection of known theories with some unexplained extracts from the different fields which are not connected with each other in the logical way.As the final accord: why the \\"quant bible\\" is based on the \\"normal\\" distribution.

The book cites a lot of conventional wisdom along with a few specious claims (such as, you can tell someone desires to leave a conversation by the direction his feet are pointing, particularly towards an exit).I couldn't glean very much useful information from the book, because most of it would not stand up to the scrunity of repeated use, different people or various circumstances.I would say, at best, it's a good fluff piece about this topic.A better book is Paul Ekman's \\"Telling Lies\\".

Call me optimistic. However, what I ended up reading was common sense pointers to find out when someone is under stress. If you want to find out truly what people do when they lie, do not read this book. It only mentions that each person has specific behaviors that they exhibit when lying. The author constantly cites exceptions to what he says and warns people not to make rash judgments. I do not feel that I learned anything new from this book. The main point here is that if you think someone is lying, then dig a little deeper into that subject area to try and uncover the truth. On the upside, the book was easy to read and was not necessarily boring. But I would look elsewhere to find a more concrete book about what people do when telling lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there are no other options...","review":"This book had minimal useful information drowned out by tons of verbose, redundant paragraphs with spelling mistakes.

The style of writing could most definitely have been improved by a competent editor. The content fell far short of what the title promised. I assure you that most people are aware that if somebody is yelling he is probably mad. This is so oversimplified that it's shocking. What makes matters worse is that the author repeats himself over and over again with the same information -- as though we didn't believe him the first time around. Perhaps he is right... I really don't believe that if a person's feet are pointed toward the door he wants to leave. I think he's just standing that way. So we go from the overstatement of the obvious to ludicrous claims that seem kinda-scientific, but aren't.In essence, I came away from this book having learned nothing. I was so mad I could yell, and now my feet are pointed toward the door. Make of that what you will.Bad book.

However, I was very surprised when I found out that the Bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another, even under some vibration. The suction rubber system is quite strong. It has 2 angles for adjustment, and you can rotate the GPS clockwise/counterclockwise.Pros: Strong suction rubber system, GPS mounting systemCons: Lack of a 4th angle for adjustment (the GPS can only be adjusted in the windshield plane, so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing - that's why I give 4 stars)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds well except in cold- beware owners of new Garmin units","review":"The suction cup works- only falling off my windscreen about once every two weeks; moreso when it's cold. The adjustments are pretty flexible but it's quite difficult to reach the various knobs once the GPS unit is installed. (Garmin- an extra 1/4\\" would have been handy). The unit is ridiculously priced for a few flimsy pieces of plastic. The back cover the unit (supplied) does NOT work for the newer eTrexs with micro-SD cards for memory. You have to use the screw which came with your unit and if you've lost that screw- well you are scr*wed. I think Garmin should either provide a back for new users or dramatically lower the price of the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This bracket is simple, sturdy and compact. The suction cup actually exceeded my expectations in the fact that it has a clever lever to adhere it to the windshield.. Doesn't need to be moistened or such. I love the fact that it has two areas for angling. I don't like that it can't swivel - would be nice to have that feature so that, let's say for instance, the passenger wanted to look at the GPS unit. Again, it requires you replace the original rubber battery cover with a plastic one that allows the unit to click into the windshield unit. Same one that comes with the handlebar accessory. It is perfect for what I needed, to read it as I'm moving for Geocaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"The only thing this mount does well is hold the unit steady. It's overly complicated for newer units. See Garmin designed this thing to work with all etrex series models. For the older Black and white models it would be great they give you this alternate back place and it just snaps in. For the newer models you're suppose to use the screw from your belt clip to secure your unit tothe mount but that screw is too short I had to get a screw from a hardware store but that sucked too because there was no way to take it on or off without a screwdriver I finally got a thumbscrew from an online hardware store cus none of the local stores had on with small enough threads to fit. So now it worrks the way it should with a small modification (1) 4-40 .500 lenght thumb screw and a small lock washer it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Usless","review":"When I purchased this item, I also purchased an eTrex Vista unit and the unit does not fit on the item.

Garmin could have easily molded a back for this mount that would accomodate BOTH the newer and older versions of the Etrex line. The add-on clip for the cover that comes with the Cx units protrudes and catches on items when carrying the GPS. It is too bad the replacement cover does not fit because the clip is less obtrussive.With a Dremel and some fine burrs the cover can be fabricated to fit the Cx.

So if you have a CX, don't purchase this item.Update: Contrary to what other reviewers have said, the adapter that comes with the eTrex Vista CX does NOT fit this bracket.

This one has some potent, memorable imagery (especially the end scene on the beach), but the dialogue and acting go from good to mediocre to downright atrocious so quickly that it's nearly impossible to make it to the climax at the end. It's a bland movie with a stereotypical love story of a mismatched pair of lovers who struggle and end up together at the end.

I had just moved to Alaska from the Oregon coast. The filmming was done in the community where I lived, and,being homesick, really enjoyed the sceneray. I fastforwarded through the story just to see whose home would be used next. Funny thing, I have never met anyone who knew an art film was being filmed on their beach. I watched it a second and third time to see weather, clouds, tide lines, and tidal debris.I agree with the inaneness of the story.

Instead, I was disappointed in the acting, plot, and intent of this movie. The plot was predictable... women gathering for a writer's workshop, and two find an attraction. But the characters were almost cartoonish, broad characterizations with no substance.... the romance writer, the dyke, the one who's husband leaves.... boring!Women's sexuality and lesbianism are such complex subjects and this movie avoided all the issues. Our society is filled with such critical misnomers about same-gender relationships, and this movie does nothing to clear the air. It only adds to the sterotypes, rather than demonstrating a healthy attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"But it gets 5 stars for unintended humor...","review":"Well, this film is bad in the way that \\"Showgirls\\" was bad. I don't think I ever had such a rip-roaring great night out as I did when I saw it in a San Francisco theater filled to capacity with nothing but amused lesbians and their appalled gay friends. I only wish I'd been on the set when the director tried to keep the cast and crew from falling all over themselves laughing during the filming. If you are feeling at all cynical about being a lesbian, this is the film for you. Have a party, invite a lot of of art-house lesbian snobs and one crystal consciousness masseuse, pop in the tape and sit back for the fun.Forlesbian romance with taste and passion and complexity, buy \\"Fire.\\" Even \\"Desert Hearts\\" (1985) is worth a night on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn. But \\"Clair\\" is in a whole other league."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie but negative","review":"I used to watch it when it have VHS long time ago. I love that movie.

It isnt worth it to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finula Bellini","review":"I saw this movie when it was first shown at the L.A. Lesbian/Gay Film Festival, and later on video. While I appreciate the efforts of the filmmaker I find the movie to be trite and unintentionally silly. The acting is okay, but the dialog and character development leave much to be desired. The almost fully clothed sex scene was a riot. The movie is worth renting to see if it appeals enough to you to purchase.

I got it! I loved the movie. It was \\"old school\\" cinema- romantic, panoramic. Nicole Conn did a fantastic directorial job. The chemistry between the two stars was breathtaking. Even after more than 10 years it did not seem too dated. It was a \\"feel good\\" movie experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"...stilted and awkward...","review":"In a cinematic work it is common practice for a film maker to carve a plot that forces the viewer to suspend some, if not all, of their belief. Claire of the Moon is such a film. Prior to viewing this feature, I read the novel and herein lies the problem. As a work of fiction, the story is plausible enough and actually quite enjoyable. However, it just doesn't quite make the seamless transition from novel to film that a viewer hopes for. The acting is stilted and awkward and the verbal sparring between the two main characters that was so successful on the written page falls quite flat here. The only saving graces in this otherwise disjointed effort by Nicole Conn are the beautiful cinematography and the incredibly wonderful score by Michael Allen Harrison. Save yourself the aggravation that comes from being disappointed. Read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"Finally succumbing to friend's urging, I rented \\"Claire of the Moon\\"....... what a disappointing waste of time that was! The dialogue made me cringe, the acting was alternately wooden or over-the-top, and the whole production in general was stereo-type-laden and preachy. Even the sexy scenes failed to excite, being over-choreographed and unrealistic. I do understand the need for intelligent, sexy lesbian films, but director Nicole Conn, in all her earnest political-correctness, totally missed the mark. She could take lessons from the great director Donna Deitch, whose beautiful \\"Desert Hearts\\" remains the standard for lesbian-identified films...simple, sweet, and tender, with wonderfully understated acting and delicious love scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"This was a wonderful movie. Trisha Todd(Claire) and Karen Trumbo(Noel) were PERFECTLY cast. I bought the video and the soundtrack. I just found it wonderfully playful as well as serious, provocative, sexy, and extremely moving.Of course we'd love to know what Claire and Noel as well as Trisha and Karen are doing now, but I guess that would take the mystery of it all away, or would it?Trisha Todd was especially exciting to me. A wonderful presence on the screen. Sexy, mysterious, and wonderfully exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie","review":"After watching Moments, the behind the scenes documentary; I was intrigued. Then I actually saw the film. I absolutely hated this film! It was a complete waste of film, and my time.

I can honestly say that a full house in a three hundred seat movie theatre booed during the closing credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scenery was great.................","review":"I've watched this movie three or four, I think four, times and each time it gets more torturous to watch. I try to remember...was I that insipid in my twenties and thirties....was I that boring. God, I hope not. And, the last few scenes always make me laugh when Claire is riding with her jeans on.

The crew did a wonderful job. However, while some of the actors are just fine, others (particularly one of the leads) is wooden.

I remember watching this film on the big screen in Chicago in a theater full of women laughing, hissing, throwing popcorn, groaning, holding their heads in their hands. The humiliation of knowing that this painfully amateurish film would never have seen the light of day if it weren't for lesbian chic. Possibly the worst lesbian film ever to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like streotype this is the movie for you","review":"This movie annoyed me.

I'm also a fan of May McPhee, and was pleasantly surpriused by her duet with Eliot Yamin (of whom I was not a big fan during his tim on Idol).

I had only one small problem - one of the ties on the bumper came off. Nothing a few stitches wouldn't fix I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?!","review":"I am very upset. I ordered this costume in time for Halloween and it came with the wrong mask, the packaging was showing the right mask..... but the mask inside was not even close. It was the scary mask from the scream movie, not exactly what my 5 year old wanted. Ofcourse, there is no time left for me to have the right mask sent here. The outfit part is ok, what you see it what you get, except the head piece is total crap, it's got this crappy little velcro to hold it closed and it doesn't come to a point at the top of his head, maybe if I stuck something in there it would. I ordered a small and it fits him well, it's just a little long, my son is adverage height. Well I guess you get what you pay for..... needless to say I will not order from these people again. Don't waste your money, you'll probably get the wrong item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Darkly","review":"Through The Past, Darkly is the second greatest hits collection from the Stones and as the title suggests, many of the songs take on a harder, darker edge. \\"Paint It Black\\", \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\", \\"Mother's Little Helper\\", \\"Street Fighting Man\\" and \\"Have You Seen Your Mother Baby, Standing In The Shadows?\\" all have that deep, dark, ominous sound that makes the band seem so dangerous. The album contains songs from their brief foray into psychedelic music in the shape of \\"Dandelion\\", \\"She's A Rainbow\\" and one their most underrated songs \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\". They are at their best, though, when the explore the dark, underbelly of life and you get ample amounts of that vibe on this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Of The Greatest Songs From One Of the Greatest Bands","review":"The Rolling Stones have an enormous amount of hits and great songs. I have bought both this CD and the first volume (High Tide & Green Grass). They both include some of my favorite Stones songs. This CD was also organized very well, for example, I liked how \\"Paint It, Black\\" led into \\"Ruby Tuesday\\". Because every song on this CD is great, I have to give it a five-star rating. However, off both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 of \\"Big Hits\\" are many other Stones classics that no fan can miss. \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" are just two examples of great Stones albums that I also recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical, wonderful collection","review":"Since the Stones had at least 30 excellent songs in the years 1966-69, one could quibble with the song choices here. However, there is just something special about this particular collection which really works--this is a truly compelling album. I have known several people who have listened to it again and again, compulsively. I have known several people who got deeply into music generally, because of this album. This is the favorite all time album of my brothers and now my son. Those who picked the songs and order of the songs hit on something great. I do not know anyone who is so enthusiastic about the Hot Rocks album, for example. This album seems to have just the right mix of hits, obscurities, hard rockers and slightly unusual material. There is something magic about this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget HOT ROCKS","review":"Get Big Hits (High Tides and Green Grass) and Thru The Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol II).Thru the Past... has \\"She's A Rinbow\\" and \\"Dandelion\\" AND \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Honky Tonk Women\\".Okay, HOT ROCKS has \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Wild Horses\\", \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" and \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", but you own BEGGARS BANQUET, LET IT BLEED and STICKY FINGERS all ready, don't ya?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"This must be the worst recorded Rolling Stones LP.

I defy you to put this book down and tell me who wouldn't love Adam. It is extremely funny in places, very thought provoking in others and often you really feel Tasha's pain especially if it often mirrors your own.

It's funny and light hearted and a fast paced read that makes you want to read more and more. The thing that really pissed me off it that the main charachter Libby is a little shallow.

A much better and much more compelling story can be found in Melissa Bank's Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Mr Maybe is a major disappointment and extremely predictable. You would have to develop amnesia not to know how the book will end. You know from the first couple of pages what is in store for you. Plus, I have to agree with another reviewer that her basis for a good relationship appears to be sexual stamina. She barely gives poor Ed a chance and you wonder that Nick wants her back. I enjoyed Jemima J very much and even though it did take a rather bizarre turn in the middle, it was still a good read and the author drew some good characters. This was not the case for this book. The only reason I continued reading it was to see what happened to her friends marriage. This is definitely a library book; don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Green Does it again!","review":"After I read Jemima J, I decided to read another Jane Green novel. This is a wonderful story of 27 year old Libby Mason, trying to find a man. Nick, a former acquaintance, comes into her life, and what was supposed to be a no-commitment relationship, becomes more involved. I thought that with the exception of a very explicit sex scene, that this is a wonderful book. I reccomend this with Jemima J, you won't be able to put them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is the 1st time I have read Jane Green, and look forward to reading her other books.Mr. Maybe is a close description of my history with men, and I LOVE it!

If you enjoy a witty romance novel with a touch of erotica, then this is a book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!","review":"Mr. Maybe is a great read!! It's simple, funny and a good escape to everyday life. I highly reccommend it! My only gripe is that the back cover tells the entire story. What it says on the back doesn't happen until page 300! I was very disappointed. So, when you read it - don't read the back! Trust the reviews - it's worth your time to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...spoilers here...","review":"After reading \\"Jemima J.\\" I was looking forward to \\"Mr. Maybe\\". Unfortunately, this book is nowhere near as riveting as JJ was for me...none of the characters resonated, and I felt no sympathy for any of them.Mr. Maybe was a VERY predictable read - I had no problem figuring out what was going to happen: that the heroine would end up with the gorgeous hunk in the end; that the rich fiancee would hook up with the TV presenter who admired him; that the girlfriend and her husband would break up...etc. etc.C'mon, Ms. Green, \\"Jemima J\\" showed us you could do better than THIS. Not even worth a second read IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not her best.","review":"I've read all of Jane Green's books up to this point and this is the book I remember the least.

I still think its an excellent read and a truly amazing book but definately not her most powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...until...","review":"I found this book good, given you could see where it was going, but it was an enjoyable read.

The story line is fascinating and you never know what is going to happen next. It's one of those books that has such a good story line that you can't wait to see what happens next and you don't want to put it down. I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Predictable","review":"I recently read Mr. Maybe and although I was initially intrigued by the story, I became increasing angry at Libby. She was selfish, mean and overall a weak character.. Spoiler * so oh she chose love at the end instead of wealth.. big suprise..Nick got a book deal, Nick told her that he was in love with her..so predictable.. I can't stand her bichy friends, and stupid brother, Olly. I actually felt bad for Ed, having to go out with such a tramp. To sum up the book: No imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sex and the city","review":"I was mildly entertained by the first few pages, but after chapters of her lengthy roundabout thoughts on men, clothes and her dream house, the book began to sound more like a superficial teenager's diary. There's also something about her writing that makes reading this book tedious. It's fun to read about someone's honest inner thoughts, but when they sound like, oh, I don't know, something like this, the reader grows weary, know what I mean? It gets 2 gilded 24 karat stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. After reading Jemima J, which I loved, I looked forward to reading this book. It was a big let-down. The heroine, Libby, is a shallow, superficial, self-absorbed human being and it's really difficult to care whether she lives happily-ever-after, or not. The other characters are wooden and the plot is predictable. Even the soft-porn sex couldn't spice this novel up. This book is 344 pages long and you could cut 200 of the pages and not miss a thing. Green is obviously a very talented writer; I hope her next effort (if there is one) is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I really have to like the bum?","review":"I don't usually write reviews of novels, but after reading this novel, I was so angry that I had to! Ok, so if a book is supposed to illicit a response from its readers, then it should get some kudos, but the gratuitous sex scenes and comparisons between the sexual stamina of the two major male characters ticked me off. So...Mr. Maybe is the guy who, although he doesn't make a lot of money, can pleasure you in bed. If that's enlightening and fun to read, go ahead. For me, I'll stick with Bridget Jones and even Jane Green's other novel, Jemima Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"The woman simply cannot write","review":"If _Mr. Maybe_ is any indication, I cannot believe that Jane Green's work makes to publication. I was constantly finding myself jarred by errors in basic grammar (most noticeably, using \\"I\\" when she should have used \\"me\\"; e.g.: \\"he decided to come along with my friend and I\\"). I can hardly believe this book got past the editors. Then there are the problems with the story itself. For some reason, Nick is supposed to fall madly in love with the main character's personality and spunk, but we never see the spunk, or personality. All we see is a shallow, greedy woman who is determined to find a rich man so she can become a \\"lady who lunches\\". What about this woman is Nick falling in love with? It just doesn't make any sense. I was especially disgusted when she kept the Gucci bag that Ed had given her; she should have at least offered to give it back. If she was supposed to have a personality it was well hidden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her other books ...","review":"I enjoyed 'Bookends' and 'Babyville' but from the start I had a major problem with this book - the heroine, Libby, is such a shallow gold-digger I found it impossible to sympathise with her. Why should we root for her to marry the nice penniless Nick when clearly this is a woman who is cut out to be a trophy wife in a loveless marriage, a shallow mindless bimbo who defines success in life totally as a matter of money and designer labels. (Frankly I'd be happier to see her become the victim of a serial killer :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...","review":"I just finished MR MAYBE two days ago and I found the book to be ok. I was rooting for Nick and Libby, although I was a little annoyed with the Ed storyline. It seemed to drag on and I found myself saying, \\"This character (ED) is so repulsive it makes me wanna throw up!\\" I know that Ed is an important character because it eventually leads Libby back to Nick, but it just seemed to drag on. Mr Maybe was an ok read, maybe I just expected something totally different."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmm....good","review":"I am a big fan of Jane Green. And this book was no disapointment.

Unfortunately I found this to be a miserable read that I slogged through simply becuase I always feel the need to finish a book I started. The main character is decidedly unsympathetic, boring, and predictable, and the descriptions of the poor rich bloke that \\"loves\\" her are nauseating at best. I couldn't find any redeeming qualites in this one, best I can do is to advise everyone to skip it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it a lot","review":"This is a really good book from British comic writer, Jane Green. It was funny, light and breezy, and Libby is a great heroine. If you loved Brigdget Jones, then this would be a good book for you.

A Must Read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The first few chapters were tough to get through because I was sure I knew how the rest of the book was going to play out, but I was pleasantly surprised by the plot twists. Okay, sure, you know what the sequence of events will ultimately be, but the reasons for the changes were what surprised me.... I know this isn't the most articulate review, but I don't want to give anything away. Read it for yourself, then you'll see what I mean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Jemima J\\" Instead","review":"I bought this book not long after reading \\"Jemima J\\" and had the same expectations--witty, complex characters with a heart-warming plot that draws you in. I eagerly settled down with this book and was disappointed not long after the start. Libby is a very shallow and unidentifiable character and her habit of choosing men based on their salaries is evidence enough of this. The 'bad boy' Libby falls for, Nick, wasn't developed enough for me to desperately want Libby to be with him, and the reasons why the wealthy and predictable Ed is not a great fit for Libby are weak. It's a good read for the beach, but for the same price, you're far better off buying \\"Jemima J.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Tapped into women","review":"There's no other way to describe the way Jane Green writes. For any women who have ever felt less than beautiful, or somehow not quite perfect, Jane Green gives hope. Her books are light, sweet, and fun to read.

Jemima J and Bookends are even better than Mr. Maybe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I really didn't like this book, I got half way through and decided I just couldn't keep going. I really enjoyed Bookend and Jemina J but this book just bored me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Mr. Maybe is one of my favorite books by Jane Green. It's about Libby who has her idea of who Mr. Perfect should be. She meets Matt, but he's not up to her standards as far as perfection. Although he's good looking, that's not enough for Libby. Then she meets Ed who has everything she's wanted. Great job, rich, perfect house, car, but material things aren't always what life is about.

Not to long after, she surprised me with another Jane Green book, Mr. Maybe. I'm just glad I didn't spend my own money on it.In one word this book is highly predictable! The author (Jane Green) goes out of her way to emphasize certain aspects of the characters, so much so I found myself asking \\"have I read this passage before?\\". By repeatedly stressing attitudes and feelings of her characters she kills the plot by making the book predictable. Between the jacket cover and the first two chapters I was right on with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Maybe...Maybe NOT!","review":"Jane Green's Mr. Maybe was a huge disappointment. I found it very hard to relate to, or connect with Libby, the main character. The extent of her shallowness and materialism made it hard for me to root for her.There were some rather implausible parts of the book that shot major bullet holes in Ms. Green's plotline. It was so obvious from page one that Libby and Nick would end up together...I didn't even read the synopsis on the back cover! The other parts of the book bored me so that I bloody wished it would end already.I can only hope Ms. Green's next novel is more substantial in character and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifying","review":"I always peruse the reviews before and after I read a book. I was stunned to see that one reviewer (a female) attacked the mothers portrayed in this book. Both of these women left this abusive man once they became aware of the brevity of their situation. They did the right thing and as anyone who is familiar with abusive men knows, the man is very charming and attractive to begin with. Anyone can get sucked into the sociopath's world when he is on his best behavior. Once these women realized how abusive this man was, they removed themselves from the situation and DID NOT go back. One mother lost her two precious girls and the other woman lost her daughter's sisters. I am sorry but it sickens me that a woman could read this book and levy a vicious attack on the women who did the \\"right thing.\\" This book is well written but I caution you to read the reviews with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite MUST for everyone.","review":"This book has been, by far, one of the best true crime novels I have read, ever. It is extremely well written, and provides all the details a true crime fanatic would want to know about. Pence describes the murder from beginning to end, and gives us an extensive history on John, Michelle, Mary Jean, and even their parents. At times, I could sense my adrenaline rushing, as I feared for Michelle and Mary Jean's lives. I could not put the book down. This is the kind of book you read at once, without putting it down.Extremely engrossing and full of suspense. A must-read for ANYONE. It opens your eyes, and makes you realize how helpless and defenseless one can be, with no one there to help, thinking that Battaglia will not strike again.Well, they were wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Kindle Copy","review":"The books seemed as if it was quickly thrown together, although the author cites several resources. Additionally, the Kindle copy appears as if the pages from the original book were torn out and copied on a dirty photo copier.

If you are looking for a thorough, well-written and nicely formated book for the Kindle, I'd take a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Written and Compelling","review":"Ms. Pence does a wonderful job of bringing a horrifying and unbelievable story to life. The characters are vividly depicted, and readers are given a deep understanding of the tragic and inevitable result of Battaglia's insane need to control and subjugate the women in his life. This is a difficult story to read, and I almost didn't buy the book, because I knew how horrific and unbelievable the crime was. I live in the area, and will never forget the first news reports of this crime and the search for the killer. It may seem difficult to understand why two intelligent, successful, and attractive women would marry this man and endure his abuse. But as an attorney, I can attest that I have seen many such situations, although none as extreme as this. Ms. Pence's book takes the reader a long way toward reaching some understanding of this too-common situation, and provides a chilling and instructive look at our flawed justice system."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Crime Reader","review":"I thought this book was well written and very vivid.

It seems fairly consistent with the book. We see Crusoe has a dog to begin with and domesticates a parrot and goats. Much later he rescues Friday from cannibals. Crusoe spends twenty-eight years on the island before returning with a ships captain he rescues. Although we see all those years pass, we are never bored by a mundane existence. The acting, directing, and editing is very well done so that we feel we the audience are part of the adventure and humor.

However, all 18 songs here are great, so I won't complain about that. I might have selected different songs if it was up to me, but that's just personal preference.

Most people listening to Jerry's music for the first time can never stop at just one CD, so this will serve as a fine introduction to some of the best music you'll ever hear. Though these songs are all more than 40 years old, they wear well and are timeless.Most casual rock fans can name only a few Lewis tunes: Great Balls of Fire and Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On, but there is so much more than that. This collection includes some of his most haunting, beautiful ballads or slower tempo pieces.He was a genuine innovator and talent. This compilation proves that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shame about the sleeve info.","review":"To an extent I'm disappointed. If all the tracks were originally recorded at Sun which I doubt, surely Rhino would make more of an effort with sleeve details. Instead all you get is a flimsy bit of paper with nothing on it. He is a great performer, I saw him live at Birmingham Town Hall, England with Brenda Lee top of the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs from early rock and roll days","review":"This album includes original recordings of Lewis' hits. I first learned\\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\\" when it was featured on the show Kidsongs back in the mid 1990s as the kids are singing this song on a rollercoaster. \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" is great too, this reminds me of America's Funniest Home Videos where a guy sings this song and the chorus and then his daughter sings the \\"great balls of fire\\" part of the song. Lewis also does a good version of \\"What'd I Say.\\" This is an all-around good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and compact...","review":"Nice quality, with sturdy chrome plating. I keep this in the trunk for emergencies. Works well, and provides enough torque to take off stubborn wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"As the headline reads - \\"it is what it is\\". I purchased this to replace the basic lug wrench that comes in most vehicles. With a 4-way, you can get more leverage for loosening lugs. Fortunately, I haven't neede to use it yet but it'll be there when I need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool at an unbeatable price","review":"I received this lug wrench in record time and it is exactly how it was described. Well made. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is SAE not metric","review":"Yes, this is advertised as metric but it is really SAE with the closest metric equivalent. There is too much freeplay to use this reliably. If you really want a metric sized wrench, I would recommend that you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I had to replace some lug nuts on my girlfriend's car and found they were slightly larger than the originals, and the stock lug wrench would not fit over them, so I got this. The originals were 17mm and the new ones were SAE 13/16\\", but the 19mm end on this fits those pretty good. It also gives a little more leverage than the stock wrench, though not quite enough to get the nuts off after they've been torque wrenched to hell by your local tire shop.. You need a real quality socket set + breaker bar to do that unfortunately. Despite the lame-looking weld in the middle, it didn't break or bend, even after jumping on it to try to free a stuck lug nut.Like other reviewers say, this isn't the most precision-crafted piece of equipment that has micrometer-exact sizes, but is pretty decent for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, but a little small","review":"It is well made from heavy stock, and the socket end (at least the 21mm size I used) was a snug and precise fit for the lug nuts, so there was no danger of rounding the nuts, as can happen with sloppy sizing. The only improvement I'd like to see is have the \\"arms\\" be a bit longer to give better leverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"lug wrench for car","review":"nice small size. various end for different size lug nuts. good solid weld on cross bar. works quite well. fits in with spare tire. much better than what came with the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent textbook","review":"An outstanding biochemistry textbook presented in a functionally and clinically relevant manner.Although there are numerous biochemistry textbooks available, none of the available texts presents the information in a dynamic, easy to read manner as Dr. Engelking's textbook does. Numerous diagrams in the book are excellent visual aids to understand clinical biochemistry. Metabolic disorders and the disease processes resulting from biochemical defects are presented succinctly in this book. Biochemistry and physiology, and anatomical principles are skillfully integrated in this book by the author. Such a presentation makes this an extremely helpful resource text for the Veterinary Medical students. This textbook will be extremely helpful to the clinicians as a quick and easy to understand reference source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best of Ideas","review":"Though I can tell that a lot of time was put into the writing of this book, the method really does fall flat. Having clients interpret the cards themselves is not the right idea. If you are going to use this method, you might as well just tell a client to go buy their own deck and a book, and then charge them for that advice! Part of my role as a Tarot reader is to interpret the cards because the client cannot or doesn't want to take time to learn. I've been reading Tarot for over 40 years, and this is about the most ridiculous method I've ever seen.That said, while I disagree with the method, there ARE two excellent things about this book: the section about the different clients IS (as mentioned in another critique) hilarious; and, the outlines and lesson plans for teaching Tarot classes are creative and effective, as well as effective self-learning exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for non traditional decks","review":"I don't read many Tarot books, but this one I read cover to cover. It approaches tarot readings not from symbols in an external guide, but from the querent's own subconscious. In this way I feel it is a more flexible system, especially since the deck I favor uses Ancient Egyptian and not western tarot symbolism. This method of reading is freeing in a deck like mine (The Ramses: Tarot of the Ages deck.) I did my first reading using this method and the Ramses deck and had a lot of \\"whoah!\\" moments. Some of which still echo almost a year after purchasing this book and doing that first reading. There's also some good stuff on ethics which I have come to expect from Amber K and Azrael K. It's well worth picking up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"The links in this textbook on communication don't work. For a book on current technology, the information is dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended, Didn't like the format of the book","review":"I didn't agree with a lot of the suggested solutions to the techniques or examples she has listed about that specific technique mentioned in the book. For example, for technique #12 Shock Value, the author wrote \\"If your daughter won't stop telling little lies, tell one of your own and let her see what it feels like\\" I felt the book was also not very well written. For example, for each \\"Seeing it In Action\\" she seemed to focus on 4,8,9, and 12 yrs. olds. For each technique, she tells you why it works, gives a deeper message about that technique & seeing it in action which gave examples about what to do about that specific technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Boxing Fighting Fit Workout Routine","review":"not at all as advertized. you get to watch a gym full of guys working out and that's about it. no instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't put it down","review":"Clement's has a way of gluing you to the pages. I found it hard to put down. I'm a big fan of Robin Cooks, but this book is one of the best I've read in years. Now I need to read lethal practice. I'm sure it's as great as Death Rounds. He has done a great job with the first person narrative. I can't wait for his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Plot and Characters -- Kindle Edition Could Have Used a Proofreader","review":"I enjoyed the plot of the book and the main characters. If you like Robin Cook books, you will probably like this book as well. The only thing that took away from the book for me is the abundance of typographical errors. The name of one of the major bacterial organisms was spelled two or three different ways depending on which page I was reading. There were other errors as well, like \\"mat\\" instead of \\"that\\" (multiple times) and \\"I was worded\\" instead of \\"I was worried.\\" I can only assume it wasn't proofread after being put into Kindle format."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the author","review":"Ladies and gents, I hope you find this book helpful and inspiring. I just wanted to alert anyone that is looking for my book that they can find it at http://www.thecoxguide.com... and for only $24. Not the $55+ people are selling it for used. And its not in hard cover either. In any case, I look forward to your business! Have a great day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for novice coxswain or rower!","review":"I bought this book when I first started rowing and I am not a coxswain! I just wanted to learn as much about rowing as possible and this book was really helpful. I also used this book to teach new coxswains about their role when I began coaching a novice high school girls' team. The guide is concise, with just under 90 pages, but thorough. Every team should have a copy of this book in their boathouse and every novice coxswain should have a copy at their fingertips! The book typically sells for $25 from the publisher, so be careful about paying more than that. There may be a used copy or two on Amazon that are reasonably priced, but I think there are some sellers who are not a part of the rowing community and have elevated their prices (perhaps because there are not millions of copies in print).

This CD was probably mastered almost 20 years ago. And it's not in STEREO! My old album is at least in STEREO. The stereo sound is much clearer and you can hear stuff better. ABKCO needs to get their act together. The Rolling Stones deserve star treatment. The Beach Boys just got their whole 60s catalogue reissued in 2-fer deals with bonus tracks! Let's see you do that Abkco!Well, there's nothing I can say about the music that hasn't already been said. There's nothing today that even come close to this stuff. I would like to see this masterpiece enjoying a full remastering and reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here we go","review":"With this album the Stones demonstate that they had the answer. This album of originals breaks the pattern of their previous efforts and we begin to see just how truly historic this band will be. The opening line-up is staggering and features on of my all time favorites in \\"Under My Thumb.\\" \\"Flight 505\\" has a nice Berryesque flavor and \\"High and Dry\\" foreshadows a bit of their country influence. Although I think the finale \\"Going Home\\" is a few minutes too long, the whole album rolls from beginning to end. True, Mick's lyrics were becoming a bit nasty, but what can a poor boy do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC FROM THE EARLY DAYS!!!!","review":"First off, 'Paint it Black' and 'Under my Thumb' are without a doubt classics. But they are great sleepers on this. 'Doncha Bother Me', 'Lady Jane', 'Think', 'Flight 505', 'I am Waiting' and definitely 'Stupid Girl'. Even the very long song 'Going Home' rocks. This early record helped show me how the Rolling Stones music evolved into a more sophisticated content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Classic","review":"\\"Aftermath\\" is aptly named. After the initial surge of excitement, culminating in the hedonistic \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", the Stones embarked upon a more adventurous, if slightly erratic, musical path, commencing with this album.The album includes two of their hit tunes (Lady Jane and Mother's Little Helper), but its best track is \\"Out Of Time\\", a derisive rejection of anything not \\"in\\". \\"What To Do\\" veers away from the band's blues roots by cheekily blending Beachboy-style harmonies with a country-flavoured rhythm, while \\"Under My Thumb\\" goes for the jugular in its dark portrayal of sexual politics.The band's blues roots were still evident on \\"Goin' Home\\", an extended jam, a form becoming increasingly popular with \\"progressive\\" Rock groups.While \\"Aftermath's\\" bitter aftertaste may require several plays to be fully appreciated, the Stones' canon of 60s music would be of infinitely lesser value without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aftermath Adds Up","review":"Aftermath shows a tremendous leap for the band. Mick Jagger & Keith Richards were starting to bloom as songwriters and the band started to step away from the heavy R&B sounds of their earlier albums. Brian Jones was the founder and spiritual leader of the band and Aftermath contains some of his finest moments with the band. \\"Paint It Black\\" was the band's third number one single and it sounded like nothing they had done previously with it's sitar work and eerie, apocalyptic sound and doomsday lyrics. \\"Stupid Girl\\" has the lowdown, dirty vibe that would permeate alot of their future records. \\"Under My Thumb\\" is one of the all-time best Stones songs and the samba beats and controlling lyrics. \\"Lady Jane\\" sounds stately with the harpsichord, \\"High & Dry\\" moves along smoothly and the \\"Going Home\\" closes the album on a strong note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, those clever sixties","review":"This is great sixties Stones (which to me makes it much more interesting thant 70s Stones.) Particularly good are \\"Lady Jane\\" and \\"I Am Waiting.\\" I like the use of different instruments throughout, as part of the burst of sixties creativity that was flowering. \\"Going Home\\" doesn't really do it for me as a jam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"Great book, really delves deep into the psyche of people with this disorder and how it is interlinked with borderline personality disorders and depression. This book also has a excellent diasgnostic survey for clients suspected of this disorder. Certain criteria have to be met and law enforcement notified before a diagnosis can be made, it is a very difficult disorder to diagnosis, but this book sheds some new light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue turns to grey ...","review":"... A bunch of filler thrown around the band's then hit single Get Off Of My Cloud. Quality control was entirely absent -- Keith Richards confessed at the time that they'd have never got away with releasing such tatt in England. More than half of the album consists of ballads, and pretty dreary ballads at that. Yawn. A pox on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hodge-podge, not really an album (2.5 stars)","review":"After the success of OUT OF OUR HEADS, the Stones (really Abkco) take a step backwards with NOVEMBER'S CHILDREN, which amounts to a cynical packaging of leftover songs and current singles.Again, it's half-cover versions and half Jagger/Richard originals in a package that the Stones themselves dismissed. (The UK version of this album was named OUT OF OUR HEADS -- to make things more confusing.) The saving grace is the inclusion of the then-current single, Get Off My Cloud/As Tears Go By.Otherwise, there's little else to this album. Covers such as She Said Yeah are good, but nothing fantastic, while other Stones originals like Blue Turns To Grey sound like album filler.Wouldn't it have been more sensible to combine the US & UK versions of OUT OF OUR HEADS?"},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"I purchased this book to prepare for the DSST in Foundations of Education. In my opinion, it's not worth the time or money. It's outdated; some of the questions and outlines look like they come from 40 years ago. You may find the sample questions so confusing, ambiguous, and poorly worded that they drive you crazy (then again, the actual test is somewhat like that too). You are much better off sticking to the books listed in the DSST Fact Sheet, particularly the standard, more objective texts, and studying them carefully. This book is of marginal value at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is simply the most amazing DVD of a jazz concert. Erroll Garner is perhaps the most musical, talented, natural and gifted piano player I have ever heard. I have always been a fan and if you are a fan or not get this DVD, you won;t regret it.

I think its open coded(Amazon please note) so it should work everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest of them all","review":"I love this DVD.

I watched this video once and that was enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A COMPLETE MUST HAVE!!","review":"Wow, Wow, Wow!!! Goodness Gracious! What an awesome performance by a piano virtuoso.

After another minute of \\"paddling\\", they rowed 20 strokes at 28-29,etc up to 50 strokes, then back down to 10. Finally came 20 strokes at 30-31.

This album sounds like an acid trip, very experimental 60's music. But it has some great songs on it. Mick's voice sounds haunting on this album it gives me chills while listening to it. The album cover is really disturbing when looking at it, it looks even darker than Sgt. Peppers's cover. The Stones show that they could keep in gear when another band experiments.

TSMR is a blatant and very poor attempt to duplicate Sgt Pepper. Although I applaud the stones for doing this kind of music.The stones were at their best when they did poppy psycadelic tunes and forgot the usual R&B nonsense.And after all it was the summer of love and the stones had to fit in.Im just disappointed they didnt continue with this kind of progression.Some of the songs are quite cool & cute,kinda like Sgt Pepper. Such as 2000 light years & lantern are great pop songs.If you like the Beatles & Floyd give this a go,its definately their best work.LONG LIVE THE HIPPIES AND THE SUMMER OF LOVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tripping Stones","review":"The album titled 'Their Satanic Majesties Request,' just shows that the Rolling Stones are an opportunistic band. Here the Rolling Stones dabble in psychedelia and it seems like tripping was the main insparation for this album. Personaly, I prefer the stones drunk and high on cocaine/heroin.

The band actually never where in the studio together for this one. This was all done by Mick Jagger, the way this worked was each band member recorded their part and left it for mick to do the mixing and arrangment. Besides the fact I never liked this album to be honest. Around the same period of time the beatles had just came out with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band so the rolling stones had to do something very similar. For instance look at the record covers it looks very similar to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover.

I recently bought the CD version of this album and listened to it the other day (after at least 20 years) and parts of it have held up. \\"She's Like a Rainbow\\" is still one of my all time favorite Stones tunes. I used to think \\"Citadel\\" was a good tune, but I guess my taste changed with age. 2000 Man has also held up after all this time. It's by far not the best Stones album, but there are morsels of good music to be heard on their adventure into psychedelia."},{"rating":"2","title":"where to go from here?","review":"In exploring psychedelicised rock, Their Satanic Majesties Request is quite essential, as has been shown by many reviews below.

Therefore, anyone who knows Their Satanic Majesties already and likes it: try Primal Scream's Vanishing Point - it starts off as a 90s version of this odd Stones album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise, Surprise- I was telling lies","review":"I have always slammed this album, told everyone to avoid it, and only played it to remind me how bad it is.BUT... that was hearing the original CD from 1986.This is a good example of how bad sound can sometimes ruin the experience, even in \\"rock n roll\\"If you are a Stones fan, buy this. Try it again.It's fun to hear them experimenting.This album, regardless of song style, shows what great musicians they are. Everything is played very well.Give it anoterh spin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not something you will frequently take out of the shelf...","review":"I have tried to like this album, but it is a hard thing to achieve. If it depended on the first song, as an aperitive, you would take this out of the player right out. An obvious (and miserable) copy of the Beatles, with just a couple of good songs, everyone knows which ones, so better buy them in mp3 format and save some money. Full of cheesy effects (snoring, WTH??) If you don't think it is, watch almost every video of the Beatles while on travel, and you will surely watch Mick Jagger, mingling around them to see what pieces of their creativity would drip unto him, LOL...I heard it today, and the last time I heard it was more than a year ago...so maybe in a couple of years I will give it a try. A star for each good song in this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Album Cover is the Highlight","review":"So unless you're Picasso or one of Mick's illegitimate children, avoid this one. Hard to believe this is the same band who created Exile, Sticky, Beggars, and Bleed."},{"rating":"2","title":"heh","review":"This is my favorite Stones album, I actually cant stand almost all of the songs that they play on the radio by The Stones. They werent the best live either or at least what I've heard. That does matter. Their still in my top 5 favorite bands though."},{"rating":"1","title":"with this, jagger became a joke","review":"this is neither an underrated psychedelic masterpiece nor the worst thing the stones did. but good god awmighty its pretty boring...citadel is a great song (done better by redd kross btw), and shes a rainbow and 2000 light years are keepers. the rest can be burned with the rest of the 60's trash. gomper perfectly illustrates keith's opinion \\"half the record was us trying to make a good record, the other half was 'lets give the people what they want and go home'\\". this release reeks of mick jagger. his poncing about on between the buttons is okay because the songs are good, and he recovered some of his \\"aftermath\\" attitude for a few albums afterward, but hearing him on this makes it clear that he is an \\"artist\\" first (and i use that only in the most condesceding way possible) and a rock & roller second...."},{"rating":"1","title":"STONES FANS BEWARE!! STEAR CLEAR OF THIS STINKER","review":"This is the WORST Stones album, and is a total embarassment to the legacy of the Stones, and multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones is to blame. There is absolutely nothing but \\"Pepperesque\\" psychedelic trash on this album, and the bad boys really didn't make much of it. Album's only real virtue is pianist Nicky Hopkins' work on \\"She's a Rainbow.\\" This was an all-time low for the band, and fortunately, Jones was sacked from the band a little over a year after its release. If you want to buy some REAL Stones albums, your'e best off avoiding the Brian Jones era and sticking to the Mick Taylor/Ron Wood eras. These are some more appropriate suggestions for your shopping list. BEGGAR'S BANQUET, LET IT BLEED, STICKY FINGERS, EXILE ON MAIN STREET, SOME GIRLS, TATTOO YOU."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I bought my first Stones album in 1977, at the age of 13, and I've been a loyal fan every since. I tend to avoid Greatest Hits collections in favor of original albums as conceived by the artists.In this case, I strongly advocate an exception to the rule. Unless you are an obsessive with a need to own every Rolling Stones release, I urge that you stay away from this one. It consists mostly of unlistenable pseudo-psychaedelic nonsense that you will never want to listen to again . . . if you make it through a first listening.One song stands out, \\"she's a rainbow\\" - a great track. But if you need to own this song, buy Hot Rocks II. In this case, I'd prefer to have a mediocre Greatest Hits album in my collection than to have Satanic Majesties stinking the place up."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I give this 0 stars?","review":"This Rolling Stones album was put out as an answer to St. Pepper's by the Beatles. Keith Richards of the Stones said it was a horrible album. I have to agree with his opinion. It was clear that the Stones had *no clue* what they were doing when they made this album. In short, it's a mess! I bought it out of curiosity, and it was a huge mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mick Tries To Copy Us\\"-John Lennon, 1970","review":"Here's Jagger trying to one up the Beatles at their own game. Kinda like Michael Jordan trying to hit a 95 mile fast ball; they missed it by a country mile.This record stinks from start to finish. Anyone who thinks they're being objective in saying that this record in any way compares to Sgt. Pepper, the ultimate 60's music statement, is either deaf or ignorant.The cover was pretty cool, though. I had the record once and threw it away, along with my Kiss collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skippable","review":"The only things worth having on this album are \\"She's A Rainbow\\", \\"2000 Light Years from Home\\", and \\"Sing This Song All Together.\\" You can get two of those, plus the very good single \\"Dandelion\\" on Thru the Past, Darkly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt Peppers Satanic Majesties Band","review":"The Rolling Rip-offs! After reading a review of someone here stating this album is as good or better than Sgt Pepper, I just had to laugh. This album is as good as Pink Floyds debut (Pipers at the Gates)from this same year, but certainly not Pepper. . The song In Another Land tries to capture the atmosphere of John's Lucy in teh Sky. It's really pretty pathetic. This album does have two decent tracks. She's a Rainbow and 2000 Light Years From Home.It is well known that Mick used to come to the Beatles sessions and John had to ask him to stop showing up all time. Trying to steal ideas no doubt. The production is pretty bad as well. All in all, the Beatles are better than the Stones. Sgt Pepper will forever be \\"THE\\" album of all-time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad...","review":"This albums is nothing more than a pathetic, trite, contrived stab at a genre this band has no business exploring. I always had my suspicions, but good listen to this album confirms: they are only in it for the money! Don't spend your time or money on this one. Try Some Girls if you want some decent songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt. who?","review":"When the Beetles came out with Sgt Peppers album this was the Stones answer. They would have been better off passing the studio by on this effort. Example: \\"Shes a Rainbow\\", this is a Rolling Stones song? COME ON!! I can't think of 1 song that is worth your time to listen toon this one. I am a guitarist and this is one that did'nt need the guitar players in the studio at that time. My question would be to them, \\"Why would you want to leave your strengths\\"? I guess they just wanted to hodge-podge some s--t and make some money. Be smart -pass on this one!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really miss the beatles..","review":"This is no 'response' to sgt. peppers. it is a blatant rip off. the stones have always been unoriginal hangers-on, making a career ripping other people off. how the beatles ever tolerated these posers hanging around is beyond me. you think the stones proved their originality by continuing to make innovative music after the beatles broke up? tell me your favorite stones song or record - I doubt it's anything after 1970. wait a second... what exactly has this band done since 1970?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I consider myself a loyal Stones fan - I've been buying their records since I was a young teenager in the '70's. However, unless you're an obsessive who must own every Rolling Stones album, I would advise against this one. Most of the tracks are unlistenable, pseudo-pschaedelic nonsense that you will never listen to after the first play. One song stands out - \\"she's a rainbow,\\" but if you're buying this just for that one track, buy Hot Rocks II instead and get a decent hits album for your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the year 1967 - so let's be as psychodelic as possible!","review":"With good reason this album has always been seen as a bad imitation of the Beatles classic \\"Sergeant Pepper's\\". It is pretentious and made for people who think that incomprehensible lyrics are a sign of art. I think Mick Jagger was really having a good time when he produced this.... Fortunately this record has got nothing to do with any other Stones-album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess,but they have done a lot worse","review":"Although this is a big mess (the stones response to the beatles epic sergeant pepper),there are at least a few redeeming moments,which is more then I can say for anything they have done for about the last 30 years!!! So,if you feel you need this,and the price is right,go ahead,just don't expect much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Underrated work, one of my favorites.","review":"Of course songs like \\"She's a Rainbow\\", \\"2000 Man\\", and \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" are great, but I also oddly got to liking \\"Gomper\\", and \\"In Another Land\\". Anyway, On with the show (forgive the pun) ...This album may not be appreciated by many Stones fans, but what they don't like about it (being unlike much of their other work) is what I like about it. Sure, I like other stuff by them, but Their Satanic Majesties Request is an excellent album, possibly their stab at imitating Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. (???) Sure, the cover was reminiscent of Sgt. Pepper, the music was a bit .. out there .. at times, but they're two different monsters.Simply put: Even though it's different, it's essential in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stoned Psychedelia","review":"All in all, \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" isn't a bad album. However, it's not in the same league as \\"Let It Bleed,\\" \\"Begger's Banquet\\" or even \\"Aftermath.\\" Still, this album does have artistic merit to it and it's definitely worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"On with the show, good health to you!","review":"There are some albums where the \\"like/hate\\" lines are fixed, immutable, drawn hard daring anyone to cross. This is one such album. I don't like it, I LOVE it! It is so freaking weird coming from the Stones, no, coming from ANYBODY, and therein lies the pleasure. I take issue with those that say that it's mindless, minor-league psychedelic fluff. Intentionally or not, there's an unmistakable menace to \\"2,000 Light Years From Home,\\" a claustrophobia to \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens),\\" and a skewed troubling lunacy to everything else that rivals the first two Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix albums for best head trip from 1967. And, besides, with 36 years between then and now, do you really CARE that Mick Jagger isn't singing here about not gettin' any ? I sure don't.

The dark side, though, is that Roy respects scholarship only slightly more than he respects his followers. Roy talks about brain chemistry, but has no training in medicine or psychology. He talks about quantum physics, but never graduated college. His method of self-teaching is the purchasing of many volumes that he skims in search of support (however tenuous) for conclusions he's already arrived at.Roy is charismatic, yes, but then so are most con artists. What he preaches is pure bunk, overlaid with a good deal of pseudo-sophistication and \\"mysticism\\"! Oooh! On the other hand, if this is your cup of tea, Roy pours it better than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a nice guy, but this book was mostly useless","review":"If you're looking for marketing advice, this isn't the book you should buy. I was looking for advertising strategies and felt I was getting moral lessons in life and being preached at instead. I don't need the Wizard's guide to living a fulfilling life, I just want advertising strategy.I bought another of his books and it was the same deal. It says it's about how to write well, but 75% of it was photos with poems people had submitted to him, which had nothing to do with advertising.If he wants to market himself a little better, perhaps his books should actually talk about advertising, not why I should be pursuing my dreams and acheiving my spiritual potential and stuff.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"Without a doubt the very worst book I have ever read. The author tries to show he is a positive person when in reality his negativity shines through.He makes wild assumptions and negative generalizations about various groups of people in America.

This book, the fourth I have read by his hand, explains to this follower what concepts and hard experience in persuasion can do for me. Roy has performed beyond expectations by connecting the brains workings with actions, thoughts and how they relate to the bottom line of human experience and being persuaded. I have read many authors, none connects the dots, or \\"gets it\\" better than Roy Williams.If you could only read one book on marketing, sales, persuasion, and business this would be it.

It's nice to see a \\"cop\\" movie that doesn't involve destructive, high speed, car/boat chases, blowing up buildings, bridges, or cities, or annihilating entire populations.

All of his characters have something in common, integrity. The novels change in complexity and depth. This is an easy read that continues an interesting man with a troubled past.

That is why I like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly-addictive series!","review":"In this installment of the Jesse Stone series, Tom Selleck reprises his role as the multi-faceted Police Chief of the small town of Paradise, MA. This time around, Stone is visiting his pal, State Homicide Commander Healy [Stephen McHattie] and whilst on a sort of stakeout, both are shot. Stone later investigates whilst Healy recuperates in hospital, and finds that the shooting and the stakeout are not connected. As is typical in the Jesse Stone series, there is more than one story arc. Stone returns to Paradise to find his position as Police Chief threatened by a town councilman.My favorite in the series is Stone Cold, but the other stories are just as engaging, and what elevates this series from the average made-for-TV movie is the intelligent writing, beautiful cinematography and of course, Tom Selleck's charismatic portrayal of the tormented Police Chief.

Simply fantasic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Beakout","review":"I heard these guys on the radio not long before the album came out and I immediately loved it. I listen to a variety of rock, classic rock, metal, prog etc. and found it to be refreshing. It's one of those cds where you can listen to it all the whole way through. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed Arrows and Anchors, I bought Fables, and I love it! It's a fun album with really good music and great lyrics. I'm not sure why Fair to Midland is often considered a progressive rock band, but no matter how they're labeled, they're a darn good band. I suggest this album for anyone who enjoys hard rock, alt rock, and also progressive/artistic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Arrows & Anchors\\"? Maybe!","review":"I was very much impressed with \\"Arrows & Anchors\\", and only got to listen to this album after seeing the band live. While \\"A&A;\\" is still my favorite FTM album, this one definitely comes very close, and some songs, like Dance of the Manatee can beat any song on \\"A&A;\\".Can't wait for the next FTM album, and they're definitely worth seeing live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Doesn't Begin to Describe it.","review":"First, there's the vocals to consider. Darroh WINS at vocals. This guy can wail, can cookie monster growl and THROAT SING. How many singers out here can do that?The guitars texture is damn good, along with the drums and bass, and there's the arrangements to consider.Fair to Midland is not yet another dull emo band pumping out the same generic licks and watered down punk vocals that you hear on every radio station these days. They are wayout there and cool.Then there are the lyrics to consider. Darroh has a way with words that is amusingly sardonic. My favourite songs at the moment are-Dance of the Manatee, Vice/Versa, The Wife, the Kids, and the White Picked Fence, Seafarers Knot, A Wolf Decends upon the Spanish Sahara, but with vocals like this, it's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally something different","review":"Garroth sings like a trio and the band plays like an orchestra. Very refreshing. You'll try to sing along anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"help me out!!!","review":"I was introduced to these guys a few months back....I had to sit through one of their shows..... unbelievable....they were awful. The singer looked like a rat on crack onstage. I have been going to concerts over 20 years. I have never seen a band like these guys. If you can run as far away as you can get...definalte one of the worst bands ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rings eclipse view of iron sights","review":"NcStar 1\\" Weaver Ring/Silver (RS11)I bought these rings because I was looking to have an open view of my iron sights on my Ruger 10-22. The rings are a great quality item, but they did not provide what I needed because the thickness at the bottom of the rings (combined with the thickness of the rail) blocked out the view of the iron sights. I would recommend these if you either don't have iron sights or are not worried about using them while a scope is mounted on your firearm. These deserve a 5 star rating for quality, snug fitment, and design. However, they did not meet my intended purpose. I hope this helps if you are thinking about rings that allow the use of iron sights while having a scope mounted. I kept these, but boughtWeaver 1-Inch Steel Lock Mounts for Ruger 10/22 SS. These mount directly on the 10-22 without a rail and provide an open view of the iron sights. The \\"SS\\" indicates they are silver (as is my scope). Blued (black) are also available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous, but not a must read","review":"Love Me is funny at times, but also very depressing. It's plot is simply not exciting.

But as much as I tried, I couldn't learn to like the book. It had its moments, but seemed to be more and more filler (Mr. Blue, GOP bashing, bad poems, philisophical ramblings, etc), along with just too much gratuitous sex. Basically it was just a thin plot with lots of padding to make it seem worth the $$. Lucking I got this from a book lending shelf, so all I wasted was my time. I wonder if Keillor had the Pederson syndrome himself when he wrote this (from the last chapter). It would certainly explain things."},{"rating":"1","title":"He had me for the first 120 pages...","review":"...and then things came crashing down. Too much \\"Dear Blue.\\" Too much self-absorption. Too much melancholy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Lake Woebegone","review":"This was like \\"Lake Wobegone meets New York City.\\" It just did not work for me. The characters were pretty one-dimensional and the scenes at the New Yorker just plain silly in a tedious way. (Normally for me, silly is a big plus.) The best parts of the book were the letters to Mr. Blue.I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted time","review":"First let me say that I love PHC. I have read many of his books. I lost interest in one of his previous books when he kept describing his elaborate meals and fine wines just too many times.I was pleased to see a book that I didn't know existed by Garrison. I ran across it in the used book section of the book store. There was a reason I hadn't heard of it before.I imagine that you are supposed to see Larry as shallow Larry and pathetic. Personally I found the whole thing boorish. I got the message. I didn't find it insightful. Instead I wanted to clock the guy and Garrison over the head with the book itself. It was page after page of mindless crap going on about writers block and a middle age man in heat.Larry, keep it in your pants - and Readers, keep your dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Guy Thing?","review":"I enjoy the PHC radio show very much (except for some of the toilet humor), but found this storyline to be a turn off. The main character isn't very likable (hitting on the nurse at the fertility clinic while he and his wife are trying to have a child), and the wife who is a serious and committed social worker strangely gets sidetracked with odd forms of massage at the end. Maybe it's supposed to be farce and you just read for the jokes. Still, if this novel really is autobiographical, like the reviews say, one can only imagine what Keillor's wife thinks of all these adulterous confessions. And why would you end a farce with the main character getting an Alzheimer's type of disease? Unless this is supposed to be God punishing him? Anyway, I think maybe you have to be a guy to enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Democratic Propaganda","review":"Keillor should consider using his talent and energy running for office or trying to change all that he gripes about rather than spending most of his time taking potshots-for-profit at Republicans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Home Companion and no where close to Lake Wobagon","review":"Garrison Keillor often seems obsessed with sex.

The teeth seperate and the zipper was broken from the 2nd time being used. The vinyl roll up board was stained by the ink transfer process used. The pieces are big with an ok weight. Finding a case is going to be tough because of it's size. It is not a compact case but portable if it were properly made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toss the dice","review":"After The Turtles song \\"Happy Together\\" became a number one hit, their record company released an album with the same title. That's the way they did things back then. Along with the title track, the follow up smash hit \\"She'd Rather Be With Me\\" was also included. The rest of the album is basically made up of a random collection of songs from the same time period. The songs vary in quality, but most of them are good. The great \\"Me About You\\" is probably the best of these songs. The CD includes three bonus tracks. The hit songs \\"She's My Girl\\" and \\"You Know What I Mean\\" are great, but \\"Is It Any Wonder\\" is nothing special. Fans of '60s pop should enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical 60's music, so enjoy!","review":"The Turtles haven't really turned up in many people's mind when they think of the 60's, but many of the songs are familiar when you hear them! Happy Together is my personal favorite, but in general I believe that if you're into the 60's style of music, you should at least check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA, twice! Piece of junk, not even worth $0","review":"Found this at a local store of a major discount chain. Unpacked it, plugged in the AC, nothing came on. I tried it again, still nothing, no light, no image, no nothing, but the player's body felt warm after a few minutes. Took it back and got a replacement, making sure it was not a return unit or otherwise refurbished. Same problem. Conclusion: total piece of junk, not even worth a penny or less since it'll frustrate you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price","review":"I was surprised to see that its price went up by $25 in the last month. Quite unusual in the age of falling prices of electronic items. Anyway, I bought it to keep our daughter occupied for our 10 hour drive to Detroit. I am secretly glad that she didn't care much for the DVD player. She was more interested in watching the scenes outside. But, her disinterest was definitely not because of anything wrong with this player. It is a fine player for the price I paid. Easy to operate, good picture quality. The finishing is not comparable to Sony, but hey, the price is not comparable either. Comes with everything you need for the road - a 12v adapter and headphones.All in all, a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby's do not last long.

I watched it for about 2 hours when the battery died. Then I plugged it into a TV at home, got about halfway through a brand new movie (no scrathes), and it started skipping. I basically had to skip the whole chapter just to finish the movie. I also noticed that the motor in it is quite loud when the airplane noise doesn't block it out (at home), good thing you mostly use these portables with headphones. I'd say go with a more established electronics brand that's known for it's quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this one!","review":"If you are buying a portable DVD player, don't get this one. It stopped working within 1 month of getting it. The motor for the spinner stopped working, and it would not even recognize that I put a DVD in. Also, even before that, it wouldn't play many of my DVD's. It behaved as if they were all scratched up, even brand new ones. All of my DVDs play just fine on any other DVD player. Plus, I had a brand new DVD that I tried to play on it (first time watching it), and it scratched up part of it so bad, that I can't watch the last 15 minutes on any DVD player.Don't buy this DVD player, the Polaroid like it is much better. I had one for over two years before the battery stopped working well and I tried to replace it with this one. I now have another Polaroid one that I have no problems with.I only gave this player 1 star, because I couldn't give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"coby dvd player","review":"I bought this for my daughter for christmas and it worked fine for about a week.

A waste of money!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"I bought the Coby TF-DVD-7100 player and it worked for about a half dozen movies before giving me a \\"wrong disc error\\" message. I wrote Coby customer service about this after reading on the web that many others have had the same problem, four months have gone by without a reply. They should be ashamed of the way they do business. Now let me tell you about my philosophy on purchasing something. When I buy an item I take care of it so I don't have to buy another, and I expect that item to give me reasonable service. If it doesn't, like more and more products we purchase these days, Then I never buy another product from that company again. I also take the time to let the company know there is a problem and give them a chance to rectify it, It's time consuming, but only fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted - it WILL break....","review":"This unit will fail approx. 91 days after you begin using it. Bought two in December and they BOTH (BOTH? - yep - BOTH) died last week (about 4 days apart). The A/V outputs are great - quality picture and sound. The A/V inputs are great, too - kids were able to hook up the Gamecube. etc. But alas, like other reviewers have noted, one day the DVD player would not recognize DVD's anymore.

Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Oh sure it was great in the beginning.....then the portable power cord had to be replaced; to the tune of $30.00. Not 2 weeks later the entire unit decided to stop working; getting what appears to be a software error so it comes on but will not play a thing; it did not even last 1 year. The Coby on-line \\"tech support\\" was NO HELP what-so-ever but they'll be glad to LOOK at it (not fix it) for $31.00. Well we are not willing to sink any more money into this thing.

After reading all the positive online reviews for the player, and disregarding the reports of the products failure I decided to buy it. After about five months (with very little usage, and no abuse whatsoever) I got the fatal \\"no disk\\" error. My key learnings on this product can be summarised as follows:1) It worked great while it lasted.2) Don't trust a no-name product with a 90 day warranty.3) You get what you pay for.4) I will never buy another Coby product, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video quality. Manual aspect ratio adjust.","review":"I'm amazed that people like the video quality on this thing. Look at it carefully! Jagged lines, flickering with stripes, really really poor job on the video resampling here. The other thing is that you have to adjust the aspect ratio manually!

The ONLY problem is that the speakers don't probide sufficient sound in noisy places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Player!","review":"This player has been great. My mother and I both bought one and have used them extensively. The picture is crystal clear and an easy size to watch. The sound is wonderful. The battery will get you through an entire movie but we did get an extra for longer trips. One of the most important features for us was size/weight. The excellent design of this player has resulted in a compact, well protected and light weight player that can and does go everywhere. In fact when we were in a local video store that carries this brand we were told this player is actually lighter than the one with the next smaller screen. I would highly recommend this player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, low-priced DVD portable","review":"I'm pretty happy with this DVD player. Nice picture, with good color -- recent movies, old movies all look good.Speakers are not powerful, you'll likely want to use headphones. I use a five-dollar Jensen headphone set, and it sounds great. Headphone jacks on both sides of case. Battery can be recharged attached or separately, has 'low' and 'charged' LEDs.Lightweight remote works well, batteries included. Comes with AC/DC adapter, battery, headphones, car-lighter adapter, audio-visual cord for TV and monitors.Control buttons on unit are clearly labeled, and have definite 'click' feel when pushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst DVD players you could buy-AVOID!","review":"This DVD player has terrible build quality and feels very cheap. It isn't even worth it at half the offerred price. Mine broke the day I received it. After playing it for about 30 minutes, it just turned off and would not turn on ever again. I returned it to Amazon, totally unimpressed.For not much more money, you could get a Toshiba or Phillips model, which are way more reliable.You may be tempted to think this Coby DVD player is a good buy but you actually get more bang for your buck and reliability with another player that won't just quit working on you.This DVD player is total garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Features!","review":"This is the best portable dvd player you can buy with this price. It has acceptable quality, really advanced features, and works great.The bad thing about it, in my opinion is that its plastic is too weak, just like any Chineese cheap product. I'd pay $10 more bucks for a better plastic. Well... Anyways... I couldn't expect anything better for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good While It Lasted","review":"This was a nice dvd player for about 15 months of limited use. Recently tried using it, and it started making loud grinding sounds. For some unknown reason, the player won't play anything past track #6 on any of the dvds I place in it. This seems consistent with many of the reviews on the site from people who have had the player for an extended period of time. My limited use of the player over 15 months was probably equal to 90 days of intense use, which ironically is the length of the limited warranty. My next purchase will probably be a Sony or Toshiba model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned Two","review":"I had to return two faulty DVD players.

It then broke for no apparent reason after only two more uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep breaking down with wrong disc","review":"I bought one a year ago. It broke 8 months later although I did not use it that much. I got the Wrong Disc error message. I tried many disc with various format, including many which played on it before so I know that it was not a format problem. I searched the web and then found that this is quite common with Coby. I had to send it back for warranty repair which took over 2 months.Guess what, it just broke again just a few days over a year from my date of purchase. No more warranty.No only I will never buy another Coby. Get a quality brand and you have much better peace of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be worst","review":"If I were to use this product as a DVD player I would be highly disappointed; I am using it as a monitor for my A/V Theater.If you attemp to play DVDs, most of them either won't play or they scip or get stuck on a sceen.

Coby offers no extended warranty, and the receptionist told me that after-warranty repairs require the purchaser to pay for shipping and also send along a check for $31. This is just about six times the cost of a year's extended warranty at Walmart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought two!","review":"Works great. I used them on a 10,000 mile summer road trip from Alaska to Ohio and then the Oregon coast and back again. I used one as a master and plugged it into the \\"video in\\" on the second player. So everyone watched the same DVD at the same time. Then I plugged the audio out into the car stereo so everyone could here it, too. I opted for this method instead of buying a single system with 2 monitors because I like having 2 complete DVD players instead of just one player with two screens. Plus, when I take a longer flight, I have 2 batteries to take along.The speakers aren't very loud so I suggest headphones for personal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed After a Few Months","review":"Worked great for a few months, then failed to work again.

I was a little annoyed by the humm it made while playing a movie. My husband says I am too sensitive to noise and calls me \\"bat ears\\" though so maybe it wouldn't bother most people. The real problem is the one mentioned by others: it konked out after 8 months and started giving me the \\"no disk\\" and \\"wrong disk\\" messages.

Now, after about an hour of use, it gets hung up and just spins around and won't go forward or backward or anything.

It has been nothing but a PIECE OF JUNK. We bought it for our then 16 month old twins for a plane trip we were taking and then for the car. This is what has happened with it in less than one year. It worked great upon arrival with the cords or the battery. Prior to the trip we tried using it in the bedroom with the tv cords-10 min. into the movie the movie went black and white. Changed movies, unplugged the cords and replugged, tried days later-same thing black and white picture. Then a couple months later the car charger died. Then soon after the battery died. Then the ac/dc charger died. Every replacement cord (not from manufacturer) dies within minutes-so obviously it is the machine. Now we have a cord killing dvd player that in less than one year has become useless.

It's refreshingly unique in the world of books for children--books with relatively few words, that is. The photographs are wonderful and match the text perfectly.

And in some moods, I like \\"Frank\\" even better than \\"Back to Black\\". There's nothing quite so immediately catchy as \\"Rehab\\", but jazz is almost always less accessible than pop, isn't it? And this is considerably more jazz-oriented than \\"Back\\": covers of \\"Moody's Mood\\" and \\"There Is No Greater Love\\", even a tantalizing scat-break in the opening track. \\"Cherry\\", \\"F-Me Pumps\\", \\"Love Is Blind\\", and \\"Take The Box\\" are the standouts for me -- though I also find myself absently singing \\"Amy, Amy, Amy\\" from time to time. Here's hoping Ms. W pulls her personal life together and doesn't end up the fastest complete burn-out in the the history of pop music: much as I love both \\"Back\\" and \\"Frank\\" I'd hate for them to be her entire oeuvre."},{"rating":"1","title":"too young sounding","review":"I first heard Amy's voice on Back to Black which is probably causing me some difficulties in accepting her debut album Frank. If you compare the two, in Frank she is much higher pitched almost bubble gum poppish. I like my Amy with more darkness and a huskier voice.

No anaylsis on his policies at all. No real discussion on the historical era of the post-Cold War 90's. No looking into Republican strategy in dealing with Clinton as they waged a succesful and brillant battle against Clinton.

I saw a Braque exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London several years ago and Autechre's post \\"LP5\\" material certainly resonates with the painter's strain of analytical abstraction.Or perhaps not, eh? Frankly, I haven't listened to \\"LP5\\" since my grandmother threw it on a bonfire back in '99.Incidentally, a mate told me recently that \\"Confield\\" captures the \\"essence of Sheffield\\".

This has nothing to do with music. I listen to virtually every kind of music (...) and artists like Autechre, Aphex Twin and Mu-Ziq made stuff I really think is good; the otherworldy feel it sometimes has can be great. But Confield is just a big joke.Take the first track; it's absolutely unlistenable trash which sounds the same as a couple of wine glasses on top of a spinning washing machine.

Sean Booth and Rob Brown, the duo that created ambient masterpieces such as Incunabula and Amber returned in 2001 offering their contractual obligation - Confield. The CD starts out bad and gets progressively worse. I found myself irritated by track 4 and depressed by track 7 that I had spent my money on a CD wrought with spastic, unconfined space junk. The music conjures up an image of our duo furiously creating loops and samples so firmly rooted in the future of how ambient music might sound, that they never stopped to think of how it should sound. I can't offer and explanation, only an interpretation of Confield. Booth/Brown have run out of ideas. Confield misses the mark with their latest attempt. \\"PS2 gains sentiency, quits day job to write music full time\\" PS2 - \\"I'm very proud of Confield, it offers a binary appeal - very one dimensional\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"New album a letdown","review":"The new confield album isnt half as good as other AE releases.

It does not take a conservative listener to hate this album. It's just noise. That would be fine if that's what AE is known for. But the makers of Amber and Tri Repetae did not make junk, so I expected more.

It addresses treatment from many aspects, not only cognitive and behavioral but also nutritional and spiritual. Because it is practical and comprehensive, it is a useful recovery tool. If, however, the reader needs more focus on his/her condition, such as social anxiety, s/he will need to look elsewhere for a deeper discussion of it and specific applications of techniques to that problem. I recommend this workbook for therapists and anxiety sufferers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one tiny complaint, but first...","review":"Let me just say that this book is amazing! Even though its last publication was in 2000 the authors seem to really speak to those who have anxiety. The questions I ask myself as I read are usually answered in the next few pages, and some of the insights really seem like the authors understand what is going on. My only complaint is that I wish there were a better way to organize the exercises in the book, as I do not like to keep multiple copies of anxiety-filled escapades around the house. I wish there were a way to work through the book rather than skipping sections and coming back as needed. Otherwise I truly recommend this book to those suffering with anxiety of any kind, especially social.

The books moves back and forth in time and is more reflective than action-packed. At the end, Jack's lifestyle choices seem to be made less from a love of freedom than a tragic and lonely flight from past traumas.

The biggest groaner was when Mr. Carmine, or Mr. Jack, meets one of Miss Lobo's disrespectful, mouthy kids, and puts the kid in his place in a manner that could only occur in a book like this one.I'lll give it two stars, because, hey, there are people that like this kind of stuff, and who am I to rain on their parade?

It is a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carey's black glitters showered...","review":"This was Carey's first album under Virgin Records. The first track \\"Loverboy\\" was a mixture of a classic Cameo and a screeching Carey. \\"Lead The Way\\" and \\"Never Too Far\\" are the only tunes that can be considered quality songs so there I gave 2 stars, and the rest of the songs are all pretentious hip hop ditties set to dismay local and international fans. As a fact, it has been a flop and then there came the film with the same title and was stamped \\"negative\\" by almost every critic in the US and worldwide. This record is OK but not FINE for my taste. Go get Tina Arena's albums instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This has got to be the weakest album of Mariah's carear so far. The quality of tracks on this album are inconsistant, and the style doesnt suit Mariah.

I wouldnt recommend this album, i would recommend waiting for her next album where she will hopefully go back to her roots and give her fans what they want"},{"rating":"2","title":"still Mariah.","review":"I don't understand why people were dumping on this album. It's great in my opinion. It's filled with dance songs and beautiful, classic Mariah ballads. It has a lot of special guests but it makes the SOUNDTRACK more enjoyable for the song choices. The ballads 'Lead The Way' and 'Never Too Far' are perfect. 'Reflections (Care Enough)' is also a great song for when you're feeling down and want to get your feelings out. I loved this CD and it's GREAT for when you're just sitting around or partying. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"This is not as great as other albums, but is certainly not as bad as critics made it out to be.

If you were thinking that it would be like every other Mariah Carey album, you're wrong. Glitter is the soundtrack to her movie, and the movie is set in the 80's so obviously the music is going to reflect the 80's. She does a great job in remaking some 80's songs like \\"Last Night a DJ Saved My Life,\\" and \\"I Didn't Mean to Turn You On.\\" You also get to hear her spectacular voice on \\"Lead the Way,\\"which is my favorite song on the album, and \\"Reflections.\\" \\"If We\\" w/Ja Rule is also a great song and the reason JLO did all those remixes w/him. When you listen to the album keep in mind it is a SOUNDTRACK for a movie, and that in almost every song she isn't the only artist, and like in \\"Don't Stop\\" she isn't the main artist. BUT never the less, this is a CD that should be in ever MC lover's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah 'Glitters'","review":"\\"Glitter\\" is truly one of Mariah's prime recordings. If this just wasn't attached to the movie which was condemed even before it opened, it would have been Mariah's bestselling. \\"Loverboy\\" is the weirdest track, and Mariah sounds like she had a cold when she sang it. Rappers spoil this track. \\"Lead The Way\\" is the second best track on the CD, and has Mariah hitting one of her trademark high notes, one of only about 3 on the CD. \\"I Didn't Mean to Turn You On\\" is an OK song, but not a classic Mariah remake. \\"Never Too Far\\" is the best song on the CD, and an amazing listen. \\"Twister\\", is a sad song about her hairdresser who committed suicide. Bottom line: A good CD, if you skip all the tracks with rappers on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Mariah a Break","review":"The latest offering from Mariah Carey 'Glitter' is in my opinion ,one of the best records around at the moment. This album contains 11 new never before heard tracks from the 'pop' diva. After Mariah Carey's recent troubles ,the press and some members of the music industry were keen to jump on the bandwagon and write her off as a 'has-been.' But Mariah bounces back once again. And what better fighting talk than the record 'Glitter'. Loverboy,the first track, with its infectious beats and vocals makes you want to 'get the party started '. Lead The Way, is classic Mariah..amazing vocals...beautiful.beautiful song!!! A few more of my favorites are Never Too Far, Want You, If We..in fact all of them. I think this is ,once again, an exceptional album from the leadiing diva. It shows Mariahs evolution as a vocalist, a writer and ,maybe most importantly as a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album by Mariah!","review":"I used to be Mariah's #1 fans. Glitter is Mariah's worst album. She sounded good on her first 6 album (Mariah Carey - Daydream), and then since Butterfly she started whispering instead of singing and wearing bad outfits. The only good tracks on this album is 'Loverboy', 'Never Too Far', and 'Lead The Way'. I give the review 2 star because I WAS her fans. If you like female singer, I recommend you to listen to Christina Aguilera or Alicia Keys instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah Is The Best","review":"When I first got this album, I will admit that I didn't care for it too much. Then, I started to really listen to the words, and I found myself listening to it every day since. It took some getting used to, because of it's 80s feel. The ballads are the best. My favorites have to be \\"Lead The Way,\\" then \\"Reflections (Care Enough),\\" and then \\"Never Too Far\\". Of the upbeat-dance tracks I really like \\"All My Life,\\" \\"If We,\\" \\"Don't Stop (Funkin' 4 Jamaica),\\" and \\"Didn't Mean To Turn You On.\\" I do think that the album could have done without \\"Last Night A DJ Saved My Life\\". It is just too long, and does not showcase that beautiful voice that we all know Mariah has. \\"Loverboy\\" is also a song I can do without. That's the only reason this review only got 4 stars out of 5. I recommend this album to anyone who is a diehard Mariah fan like myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Glitter is pretty laughable.","review":"Mariah Carey's soundtrack to her first big movie, Glitter is a waste of '80s style pop/ r&b songs. I was such a huge fan of Mariah when she first came out but somewhere along the way she become self-involved with her career releasing album after album, she grew to be pretentious and her incredible voice began to give out. With that said, Glitter is her second weakest album (her worst is the hideous and unlistenable Rainbow). But she does she shines on the ballad, Never Too Far and Reflections. Loverboy is just another take on Dreamlover, Fantasy, Honey, Heartbreaker, etc. This soundtrack is anything but inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discovering roots.","review":"With this latest release, Mariah has decided to explore her father's past. Unfortunately isolating her fans along the way - and also releasing an album with forgettable songs. After being one of her fans from the start, I now understand why the film bombed and why Sony bought out her contract for future albums. Don't missunderstand this - I wish her the best - in both her professional and her personal lives, but I hope she re-analyzes the vocal range and chemistry that made her career skyrocket years ago and then builds on this in a way to get her the radio airplay this talented singer deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"her worst CD ever","review":"the only good songs are lead the way, reflections and never too far.

I wasnt sure if would be good because of all the emotional distress and poor promotion. But, I took my chances and bought the album...well what can I say than that this album is great! I love almost every song on it and it really shows Mariah's rise to even BIGGER fame because she has matured. And even though this album is mainly a soundtrack to her upcoming movie also of the same title, it really shows Mariah's talent in full.

I suggest that anyone considering buying this album should purchase the latest from Mary J. Blige instead. It is a much better effort from a real talent. Mariah's album on the other hand smacks of desperation.The movie and album are both stinkers. Bland ballads, [unsuccesful] r&b attempts (with... rappers rapping over the vocals)... remakes of old songs that are better left forgotten, and tacky artwork is enough to make your stomach turn!

Her voice was not doing what she asked of it and she was not helped by a complete absence of good songs.It was her lowest selling album and one listen will tell you why. To the 230 people who give this album five stars, I can hear John McEnroe yelling, \\"You can't be serious!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah's Glitter","review":"Overall, this album was a disappointment. Even though I am a fan of Mariah Carey, the music on this album wasn't very good. Most of the songs sound like pop and hip-hop music, and don't show off her powerful voice. Like (If We, Didn't Mean To Turn You On, Don't Stop Funkin' For Jamaica, All My Life, and Last Night A DJ Saved My Life). However, she has 2 good songs on this album, (Lead the Way, and Never Too Far). Twister was alright. Loverboy was okay.

How? Due to sheer brain washing, using MTV, massive advertising. Now, everybody can see MAriah undressing, in an explicit move to seem like a teenager pop star. Absurd! But,e ven so, GLITTER receive 5-stars reviews.. how can it be possible? IF, even inside her own frame of work, her fans acknowledge that she released better albuns, how can this one, a mixture of hip-hop, rap and screaming vocals, be reviewed so high? Open your eyes (or ears), folks. Stop being manipulated so easily by the media. Mariah always had a great pair of lungs, but never knew how to sing.

What she chooses to do is appeal the the masses by incorporating R&B; and rap in her songs. While doing this she alienates her old fans like myself.I had the displeasure of listening to \\"Glitter\\" in a record shop.

Glitter has all the best intentions and elments: eighties styled music to fit with the film, ballads that are meant to evoke sincere emotion and appearances by some of today's hottest hip-hop artists. But all of these intentions fall short. The eighties music was badly made, the ballads were strained and emotionless and the constant array of rappers on this album got incredibly annoying. The rappers seem like they have more singing the song than her. In other words, it sounds like she is singing backup for them.This album seems forced. Many have said that Mariah has truly revealed her feelings on this album, but I beg to differ. The songs are too cardboard to be like that. \\"Butterfly\\" held much more emotion than this pile of drivel.Mariah has spent far too long focusing on finding herself. Perhaps she should just find some good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Mariah I used to know and love","review":"What a disappointment. I remember back in the 80's when she made her her first albums, i was a single mother and songs like \\"Vision of Love, \\"Make it Happen\\", Someday\\", \\"Emotions\\" , \\"Anytime you need a friend\\", \\"Hero\\" were the songs that helped me get through those bad times. The ballads were beautiful. I loved the backup singers, there was a choirlike sound to them that lifted you right up. I don't know why the need for all the rap. I guess maybe she had too much of a good thing. I vote for her returning back. She really was a superstar in the 80's and early 90's. Or, maybe I'm just getting old. ;-) Anybody want a cd?"},{"rating":"2","title":"well.. i liked it.. =)","review":"this my first mariah album, ever.. and maybe it's the 80s feel, but I really, really liked it.

Go Mariah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Bad As I Thought","review":"As an official member of the 80s Rejects, when I heard Mariah was releasing an 80s themed soundtrack to accompany Glitter I was thrilled. Although I have all Mariah's cd, I thought Rainbow verged on [gargage]..., to be honest. Glitter returns to form, although i would not say it is a classic. LoverBoy featuring Larry Blackmon from Cameo definitely grows & I Didn't Mean To Turn You On is a great 80s moment. The album's highlight for me is Last Night A DJ Saved My Life - Mariah makes it all her own with Busta Rhymes & DJ Clue. This track funks along like noths else. There are a few down moments. What is Don't Stop all about? Never Too Far wails & all you feel is Mariah making a mess of the song. Ironically Virgin chose to release these. Are they trying to kill her already? The disappointing sales do not fare well for Mariah, which is unfortunate, as Glitter is really very good - well, better than the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"The saddest example of selling out","review":"Like back in 1997 during the butterfly album.She used to be a talented singer, she used to incorporate soul and emotions, she used to write good.

Since the rap r&b direction her music has simply lost all meaning. She has become a joke to me. I stopped being a fan after the god-awful Rainbow album and now I despise her deeply.Go and buy Maxwell, Lenny Kravitz, or some Luther Vandross.

First, all the songs sound like her last album and she does the same melodies, riffs, etc. I know they say \\"if it works, don't change it\\" but she really needs to. Mariah needs to stop producing the songs herself and find some great people to do that for her.

A listened to it a little bit over the next couple of days and then put it on my Mariah shelf. However, it wasn't until about a week ago that I actually really listened to it. And I found that I liked it a lot! It can't compare to any other cds she's made, but it is great all the same. It was a different direction for her.

Shrieky tried to do what Neil Diamond did with The Jazz Singer in 1980 but whereas Neil succeeded with a superb soundtrack, Mariah flopped. Also, her releasing this dud on 9/11 destroyed her chance for success. The soundtrack stunk and Never Too Far and Loverboy are crap compared to gems on The Jazz Singer like Hello Again, America and Love On The Rocks.

None of these songs are worth listening to and neither are the ones on her previous albums. Also, her album names need more thought to them. Glitter? Rainbow? Butterfly? Daydream? Music Box? Sounds like something a 9-year old girl would name their album. Mariah is 32! I wouldn't be surprised if her next album was entitled LIPSTICK or UNICORNS & PONIES or some[thing] cheesy... like that.

It sound just like her few previous albums (unfortunately). She could've picked few good songs form each of them and make a really nice album.

The few shining tracks are \\"Lead The Way,\\" \\"Reflections,\\" and \\"Never Too Far.\\"1) Loverboy- Awful chorus and too many collaborators, but catchy. 5/10.2) Lead The Way- Good and soft ballad. 8/10.3) If We- Good upbeat song. Collaboration not too bad. 7/10.4) ...Turn You On- One of the two 'cheesy' disco renditions. 5/10.5) Don't Stop- Aboslutely awful and horrible. 2/10.6) All My Life- Just good. 7/10.7) Reflections- Deep and emotional. 8/10.8) Last Night...- Boring, and again 'cheesy.' 4/10.9) Want You- Decent, but too plain at times. 6/10.10) Never Too Far- Great love ballad. 8/10.11) Twister- Good, but repetitive. 7/10.12) Loverboy- Much better when excluding the many collaborators. 7/10.74/120- 62%: **1/2"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a soundtrack, not an \\"album\\"","review":"All in all, this is not a bad CD. Not your typical Mariah Carey, but then, one thing people seem to forget is: it's not an \\"album\\" proper, rather, a SOUNDTRACK to the movie. Yes, every song was by Mariah (w/ guest artists thrown in), but it was still a soundtrack released to go along w/ the Glitter movie. So I find it rather funny when critics and people slammed the CD and called it a flop. Soundtracks generally aren't #1 blockbuster records, so it's not surprising that this one wasn't, either.

This CD came out to mixed reviews, and many people are hesitant whether or not to buy it. Although it's not a must have, it is an enjoyable album throughout. Ballads like \\"Never Too Far\\" and \\"Reflections\\" are beautiful, but there are still your typical hiphop party jams like \\"Loverboy\\" and \\"Last Night A DJ Saved My Life\\".

Never tommorow brings(heck i dont remember the title?) was very powerful and moving. I also liked the fact that there were a few 80's inspired tracks on this album. Mariah doesnt really step outside of the old crooner r and b/T-pain/biggie sound. So I thought it was intersting. Most of this album is enjoyable, while the movie just down right blows balls. I just think people were alittle tired of hearing Mariah Carey(hey it happens, i havent listened to this really in at least 5 years!).

Some of the songs you can't even tell that Mariah is singing words. It sounds like a rapper is rapping over the drowned out beats and she is moaning annoyingly over them. I wanted to like this album. I even listened to it 3 times a day when I got it and said \\"okay I am going to make myself like it!\\" I turned it off every single time! It is horrible noise even many Mariah fans can not bare. Maybe this is the reason that only one of it's singles even charted and the album hass fallen out of the top 100 after 10 weeks.

What ever happened to the emotion mariah showed in gorgeous tracks like \\"my all\\", \\"cant take that away\\", and \\"without you\\"?

She shouldn't be bogging herself down with rap artists and the like. Rather than running to what is a \\"hip\\" or \\"current\\" (J-Lo, Destiny's Child, etc.) sound just for the sake of being hip, I'd rather hear her pushing new musical ground and strething her sound like Madonna or Kylie Minogue.Mariah baby!

I just have one question, what made her make this album??? Was she held at gunpoint forcing her to make it?? The album has WAY too many rappers that aren't Mariah (HELLO!

Andie, although she's been a mother for nine years, knows little about that and is plagued by guilt that she's leaving her girls with a stranger to pursue her career.Various complications ensue, none of which paint the leading characters in a positive light.The best parts of this book are the author's somewhat amusing, though repetitive, musings about suburban life.

Isn't that what you normally do? Why write it? The kids didn't sound right, either. One sounded like a miniature adult and the other like a three year old, although she was suppose to be older.However, the premise was interesting.

The one scene that totally was a thumbs down was when the wife, Andie, gives the nanny a very hard time. The nanny doesn't quit--which would be the case in real life--but, seems to glide through the incident.

But what is best about this book is how realistic the actions are. You truly see the layers of personality in the different characters and how their lives are impacted by the events in them. I've read all of Lloyd Alexanders children and young adult books - this is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent middle book","review":"This novel is very well-written. The action keeps the reader engaged, and perhaps distracts him from the thought-provoking exploration of war, democracy, class struggle and revolution that it frames. The first book of a trilogy is limited by the need for exposition, and the last by the need for conclusion. As such, it is only in the second book that a trilogy can stretch its legs and explore the world into which it ushers the reader, and this book does so with aplomb. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay!","review":"i am sooooo happy that this book is being published again. i love this book. its the best of the three in the westmark series, and i've been looking for it since i checked it out from the library 3 years ago. i would reccommend this book to anyone- you have to read the whole series- its great- but this one's my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather cute","review":"This was a fun story, generally.

The cat is obviously overweight, so we got the harness to get her some exercise without the worry of losing her. A car went by and alarmed her. She panicked and got out of the harness in less than a minute. Yes, we had it on correctly. If you have a small cat, who is already used to going outdoors for a walk with you, AND nothing startles your little feline, it MIGHT work. It' not very high quality, and not at all secure.

I gave it one star, because it was the lowest rating available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Large Cats","review":"I have a cat, Loki, who used to enjoy going outside, but he would sometimes get easily distracted and want to chase after anything that moves. I used to have a nice cat harness, this is not like it. Like the other reviewer said, a cat can slip out of it if he/she tries. Luckily, Loki didn't attempt that. My issue was that the harness just didn't fit him. All three of my cats are larger then what most people picture when they think \\"cat\\", but only one is overweight. Loki is just too big for the harness. I still was able to use it by extending the part that goes around the waist using an old collar, but no matter what, it is not a secure harness. There are better ones out there. Unfortunately for Loki, we moved, so he hates going outside now that we live in the city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie","review":"I Liked this movie but it had to many stero types.

My only complaint is that I wish the album were more family-friendly. Some of the humor is a little on the PG-13 side of things.

I love to hear ghost stories and legends, so I was rather excited to read this book. My expectations were dashed when I found that I had to weed through all the commentary about how the author feels about Utah culture before I arrived at the story, and the stories were not very meaty or FACTUAL. Another issue I had with this book was the poor writing mechanics. I've seen high school students who have better sentence structure. I couldn't finish the book. I would not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Politics","review":"I picked this book up expecting to read ghost stories. Instead, we got her political agenda and complaints about the Utah culture. Several things stated as fact were historically inaccurate (i.e. Snow College was named for Erastus Snow, not Lorenzo Snow). In the section on the Salt Lake Tribune and Lamb's Cafe building, there was a three page diatribe on the conflict between the Deseret News and the Salt Lake Tribune before she even got to the ghostly encounters and they weren't even related to the newspapers.

It is as accurate as this book is while being more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was excited to find this book as I am interested in hauntings and I grew up in Salt Lake and am familiar with several of the sites mentioned in the book; however, the author seems more intent on bashing the Mormon church in general and men in particular then in presenting substantial evidense of haunting. I noticed several mistakes regarding historical facts and place names. The book is poorly researched and poorly written. The book was too boring to finish. Not recommended.

There is somehting about a kid who can live on her own and have only fun, be very funny, and not worry about what other people might think, that will appeal to anyone!The simplicity, playfulness and at the same time depth of the story make it endearing.

True, they do seem a bit childish now, but still as wild and crazy as ever! Their unique slurring chord bridging gave their early songs a really brazen style.

This compilation proves that the Kinks were serious rockers and more than just noisy guitar strummers and drum bashers. Ray & Dave Davies wrote some of the best of 60's rock, all included here. Today's so-called rockers could learn a thing or two listening to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation of early singles","review":"Greatest Hits albums fall into one of two categories. The first is a summation of the artist's career up to that point. The GH album acts as a polaroid snapshot capturing both the elements that influenced the artist as well as their artistic and musicial growth. The second is to milk the fans for more money. This collection falls into the former camp.Rhino has done an outstanding job on most of the anthologies of 60's and 70's bands. The Kinks GH collection is an exceptional example of Rhino's best work. The sound quality is excellent (some of these tracks appear in stereo for the very first time)and the booklet notes very good although I could without John Mendelson's opinions on the band's artistic peaks and valleys.The song selection presents some of Ray's best work.

This was a mistake as Mr. Ellis apparently dashed this off on his way out the door. I suppose when one has written many books, particularly on one subject, re-iteration eventually becomes one giant summary-which this book is. This is a throw away. Both for the author and the reader. I'm looking at it now on my bookshelf, lamenting the waste of money and time. Mr. Ellis probably regrets the time but not the money. If you are seeking an alternate view of reality, and who isn't, check out David Burns, \\"Feeling Good\\". Much more substantive and not a gloss over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessable and Effective","review":"To put it bluntly, the techniques described in the book work... period! You can't say that about most self help books. You definitely don't need a therapist to garner a huge amount of benefit from the trivial sum you'll have to pay for the book. That said, the techniques only work as well as the effort put in to implement them.The book is written in a way that's understandable to any reader.I do prefer the work of David Burns on CBT because it is more comprehensive and is better written. I'd recommend Feeling Good..the New Mood Therapy over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without question, the best self-help book I have ever read!","review":"This book is fantastic, exactly what I was looking for. I knew it was out there but unfortunately it took me awhile - and many unhappy days - to find it. Within the first few chapters I started feeling better about myself simply through the idea that I do not need anyone else's approval and simply accepting that there are going to be people out there who will not like me no matter what I do - but that's THEIR problem, not mine. With this mindset, I have been able to look at my relationships with people in a new light. I still try to be friendly and polite to others but if they do not reciprocate, it is no longer a problem. I haven't finished reading this book yet but I know I will never buy another self-help book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NONSENSE RAMBLING...","review":"I found this book to be full of ramblings and fluff. Whatever somehow resembles advice or technique is common sense and useless for those with serious conflict. While I feel that conflict takes two, I don't particularly think it's fair to place all responsibility & work on one person ( usually the victim, or nice person). How about a book on how to not be an A-hole? A much better book is EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL by Susan Foward. E.M. offers true whys and what-you-can-do-about-it that this book suggests, but is somehow disguised as ramblings.

I like the Destroyer series and am glad they are on the Kindle. So far, out of the first five books in the series this is far and away the worst for the poor OCR scan job done. Like the earlier reviewer says, there are atrocious errors like Till instead of I'll, missing sentences, missing lines and quite possibly missing paragraphs. And they are charging $2.99 for this book, but only 99 cents for some of the others.If it wasn't for the terrible OCR scan job I'd give this at least a four star rating. Of all the Kindle books I have read in the past couple of years this is absolutely the worst one for quality of the scan.I purchased the book on October 25, 2011, well after the publisher told the first reviewer it had been fixed.

Well I didn't need to worry with this Stereo Speaker System. Acoustic Research has always been a brand known for making speakers that give justice to sound reproduction. The base just thumps and is very smooth. I didn't have to worry about some of my favorite musicians sounding like they were amateurs because of the quality of the speakers. The listening experience for me is detailed. I try and pick up on subtle variations in the talents of the musicians and you only do this if you have speakers that fully recreate what the artist had in mind when good music is put out to be accepted by a discerning public.

Like the last review says, it's really just an outline with a few sample questions. Even the sample questions were nothing like what I just took, and the explanations of the answers were too brief to be helpful. There was a lot of BS about preparation and test taking strategies which was all common sense. It really seems like this book was just thrown together to make some money, not to help students. The MCAT Review book, on the other hand, was very helpful. I didn't even look at the sample questions, but I read over the organic chemistry sections the night before the OAT, and the organic part of the OAT was a breeze. I also used it last semester to study for my Chemistry final, which I aced! Obviously since it's not made for the OAT, some parts were irrelevant, but it was worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plot to get them more money","review":"Well, the book does have information in it that can be useful. But what gets me is that the cover explicitly says 2001 OAT prep, but as soon as you open the front cover you see that they have just put a new cover on the 2000 edition. Even the dates that are listed in there were incorrect. The test questions were OK, but upon cross referencing with my other study materials, i found that every single problem in the book was also listed in the MCAT prep guide from a few years ago, and the MCAT book gave explanations to the solutions while this book did not. Bottom line - If you have nothing else to use, this book is OK. If you're serious, get other books which have better explanations for problems and give better background on the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This book is definitely NOT \\"Complete Preparation for the OAT.\\" It offers useless generic advice such as not studying late at night. The actual review material is condensed to a few pages and an outline of every topic tested. The instruction even tell you that you can purchase thier MCAT book for more information. All in all, there is nothing in this worthless book that is of any use.I suggest the Exam Kracker series of MCAT books. They have thourough coverage of Bio, Chem, Organic Chemk, Physics and Math. The books are clear and concise and use figures to illustrate the text. Also, review questions are found at the end of every section to gauge understanding. Although these books are a bit more expensive in all, it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"check it out at the library just for the practice exam","review":"The practice exam at the back of the book is not actually full-length. Especially because the OAT is now computerized, consider buying TopScore Pro instead and also using Kaplan materials. When the Lippincott arrives in the mail, you will be surprised by its thinness, both physically and by the extent of coverage of material. Most public libraries also carry it (or the DAT version, a good substitute), and you can copy out the exam and the grading scale (which will help you score your Kaplan practice tests) from the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as flame throwing as the debut but just as funny .","review":"Yea,ok,so some peaple (chiefly women and some PC pusheads) probably will find Lee Vings misanthropy semi-offensive at least.But after your done making MORE BEERS subject matter your focal point (assuming you actually believe Ving is any consequential theat to society) its understood that MORE BEER again shows anyone who is at all familiar with the old LA hardcore scene that FEAR could outplay more than half thier peers.The album opens up with THE TROUBLE TODAY WITH WOMEN THE MOUTH DONT STOP with Vings volcals evoking images of a young Bruce Springsteen.And damned if its not one of the funniest albums i have ever heard.

They had plenty of good wine there and cheese dips ect but the irony of missing the gig and being with these bottom feeders never left me. Fear really are a band on their own unique trip, nothing quite sounds like them. Lee Ving finds effortless ways to be offensive to all those wishing to take the bait. More Beer and The Record are my favorite long plays of theirs, but their later cd's are good also. Describing their sound is difficult, let's try redneck early 80's hardcore with vocals being mixed high above the music and musical influences being broad amongst the punk scene. So please learn from my mistake, if your caught with the peace/love and \\"i feel your pain\\" set and your sick of hearing the latest Bob Dylan cd then spice up the party with \\"More Beer\\", I'm sure it will be appreciated.

Fear was and is a punk parody. The music is pitifully generic and the lyrics are far too stupid to be offensive. A number of vastly superior bands (Dils, Zeros, Avengers, etc.) never had the chance to record a full-length LP in their brief life spans. The fact that Fear has something like six LP's and are still making money off their tired old schtick only proves, once again, that you don't need talent to sell records."},{"rating":"2","title":"question?","review":"My copy of this CD has the song \\"strangulation\\" on it but it doesn't list the song on the back cover or the sleeve.

No one can argue with that. Unfortunately, the book goes overboard. While the concepts are indeed worthy, the book falls short in implementation. If you try to transform corporate culture a la Marshall, you'll spend all your time in committees and find it impossible to make the hard decisions that management alone must make. Having attempted to implement Marshall's doctrines, I found his approach unrealistic. This is great conceptual reading, but leave it on the bookshelf where it belongs.

All of his brothers and sisters have names that describe them, like Jumper, Hunter, Thinker, and Sniffer. Runt wanted to go with the pack to hunt and he does but he gets in tons of trouble; he even gets blamed for killing his own brother. Runt has a pretty hard life.

I like to read books that are kind of sad but turn out good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, even for a book geared towards the younger set...","review":"Being stuck with a name like Runt is not exactly something anyone would be proud of, esp a young wolf. Runt has much to learn and makes many mistakes. You feel bad for the little guy, but I felt the book lacked details that could have enhanced it. I'm sure there are better animal stories out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wolf with Character","review":"RUNT, like all books by Marion Dane Bauer, tells a gripping story in which the main character, in this case a young wolf, makes one mistake after another and through them learns and grows in character. In this case Runt competes with his siblings to gain a place in his pack and his father's approval as he seeks to show that he is more than just the runt of the litter. His adventures are increasingly harrowing making it difficult to put the book down. I found myself reading late into the night until I was satisfied that Runt would gain a satisfying measure of wisdom and belonging. Bauer is expert at telling tales that intrigue children while dealing with strong psychologicla issues in beautiful language that sinks deep into the reader's heart. Runt illustrates this one more time"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOOK YOU CAN'T MISS!!","review":"...I Love This Book!!!!It was about a little wolf pup named Runt because he was the smallest wolf of the litter.

Silver also had two other kids, a boy and a girl. The boy's name was Helper and the girl's name was Hunter. When Silver had the five pups, Helper and Hunter were just one years old. Runt's pack didn't get food everyday. Sometimes they had to wait three whole days.

You will proabibly like it.It is for ages 7 to adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but also a little sad.","review":"Runt was a very cute book but also it was a little bit sad. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, the book still was fantastcic, but it was still a little sad. Runt is a black wolf with a white star on his chest. He looks exactly like his father, King but King is afraid his poor little son will be too weak to survive so he named him Runt. Runt didn't like his name but one day, when he got older after three wolves had died, he finally got a new name at the end of the book. It was a very cute story. The reason I didn't tell you much about how this book began and ended is because I just don't want to give the story away so forgive me that my review is a little short but I think this book is really wonderful even though it's a little easy to read. I don't think it matters though, I love this story anyway! I recommend Runt to readers at younger ages but I definitely think that all young readers will love it. Even older readers that are above the level of this book like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runt","review":"I really like this book. It has alot of heart and personality in it and it really shows life through a wolf's eyes.However, I think that the characters could have had their history explained more such as Bider.

I especially enjoy Otherside, American Zone, and Nice Guys. I was quite disappointed in the Revenge album that followed this, as I had high hopes for an album similar to Change Today. After that, came Hit & Run which completely changed the band's style in an attempt to jump on the 80's glam metal bandwagon. Thankfully, Jack Grisham took TSOL back after Wood's third album without him. Even hardline Grisham fans should appreciate Change Today? for what it is; an impressive punk album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the real TSOL.","review":"This album was made with a new TSOL lineup following the departure of their legendary vocalist Jack Grisham.

It relies a lot on surreal imagery and a fragmentary pacing to convey the messiness of the life of Leon Barlow, full-time writer and wrecked-up vet. Arliss Howard embodies Barlow fully; it's amazing that he was able to both direct and star in this film and to do a great job in both roles (and a third; he co-wrote the script as well). Paul Le Mat, a great actor who should be seen more often onscreen, almost steals the film away from Howard in the part of his best friend Monroe, who suffers a tragic turn of events that ironically partly serves to bring a semblance of balance to Barlow's out-of-kilter life. The whole movie is a finely-wrought stream-of-consciousness tale, with the underlying theme being that people somehow manage to maintain connections with one another despite the body-blows delivered by life. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Angst of Arliss","review":"If everything in your life is going well, you'll likely regard this story as somewhat frustrating. For once could you NOT be drunk, Barlow??

WHO doesn't have CORNSTARCH? Well, I guess we don't. Not tonight anyway. So all the time spent to prepare for this soup and we are stymied by cornstarch.

Wile's texts are so truly readable, making the concepts very understandable. In reading his texts, even I as a teacher have had some \\"aha\\" moments, as he has connected some things for me that had not been clear before. If you want your student to truly understand the concepts in addition to being able to work problems, get this text. I do enjoy adding extras to my class, including more high-powered labs, to make an honors class, but this course (as is) is certainly sufficient for a college-bound student. I have taught out of several different texts over the years, and this one is by far my favorite. Most texts are so unreadable that I never assigned reading, using the text only as a source of problems, but with Wile's texts, my students read from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy fit for '00 Audi A6 2.7T","review":"Got the product *after* confirming it will fit my car.

Pretty much everyone should read this, ESPECIALLY those in leadership positions at churches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good scholarship","review":"The subject of Biblical history is certainly a fascinating one and and I had eagerly awaited dipping into this volume. Unfortunately, though, I found myself too often distracted by glaring mistakes of fact (a couple gaffes which would have brought poor grades to a high school student) and some preposterous conclusions which were far from justified by the evidence. Aside from this I'm afraid I can say little else in review. There is a certain level of competence one should be able to expect from authors and publishers, and when the most basic level is not achieved I lose my patience.

He meets and adopts a little boy who also belongs to himself, and the two independent souls begin to live together cooperatively and happily. Indescribably charming. One of Ms.Brown's best, and should be revived for all of us jaded parents who have to read the same story over and over again.

Mister Dog, aka Crispin Crispian, lives a great life and shares it willingly with rabbits, cats, other dogs, and a charming little boy. Brown was indeed wise to ask Garth Williams to do the illustrations because they illuminate the book, as well as the room in which you may be sitting to read the book, with warmth, delight, and amusement.

I was tired of replacing cheaper clips several times a year when they would break, and they always did. I've now seen very similar clips at Target by OXO for around the same price. I was a little bummed because I had also paid for shipping with my purchase, which doubled my cost. I noticed the set at Target does not have the holes built into the handle for hanging up.

Either way, I do suggest OXO to anyone searching for quality bag clips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Gadgets!","review":"Here's one of those household gadget items that has proved to be really useful. It's an OXO bag clip. We have a lot of smaller bag clips, but these extra wide clips are particularly useful on large cereal bags, large potato chip bags, cat-food bags and the like. I fold the bag edge over several time, squeeze it as tightly together as I can and then apply the clip. On especially large bags, I use two of the clips. The clips are strong, easy to use and look good. Do it right and it will make a nice seal.

For some reason I cannot explain they discontinued their Oxo Heavy Duty Clip which was far, far superior in every way possible. Amazon used to carry it, and if I had known Oxo was going to stop making them, I would have bought several of them to have on hand. Their Heavy Duty Clip was the best I have ever found, it was extremely versatile, and it was good looking too.These bag clips cannot begin to compare or be as useful to the Heavy Duty. They are not as strong, and their shape is not as functional. They only work for closing a bag of chips, and that can be done by any number of other clips on the market. I bought these red clips hoping they might be useful, but I am extremely disappointed.

When I compared each show to the 2003 dvd, the 2nd show seemed brighter, but there was no improved video or sound definition. The other3 shows were inferior in clarity. How can these people take a step backwards in quality, and sell the product as being remastered? For the best product, seek the 2003 version.

None better. To this date, no band or performer in any idiom has topped the impact these performances had on music, popular culture and social change. These televised gigs display songs, singing, ensemble performances and charisma beyond anything else in music, prior to or since. These shows were like an alien invasion. They ended the '50's, kicked off the '60's, helped a grieving nation heal from the horrific Kennedy killing, and launched revolutions in thought, social change, sexuality and music that shaped the cultural curve of the most important century since the dawn of civilization. All that accomplished with just 4 voices, 2 guitars, a bass, three amps, a drum set, killer chops, and perhaps most importantly, amazing songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja Vu","review":"I was a young teenager when I watched the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Shows - I remember them like they were yesterday.

If this is, indeed, a reprinting of Bingham's original expeditions, they are facinating period pieces full of the hardships of exploring before tourism, basic amenities, travel health care, much less maps.

The portion sizes are a little hard to adjust to, and I found myself frequently hungry, but I adapted quickly. The exercise you must do is merely taking a moderate walk after two of your meals. I didn't even do the weight routine he suggests and still lost! The only drawback to this diet is that it takes a LOT of preparation time to make the recipes.

I am not terribly knowledgeable about MacBeth, either the historical or the Shakespeare version, but I trusted that Ms. Dunnett's fabulous writing would carry me along anyway. This book seems to differ from her other works in that the writing is less absorbing and her characters are poorly drawn and even confusing. Whereas I couldn't read her other books fast enough,I had to struggle to read King Hereafter all the way through. By the end of the book I did feel some empathy for the main characters but all in all King Hereafter does not measure up to Ms. Dunnett's previous efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a book for those who cannot persevere.","review":"Every page is packed with information about the times, the mores, the texture and taste of the characters.

The background research performed by the author is impressive, and the book might have been a splendid read if only the characters were not drawn so one-dimensially. Has there been something else in their life than intrigues? Feasts, passion, life at home?

To be fair, it isn't Jennifer fault, I thought she did quite well overall, she looks great as always and demonstrated the ability and range to do more than just light comedy. I hope she'll get the opportunity to act in more serious roles in a good production in the near future.I'm not exactly sure where to place the blame for this dismal failure, all I can say for sure is that nothing seems to work in this film. The usually likeable Jimi Mistry is totally out of character and a non-factor in the movie while Dougray Scott fairs a little better but not well enough to spark any real interest in the viewing audience.

The dialogue was real, the scene settings were so well described I could picture myself at a table near Claire and Lonnie in some of LA's best places to be seen. This is not a book to read piece-meal. Let me warn you , once you start reading about the perils of Lonnie, you won't want to stop.

It does sometimes leak from the large top opening if you don't get it sealed -really- tight and may even then leak a very small amount if you leave it upside down with the hose on top (not that you would, since you can't drink from it that way).Would other, more expensive bladders not have these issues?

The cd is well mixed, and by that I mean, the balance between the songs which are instrumental and those who have vocalists are well balanced. Which is something most bands never grasped the importance of. If you have ever listened to a cd with 20 songs by the same artist or the same group of 4 or 5 people you can understand that. I would put this cd in a class of jazz fusion, and the only other group which mixes instrumentals with vocalists and is as well, ingenius and innovative is the band Galactic. My friends who have listened to this cd have given me the same reaction, which is basically \\"wow, this is great.

I felt I was being told too much reference info (like the DFD example).

It is a collection of common practices and questions to ask that every architect should be familiar with, anyways.

It may have been recorded in the late 70's, but even by late 70's standards, the audio quality is poor. In fact I have heard better quality Sex Pistols material from sidewalk vendors. The concert itself is really lacking in the legendary energy the Sex Pistols have been known for. There is no witty banter with the crowd at all. Not a hint of antagonism from Mr. Rotten and not a single \\"loogie\\" is heard coming from the equally dead crowd. Simply a big let down if you're a Sex Pistols fan looking for a good live material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sounds","review":"This CD offered the perfect background sounds for getting me through my big deadline...

Mellow and relaxing with NONE of the boredom factor that a lot of mellow music has. This is a masterpiece that NO Electronica collection is complete without. I can't possibly say enough good things about this album or do it justice with the mere English language.

Some of Delerium's absolute best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle perfection","review":"Can we say \\"Flowers Become Screens\\"? I mean, that probably is like, the perfect pop song... it's just dark enough, just danceable enough, just enough to sing along to, just uplifting enough, just enough emotion without being cheesy, just subtly intelligent. Plus we get the famous Leeb basslines without anything being held back! Delerium presents a thick veil of worldly influences mixed with some techno / drum'n'bass sounds and even orchestral elements melted in. If this record floats your boat, check out Karma, the another great Delerium record... in fact, check out the Spiritual Archives... and be on the lookout for new Delerium in mid-2000"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok, but it's not Enigma ... or FLA for that matter.","review":"First of all, I like Enigma, and I also like Front Line Assembly (these guy's main project) but I wasn't blown away by this album for some reason. Any Leeb/Fulber expert, who isn't blinded by their love for these guys will admit that they are notorious, and often critized for excesive sampling of other people's work - and this album is no exception. It is LITTERED with Enigma samples (as well as a few other artists) ... and isn't near as satisfying of an album. I find it dull and boring and can't quite pinpoint why. Maybe because there are no surprises, it's too monotnous, or too contrived. Karma (Delerium's follow-up) is a much better album than this one, which I'd recommend instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't anyone notice the boring and trite percussion?","review":"All the nice things said in the other reviews are reasonably true, but sheesh! Electronica offers infinite options for percussion - it does not HAVE to be trite, incredibly monotonous, and synthetic sounding. This is the bane of so much electronica, it's a joke. Nothing with a petty-swingin' rhythm can be good. I would give this album four or five stars if I could just erase the silly percussion tracks - almost identical in half the songs. Get the Karma album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neatto CD!","review":"This CD is just plain enchanting! I love the feel that I get everytime I liston to it. Kristy Thirsk has a brilliant, angelic voice that is both haunting and beautiful at the same time. Although she only sings on two of the tracks, Flowers Become Screens and Incantation, the rest of the CD is awesome. If you loved Kristy Thirsk on Karma (too bad she was not on Poem) then you have to get this CD. My all time favorite track has got to be Incantation (awesome!), but the whole CD is just a delight to liston to. If you like Enigma and the newer feel of Delerium then this is a CD that you have to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Heavenly Ambient","review":"The Front Line Assembly guys-Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber, along with other talents like Kristy Thirsk uses her angelic vocals in this ensemble of heavenly ambience. Leeb and Fulber put their Ambient and Rhythmic Auditory talents to work here. Greg Reely and Cryogenic Studio provides Sonic Realization. and the results a mysterious, gothic voyage weaving through Gregorian monk chants, angelic chorus, tribal beats and atmospheric conditions. I think that is project is one of their best along with th POEM album compliation. Thirsk sounds so much like the voice of Sarah MacLachlan. Any fans of MacLachlan will like this. This is the kind of escape music you can lose yourself in. If you like Enigma and Amethystium, or light industrial, ambient music then you'll like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"Beware. . .the product title says \\"unsweetened\\" but it actually contains a sweetener called stevia.

Then reading the book I thought it was too long by a good 100 pages. But you really only need one or the other, or sadly, neither.

And when one puts together a great work, a great orchestra and a great conductor - who at the same time has full control of music and musicians alike - the result is this, an album one simply cannot pass without. Berlioz's struggle with insanity, as mr Bernstein puts it, contrasts greatly with the maestro's firm, stalwart conducting hand. Bernstein then promenades through the symphony's five movements as if he were a head-shrink visiting his loonies in a sickbay, while we're left to fall madly in love with this rendition of Hector Berlioz's 'trip'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Went to a live performance of this music.

I was pleasantly surprised when this album turned out to be one of the best of the year. The first disk screams trance, ranging from beautiful, heart-warming melodies to \\"get up and dance\\" party tracks. Alex P. doesn't skip a beat with this mix, taking you higher and higher until you are about to burst. Although a few of the tracks have been overplayed, they still pack quite a punch. On the second disk, Brandon Block gets the house moving to a funky club style. Using strategically placed basslines and upbeat vocals, Block shows listeners that you don't have to be at the club to get down. Overall, I was highly impressed with this album. If trance is your style, you won't be disappointed. If club beats are your style, you are in luck.

I opened up the package and looked at the power wiring. It's borderline fraudulent to advertise this as 8 ga wire. It has a thick plastic casing to give it an 8 ga diameter but the amount of actual copper wiring is closer to 12 or even 14 ga. I had a small amount of actual 8 ga left over at home from years ago and the amount of copper in the Pyle kit is nearly half. I'm afraid this thing would short on me. I didn't even consider installing this. Shame on Pyle and Amazon for advertising this as such. The other connectors, etc. are ok in the kit but I may still send it back. All the wiring is very undersized compared to what's \\"advertised\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree","review":"I agree with the another reviewer that the amp hook up wire is certainly not 8 AWG. After I stripped the insulation off one end, I pulled it through my stripper's 12 gauge size hole and there was no drag at all. Pyle should be ashamed to claim this bogus gauge size. It is beyond borderline fraudulent! I should have known better due to the price compared to others. As the previous reviewer said, the rest of the items look pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised by manufacturer","review":"I purchased this to hook up my amp under my drivers console in a 22' boat. I barely had enough power wire to make it to my amp. And the 8 gauge wire was hardly 8 gauge. Maybe 14 gauge at best with. My other biggest complaint was that in a boat, you do not have the ability to ground to frame as in a car. So in most cases, you would need to run the ground wire back to the battery as well. This is a little difficult when they only supply 4' of ground wire.At best, this is a 12 gauge car kit with added insulation and an extra gasket. They need to really redesign this kit with marine application in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"I should have read the other reviews! The power wire actual cooper is just about 1/2 the size of the REAL 8 gage wire I had left over from a previous install. I cut this power wire in half and soldered the ends together to create a single wire from the combined halves. This served as my ground as I re-used my original 8 gage power wire. The speaker wire was also smaller than advertised. Looks like lamp-cord. I used the wire but I am unhappy with the actual gage and will eventually replace it. The cable ends didn't crimp well and I used a set from my local marina.Would not reccomend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"In one word, junk.

We also sent photo's of bikes falling over with the arches wrapped around the wheels. Contacted Saris again and was told the arches were to support bike during storage. Obviously a photo of the arch wrapped around the wheel of a bike lying on the ground didn't suffice. So instead of going through all the hassle of sending them back I just took them to my friend who is re-engineering them. I was very disappointed with the arches.

Richard James, in his Aphex Twin persona, tested the limits of his equipment when he compiled the various tracks. As a result, the sound will severely test the limits of your speakers. This is particularly true of the bass, which is so heavy that I suspect in many instances that it is actually subsonic. While I'm not about to question the accuracy of its title, this is not an ambient CD in the sense of a chill out and relax offering. If you want that, check out the appropriately named \\"Chill Out\\" by KLF. But if you want to hear cutting edge sound of the late 80s - eary 90s; sound that is so far removed from the mainstream that it remains cutting edge today, \\"SAM\\" is the way to go.

Movement, so jentle yet so compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"MMmmmmmbient works is more like it...","review":"This collection of tracks from the early stages of Richard James's career and experiments fits not exactly into the sphere of 'ambient', as in Brian Eno, but 'ambient techno'. And in there, this release is one of the defining documents. Essential. Lush atmospherics + beats dominate here, and provide an experience that's as welcome in a chill-space as in one's own headphones. There are no duff tracks on this one, although those expecting the harder RDJ sound (see Caustic Window, or much of the recent Aphex material) probably will get thrown somewhat by the inviting feel of this album. But I doubt they'll be disappointed, honestly. My only regret here is that James doesn't pay much attention to this musical territory these days; his current work could benefit from revisiting these efforts, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Aphex Twin but....","review":"Even if you are an absolutely fanatical Aphex Twin devotee (and I am), you can safely ignore this disc. The otherwise talented n' tasteful Richard James should have left this one locked up in the vault. Yeah, he was 14 years old while working on some of this stuff... and it shows. Even by the relaxed standards of the 'ambient' genre, I found this album predictable, dated and boring.

If you're looking for the PERFECT after-party CD or just a CD you can close your eyes and just \\"release\\" to, pick this one up.

True, touring has taken a backseat to families and dayjobs, but the Connells are still making music and playing the occasional local or regional show. In fact, they are working on material for a new album! So don't give up on The Connells just yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great music -> masterpiece!","review":"I was trying for nearly two years to find this LP in Germany, and when I finally purchased it from the UK, I immediately knew it was worth the efforts. This is simply great music, and it sounds far more authentic and honest than their last LP \\"Still Life\\". Surely, the sound quality could be better, but as far as I'm concerned, I don't care so much about that as long as the songs are so touching. This is in many ways one of the best Connells albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate mess","review":"Was hugely disappointed in this one. The engineering is remarkably bad for a band who has been putting out good music for as long as the Connells. There are other strangely mixed albums in their catalog (Boylan Heights), but those other albums at least have the plus of having great songs on them.The Connells have tarnished their legacy with this one, Still Life was a masterpiece...

I am amzed the connells have never made it to the ultimate limelight in the music industry, however, I am selfishly glad since I have the pleasure to continue to introduce friends to the daring and original style of the Connells. Old school dropouts has a more mature edge to it with an artsy garage sound. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Connells are Back!","review":"Their best effort since \\"Ring\\", \\"Old School Drop Outs\\" is full of catchy songs that you can't get out of your head. Too bad these songs won't be heard by anyone except for die-hard fans. Such a small label cannot possible promote this adequately. The production is the only thing that prevented me from giving it five stars. About a third of the songs were recorded using an analog 4-track and the remainder with DAT. The sound just isn't as crisp as on their past work. All in all a welcomed return from a band I didn't think I'd hear from again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Connells Drop Out - was it the Drummer?","review":"I can't believe this is the long-awaited follow-up to \\"Still Life\\". This CD sounds as if I recorded it on a cassette tape off a scratchy vinyl LP then left it out in the rain for three weeks before playing it on my beat 70's clock radio and listening to it through my cell with about 1 bar of reception. Yes, it's that bad! AND, I have been following this band since their inception - or at least since they got good enough to tour away from Raleigh (best show? Blind Pig in Ann Arbor 1993) and I've seen them perform 4-5 times over the last 10-12 years and they ROCK. I love them, but perhaps the departure of the original drummer Peele was for a good reason after all - maybe it's just too much heartache and jagermeister? Whatev, it's not what we expect and demand from guys like the Connells with so much heart and talent. C'mon fellas - you owe us all a good album to follow up this \\"Weird Food'esque\\" trash.

And without a single doubt this is his finest release. I haven't been convinced by the other two, with production lacking a little, but am very much impressed by this album. Flooded with special guests from the world of Westcoast and AOR (Lukather, Baird, Gaitsch, Thompson, Paich, Denander, Porcaro) this album is a smooth as anything else out there and better produced than most. This album is better written and performed and far better produced than the first two albums and comes highly recommended to any fans of smooth Westcoast, AOR and the likes of the guests involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raga","review":"This is an incredibly beautiful, informative and moving film.

Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's feel sorry for the victim","review":"As I read Judith Moore's book, I cried and laughed in recognition. I was disgusted and appalled at how close she hit home. Most of all, she made me angry. For those of us who are fat, husky, or large, we are not pitiful creatures. We are not defined only by our size. That is one part of who we are. Yes, my weight has shaped who I am today, but I have chosen who I am as much as my parents have molded me. I love food and I eat it. Fat people are not people who walk around thinking we just can't help it. It is very simple. If you don't eat, you will lose weight. God knows it's not easy, but it is a choice you make. This little rule applies to Judith Moore too.This memoir is soaked with self-pity and Judith Moore fancies herself as the martyr of fat people."},{"rating":"1","title":"This woman needs counseling . . .","review":"not a forum for spreading her poisonous thoughts and emotions to the public. She needs to recover from her self-hatred instead of assuming that other fat people feel the same sense of shame that she does.

I hope that Judith Moore finds a good therapist and gets the help she obviously needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, whiny, just GET OVER IT!","review":"You only have to read the first chapter of this book to get the whole feel of it. Yes, she was fat. Yes, she was abused. You know what, Ms. Moore? So were millions of other kids. All you wanted was a loving, happy family? Yes, so do millions of other kids.Other reviewers say this book is intense and raw: maybe so, but I also think it was boring and full of self-hatred. Why waste time reading something like that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Girl Book","review":"I ordered this book along with the Hollywood 24-Hour Miracle diet. The book was packed in the same box with the 3 bottles of the liquid diet. One of the 3 bottles of the Hollywood Diet broke open and leaked all over the box and ruined the book. I returned the book with the one open bottle of the diet and the 2 unopened bottles of the diet. In the future your employees should pack liquid items securely and separately from other items so they do not move all over the box and break open ruining the other items that are shipped with the liquid items.I received full credit for my return of this book. However, I originally requested another copy of the book but unfortunately it was out of stock. I ordered the book from another company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very honest look at one person's life","review":"Ms. Moore shares with readers her deepest feelings and realizations of growing up overweight in a dysfunctional family. Opening the closed door behind which the abuse occurs, survivors like the author are refusing to stay victims. Dealing with her self-esteem issues and family dynamics, she portrays her life unflinchingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy childhood makes for unhappy book","review":"This book totally depressed me. The cover and the blurbs did not provide clues to the true nature of the book. The author seems to dislike herself, and that comes through page after page. It was well written, but the story was simply too bleak."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was open-minded..yet the door began to shut","review":"I began reading this book with the hope that it would open up a new narrative to me of a world that I thought I had, for many years, shared in some format or another. However, while reading the first 10 chapters, it appeared to me as an over-engrossed blog full, not of insightful learning/challenging experiences, but of the author's need to explore every vocabulary word that she could dig out of her mind to describe foods that she wanted to eat. To me, it got old fast..off topic...seemed like the 'worse case scenario' of any experience, had this author at its worst demise. Just seemed too 'poor me' and truthfully, unbelievable at many turns. To the point that..I felt..she was just trying to fill up the pages was nothingness as her publisher made her have a quota of pages to turn in, more than the rough draft she might have initially presented. As you would probably guess, I don't suggest you run out to buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book about being fat, its about hating yourself","review":"I am fat, and I have always been fat. I have never hated myself. I was a fat child, nobody ever made fun of me, called me names, molested me at recess or in the movies, and while my childhood was not a bed of roses, it was not because I was fat. This woman hates herself and I feel sorry for her, but it makes me angry that she blames all her problems on food. Her mother was abusive, told her she wished she had never been born, that she was useless and ugly. She slapped her and cursed her and made her life miserable and she blames it all on being fat. But if she had not been fat, her mother would have found another excuse for the abuse, because she had a problem, not the child. This book just perpetuates the idea that all fat people are miserable and it simply is not true. Too many people blame their misery on being fat, but most fat people are truly happy...At least this one is....Leave this book on the shelf..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad, painful read","review":"This is one of the saddest books I've ever read. I'm usually okay with sad, especially when there's a great lesson or a happy ending. I picked this book up because I thought I would get a better understanding of how very overweight people feel and how they live there lives day to day. I was way off on that - what I got was a terribly depressing detailed account of a horribly abusive and neglectful childhood. The only plus about this book is that it is a very quick read so you can get it over with quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Fat Hatred?","review":"Why is it that all the size positive books out there seem to sink into oblivion, but yet another self- and fat-hating book gets touted to the skies? That the author had a traumatizing childhood is undeniable. That this childhood makes every woman smell like \\"meat\\" and every fat person worthless is ridiculous, offensive, and hateful. This book is anti-woman and anti-size, and is written with the language of an adult, but the emotional knee-jerk reaction of a child. The author's childhood makes my heart ache, but it's time to grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book ever...","review":"so...this book started out all-right, with some vivid imagery, but it sharply went downhill, with the author refusing to write about a personal topic which is why i chose it in the first place. instead, she writes in a very detached way the history of her family, which she didn't even experience herself, starting w/ her grandparents when they were kids. it has nothing to do w/ her experiences of being fat, except for the fact that her grandfather has a bad eating habit like she does now. it's extremely boring and dry, packed chalk-full of needless informational facts about their grandparents, like where and when they were born, etc... i stopped reading this book about 40 pages because it was so bad, and it was a huge waste of money. it read like a high-school history book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"Just read this book for our monthly book club selection only 1 person out of 15 liked the book.

This is human experience, exquisitely, precisely told. If you want life wrapped up in tidy fake ribbons, this is not the book for you, as, indeed, it was not for four previous reviewers.

Judith Moore desperately needs intense therapy. I don't think I could put it any better than the others who have only rated this piece of trash one star--I would've given it zero stars but that option is unavailable. Ms. Moore, please do everyone a BIG favor (no pun intended) and keep your opinions of fat people to yourself from now on. The world will be a lot better off if you do. Awful. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and Riveting","review":"I've never been a heavy girl-I've been blessed with a high metabolism and a relatively thin structure my whole life. I bought this book after finding it on a friend's wishlist and reading the summary. What I found upon opening this novel was more than I bargained for. Judith Moore tells us her story in painul detail. She makes no apologies, no excuses, just tells us what it is to be the \\"fat girl,\\" the subject of horrid jokes, the constant internal battles of the mind and spirit, the innumberable attempts at losing weight, only to see it creep back on. I think that \\"Fat Girl\\" opened my mind to a world that I've never been a part of, and definitely made me more sympathetic. I would recommend this book as something more substantial than bedtime reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"I thought this book would have more resolution but instead it's an insult to women."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't talent!","review":"As a fat girl myself I am very disappointed by this book. I was expecting a story and instead I got a bunch of ramblings. This book doesn't make sense.As soon as Moore started describing an interesting situation that got my attention, she stopped abruptly and changed topic. This is not a talented writer. This is a woman who knows her vocabulary and decided to show it off. What a waste of time, reading a page and a half about a cheeseburger. How about describing this man who was so rude and offensive, instead of a darn burger! I don't get why this book got so many good reviews. It's not a pleasant read. It has no flow. While reading this book I became annoyed by Moore's writing style. It feels as if she was purposely trying to make it bad, just to be different. The only good thing about this book is the dog stealing chicken scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"This book was nothing but annoying. I wasn't able to finish it because of how annoyed I was. In the first three chapters, the author goes on and on about all the food she loves to eat. It got really old fast and made everything feel off topic. The story didn't seem to have a story line. It was all over the place. It wasn't about her living her life as a \\"fat\\" girl, it was about her putting other women down with their personal struggles. A very immature book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice book","review":"very nice book, but if you dont like reading about food, i dont thinks its a good idea for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, self-indulgent and sad","review":"I have never been slim and so picked up this book with interest, but the endless descriptions of fat were disgusting and the stories about Judith's childhood were horribly sad. I cannot imagine what possessed her to write this book except perhaps a serious mental health crisis (to which she is certainly entitled based on the contents of this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring with an Abrupt Ending","review":"I listened to the audiobook and had to force myself to finish all five CD's because I wanted to see how it ended. Four and a half CD's full of lists of all the food she ate growing up and an abrupt, unsatisfying end. It's like she wrote down everything she possibly remembered from her childhood, whether it was relevent or not, and then had to finish the book to meet a deadline. Did she learn any lessons from her bad childhood? Does she try to treat her daughters better than she was treated? Has her self esteem improved any as an adult? What was the point of writing this book? To tell us that fat children are doomed to be sweaty, stinky, and unlovable the rest of their lives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read or well tried to read","review":"It was sooo boring for me. I only got 50 pages in and decided I wasn't gonna waste anymore of my time. She just names off foods and rambles. There's no plot line or anything and it's impossible to stay focused in my opinion. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Draining","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Her experiences of abuse made me feel deeply for her and I appreciated many parts of it but just could get beyond her hatred of herself and the description of smells. I know that sounds strange but read the other reviews and it'll make sense. After I read this book, I felt a little emotionally exhausted. It must be what a psychologist feels like at the end of the working week. Additionally, because of all the self-loathing fat body smelling description portions of this book, I felt a little sick to my stomach and skipped lunch. Okay, that's a little ironic. Anyway, go get it from your library if you are curious. I spent 99 cents on it at goodwill and will definitely be donating it right back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like attending a psychoanalysis session on obesity","review":"Rarely have I read such a detailed and honest portrayal of one person's struggle with obesity. Pulling no punches, Moore lets it all hang out...her abusive parents, her pain and despair and sense of hopelessness and her obsession with food. At the heart of the book is her loathing of her body, the container she would NOT have chosen to house her spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but too depressing to be worthwhile","review":"I heard this book was good, so I waited many months until I could finally get it. I have to say, though, it was one of the most unredeemingly depressing books I've ever read. I'm not unsympathetic to the plight of \\"fat girls\\", as the author called herself. I have at times been significantly overweight myself, and I know how difficult it is. But this book was just filled with such self-loathing that it got painful for me to read. Despite the fact that I almost quit reading it twice, I finally finished it because I hoped that there would be something redeeming in it by the end. But unfortunately there wasn't. It was about the author's self-hatred up until the very end.It's not even that the subject matter was too depressing. Sickened by Julie Gregory was about a far more disturbing subject (child abuse), and it was still riveting reading. This book made me feel like I was reading someone's suicide note."},{"rating":"2","title":"a graphic story of the consequences of not believing","review":"Euripides' \\"the bacchae\\" is an interesting story about a king who refuses to believe a stranger who walks into his city is a god.

The information on Amazon says that the book is 28 pages. In fact the book I received was 21 pages and is only a commentary - it is missing the Greek text.The poor rating in this review does not refer to the quality of commentary by Beth Causey but the fact that I expect commentaries to have a copy of the Greek text, and I expect books I order to be the same number of pages as stated in the information on Amazon.Several of the reviews here seem to be of a different book altogether since they refer to an English translation of the text. I have never heard of a Bryn Mawr commentary that gave an English translation of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Great drama. I'm not a huge \\"classics\\" fan and yet I enjoyed this. If you're into Greek mythology and like flowery language and prose (and lots of melodrama) you will enjoy this.

Read this like you would a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgraceful translation","review":"No translator is credited for this text - the incredible story of Dionysus' entry into Greece which has interesting hints of hidden rituals and about which Nietzsche wrote extensively. Dodds, the Greek scholar, has also concentrated on it.

It should be a separatealbum. But I guess nothing can be done about it. I just lovethe spiritual part of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors and too dense","review":"I get unceasing complaints about this text. The explanations are too shallow, the topics are too dense, and the author presents wonderful proofs with no explanation of what it is he is really trying to prove, or why the proof is important. To make matters worse, there are material errors in the text that impact the dicussion he presents. These errors make it nearly impossible to understand the underlying points he wants to make, and unfortunately there are many errors (for example, his whole discussion of CNF in Chapter 2. There are many others).I think that when the author corrects these errors, and rewrites uncomprenhensible parts, this could be a good text. For now it is average at best, and I do not think it is ready to be used for classes, at least not at an undergraduate level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a book on rosacea","review":"I've had rosacea for about eight years and felt pretty hopeless about it.

It is written for middle school readers, and will please those who want something exciting, not too long, and not mushy. Phineas Gage was working on the railroad in 1848 when an errant explosion sent a crow bar-sized tamping spike up through his neck, past his eye socket, and right out the top of his head. Appropriately grisly illustrations for those of us who like that sort of thing.The author works in a good deal of medical history and \\"brain science\\" along with his tale of Phineas' horrifying accident. Modern advances in our understanding of the brain are also included. A glossary, resource list and index make this a great teaching tool as well a very interesting read. Wish I'd had this book when I was studying the brain in 5th grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so...","review":"I'm fascinated by Phineas' injury, survival and subsequent challenges with his injury. However the book digressed more than I think it should have. When the author was explaining that doctors back in that time didn't use aseptic techniques and didn't even know that micro-organisms existed, that should have been about the end of that statement. But instead, the author digressed paragraph after paragraph giving a primer on microbiology, which is nearly irrelevant to phineas' condition. Yes, he got an infection, but did we need to learn a little microbiology to grasp the concept?Similarly, the author digressed for quite a while explaining the basics of neuroscience and anatomy that stretched (in my opinion) beyond the scope of Phineas and his injury.Over all I thought it was a good read. However, it's a relatively small book printed in relatively large type, nearly double-spaced. Perhaps the digressions were more for filler since I felt they went beyond the expected subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Made Irresistible","review":"This is one compelling and very entertaining read, albeit not for the squeamish. While aimed at kids, adults will find it equally fascinating. It has all the elements of a wild work of fiction, yet it's an eyepoppingly true story--just try and put it down once you've opened it. It's great to see factual science presented in such a winning, approachable style. After ordering a copy for my biology-minded kids, we thought so highly of it that we got a copy to donate to our local library as well. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick entertaining read","review":"First, this book can easily be read in one or two sittings, that being said, it's not worth the hardcover $16 list price. Pick up a copy here for a couple bucks and all is well. Otherwise, i found this book to be a page turner. The author has a great \\"story telling\\" writing style. This book is a little step back in time, fortean in nature, and educational all in one short, well illustrated book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky or Unlucky?","review":"At the beginning of the book you are told to pay attention and at the end, decide whether or not Mr. Gage was lucky or not. This book was fantastic. I'm not a blood and guts person, and I thought this book would be ALL blood and guts. This book turned out to be better than expected. The text is easy to understand, and Phineas Gage: A Gruesome but True Story About Brain Science had phenominal pictures. I would suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK book","review":"Bought for my husband. He thought it was really cool. Seemed very thin and for a younger reader(middle school or maybe high school)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"A friend gave me the CD to listen to on my trip to Panama City Beach, Florida. I chapperoned my 18 year old daughter and her 3 friends. I drove my surburban and on our way there, we listened to all the RAP music I could stand. We stayed 5 days and had a wonderful time. When we departed at 7:00 a.m. on our way home, I told them to go to sleep because me and the Manhattans were going to drive them home. I put the CD in and turned the volume up real high. The drive is 7 hours and I listened to the CD over and over for 7 straight hours.All I can say is \\"I sure wish that I could have been there\\". The album is AWESOME!!!! And those South Africans certainly appreciate the talent of the Manhattans!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"Reading this book was a painful waste of time! As a graduate student taking an Internet marketing course, this text was required reading. I found it to be extremely arrogant and repetitive. Lamont states that all data shows that Americans are losing their reluctance towards m-commerce, but never sites any data. This is just one example of Lamonts self-proclamation of being an expert. He never examines the issues of why Americans are reluctant to use wireless technology (i.e. decreased functionality vs. the computer Internet and a reliable wired telephone infrastructure). He makes broad statements and tries to compare the mobile markets in Europe, Japan and the United States, when they have very little in common."},{"rating":"2","title":"with its nice smooth quailty you cant not like it","review":"\\"Time Has Come\\" is a very enjoyable album, all the way through from crickets to heavy guitar solos. I give it 5 stars because even though its got some rough edges in the production of it, since it is self released, i think it makes it more wonderful and it sounds more from the heart. Each song is delightful and makes you smile whether the lyrics are airy and good natured about love like \\"Golden\\" or deep and about death like \\"24 Hours\\". With the great lyrics and melodies this album is so likeable, the feeling in the songs are easy to relate to and in a way it touches home. I love the theme of this album, too. Its nice to see something like this done to an album that is so original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun DVD of Sasami and Mihoshi","review":"It is a nice DVD to have some fun with two of the characters in Tenchi"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The Mihoshi special was the better of the two. But not by too much. Basically it was a mediocre plot only made interesting by occasional 'in-jokes' and using the other characters to 'act out' the story. All of whom resented being made part of the story. But the Pretty Sammy episodes were obviously just used as a testing ground of ideas, some of which carried over to the later much better Pretty Sammy series. However most of them were dropped like a hot potato. Deservedly so. The 3 Sammy stories were just not well thought out, being choppy and jumpy in their storylines. Example, Pixy Misa forgot she was supposed to be French in half of her lines. They should either have added about 10-15 minitues to each episode to make it smoother, or as they did do, give up and start over with the much improved Pretty Sammy series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther Vandross Ultra Selection","review":"This is my second favourite Luther Vandross album!!

As weird as that concept is, Crystal Waters pulls it off, with her comeback club chart number one \\"Come On Down\\". The main hook is the campy \\"Ba-ba-ba-da\\" chant and the catchy \\"come on down, come on down, don't you wanna party with me\\" chorus. The best version of the track is the extended club remix by Tamperer, in my opinion, while the radio edit also provides a bite size kick. The other extended mixes by Live Element and DJ Dome also come with their radio edited counterparts, and a pair of fresh dub mixes by Silent Nick and Keith round out the remix collection. The track isn't groundbreaking and at times it can be entirely annoying, but for a track this catchy and dance floor ready, you don't need to be breaking any new ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true NOVELTY number, only for the strong-willed!","review":"As I was enjoying the fun and sun of an area theme park, my ears caught the recognizable \\"voice\\" of Crystal Waters, warbling as the familiar \\"Price is Right\\" theme played in the background. Walking with my four-year-old niece, I began to step to the infectious tune, becoming totally enraptured in the rhythms.I had to find that song.Well, find it I did and I wish I hadn't.For some reason, outside of the confines of the theme park, the song loses much of its appeal, weakening to a rather routine bit of retro disco. It's more of an oddity and probably belongs in one's audio collection for that reason alone.Because this \\"single\\" recycles the song seven times, this one belongs in the cutout or maybe the two-for-a-dollar bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pentecostal Classic","review":"For years this book was the textbook on Pentecostal Pneumatology. It is a clear and concise study of who the Holy Spirit is and what He does. It was written in a way that allowed both laymen and serious students to understand the subject well.

Gotta admit, there's no way I could drink that much and be that coherent. Must be a gift. The biggest irony is that he's just as big of a hypocrite as the judgmental masses he bashes. And so am I.

An interesting, down your throat point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"no refunds vs. deabeat hero","review":"I think \\"deadbeat hero\\" is a much better DVD. The set-up for \\"no refunds\\" just seemed off. The mirror background behind the stage was distracting and the stage seemed too bright. Stand-up comedy works best with some darkness. That's why I think the black and white works so well in \\"deadbeat hero.\\" Stanhope's material didn't really have any continuity to it and it's not his strongest stuff in the way of punchlines."},{"rating":"1","title":"shock factor","review":"Rather that developed some respectable material this guy banks on your love of shock.

I can laugh at an abortion, drug or religion joke--if it's an actual joke and if it's funny. As others have stated, he is just more or less ranting, without a point or punchline. He could be Andrew Dice Clay's unfunny cousin because that's who he reminded me of.

Anyone interested in the investigation and prosecution of murder cases and their impact on their communities will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb True Crime Chronicle","review":"Jacqlyn White has taken an older crime set in the 50's, breathed new life into the story, and made it relevant for avid true crime readers. The story is unbiased and has just the right spin on it at the end to enflame our emotions. It is also a interesting venture into the segragated South, all male jurors, distinct social classes, and racial divisions. A very unique tale of a manipulative woman who doled out death sentences to her own family members for personal gain, but ultimately conned the judicial system and escaped her own punishment of death by electrocution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curiosity of a Georgia native","review":"As a twelve year old growing up in Georgia, I was a bit too young to understand the story of Anjette Lyles. It was discussed frequently at family get-togethers during the pretrial to posttrial years because of close family ties. My cousin Charles Adams was the assistant prosecutor on the case and in researching family history my interest was peaked once again about the circumstances of this shocking case. Mrs. White did not disappoint. As a grown up the story read much differently than heard as a child. The author was fair and equitable in presenting both sides of Anjette's story. She laid out and gave credit to the strategies of the prosecution as well as the defense attorneys. I closed the book and even with new insight still wondered if a Mother really could kill her own daughter and if she did, how she could live with the fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book from my home state.","review":"Knew the case already and wanted to read it as it was from my home state.

He breaks it down into fifteen different parts, grouped in threes. If that sounds confusing, it is. Some of the categories are responsiblities, requests, and reasons.Hemphill has a few good insights into prayer. He doesn't agree with vain repetition of the Lord's Prayer, but also doesn't advocate ignoring it. He is able to blend stories of his own families relationships and communication with spiritual life and conversation with God, but sometimes the anecdotes are forced.The writing is choppy, and I found it hard to stay interested. I didn't like the dissection of the Lord's Prayer. I think there is a lot to be learned from it, but it shouldn't be broken down into little pieces like an essay. This is a nice effort, but I don't find that it helps one's prayer life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catalan Made Easy for Spanish Speakers!","review":"An excellent book for Spanish speakers wanting to learn the norms and basics of speaking Catalan, one of the several Romance-based languages found in Europe. Spoken by over 7 million people in Spain, France, Andorra (it's official language) and Italy (Sardinia), Catalan is one of the ten most spoken languages in the European Union (although it is not recognized as an official language of that organization.

The box set may be worth the price just for the five tracks on CD #2. My original LP that I've been playing on my turntable for decades is worn out. So I figured it might be time to get the remastered CD plus the bonus material. Anyone who appreciates great rock 'n' roll guitar playing will love hearing Mick Taylor's solos on \\"I'm Free\\" and \\"Satisfaction.\\" Is it worth $46.49?

The backbeat drumming is just superb on Jumping Jack Flash, Honkey Tonk Women and most of the others. Yes, Charlie was really good that night in MSG.

The DVD of outtake footage from the 1969 tour, although only 28 minutes in length, is superb. There is a sublime scene of the Stones and The Grateful Dead at a heliport about to head out to Altamont. Jagger clowns around while Jerry Garcia chuckles in the background. Priceless footage.

First, the school is having the yearly physical and Hibiki might have to have a physical too! Then, in the second lesson, the students start getting into fights. How will Hibiki handle their flaring tempers? Then, in the last lesson, the school's director tries to set Hibiki up with the perfect man!During all this Hibiki finds out he likes bras and is starting to enjoy shopping. What is a cross-dresser to do? And does breast size REALLY matter?The extras are great. Another art gallery and the female student roll call. High ratio of laughs per minute. While only 75 minutes, I think there is more humor packed into the second DVD than the first (as I pointed out before). IF they can keep to these high standards I will have to declare this the best cross-dressing anime series EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Volume 2- Very interesting","review":"I think this had more of a touch of humor than the first one.

The money will be returned, but I do take issue with the order of these procedures, especially since I now cannot get my hands on the book in time for Christmas.

The other reviews all made it sound so wonderful, so I purchased it. Much to my disappointment, the movie is more about the teenagers than Rob Lowe's and Julia Ormond's characters--indeed, I would consider their story line to be secondary to that of Chelsea Hobbs' character. But I will admit that when they are on screen I enjoyed their performances and story, and the photography is very good.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

So, whateever you do, DON'T READ THIS BOOK. If you do you might think about stuff you wouldn't normally think about. At least that's what I believe all books do, but I wouldn't know because I just critize books, I've actually never read one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daegu girl","review":"The line I agree with most in this book has to be on the back cover: \\"No book summary can do it justice.\\" It's not your conventional sort of a book, take that as either praise or damnation depending on your tastes! Honestly, it didn't suit my tastes, I'm a fan of narrative and know very little about the surreal. But if you do, then am sure you'll like it, because the author doesn't hold back. The best thing about this book is that it's shameless and bold enough to say whatever it wants! Which you have to appreciate for honesty alone. Personally, I hope the next book is more accessible. It's like Marmite - a love or hate thing, so you have to read it for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully Honest","review":"Before reading \\"Elitist Camelback Gaga\\" I had never delved into the world of the extremely surreal (I'm not even sure what the hell that really means) and my virginal experience didn't quite get me begging for more. I can appreciate the mixture of the written word with the various visual stimulants contained within Gaga, but I personally thought that the overall concept interfered, rather than aided, in my enjoyment of the plot. I don't want to push anyone away from this book for I am obviously not connoisseur of the genre and therefore am not really qualified to make any harsh criticisms. I can however give this bit of advice; if you want to experience something that will challenge the socially constructed ideals on which books are based, dive on in. If you however are like me and enjoy a more straight forward approach to reading, steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"misinformation in print","review":"This is a terrible book. It is sloppy; for example the Italian nobelist Segre becomes Segra; the authors claim to be experts on uranium separation but in attempting to describe the operation of a calutron they actually describe a centrifuge. The worst offense, however is the intellectually dishonest intermingling of historical facts and pure conjecture on the part of the writers without giving the reader any way of knowing what is what. An obvious example is the statement that Clinton bombed iraq to draw attention away from the Monika Lewinsky scandal. Certainly he did order the bombing; but why he did so neither the authors nor anyone outside that administration know. The mouthing of extremist propaganda is no substitute for good journalism. Unfortunately this level of reporting is repeated over and over again in this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating a dead horse","review":"Given that the IAEA declared Iraq nuclear-free in 1998 and thus far nobody has found any evidence that Saddam restarted the program after the inspectors left the country this book is more than ridiculous.The sensationalist and flatly biased authors ignore the fact that Saddam's nuclear program evolved and almost reached its peak during the Reagan and Bush years but was completely dismantled during Clinton's tenure. Even if Saddam had wanted to nuke the US --which itself is a rather silly allegation-- he never had the means to do it.If these so-called journalists think they know it better they should present their arguments to the IAEA or to the coalition forces who are now inspecting Iraq. I wonder what they could achieve.This book is a good read for those who are either paranoid or pathologically anti-Clinton or both but not for those who really want to know what happened to Iraq's nuclear capability during the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Holocaust story.","review":"I always hesitate to say too much about these movies as it takes away all the elements of surprise.I very much enjoyed this movie. It shows how people help people and what we are able to do when we have to.I hope by remembering where we were we will never go there again.A must see for Holocaust survival lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring film in October","review":"I admit I was swayed to purchase this DVD by the good reviews it received on Amazon. I like films about WWII; I like DB Sweeny; and the plight of Danish Jews sounded compelling. But the film is a 'dud' and sad to say in particular because DB Sweeny just isn't very good here.The story of the Danish Jews escaping to Sweden just before they were to be sent to concentration camps by the Nazi's, should hold anyone's interest, but the effort by the filmaker to make an engaging movie just falls flat. Scenes go on too long with no forward movment of the story and I just couldn't find anything that likeable about the characters. So don't be fooled by the reviews; this movie isn't terrible--just 'dull' in its presentation and really not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame acting","review":"Acting was lame at best. Sounded like they were reading their scripts. Very hokey. Not a good representation of the incredible true events surrounding the organized escape of over 7,000 jews from Denmark, and the way it was carried out by the Danish people. If you want to see a good movie about these events, see Miracle at Midnight. Much much better, even though it's a Disney \\"made for tv\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good True Story Drama - A Day in October","review":"My family and I enjoyed this suspenseful drama. The acting was good, and I bought this movie because it is based on a true story. The main characters are interesting and show strong courage during a very painful time in their lives.

Two things make this totally ridiculous for anyone to consider purchasing: first, the guy singing has no voice, no talent, no musicality, no personality....it was laughable (except for the fact that I paid good money for this outrage). Then to top it all off, none of the tempos are correct. It does not even come close to correct tempi. A total waste of money, in my estimation. For the record, I have a doctorate in vocal performance and was a National semi-finalist in both the Metropolitan Opera auditions and the San Francisco opera auditions. So, I know what I am talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLF at their best","review":"This is the best SLF album, and also one of the best punk albims ever.

There's a little text (rather stiffly written) at the beginning that sounds like the boilerplate stuff you'd find in any introductory book on IBD. Most of the book, though, is made up of recipes, which don't sound much different from recipes you'd find in any cookbook. All in all, not a good match between writer and subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work for me.","review":"The recipes have milk and cheese -- IBD makes many people lactose intolerant. Also, recipes include nuts and mayo and beans, etc. Virtually no recipes I can have.

I find the overall tone to be melancholy without being morose. Surely a difficult balance to achieve. And his execution is flawless. The maestro has got the hands of a surgeon.Ben's music is powerfully beautiful and profoundly moving. It leaves me breathless and utterly overwhelmed to the core each and every time I listen.I cannot thank you enough, Ben, for creating such a pleasure for my ears.Here's hoping for more of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 page Monograph","review":"The item I received is not an pictured. It is also a 20 page monograph. I thought this was a book. It also has no symbols in it. It is filled with Rosicrucian ways on living. It does not focus on symbols or explain symbols which is what the title states it should do. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book. There is nothing in it that you could not get elsewhere or from AMORC itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jean Genet lives on film.","review":"The imperfections of this film--slow pacing (by American standards), choppy transitions, complex and convoluted plot, unpredictable outcomes hidden from the viewer until the last moment then released with insufficient force--are truly irrelevent when the experience of the essence of Genet's novel and its leading character are so effectively brought to the screen in its form, color, casting and concept. Brad Davis is awesome in his portrayal of Querelle--enormous emotional and physical risk, awkward to watch at times because of its truth and openness. If you love Genet, as I do, there is no finer interpreter of his sensibilities than Fassbinder. I am not an expert on Fassbinder, but I love this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly bit of tripe","review":"Absolutely dreadful film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Arty and pretentious in every aspect--cardboard scenery, garish lighting, intrusive vocal score (sounding like medieval chant), stilted dialogue, bombastic narration, and worst of all, wooden performances by Brad Davis, Franco Nero and French film legend, Jeanne Moreau. It feels like a very bad experimental off-off-Broadway play.The plot is totally incomprehensible. Perhaps it would have made more sense if I hadn't fallen asleep several times during the movie. Usually if I doze off I back a film up to see what I missed, but not with this one. I just kept hoping it would end.I felt embarrassed for everyone involved in this ghastly mess, especially Moreau: \\"Querelle\\" certainly isn't one of the highlights of her distinguished career.Avoid this thing like the plague, unless you're an out-and-out masochist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and very strange","review":"This movie is based on a homoerotic novel and so might not be suitable for general audiences. But even the most open-minded viewer will find this movie very slow and very difficult to watch. The homosexual iconography and imagery is over the top and a bit off-putting. The film was shot on a sparse set and the violence in the movie has such stylised choreography that the combined effect is very artificial. This film is a bit self-indulgent on Fassbinder's part. If you are interested in exploring the work of Fassbinder start anywhere else but here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Nightmare!","review":"I have heard about this movie for decades so decided since I enjoyed Brad Davis, I would give it a try. Boy, was I surprised! Watching this movie is similar to viewing an accident...you keep watching to see what will happen next. Trust me, nothing better happens. It was truly a waste of time and money in purchasing this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovering the Ego","review":"Lust, money, drugs, desire, sex, incest, murdering and detective story-lines have been mixed so inextricably that it is too hard to follow just a singly line only as a handsome desired by both genders manly-man sailor-drug trafficker Querelle had discovered his very own sexual ego.It is really a romantic masterpiece in orange-and-black, the last movie and real summit of a Rainer Werner Fassbinder's life-cinematographic and biological."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising!","review":"The bright side of this movie is that it's surprisingly outrageous! It is not a very direct movie, you have to infer much of its meaning and it's very subject to personal interpretation in some parts.It is a very theatrical movie, and it depicts homosexualism in a very novel way -- no gayness, just homosexualism."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor DVD quality","review":"The film is great, but the DVD release doesn't do justice to it. Picture is ok, but not great. The sound is mono. Subtitles are only occasionally simultaneous with the action. This is really very annoying, at least if one wants to watch the film in its original French track, rather than the English dubbed version.The quality is thus that of an Asian bootleg, except that the DVD costs four times as much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it camp or is it serious....","review":"This was Fassbinder's final film, and I didn't like very much about it. I saw in a pan and scan VHS copy, and thought it was one of the silliest, most pretentious things I've ever seen. Seeing it in a widescreen DVD has altered my opinion only slightly. I do love the photography and the hilarious set design, which is overly phallic and rivals Ken Russell's films. It's hard to tell whether Fassbinder meant this as camp or as a serious film. The performances are really over the top, especially Hanno Poschl and Franco Nero's performances. There's a hilarious scene in which Poschl and Querelle (Brad Davis) are fighting, and they are interrupted by Jesus carrying the cross. The film is very homoerotic, more so than any other Fassbinder film, but it doesn't make it any better or more interesting. It's a shame this was his final film, but it doesn't diminish his legacy at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, this is not a good farewell for Fassbinder","review":"It's very sad that this film became his last. I too love Fassbinder's work and Brad Davis is great, but you can't say that by watching this piece. Please see this after you went through all other movies from this master otherwise you would get wrong impression about his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder it was his last film.","review":"I've been a fan of Fassbinder since my college days. I was hooked when I saw \\"The Marriage of Maria Braun\\", however Querelle was a big disappointment for me. I saw the VHS version some years ago, and wonder if this film wasn't the reason for Fassbinder's suicide (as it was his last film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic, sparse, and beautiful","review":"This is a gorgeous record and possibly the most neglected gem in the Gene Clark canon. Simple, rustic arrangements call to mind The Band's \\"brown album\\" or Neil Young's \\"Harvest\\": acoustic guitar, harmonica, bass, drums, a little melancholy piano and stirrings of hammond organ and slide guitar. This album's mood also reminds me of Bob Dylan's \\"Desire\\". Gene Clark's poetic lyricism is genuinely moving, and his bittersweet, autumnal emotion shines through beautifully. I would also recommned this album to fans of modern bands like Red House Painters, Mojave 3, or Mazzy Star. GREAT"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!

It said there was 5 interconnected enviorments that you could roam around in traversing from one to the other. That was the main reason I bought the game, and the closest thing to it was free run. Max 4 laps, and you couldn't go from one enviorment to the other like it said you could.-Bad crashes. Now after some major disapointments I could always look forward to bumping cars and causing traffic jams for a few brief minutes of fun. WRONG! All it does is bump, and nothing else.-Graphics.

The plot was absorbing and each character was developed very well. Alexander has a talent for story-telling. I love the way she wove the two time periods together. At first I wanted to skip ahead to read more about Sita as a young married woman, but then I decided against it. So it was very suspenseful. And the humanness of each character. They are still alive in me. And it was fun to recognize place names like The Red Rock Cafe in Mt.

It made you think about the easy lives most of us have and the choices we would make if put in an entirely different situation. While at times you feel Sita made the wrong choices you realize that all she wanted was to be loved and be the best she could be, but the odds were against her. We recently had a book club and asked the author to join us via Skype - it was terrific. She was so willing to share her perspective and also shared a pivotal question that helped her create the story.

I do know one thing, after reading this book, I won't go hiking/ walking alone on a deserted road or trail ever!

As a fan, I've followed his career for years, however, Night Sun is not one of his better performances. The film is standard period melodrama with too much costume and little content. Although Sands attempts to bring life to a dreary storyline, he's overwhelmed by the maudlin and predictable characterization. Nothing works in this film, and perhaps most obnoxious is the dubbing. We all know what a beautiful voice Sands possesses, and to hear him dubbed is plainly irritating. The film is easily bypassed for better performances by this talented actor, and better storylines in film worth the attention such as A Room With A View."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, basic book on Marital Counseling","review":"This book is geared towards short term pastoral counseling of couples with minor problems.

You might find yourself completely addicted! I have not stopped listening to this one for six months, and my changer usually has high turnaround.If it were necessary to pigeonhole the disc, the most likely fit is \\"alternative power ballad,\\" but expect more creative range and catchiness than that label would allow.

Stuff like \\"Monotone\\" and \\"Wallflower\\" show the that the band wants to rock while on the dreamy \\"London\\" and \\"Spaceboy\\" they show a more sensitive side.

It talks about a relationship going bad, and that is why I think most people would enjoy and relate to this song. There is also \\"Yeah, Whatever\\". This song is a dramatic switch, from the slow-moving \\"I think God can explain.\\" \\"Yeah Whatever\\" is very fast-paced and has hard-hitting lyrics that define the meaning of the song. I highly recommend this CD to anyone. If you have not heard these two songs I have talked about, then please download them and listen to them, and you will see what I mean.

The whole band comes together and plays music that makes one sit up and listen intently. The songs are just so listenable! The emotions are evident, but not overcharged, and that's why these songs are so wonderful. No silly expletives, no needless swearing, just some honest-to-goodness musicmaking.

The singer sounds like he wants to be passionate but just can't quite muster up the energy. The songwriting is straight out of the alternarock radio handbook.

I got to track 9, \\"I Apologize,\\" and just couldn't take it anymore.

The whole apparatus is held together with a flimsy 1mm thick nut threaded onto the female end of the RCA cord (if you blow up the picture you can see what I am describing). The nut will not stay connected to the RCA cord and the cord is not melded to the plastic marine drilled socket mount. When the wee lil nut falls off (which it will) the RCA cord falls out of the socket mount. Poor design, would not recommend.

One of these days, I'll buy another player just for the Warner issues, but until then, make sure your player will accept the formatting on these discs. As far as I can tell, Warner Bros.

Rob and Anne have come through again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quanitity, not quality","review":"This volume has tons of haunted places listed, but presents them each as a capsulized summary of others' research and writeups. They have an impressive listing of resources and give due credit to all, but they don't seem to add anything of their own to the descriptions. Most of the listings are one page or less, with there being some double spread pages that contain parts of four different entries. This guide is helpful purely as a directory (in the same way the yellow pages would be) but has no feel of personal investment or enjoyment. If you have access to this book, my recommendation would be to use the \\"Resources\\" section for each state to identify books and authors for more indepth and enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"Dick Dale seems to get better and better with age, and this album proves it! There is nothing that compares with the raw power and energy that seems to flow out of his guitar. A MUST for any fan of \\"Surf\\" type music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup 'o tea...","review":"As much as I respect Dick Dale and his unequaled place in surf-rock history, this album just didn't cut it for me. While his ability will still 'wow' you, I found too much of this album somewhat derivative, especially of things he himself had done earlier. Even worse, a couple of tracks I even found boring. Of course, not all the album is bad. Songs such as 'Nitrus' will make you sit up and take notice, but I found those moments lacking for the most part. Your time may be better spent searching out some of Dale's earlier, more inspired work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mormon Country","review":"As a non-Mormon, I have always been fascinated with a faith that has remained strong and isolated, even when it resides in the midst of much misunderstanding. Much of this secrecy seems to be intentional. In Mormon Country, Stegner breaks through a part of this secrecy and gives the outsider insight into who the Mormons are and how they live. There is not much about their faith, but much about their lives and society.Since the book is now over sixty years old, it reflects a time that has been lost. It tells stories that may well have been first or second hand accounts of the founding of the Mormon Country. The writing is crisp and moves easily. This is interesting reading for anyone interested in getting a basic understanding of wh the Mormons are and how they live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallace Stegner's early work","review":"A wonderful example of Wallace Stegner's writing in the early 40's. This is a precursor to his later work about the Mormon Trail...THE GATHERING OF SAINTS, I believe it's called. This is history written by a citizen of Utah who was not a Mormon. MORMON COUNTRY beautifully demonstrates his prose style, which is his lasting gift to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh boy","review":"In comparison to her other concerts, this one is the lowest most boring thing I ever seen done by Janet. I couldn't even watch the whole concet. Too boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet, your losing it but i want to be together again","review":"Janet, come on. Growing up with your genius brother Michael, you should have learned how to put on a concert. Remember you going backstage in his 1988 Bad Tour in Japan. You and your mom were right there. Remember how he moved an audience. I haven't seen that in your concerts. The audience is just standing there. In Michael's they are fainting, crying, jumping, moving, hands up, waving arms, and going crazy. He puts on an electrifying performance and he makes it look so natural. You on the other hand at this stage make is look so forced and so rehearsed.I know you are no where near the talents of Michael Jackson, but you sure put on a good concert for the Velvet Rope and also put on a good concert I attended during your Rythym Nation tour. Come on Janet, lets be together again.I have your concert taped, but I have all of Michael Jackson's concerts as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Exercise Video","review":"This could be a 5 star exercise video but as for music it is 2 stars. I was thinking that maybe Janet would be in the same league as Madonna, Britney, Cher, Kylie, Christina... and found this dvd to have good costumes, sets, etc but the music and singing was not at all in the same league as those mentioned. This one is not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I think this concert was pretty typical and boring. This show is pretty identical to her previous concerts. She barely sings live through the show. It's basically Janet lipsynching to her songs as she dances. Nothing very original here. Her dancing is remarkable, however she lacks in most other areas. She is no Queen of Pop or Dance. I would pass on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Concert Experience!!!","review":"Janet Jackson's All For You tour live from Hawaii DVD is a really interesting look at the tour as well as what goes on backstage. As always, you will be amazed by the stage show and how Janet can manage to perform all of those songs! Each song is it's own special show and Janet performs them with grace and ease.This is a really good concert for any fan of Janet, and would make an interesting viewing experience for someone who has never been to one of her live shows! Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lipsynchapaloza!","review":"Wow.... its not only Britney who doesnt know the words to her own songs enough to lipsynch the right lines or times, but at least Janet re-recorded her vocals to SEEM live. Its a pretty entertaining show. It at times gets boring (alright, whymsical medly) but has its high points. Its a very good performance. In my opinion the best out of the three HBO chicks who did a concert (madonna janet and britney)Janets amazing outfits and interesting choices for the set make this show worth the pricy-for-a-dvd cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this concert! I wouldn't have brought any of my nieces or nephews under the age of fifteen to it though; there were a couple of rough spots. Otherwise an excellent experience. I'll buy tickets for the next tour based on this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aloha, Baby!","review":"...or (Abs)olutely f(ab)ulous...!Who gives a shu-gah honey iced tea about routines culled from the previous concerts or whether or not JDJ lipsynced or if she is or ain't like her big brother? And reserve concerts to save the world by looking serious, feeling important and furrowing the brow to U2 or Springsteen and E Street: that wasn't the purpose of Janet Live in Hawaii. It's purpose is fun. This one has a lotta good and stunning visuals. It's nicely sequenced. Janet looks stupendous and she does all, and I mean all, of her hits. And Hawaii does her quite well. So, who can complain? \\"Black Cat\\" is still a show stopper and the addition of the \\"All For You\\" material, esp, \\"Son of a Gun\\" w/ an assist from Carly and Missy, makes this a must have for your live concert DVD collection. Enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawai + Janet = Hot!","review":"Being an owner of everything Janet, this of course was a must buy for me. And I can honestly say I was not dissapointed....UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR! This DVD has it all! Great concert and great extra's (which don't come with every concert DVD that's made).From beginning to end this concert is majorly entertaining. Favourite songs like 'Got till its gone', 'Rythm Nation', 'Love will never do', 'Nasty' etc are all there. Plus excellent new songs like 'Trust' (great costumes), 'All for U' and Son of a gun' (with a nice surprise performance by Missy E. and taped images of Carly Simon).With a new set of dancers and a band that clearly knows what its doing, this musical experience is a winner and one of the best concert DVD's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hats Off to Janet and the All For You DVD.","review":"I'm very happy to have seen her in concert and to now see her in Hawaii doing it again was great! The best feature of this DVD is the \\"Would You Mind\\" block. It's funny to see her expression from these guys who do everything to keep their composure or go wild while they're strapped in. The pictures are from the tour book, still the shots are awesome. I enjoyed this concert a lot. Everything from the songs, behind the scenes, Carly and Missy, even the breakdown in \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\" after she introduces everyone. As with another reviewer, I miss Tina Landon. Shaunette, Eddie, and Gil did good jobs, but Tina and her style of choreograpy wasn't there. I guess it's all about moving on and trying different things. Hey, there's nothing wrong with that.

This game is great. the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is flawless and the controlling is another great feature. This is definetly in my top 3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beat it in 4 hrs","review":"Sure the game is fun for the extremely short time it can provide new levels. I assumed there were 8 levels of 3 or 4 worlds each, but there are about 8 total worlds to beat and they are not that difficult. granted I played it on Normal setting (there are 3 difficulty setings, normal is the lowest) but that does not mean there are really 24 boards, it's still the same game. One should not be able to beat any game on any system in the same day one opens the package, no matter how hard you try. All DS games have this problem to a greater or lesser degree I find, but this is ridiculous. At least I only paid something like 8 bucks for it in the first place; Now I know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"Good, but not great shooter. Still worth picking up though.... plus there is the sequel. Worth collecting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a quick adrenaline rush!","review":"This is the kind of game that you play if games like the original Starfox for the SNES appeal to you. Don't expect incredible depth, but rather, gaze at the awesome graphics and music while blasting a bunch of ammo at waves and waves of oncoming enemies. I love it. The only drawback is that the game is waay too short for the money- I would say a good three hours is enough to beat this game from the moment you pick it up if you are a seasoned gamer. With that said, I can never get sick of replaying this game because the graphics and superficial flashiness are kind of addictive to me. If you are expecting a hardcore shoot-em-up on the level of Ikaruga, you will definitely be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable And From The Heart","review":"Into Your Heart is one of the best CD's I've heard in some time. There are no bad tracks, which makes this CD highly enjoyable each time you listen to it. Mick Hucknall of Simply Red once penned that he was 'one of those grains of sand that gets blown all around the world'and that sentiment truly describes the life of all musicians. Tom Schuman has brought his memories of special places and people to Into Your Heart. The CD is masterfully crafted and is garnering rave reviews from all who hear it.

While I don't think it is necessary to read the books in this series in order, it add to the pleasure of reading others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice introduction to an interesting series","review":"Desert Heat in a nice introduction to the Joanna Brady series of books. Joanna Brady is a happily married mother of one, when her husband Andy, a local police officer, is shot on his way home. Determined to find out who killed Andy, and why his reputation is being destroyed by innuendo and gossip, Joanna sets out to solve the mystery of his death on her own.The pace of the book is fairly fast, and there are an assortment of interesting characters throughout the story. Joanna Brady is also smart, and tough, but with a touch of vulnerability. The setting of the Arizona desert is almost a character in the book, with nice descriptions. The ending leaves you wanting to follow up on the further adventures of Joanna Brady and company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother in-law introduced me to Joanna Brady","review":"As a huge fan of the Alex Cross series by James Patterson which I introduced my mother in-law to, she introduced me to JA Jance's Joanna Brady series. Thanks Mom! I loved it. As soon as I finished this one it was on to the next and the next! It's great to have a strong female character that isn't trashy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much exposition, not enough plot","review":"This was my first Judith Jance book, and it wasn't a promising beginning. In her efforts to set the stage for a whole new series, Jance forgot to tell a decent story. The characters, good and bad, were 2-dimensional, and the plot rested on the shaky foundation of the protagonist's stupidity. Maybe later books in the series are better, but skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!!!!!!!!","review":"J.A. Jance is a great mystery writer.

I couldn't put them down while we were at the beach, or relaxing in the evenings. I devoured three in three days. This is a great start to a fun series, and yes, Jance does character development very well - as other reviewers have stated."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suspense or mystery in this book","review":"I gave this series a try based on the author's other series. I was not only disappointed but couldn't find the suspense or mystery in this book. Too much filler that dilutes the story. Making the reader go to the end of the book and read the last chapter. The characters are not well developed,nor do they keep your interest. I would try the second book in the series only to see if there's improvement in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.A. Jance series is good.","review":"I am a new JA Jance fan, and am thoroughly enjoying the Joanna Brady series. I highly recommend the series for those interested in reading about strong women, dealing with family and career. They are also good \\"who done it\\" mysteries. She spends a good amount of time on character development, and is thorough in her detail. My only comment would be that she rushes through the ending a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Mystery in the Joanna Brady Series","review":"I LOVE Joanna Brady! However, this introduction to her and her life in Bisbee is NOT the best book Jance has ever written. One thing that is terrific about Jance, though, is that she is from Bisbee and describes the town in exact detail. Bisbee is a quaint crazy town and Jance grabs all of the details of that small town oasis in the desert. Joanna Brady is a likeable character and the series gets beter and better as time goes by. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I found this book to be very good. It kept my attention the entire time.

Most of the rest of the material on this greatest hits is poor by today's standards and weak for the standards of the day they were produced (and I lived through them).

I have been tracking down and reading her out of print books ever since I read her first book! You can usually find her out of print books in used book stores or Amazon.com's auction resources, etc. \\"Half-breed's Bride\\" grabs you in the first chapter and never lets you go! It is more intense than most of Georgina Gentry's books (but, not quite as much historical background as usual). Everyone has secrets in this book! The reader finds out the secrets little by little. All of the characters in this story are extremely strong and unforgettable. The story is exciting and very lustful as it takes you through a journey of human character (black, white, and grey)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"Great movie about an event in WWII history.

I basically bought it by chance (something that I almost never do) because I've read so many good reviews about the album. And needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. The album is tight.

And although this group resembles the ladies who were not \\"too proud to beg\\" over a decade ago and the fact that they are the discovery of the late Left Eye, the ladies of Blaque have their own thing going and it's evident with their self-titled debut. They shine on their brand of R&B which is dashed with an alternative flavor. Highlights on the set include, \\"Roll With Me\\", \\"I Do\\", \\"Leny\\", \\"Time After Time\\"(a splendid remake), \\"Bring It All To Me\\", and \\"Right Here Next To Me\\", just to name a few.

I could go on and on about their musical abilities, wonderful songs etc, but better yet allow me to assure you if you like the bands I mentioned above, you'll love Jubilee by Dotsero.

My opinion of the DVD itself is what you're interested in, though.OK, apart from the Tony Curtis intro, this could have been a decent disc. The quality is about what you'd expect from a movie made ten years earlier, but that may be what we'll have to live with until Robert A. Harris decides to restore it.Unfortunately, the logo that Laserlight chose to put in the lower right corner, much like television stations can't resist doing these days, really ruins it. Not only does one not expect to have to put up with distractions like this on a disc that one pays for, but it shows up EVERY TEN MINUTES during the movie. It just shows how little class Laserlight has. You may as well tape it when it shows up on AMC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor technical production","review":"This version (LaserLight) is awful.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend this copy. I have also tried other DVD titles from this distributer and was surprised at the excellent quality.....check them out...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating is for the movie, quality is another story","review":"Excellent movie, brilliant satire. As others have said, the logo in the lower right corner is very annoying. I got a copy from another manufacturer at the Dollar Store near me (for a dollar of course). Its quality was as bad as the rest of the releases but at least there was no logo. Sad that this one is in the public domain and so no one bothers to restore it properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"-- Improving quality of my video archives --","review":"This DVD was purchased to replace an old VHS tape that suffered from interference from variable-tracking and distortion faults. This fault is tolerable with Bogart classics only so long as there is no other media option available.This quaint Bogart classic features some other super-stars in rather comic roles and plays delightfully.-- and it is about (dammed) time !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Our family settled down to watch this over the Christmas holidays with great anticipation. After all, wouldn't a movie with Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Robert Morely, Jennifer Jones, and Gina Lollabrigida be a stunner? Not! We literally couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of it, and even then people started talking and shuffling around while it was playing. The script was absolutely awful and the actors read their lines with a stiltedness that was exremely puzzling. I mean, these are all great actors! How come suddenly they can't act? See it yourself and go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boggie Musta Needed Da Moola","review":"I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid on TV..... wish that had been the last time I saw it. Bogart must have really needed the money to ( and I use the term loosely ) star in this debacle. Still, if you're sitting around with a bunch of drunk friends, it might be good for an unintentional laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the Platinum Disc Corporation version","review":"Buy the Platinum Disc Corporation version. The transfer is excellent and I have no complaints. It's not Criterion, but you will not be disappointed. Beautiful black and white.I enjoyed this disc the first time I watched it a few years ago. On second viewing a few weeks ago, I appreciated it even more. Maybe it was because I had not viewed it for so long and had forgotten what it was about. All the actors perform their characters well and the pace is steady. This is now one of my favorite Bogart films. Jennifer Jones and Gina Lollobrigida are hot dolls and I like their characters. Just my two cents worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor DVD Work","review":"It's really sad but until a reputable firm like Criterion makes a decision to restore the film it's useless to search for a good DVD. You can only avoid the really poor work and hope that one day somebody will find it worthwhile to do so. In that case they simply wouldn't be able to stamp enough DVDs to keep up with the demand. Chatter on the internet claims that honor belongs to the Platinum Disc Corp. or it may be known now as Echo Bridge. For myself that honor belongs with the Tony Curtis DVD of the film. Most firms allow you to exclude an introduction but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogart Beats the Devil.","review":"Viewed: 3/10Rate: 83/10: Beat the Devil is a subtly written film that doesn't make anything too obvious. So, I sit back and relax while enjoying the acting of the entire cast. Humphrey Bogart, as usual, makes this one special and especially so in the end. Beat the Devil does feel like a cross between Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon and yet there isn't a moment of clarity in terms of where exactly is the story going to. That can be annoying to some, but I really think everything about it was well-paced and interesting. All in all, Beat the Devil is about subtlety, and that's what worked for me the best. Kudos as usual to John Huston (one of the best film noir directors ever) for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Don't even bother purchasing this album. If you want to hear this band at their best, look around in record shops for their earlier work(early 80's) These albums were put out by Star records, and Other People's Music. I think that Star records has begun to re-release their earlier stuff,eg. In love with the system lp, Surfin on Heroin,and Pride and Disgrace lp.

It fits perfectly. We love the ability to be dimmed by Insteon equipment. We love the ease with which the unit will line up with similar units for long installations.However, ours generated so much heat (with the supplied 35 watt bulbs) that the plastic central pivot which holds the diffusers in place simply melted and sagged at least an inch below the rest of the fixture. It took only four months to accomplish that, but 3 months after the return rights had expired.We now use the device with no diffusers and it is certainly functional. Can't say I wouldn't buy it again. We already have 6 of these units under other cabinets, but beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cost of Maintenance","review":"The light is well made and easy to hang.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An irresistable invitation to re-evaluate punk's origins.","review":"Originally issued as \\"SPunk\\", a legitimate release that claimed to be a bootleg, \\"The Mini Album\\" is alternative versions of Pistols classics. While the performances may be perferable to some, the sheen of \\"Never Mind The Bullocks\\" is left off. This leaves the Sex Pistols exposed as they really were: an incredible, experimental rock band. Progrockers like Yes tend to be credited with widening Rock's boundries; the Pistols ignored the limits entirely. It sounds as though it never even occured to them that they would be changing rock and roll forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The premise was interesting,promising a mix of police detective/SiFi, one of my favorites. Unfortunately, the book's positive points ended with the premise. This one failed to hold my interest. I had trouble connecting and sympathizing with the heroine. The author also devoted a time consuming and rather boring amount of space attempting to prove a history of \\"aliens among us\\", using the heroine doing research as a vehicle. By the time the book ended, I found myself sitting thinking,\\"OK. What was the point?\\" I won't be buying any further books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor execution","review":"This book has an interesting premise, sort of an \\"X-Files\\" theme, however, just about every other page has some social comment about men. This book is dedicated to Patricia, and while the author remains anonymous, I am pretty sure it is a woman with some really serious problems with the males of our species. I don't have a problem with the author's chosen lifestyle (to each his/her own,) but I do have a problem with the CONSTANT male-bashing throughout the book. The main character, who is female, apparently feels every man in her past and present is some base creature trying to take advantage of her. I can't tell you how many times I stopped reading because I was sick of being assaulted by the author's personal problems. Here's a hint A. A. McFedries - talk out your issues with Patricia, and leave the writing to the well-adjusted members of our society. Oh, and by the way, purchase a Thesaurus. There are other words for \\"fear.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible dialog","review":"My gosh, the writing is just terrible. I was fortunate to have pick this book up at my local library. I didn't waste my money. The plot sounded interesting but I was a little worried by the fact that there was no bio of the author at all. Which makes sense now.The dialog is just bad and repetitive. It was painfull at times. You could skip pages of dialog and not truly miss much of the plot. After 200 pages out of 336, nothing really happens to futher the plot. Much of what happens in the first 200 pages could have been told in about 75 pages by a better writer.I honestly don't know how this book got published. Could I write better then is? Heck no, but then I know my limitations.It was a chore to read this book. It wasn't fun or enjoyable. I had to force my self to plow through it.I got a headache reading this book for rolling my eyes every other paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unbelievable","review":"This was a very thinly outlined, unbelievable story concerning a female detective investigating a murder in the desert. I don't mind a little bit of a stretch to the plot but the way the characters calmly accept the most ridiculous clues and situations removed any suspense or interest for me. Small spoiler... when a little dwarf starts hanging around I was ready to pack it in.

The exam questions were not at all like the flash cards. And the cd-rom that came with the flash cards could only be installed on a palm top, which I do not own. There were also alot of incorrect answers on the flash cards as well (I had my instructor look them over). If you took a class in preparation for the a+ exam, just study your notes. I would not recommend the flash cards to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent with a few errors","review":"This is worth the money but make sure this is in addition to a comprehensive study guide like Michael Meyer's A+ Certification Exam Guide. I noticed a few errors which is why I gave it 4 stars but I think it is much more of a value than the Exam Cram flash cards. I really liked the included CD. There are a 50 minutes of questions each followed by the correct answer a few seconds later. My trip back and forth to work is now actually productive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but have other sources handy","review":"If you are a complete novice, and take the time to thoroughly understand the contents of this book, then you will very likely pass the A+ exams. However, you will not necessarily ace the tests. I found the book useful, but I already had a good foundation to work with. My main problems with the book are topics that are not discussed (but the author asks you questions anyway), and there are a couple of incorrect answers in the book and on the CD .. both of these scenarios create confusion. Just be aware that anyone should utilize sample tests and other reference materials to get a more thorough understanding of the topics for the A+ exams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits like a glove","review":"Got this for my 2008 dodge ram 1500 and it fits perfect with my stereo, and looks actually better then I thought.

A number of single din installation kits that I looked at indicated that I wouldn't be able to open the drop-down face of the unit and they had unattractive plastic panels to fill the space left by the factory stereo. This unit has everything that I was looking for. The drop-down face works perfectly and Metra used the extra space to make a small storage area.

The author seems unqualified to write plausible science fiction. The plot turns on a lot of mystical mush that made no sense to me. It's the usual problem that if anything can happen, the reader doesn't care what does happen. Also, the characters are all unpleasant and interact only through bickering, so I cared even less about their arbitrary adventures.Did I mention that it was horrible?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasteland of Flint, by Thomas Harlan, a very interesting tale set in the future that has a Aztec/Japenese power bloc.","review":"I think that Thomas Harlan's series that begins with Wasteland of Flint is a very good series, (Two Books so Far), with the premise that the Aztecs and Japanese conquered the planet and expanded into space. One of the main characters, Gretchen Anderson, is a xenoarcheologist, working for a private company. Unfortunately for Anderson, she is neither Mexican (Aztec) or Japanese and unfortunately this makes her part of the oppressed majority.The two books in this series are very good and well worth reading. I have tried Harlan's ancient history tales set in Roman times, and I do not find them as interesting to me.Mark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for insomnia","review":"Thank God I bought this book at a local used book store for only $0.50. I would hate to think I bought it new for $7.99. I am a fan of most alternate history, which is the main reason I purchased the novel. But you could take what little alternate history there is out of this book and still have your novel. The book dragged on and I have to admit that I know of no good reason why I completed reading it. Fortunately the book will not be wasted. I often donate books to the local library's Books for Soldiers program and this book will go to Iraq where one our our soldiers will use it to relax as there is nothing exciting in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Space Opera","review":"I have to give the author credit for trying. This is a combination future history and Fred Saberhagen type ancient malignant forces in the universe story interlarded with Star Wars type mysticism. The future history, a time line is which a combined Japanese-Aztec society conquered the Earth and now runs an interstellar empire, is probably the most interesting component. It is presented obliquely as the background to the main action of the story and the reader has to exercise a bit of thought to infer the history of this society. The main story, the efforts of the characters to avoid awaking terrible cosmic forces from a prior age of the galaxy, is a descendent of Saberhagen's Berserkers and is a fairly routine action story. The elements of mysticism are simply silly and actually detract from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it while it worked...","review":"I bought this mixer mostly for mixing bread doughs. My first model stripped its gears shortly after I received it, and Kitchen-Aid was quick to send a replacement. Now over a year later the same happened to my replacement model. Both times it happened while mixing bread dough on speed 2, which is the only speed allowed by the model for bread dough. I've used Kitchen-Aid models in commercial kitchens, so I thought the Kitchen-Aid Professional Series was what I wanted. Apparently I was wrong about the integrity of this company's products.

The new one failed within days and was replaced by the factory after way too many calls; the replacement failed after a couple years of average use and being essentially unable to complete any bread dough recipe as advertised. It's useless and disappointing, and sadly we have a lot of useless accessories with it too. We have heard no response from Kithenaid and will after years of loyalty and hundreds of dollars buy something else from perhaps Viking.

This volume is especially disappointing, since the gems here (All Of Your Toys, Nine Times Blue, and Carlisle Wheeling) can be heard as bonus tracks on other CDs. That leaves a lot of room for songs that sound like Davy is just making it up as he goes along (So Goes Love, Storybook Of You, and such).

Second, the chiller is great for bring bottles of white wine to friends' homes that you want to share immediately. Many people start with whites and if you are bringing a room-temperature white, it's annoying having to wait for it to chill in the freezer. Those 15-30 minutes may see your bottle passed over and forgotten.

But if you want to hear \\"real\\" jazz...then look elsewhere. If you are looking for a Monk tribute disc (because you own everything in the Monk catalogue and STILL can't get enough), I would suggest either Steve Lacy (he has released many recordings covering Monk) or the 3 disc set with Alexander von SchlippenbachMonk's Casino: The Complete Works of Thelonious Monk.This disc is like a \\"Kenny G plays Monk\\" tribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"More blowing than most of Skayne's latest releases.","review":"This release will satisfy conservative jazz fans and newcomers to Monk's challenging, quirky composititions.

The book does have many beautiful and stunning pictures of great muscle cars. Most of the pricing, production figures and engine configurations are very interesting. The only problem with the book was that it was never proofed for errors after printing. Many of the picture inset desriptions are referencing the wrong picture and sometimes even on the wrong page. Some of the descriptions are in error as to the year of the vehicle (eg. a 1967 Chevelle description of a 1968 Chevelle). One of the pictures is even inversed making the Satellite look like a right-hand drive car with funny license plates. It is a shame that such a fine book was never proofed checks for such obvious errors, but, still a fine book for muscle car lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pics, few information","review":"A good book to see the most important muscle cars, and just that.

The wiring color-codes are nonsense! You MUST re-wire the speaker- and power-leads or you're asking for trouble. The brass inserts, on the sides, break loose as you tighten the cheezy Knob-Screws. Only a tiny dab of some brittle cement was applied at the factory. The M6 threads in these brass inserts were not tapped properly, so the Knob-Screw shafts bind/sieze almost immediately. These are \\"blind\\" holes that will require re-tapping and, preferably, use of a bottoming-tap before becoming useful.OVERALL: It's a great concept and a handsome design.

Incredibly sad. Olive Films should not have accepted this HD master from Paramount, and if it really represents the best that could be found in the vaults (which I doubt), then a DVD release only had been a better decision.

Hollywood, 'cause he's tall blonde and lethal, in Lover Eternal just happens to be my favourite but all the books in this series are fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough depth","review":"As someone who has already read Sherilyn Kenyon, Lynsay Sands and Christine Feehan books about vampires I find this version not very well written. Each of the authors above created a world that was highly complex but explained it fully to the point that you enjoyed each turn and twist from real life. J. R. Wards style has too many types of species and events that are not explained, characters that are so negative and not fully developed which make it very hard to stay focused and enjoy the experience of this series. I have read 5 books out of this series and still don't feel like I know enough about this world to really look forward to another book, like I do for the authors listed above. Also it seems that the drama of each character is drawn out to the point where I just want to know the end rather than how the story plays out.Mfiona"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Vampire romance!","review":"I have read many so called vampire romances and this author is the best. The story is original, the sex scenes are satisfying, the plot is rich, and the reader is left fulfilled with the ending. I just hate that there is so much time to wait for the next book. This is one author that I REALLY look forward to the next book. I HIGHLY recommend this author. Thank you J.D Ward and keep on writing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"U feel all emotions with this one!","review":"I fell in LOVE with the 1st book and could not wait for this one...especially since I liked Hollywood from the get go. I cried with this one, got a little pissed and laughed. This was an awesome read. Not as good as the first to me but not far off. The only thing I didn't like was how fast they changed a player in one book. I think some of the things said in this one could have been said in the 1st one to lead you more to this...like with Zsadist (sp). Outside of that, awesone read."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I love the wole series of these books. You wont be sorry if you read any one of the Black Dagger books. The story is in depth and the characters are rich and well fleshed out. I love the way she builds the stories of the supporting chacters as well as the main. Run to this book, do your self a favor and order the whole series, cuz once you read one you will be jonseing like a fiend to read the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Kind of Boring","review":"I had a hard time finishing this book. I am dissapointed b/c I love the 1st book in the series. The hero is angry and a little to weak (emotionally) for my taste. The heroine is the worst. She is too emotional and sappy. Granted she did have cancer, but her character really had no back bone. Just not a good read overall. Yes, the sex scene was good, but other than that, nothing. I mean how can you get into the sex scenes when the heroine is skinny and all weak from the cancer????"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MY KINDA BOOK AT ALL","review":"I read the review of D.Silva and agreed with everything she wrote. This could,ve been a good book but when the hero sleeps with someone else that's the point where I hated it. IF I wanted real life I can watch a documentary. I wish I had seen my review before I bought the book, cause then I wouldn't have wasted my money.When I read the first book by J R Ward, I thought this is okay the kind of book I like, but I don't think I'll buy anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheating hero and weak doormat herione","review":"Don't want to waste your time with long details why this book is not worth your money.Cheating hero + weak doormat heroine = spineless heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would buy again","review":"Good quality product. Love the series, hope to see more of this type of fiction. Would buy again from vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double your pleasure!","review":"Vampires have long been symbols of power and sexuality, and the author of this series definitely takes this theme seriously! This is an interesting take on vampires and those who hunt them. The characters are interesting, compelling, and surprisingly believable. Themes of family, brotherly love, romantic love, honor, and loyalty really suck you in. The pop culture references (slang and music references) date the book, but it's still plenty entertaining. The sex scenes are really great! A lot of women (including myself) love a seriously physical, sexually aggressive guy.... and these male vampire characters are just that. Very hot. Love the whole series! I ordered and read them all within a two week period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"It was pretty entertaining...but I hate the story on the lessers! Have a feeling all the books are gonna be the same!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I cried.","review":"I cried a few times while reading this, because the characters were written well enough for me to have sympathy for them. I wasn't a fan of the end so much, but it wasn't horrible or completely divergent from the main story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Rhage is such a sexy character to read about but Mary is so boring I can't bring myself to finish the book. I personally don't want to read about a boring unattractive female who's dying of cancer. Vampire romance or trashy novels are supposed to be about sex appeal and imagination lol a fantasy. I don't want to be depressed and bored while reading this kind of book. I want to read about a more exciting attractive female so I can live vicariously through them while reading the book and imagine I'm that hot gorgeous female. I had cancer been there done that. If I'm going to indulge in a trashy novel I sure don't want to think about cancer. Rhages character deserved way better than a boring plain Jane."},{"rating":"2","title":"beats twilight hands down","review":"Yummy to say the least. Rhage and Marys story will make your heart ache, your pulse race, and eyes fill with tears. Hollywood has been tamed, and it didnt take a supermodel to do it. Dont be surprised to find yourself unable to put it down, it will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no words!!","review":"I love the Black Dagger Brotherhood series!!! My ONLY complaint is that I will now have to wait until September for the next one!! Can't wait for Zadist and Bella's story, now! This series is absolutely awesome!!!!!!
