Little is known about Beverly Kenney today except that she ended her own life, depressed at her career's failure after the advent of Rock. Unfortunately this makes her recorded output for Roost and Decca all the more precious. Kenney had a light, wispy voice not unlike Joni James, with the timing,phrasing, swing and individuality that makes all great jazz artists. One listen and she is instantly recognizable. Beverly Kenney's impressive work needs rediscovering, and this is a jewel of mid-1950's jazz singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible singing","review":"No matter how many times I listen to this LP, I just can't warm up to her singing. She sounds like a typical 1950s pop singer. Her singing is marked with the irritating mannerism of bending notes without any consideration to the lyrics, harmonic structure or rhythm of the music. I suppose Beverly equates this to jazz improvisation. Beverly's supposed \\"jazz singing\\" is analogous to letting a 5 year old child drive in a busy freeway...the result a WRECK!!!

You hear it as we watch home movies of Hanks' character as a child, just before the end credits roll. The combination of images and music is quite stirring, for me at least.

It went off constantly in the sensitive postion even if a car drove by on the street 30 yards away. If we moved the dial down far enough so it wasn't going off for no reason, the bark wasn't always enough to set it off at that point. We tried it daily for over a week, then sent it back.

The best thing I can say for it is that it does not eat D size batteries by the case. The first set has been in it for 4 weeks. Made in China, and it has the Chinese quality sticker on it.Does it work to quiet a dog?

The constant barking has stopped! The dog will still bark once in a while but it is at a much reduced volume and only one or two barks (smart dog).For this to work you will need to mount it with a clear line of sight at the offending dog. The dog will need to have good hearing, some older dogs, like people are a little deaf.

I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 just because \\"I don't like it\\" sounds better than \\"I hate it\\". There's just really no answer to a neighbor's barking dogs if the neighbor just doesn't care.

For the first time in my life I read about the differences in lies- when you should and when you shouldn't lie. Students need to also learn how to admit their mistakes, instead of digging themselves deeper in a hole by continuing to cover it up.

And the end that Nicholson chooses to give his book is both sappy and clichéd, although it might please those readers who need a happy ending, no matter how improbable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book!","review":"This is a lovely book about a young girl who moves to Canada from Germany, is put into a special school for kids like her with vision problems, and for the first time in her life she feels that she is worth something.

I really didn't expect it to be this good. It can easily pass as an R&B album. Some songs express their feelings towards guys such as \\"Sixteen Again\\", and \\"All of My Life\\" which is fine because it sends a message to wait on God to send that special someone. But overall these songs were really nice. They redid Musiq's \\"Love\\" and changed the words which was fine. I also liked the way they redid \\"People Get Ready\\" but I forgot who was the original artist. \\"Rescue Me\\" and \\"All of My Life\\" were beautiful. I loved the lyrics and it was very enjoyable. \\"Holla\\" and \\"Dance Like Sunday\\" are off the hook and are songs you can dance to. Other songs I liked were \\"Sixteen Again\\", \\"Here 4 U\\" and \\"Greater Than You and Me\\", very good songs. If you like contemporary gospel I recommend that you get this. It sounds just like R&B and it's worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible third attempt!!!","review":"This was a horrible album by Trinitee! Their first two albums were true contempo gospel albums.However, they were getting too \\"worldly\\" with this one (meaning, they were too secular). They even stooped so low to sing a song to their husbands, about teenage love and that nonsense.It's foolishness! If you're looking for good contempo gospel, I recommend Mary Mary, Donnie McClurklin or Kirk Franklin. Trinitee usually fails to mention the saving name of Christ, instead singing about \\"Him\\" and \\"He\\".Horrible cd. I should throw it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is the \\"one for me\\"","review":"I have to first off say i agree with many others that the production is much better than the previous 2 and a huge jump from their first CD. i cant believe its the same group! i also enjoy how Adrian has contributed more on this disc, and it seems the girls had more involvement this time! Now on to the tracks, I have to say my favorite right now is a tie between \\"Dance Like its Sunday\\" and \\"People get ready\\". other favorites are of course \\"Lord\\" both versions of \\"Holla\\" and \\"All of my life\\". this cd is very balanced and i dont find any weak spots, these girls truly sing their hearts out for our Lord and if u enjoy Mary Marys new one, you gotta pick this one up too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slammin!","review":"I'm from jersey and I can say that this cd has got to be one of the best cds in my binder.

While there are many good songs on there, BY FAR the most wonderful one on there is \\"Lord\\". I'm not into secular music so when I found out it was a gospel remix of a secular tune, at first i didn't like it that much any more. but then it began playing again and i just couldn't help it. it's one of those songs you can't make yourself not like no matter how you try, in my opinion. Very beautiful and the CD is worth getting for other songs too (\\"Holla\\" urban remix, \\"Dancelike Sunday\\", \\"The Kiss\\"), but especially for \\"Lord\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great when you can't get to the studio!","review":"This is a nice 75 min class led by Debbie Williamson, a certified Baptiste Power Vinyasa yoga instructor.

Frankie Dunlap replies in his solo to what the others had done, and the soloists (Jones, Woods, and, ahem, oh well, Rouse) seemd to be on the same frequency. This tune really rocks.I don't know why this album isn't looked upon with such favor by many people. It is great.

As for the problems with Salvage Association or Lloyd's agency , which the cover of the book says he will reveal, what he says is laughable and does not bear any other comment.Reading this book will not give anyone any insight into marine insurance or its problems and certainly not commercial marine surveying, except, perhaps if they own a rather small yacht in the West Indies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"'Gotcha' provides an intriguing depiction of maritime fraud in Latin America and the Caribbean, an area the author knows intimately well.

If you have the slightest interest in this era of advertising, buy this book now, before it slips away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine example of Piedmont blues","review":"Woody Mann is an adventurous acoustic guitarist whose playing is based in blues, but who draws equally from jazz and several other styles. Orville Johnson specializes in dobro, but unlike most dobro players, he does not stick to bluegrass. He plays pretty much every style there is. However, on this album, both Mann and Johnson keep their adventurous instincts mostly in check to focus on straight Piedmont blues. More than anything else, then, this is a John Cephas record. Of course, Mann and Johnson contribute their usual outstanding guitar work, but they do so in service to the style for which Cephas became famous. The mood is relatively upbeat, and all players involved were clearly having fun. This is a fine album, but don't expect the usual level of exploration that you would get from either a Woody Mann album or an Orville Johnson album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Author","review":"This author ranks up there with the best in the genre. Smart writing, but light and fun with emotional resonance. As soon as I finished reading SEPTEMBER MOON, I went back to the bookstore and bought her earlier titles, NIGHT IN EDEN and THE BEQUEST. They were much darker, but definite keepers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flat, predictable plot; main characters lack chemistry","review":"This book begins with a colorful setting and a promise of much more than it ever delivers. Amanda and O'Reilly never seem to develop into persons that the reader can care about, nor does the chemistry between them appear genuine. The storyline was so boring and pedictable, even for a historical romance novel. I suggest Barbara Bickmore's \\"The Back of Beyond\\" for a real taste of Australian history and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book!!!","review":"I came across this book by chance, and am so grateful to have found this writer!

The bulb is the vision-saver not the true-color. Apparently Ott-Lite makes two series of bulbs. For working and reading, it's very easy on the eyes. I do have to supplement with a halogen torch lamp to illuminate the room.

Although it doesn't really bother me but at time I like complete silence you'll hear the little buzz. So if you like complete salience in your room and work area then this light is not for you. If you have music on and noise in background then this light is for you because the background noise will drown out the buzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful while it lasted","review":"This was my second Ottlight. The first lasted more than two years and the second less than one year. I like this light very much but the useful life is too short to justify the purchase of a third. I want to suggest to the company's engineers that they have a problem with thier ballast. Also, the light seems to be unrepairable. I'm going to try a lower price Ott light.

The choice of songs on this was a bit redundant, as many are available in Live After Death, a live album compliled when Bruce Dickinson's voice was still in it's prime (it's not bad now, but let's face it, it was better back in 1985). It would have been better if the producers had chosen more of their newer song, rather than compile extra live repeats of songs that were better sung 20 years before."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Scream for me !\\"","review":"Just what everyone needs - more live versions of \\"Number of the Beast\\", \\"Iron Maiden\\", and \\"Run to the Hills\\"...

This album... no so great. the mixing is absolutely horrible. the vocals are way too loud, compared to the rest of the band. Also, you can REALLY tell that they jack up the volume of the crowd at various points. normally, i like this. it sounds awesome to hear the crowd chanting along with Fear of the Dark, or Trooper, etc. But it sounds horrible on this CD.My advice, DONT buy it. I wish I hadn't. If you want an old-skool Maiden live album, go with Live After Death. If you want a more recent Maiden live album, go with Rock in Rio. Hell, I have BOOTLEGS of this show that sound much better than the mixing job done here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On","review":"This live album is well recorded, and the band is the best its ever been. Why only 2 stars? The tracklist! Apart from Can I Play With Madnes (yay!) and Lord of the Flies (yawn), its exactly the same as Rock in Rio, released a couple of years ago, with Dance of Death instead of Brave New World songs.Why not play Somewhere In Time, or Wasted Years? Or Futureal (ok Blaze song but still)? or Powerslave? All would have fitted into the theme of the concert well. I don't need to see another version of Hallowed Be Thy Name. Or Wrathchild. Or Fear of the Dark. Or Run to the Hills. Good performance (as expected), but VERY disappointing tracklist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sounding......","review":"I am a BIG Iron Maiden fan, like that's all I talk about, but when I heard this album, I was apalled. It frightened me. Bruce may be getting old, but it's just too much of a difference from Rock In Rio. I can't believe anyone would give this a 4-star. Maybe it could pull a 3, but I want 2. It just sounds terrible, you can barely hear the guitars over the screaming crowds! That's just crap! It's basically like, I died when I heard this, and then when I find out it's copy protected!? Ok Iron Maiden, you guys have gone far enough with that. This is just terrible, sure I'd give the artwork a 5-star, it's way better than the Dance of Death artwork, um EWWWW!But there you have it, a true Iron Maiden fans honest opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST LIVE ALBUMS!","review":"I have been an Iron Maiden fan since 1983.This is a wonderful album, Better then Live after death (Not, the cover art, but the music)Like a fine Wine, These guys play better with age. Save your money on the US Album, You get the same Kick for half the price with the UK Import.Long live the Iron Maiden!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be...","review":"Lycia enjoys a small but devoted following. They employ a style of acoustic guitar and mellow keyboards layered harmonically with the beautiful vocals of Mike and Tara VanPortfleet. The effect is to produce haunting, pensive images and stories reminiscent of Dead Can Dance, or some of Pink Floyd's early acoustic work. However, what I couldn't get past was the total lack of percussion in their work. This is quiet, brooding music, but it barely seems to move at times. The advice I would give a 1st time shopper for their titles? Listen carefully before you buy. Lycia is a ghost ship that never leaves the port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Romance Story","review":"Anything for Her Marriage seems like a promising story. The theme and plot appear to be interesting but the story rambles. The author has adopted a tone of voice that I disliked. She uses the word \\"oy\\" a lot.The leading man, Rod Braden, has too much emotional baggage including two kids, an ex-wife, and a time consuming business. The leading lady, Nancy Shapiro, has too many cats and not enough going on in her life.I usually love stories like this one but Anything for Her Marriage was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"This DVD is basically a Power Point presentation in which the creator speaks about Pythagoras.

Actually, the song tempos are mostly up-beat. Oleo seems to cook along. This CD is better than \\"Workin'\\", and about equal to \\"Steamin'\\". I don't have \\"Cookin'\\" yet. I have two live Miles Davis versions of \\"If I Were A Bell\\", and this version is better than either one (though not a live album, these songs were mostly done in one take). \\"You're My Everything\\" might the most relaxing song on the set. There are toe-tapping versions of \\"I Could Write A Book\\" and \\"Oleo\\". \\"It Could Happen To You\\" is another easier-swinging song, then the CD ends with Dizzy's \\"Woody'N You\\". Miles' trumpet is in fine form, and Coltrane is good, though his best work was yet to come. Anyone who likes mid-50's jazz should get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sultan of Cool","review":"A fine cd by Miles Davis. This is one of a series of 4 albums that Miles Davis and his quintet recorded for prestige records. Here with a great lineup that included,John Coltrane on Tenor Saxaphone,Red Garland on piano, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. This is one that's sure to satisfy any jazz afficianato. And Miles never sounded better. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK REALLY HELPED ME WITH MY ACCOUNTING PROBLEM. THE INFORMATION WAS VERY INFORMATIVE.

I found this at multiple stores; however, I didn't buy it because the Ernie button didn't work well. As an adult, I had great difficulty making it pop open. My 10 month old daughter certainly wouldn't be able to do it. Again, I've been to 3 different stores and all of this toy that I've tried didn't Ernie work well. I'm not sure if they had a bad batch, bu I didn't get it because 25% of the toy was unusable for my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not impressed","review":"This toy does not keep my son's interest. It is well made and I am thankful for the on/off button. Some of the doors don't shut the first time, so it's frustrating sometimes. I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great toy and great service","review":"Exactly what I was looking for. My grandson's play group has the toy and I had tried to buy it without success. This vendor had the toy in several versions and conditions; I indicated which I wanted and it arrived promptly, exactly as represented. I couldn't be happier and more importantly my grandson LOVES it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy!","review":"The toy is very entertaining when it works! No real educational value, but my son loves the characters and the songs. I got it in early May and it no longers sings songs as of June 30th! I paid a lot of money for it and now it doesn't work! Very dissatisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop-Up's A Bust","review":"Toy is attractive and songs are enjoyaable, but they are brief excerpts. There are only four things you can do with this toy. No room for creativity. Very over-priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for baby, not too annoying for mom.","review":"My six-month-old daughter enjoys this toy quite a bit. She's younger than the target age, and as a result, she enjoys it mostly by lifting the whole thing, then dropping it back on her high chair try, and banging it with her hands.The easiest characters to activate are Cookie Monster and Elmo, which is a shame since I find Elmo the most annoying. I'd love to have a Count or Grover or Big Bird in his place! Oscar seems to be the most difficult to activate since his control requires twisting, but I'm sure as my daughter grows, she'll grasp that concept better."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter loves this toy but.....","review":"My daughter loves this toy but it does not always work!The Elmo (which is her favorite) does not work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept but Not Long Lasting","review":"My son got this toy for Christmas this year and he really loved it. However, very quickly it stopped working properly. He would hit the buttons to open the doors and the characters did not always sing. Ernie has stopped working all together. It is too bad because my son really got alot of satisfaction when he pushed a button and the music would start. He would start clapping and waving his arms. Now, he barely touches this toy. I would not recommend this item because it is not durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant favorite for 15 month old","review":"My daughter immediately loved this toy and has gotten more and more dextrous at each of the controls. The easiest is the cookie monster button but she is starting to get the toggle and switch as well. The characters are cute, the music is just the right amount. It is a great toy for a toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"19 month old daughter LOVES it","review":"My 19 month old loves this toy.. The buttons were easy to push and the doors easy to close for her. She loves the brief songs that each play.. Each play a brief version of the character's song.. Elmo- Elmo's World; Ernie- Rubber Ducky; Cookie Monster- C is for cookie; Oscar- I Love Trash.. She plays with this toys for hours at time and even asks for me to interact with her.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love those pop'n people","review":"This was a toy my grown children enjoyed when they were young. Sesame Street characters are our favorites. My grandson loves this toy and will only enjoy it more as he matures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little action","review":"The Sesame Street: Singing Pop-up Pals has very little action and just brief song fragments.

Having the Sesame Street charaters just pop out and do nothing else does not keep my grandaughter occupied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album, very good.","review":"This is a good album, very good indeed but not great and glorious as the first one. Anyway that is no reason for not listening to this CD. The songs are slower and their 80ish style has changed but there are some gems like \\"In the Beginning\\", \\"She's Walking Out\\" and \\"It takes Time\\". The rest of the songs are very good also. I didn't find a bad song at all. Buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Stills live show....","review":"I was sorely disappointed after seeing the Stills live at Sonar in Baltimore. I felt like I was seeing a band playing at the high school prom in an episode of the O.C. They were trying way too hard and the crowd just never got energized, the reason probably being that they played a bunch of the [...] from Without Feathers. Even sure-fire crowd pleasers like Lola fell flat. I can't believe I rallied the troops to see this show. We listened to Logic on the drive home just to see if we were crazy for wanting to see them live in the first place -- but no, Logic is still a kick ass CD. Too bad Without Feathers is such a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE ARTWORK","review":"BUY THE FIRST ALBUM!!!!!!

This CD arrived a good week before the others that I ordered at the same time for the present, so nothing bad there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken.","review":"I gave this album 2 stars because this is apparently the same band that produced \\"Logic Will Break Your Heart\\", although you would never know this by listening to \\"Without Feathers\\". As other people have noted, this album is infinitely different than the amazing \\"Logic Will Break Your Heart\\". I fell in love with \\"Logic..\\", and when this album came out I was first in line to pick it up.After a thorough listen, I examined the packaging. I thought, \\"Did I buy the wrong cd? Dear God, please, did someone accidently place a different cd in this case?\\" But, to my dismay, it was The Stills. Say what you want about this album, but I don't see how anyone who really felt \\"Logic...\\" could be anything but disappointed in this album. I've tried examining it from a different angle. I've given it a \\"fresh listen\\". Nothing. I got the same feeling from this album that I got after I watching \\"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\\". What happened to the magic, man?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest upset so far this year...","review":"There were a number of albums being released this year that I could not wait to get my mits on and The Stills second full length was at the very top. Logic was an outstanding album filled with sleekness and drone that any fan of post punk would instantly fall in love with. If you loved the sound and atmosphere in Logic, I'm sorry....but you won't find it in Without Feathers. You don't believe me? Check out the first track \\"In the Beginning\\" and I'm sure you will agree that The Stills are no more for the time being....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this even the same band?!","review":"Theory 1:This might be a classic example of a band producing great work as a direct result of their environment, i.e. KoRn's John Davis channeling his anguish into their self-titled debut masterpiece. Then once the band's situation completely changes (they get popular, fat, and happy), their muse is gone.Theory 2:They had all these years to produce great music and then they had a bunch of songs to pick and choose from for their masterpiece, \\"Logic Will Break Your Heart\\" then this horrible horrible album was put out with only a few years of work involved.Theory 3:Someone besides the leader in the band had an ego, so the leader of the group (usually the singer) was like, \\"Fine, we'll do it your way and see how it turns out.\\" And if it sucks they can blame it on that guy. I hate that guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just saw them last night....","review":"I just saw The Stills last night for the first time and I didn't know they had released a new album until they started playing. I liked the ones I knew--I didn't like any of the ones I didn't know (which was about 75% of their set.) They have good stage presence and I really loved when they played the Logic songs. I thought I would give their new songs a try so I listened to them here. If you see them live you will hear the songs on this album and they WILL sound better but...c'mon these songs still suck! An album really shouldn't have to \\"grow\\" on you to like it. If I didn't know about Logic Will Break Your Heart and I heard the samples on this album as a stand alone I would pass right on by. Here's hoping their next album (if there is one) goes in a different (but hopefully smarter) direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this even being sold?","review":"What was the record company thinking? not much i presume, typical sophomore album: \\"okay the first one sold, now hurry up and get another one on the shelves while you're still hot.\\" worst thing a record company can do to a band. just terrible. A band with this much talent should probably focus on making great music, their fan base is driven by the sound they created on the first album, and by allowing this to hit the shelves pretty much gives me the idea that i never want to see this band perform live. Absolute shame, i wish i read the reviews before i bought it, seriosly, this is the biggest waste of money ever, ... ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all changes are good unfortunatelly.","review":"It seems that the original sound they produced in previous works has finally left them. This work may not be terrible but it sounds like a clone between Coldplay or Keane love songs, very slow, mellow sounds. Unfortunally they don't rock anymore, some teenage girls will probably like this but for the people that hoped for some great material like Killer Bees or Still in Love from their debut EP this material is not even a far cry. I really wonder what went wrong..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the end of The Stills","review":"This album is such a huge 180 from what used to be The Stills. I don't even consider this to be the same band. The band I knew and loved is now gone with \\"Logic\\" as far as I'm concerned. I found it mildly amusing when Dave sang \\"Yesterday Never Tomorrows\\" at the end of each show in previous years. Kind of a novelty \\"the band having a good time\\" type of song, as he can't hold a tune to save his life. Little did I know he would take over entirely on vocals for this album and make their music such a mockery. Not to mention the gospel organ they deicded to add to each and every song. Hearing Tim on the whole two tracks he sings for this album just makes me hit the Stop button and pop in the first and last Stills album, \\"Logic Will Break Your Heart\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MUST BE A MISTAKE!","review":"I had such high hopes for this album! Logic was an amazing album, one you never tire of listening to... so I had anticipated a great new album... \\"Logic\\" was like love at first sight... but this new album, it's just an incredible disappointment. I listened to it one time and found it monotonous, uninteresting. I gave it another chance, listened to it again and had to stop. Terrible.I can describe it in just one word: BORING!Do not waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The dreaded sophomore effort that should have never happened...","review":"...they should have called it quits.If you havent read all of these reviews yet, let me, if I may, put them all together.We all love Logic Will Break Your Heart, however this is not the same Stills that you know. There are little, if any, redeeming qualities here. You will be dissapointed in this album. If you end up liking it, God bless you and call me a fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Different, and in a Bad Way","review":"Gone are the inspired nu-wave anthems that combined heartfelt vocals, jangling guitars and a penchant for the dramatic. This new album sounds like a half-hearted attempt to cover a generic pop rock band. I'm all for a band trying to broaden and change it's sound, but not if the end result is something that would fit in perfectly on a Starbucks in-store soundtrack cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat!!!","review":"I don't have a problem with a band changing sounds or genres as long as the music is still good. The songs on this album are monotonous drivel and go nowhere (ok, maybe a little harsh). Dissapointing, however, after their killer first album.This album may have some fans out there, but it just missed with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb !!!","review":"I brought this book maybe 5 years ago, i must have read it like hundred times, its never boring. Meena kumari was a legend. She did some great memorable films, but she lived a very scandalous life style and she unfortunately died the same way.

Szigeti plays the Mendelssohn Cto. with Bruno Walter (1841) and the Brahms with mitropoulos (1948), but don't let the relatively late dates fool you. The tinny, shrill, cramped sound is too primitive to be listenable, comparable to Edison cylinders from the turn of the century. Music and Arts isn't doing anyone a favor by releasing such a disc, not without a bold warning about the sound for prospective buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Missed Opportunity","review":"As others have already mentioned there are several reasons to avoid this release. First of all, where did they get the title? If they are referring to the song, it's called \\"ISN'T IT GRAND BOYS\\" not \\"AIN'T\\". This release comes in a clunky plastic box and most of the music sounds like it was recorded two blocks away. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem deserve a first rate box set. Sony/Columbia surely has endless hours of unreleased material to choose from...and please release some of their great early records on CD. \\"Heart and Hellish\\" and \\"A Spontaneous Performance\\" should be made avaliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealeased?","review":"It behooves me to relegate anything Irish to one star and in fact the music itself is great it's just that most of the recordings ARE released and I have 'em however if you don't have other music by this group it would be grand to have this one. In addition it's a little on the short side being about 100 minutes of music. There are better releases but you'd have to buy several CD's to get all these plus a few LP's,some 8 tracks and LP's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old favourites with nice surprises","review":"The title of this CD caught me off guard: I've been searching for a copy of the Isn't It Grand Boys LP. While it wasn't what I expected, this is an excellent collection.If you're a Clancy and Makem fan, you'll enjoy Rosin the Bow and the Gallant Forty-Twa -- you'll catch some jokes you've heard on other recordings too -- but the addition of Pete Seeger's This Land is Your Land and the rendition of Port Lairge that rolls into US and Israeli folk favourites is a nice surprise. Marie's Wedding -- a tune I've never heard on any other album has become one of my favourites.A nice combination that's a great gift for any Clancy and Makem fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music and great friends","review":"It is true you can get most of these songs on other albums. What makes the album different is that most of the songs are live recordings. As someone who was never able to see the original group perform live it is a true gem. There are a few songs you can't get anywhere else, or at least I haven't been able to find them. The recording show what masters the Clancy's and Tommy Makem were, their good humor and stage presence shines on these recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stopping by Woods","review":"I think this is the best recording of the work. The Road Less Traveled and Stopping by Woods are deeply inspiring, a lyric masterpiece. I use it with my college students, not only for the Survey of American Literature, but as a focus for life choices. Their reaction to the recording was so positive that several decided to buy their own copy...from college students who are not into lyrical music, that says very much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cools!!","review":"If you're looking for a good sentimental Pokemon video, look no further. You'll understand what Max is going through during the movie especially if you've ever lost a friend. Then, when you're all dehydrated from crying so much, watch the Pokemon, Gotta Dance short. Then you'll be like a Goldeen on land. Suffering from lackage of water from all the tears you'll be laughing during the short.

This is my first exposure to the new characters May & Max. The Pokemon themselves are radically different, but it is easy to follow along. The story was strong and the voice acting was on spot and conveyed emotion quite well. I loved the short, GOTTA DANCE, and got to see Seviper and Cacnea for the first time (Arbok & Weezing are sorely missed). The \\"Make A Wish\\" music video is also a treat & I love how they combine the animation with the symphony setting of the japanese singer.

I took it back to troubleshoot and to get a replacement from another brand. The technician at Best Buy indicated that he had seen this happen with USASPEC units many times before.

When I advanced to new songs, a high-pitched hissing sound would start a few seconds after the songs began. I tried an iphone 3GS and an ipod touch; same results.

He plays with a variety of sidemen (no piano on \\"Someone in Love\\" for example), and doesn't yet play \\"sheets of sound\\", but this album is definately 'Trane.He's a little more lyrical here, not in as much a hurry. He also plays some standards, such as \\"I Love You\\", rather than all originals.The highlight of the album is the title track. In fact, this may be the defining recording of Lush Life. Unlike the other tracks, 'Trane has a foil in Donald Byrd on trumpet, and the two play beautifully together. It's also an opportunity for some extended improvisation, as the track is over 10 minutes long.This is a great Coltrane album to start with if you are new to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Coltrane's Lush LIfe","review":"This is a great recording from the 1950s which has lost nothing in the intervening years. It is interesting to hear the seeds of Coltrane's later style in this recording. The pianoless format suits his sound very well. He had a rythmic sense unique to himself, and a beautiful sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this printer","review":"Thought a made a good choice with my first sublime printer. First couple of prints were pretty good. Then printed an indoor photo which came out too dark. Couldn't find the ICC profile to try and correct for differences in displays so I contacted tech service. They said send it in for repairs. No parts for this printer so they sent me a replacement. Replacement printed a few pictures, which were even darker than the original printer, and then jammed. Waiting for a return label (3 days now) so that I can send it in. While I was on the phone with tech support found out that sublime printers don't have ICC profiles only ink jet printers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selphy CP720","review":"This copy printer was purchased for my husband.

I was Wrong, lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prints have green tint to them","review":"The quality of prints from this printer is disappointing. I did a comparison of prints from this printer and a four year old HP inkjet printer. The inkjet printer had truer skin tones and brighter colors. The Canon printer produced prints with a green cast. Skin tones did not look natural.Worthy to note that this printer does not include a printer cable to connect to a computer.As noted by other reviewers you only can print five prints out of the box. I had a difficult time finding stores that carry the paper/ink for this model.The printer has a number of useful features but it all comes down to the print quality which doesn't compare to other printers on the market.Keep looking, there are better alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannon Printer- Selphy CP720","review":"Providing an ink cartridge that only prints (5) picture is disappointing. When purcahasing this type of product, a full ink cartridge would impress the buyer.

When I tried to print an additional photo on the blank half of a used photopaper, the ink cartridge and paper jammed. The only way to take it out was to break the ink cartridge film. (The film was stuck onto the paper) Thus, the entire cartridge was wasted just because of one jam. It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash!","review":"This movie was a great disappointment when I had high expectations on this one being the first work watched of the much admired director, Bernal. It had no coherent story at all but merely idiotic episodes, in short--it ain't Fellini's \\"La Dolce Vita\\"--and the totally terrible thing about this flick was the director's exposition of irrelevant sex scenes just to manipulate the viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Donna Reed Show Season Three","review":"In my opinion season 3 is by far the best. I have not seen this program in years and I had forgotten so many of these wonderful old shows. I can't deceide which I like best but the one that surprised me the most was the episode called, \\"Donna Redecorates\\". Jay North guest stars as Dennis the Menace and what a great treat this was. Hopefully someone will release Dennis the Menace on DVD. The sound and quality are excellent and each show brings back so many wonderful memories. The clothes, hairstyles and values are so beautiful that it really makes me what to go back to those simple times. I would recommend this set to any fan of classic TV. It is well worth the price and I hope season 4 comes along soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Perfectly for the most part","review":"Well other than not being able to find the white version without paying considerably more (so I spray painted the brown version), these worked perfectly for the most part. Does give you full access to your closet and pretty easy to install. I recommend using a socket wrench with a screw driver adapter to tighten the top screw for the sliding assembly though - much better leverage. The only problem I had was when using two sets of these (so 4 doors all together), when I closed one set of doors the air pressure in the closet would pop the other door open a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"If your looking for full width access to your closet, this is a great way to go.The quality is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solved my problem with bigger washer.","review":"Very easy to install.

It combined soul, blues, pop and experimental music with an immensely talented group of musicians. Not only was it one of the best things Bloomfield ever did, it also showed Buddy Miles at his best. \\"Texas\\" is one of the best blues songs ever recorded. \\"Groovin' is Easy\\" and \\"Sittin' In Circles\\" are great pop songs, unfortunately, neither one of them charted. Nick Gravenites vocals are strong and to the point. This one or \\"A Long Time Comin'\\" are both good choices...though there will be some overlap, picking up the both of them is well worth it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book has the information but is filled with Errors!","review":"I bought this book hoping it to be of the same high quality content as Mr.Black's previous books.

Steve Eliovson unknown to me at the time with the late Colin Walcott of Oregon fame on percussion. The piece that stands out to me most is Venice, which I was told was written with the Venice, CA in mind not Italia. Since the album came out Eliovson was not to be heard from since.

According to this book in order for you to be a hipster; you have to be a little dirty, have a body piercing, have kissed somebody of the same sex, know exactly where to get drugs and be younger than 30. So... no thank you! I though this book was going to be more about the culture of the young Americans. Apparently the \\"hipster is about appearance, and a bunch of rules that they have invented so they can be \\"deck\\".So as a foreign to the American culture I am sure this is just a bad characterization of certain kind of young people that dress and talk in a certain way.

And this book seems to somewhat classify correctly the dress and perhaps some of the qualities of hipsters past to present, but the \\"slang\\" they claim hipsters use in regular conversation is completely false.

The book reads quickly and keeps interesting thoughout. While it is a bit out of date at this point, most people with a pop culture sense will be able to get a kick out of it, or perhaps even pick up on a band, book, or movie or two in some of the books lists.

The movie Boricua's Bond came out two years before Skilligan's Island dropped, and the use of Polo Rican in the credits had plenty of people wondering who the artist was.

The author was hypocritical in the fact that he claims we should all love one another and forgive each other. Yet, Zatarain though does not practice what he preaches. Zatarain seems to despise Duke even though Duke has remarkably changed. Zatarain does not even realize that Mr. Duke is a man who has developed and grown spiritually and mentally. David Duke is no longer a former Klansman but a individual of gracious compassion towards his fellow man. Zatarain should take his own advice and reaccess Mr. Duke accordingly. I recommend that the reader should view Mr. Duke's side of the story also by reading: My Awakening by David Duke. Duke explains who he is in his book. It is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More liberal garbage","review":"As is typical of anti-white hatemongers, the author goes to great lengths to imply, manipulate and misrepresent Duke's life and beliefs.

I cannot express in words how much I love the Harry Potter series. This book was, although not the best of the series, was very, VERY well written. It was much darker than the first 4 books. It was exciting, suspenseful, and funny. I absolutely adored it. What I didn't like, however, was Harry's temper tantrums. But those cannot be helped, due to events in this book.

Definetly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Harry Potter Book By Far!!!","review":"This is by far J.K. Rowling's best work. The building suspense and changes in Harry's life just make you want to keep reading it. The Ministry of Magic plays an evil role in this novel and tries to take over Hogwarts, but apart from that, Harry is very moody. He even kisses a girl! The climax is thrilling with a tragic and unexpected death that hits Harry hard. A thriling secret is revealed about Harry's connection with Voldemort and the usual gang returns to take part in this fantastic piece of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for bedtime reading","review":"Like everyone else has said, Book V is rather long, although devoted readers like myself will have no trouble zipping through it. But the one sore spot this book has besides this is the prophecy - it's nothing we didn't already know. The buildup to a final showdown between Harry and Voldemort has been obvious, and of course Harry has to have some hidden power to help him through that. Other than the abovementioned, however, this book is a fascinating read. Just don't start reading it right before bed or you'll end up reading past dawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"This IS NOT the book you expected!!!","review":"I got this book a couple of weeks before it came out from a distant cousin.

Rowling for writing such a glorious book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions of a Harry Potter Junkie","review":"What can you say about a brilliant book? I have read it twice in the past 5 days and I want to know when 6 is coming out. Does this mean I am impatient, not really. Normally I can sit quietly and wait for whatever I need but this book brings the series to yet another peak leaving the reader on the edge of their seat (or pacing the room) just waiting for the next installment.\\"How is JK going to top this?\\" is a good question. \\"How I am going to survive long enough to read it?\\" is a better one. Thankfully the entire series is good enough that it is worth re-reading again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob's Review","review":"J.K. Rowling has again written a novel which has captivated me. The plot is easy to follow, and very well written. I liked the book a lot because it starts out full of action, and ends the same way. Mrs. Rowling has done a very good job with each book so far, I can't wait until the sixth book comes out!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, but...","review":"I was up all night reading this, and I must say I'm slightly disappointed.The book started out good, and got better. It gave me the slight impression of a bad dream. Everything strong was going to pieces, and it seemed like everyone was waiting to wake up.The part with Fred and George was classic.I noticed, though, and this could be just me, was I felt like the last hundred pages or so were slightly rushed. JK, in my opinion, was rushing to finish the book.There was really no real character development, and I was slightly mad about the easy write off of Draco. I wished that JK might have maybe done a bit more with them? They're coming off as fake bad guys, and like Voldemort, more of an archetype than a person.However, Snape saved the book. I love Snape. There's just something about him that's real. I can't really describe it, but you probably know what I mean.All in all, great book.:DMaybe not great for kids, but I wouldn't know. I let my eight year old sister watch Candyman with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Rowling has done it again. I enjoyed this book. It was fun reading about Harry becoming into a young adult. I thought Rowling handle the death of a \\"main\\" character well. Harry's reaction was geniune and anyone who ever experienced a death will be able to identify with Harry's emotions. Also, the conversation with Dumbledorf in the end is quite a revelation for Harry and the reader. Harry finally learns the prophecy between himself and he who shall not be named. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"another excellent potter book","review":"Rowling has done it again witht this the fifth edition of her harry potter series....I can't wait to see what she comes up with for the sixth and final editions of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!!!","review":"I read this book in 16 hours straight, I was so hooked! I've read the series many times before, and I am so happy to say that a lot of questions are answered in this latest book. It's interesting to see how the characters have changed. I'm rather excited to see what happens next in the lives of the characters! I thoroughly recommend this book to any Potter fan!! Have fun!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! The Best Yet!","review":"J.K. Rowling gets more amazing with each book. The way she weaves a story and keeps you guessing right up until the end is great.

After reading it a couple of times, I have grown to like this book even more. He is angry and sullen, which is different than what we expect.

Rowling is one of the best authors out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a keeper","review":"There are books you buy, read and give away.Then there are books you keep and reread, taking them out to enjoy again.The Harry Potter series fall into the later category.I was reluctant to start the series, figuring if everybody liked it, it couldn't be good (there is some logic in there somewhere). Also I hate waiting for the next book in the installment, so I avoid series.But I admit it, I was wrong, and I am hooked on HP. They are easy to read and they keep you reading because you HAVE to find out what is going to happen next. And with this series, anything could happen next.It's true the books are getting longer, but so are the stories getting more complex. This does not interfere with the readability; it just fleshes out the HP universe.So, buy the book and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but could have been better (non-spoiler)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book till about the last 4 or 5 chapters. I thought the beginning was well-written and left a lot of room for sub-plot expansion and development that would have made the over-all plot much more interesting. The ending, however, didn't live up to the beginning, leaving a lot of questions unanswered or with very disappointing resolutions. The death scene came across as needless and (to be honest)..., almost like it was thrown in as an afterthought instead of intending to be meaningful like in the 4th book. Over all, the ending was disappointing, instead of expanding the current plot, it seemed to reinterate what the previous 4 books have already established. It seemed like Rowlings was rushed when writing those last few chapters, though I wouldn't have minded waiting longer for a more complete book.By all means, not bad and overall enjoyable, but clearly not the best out of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Rowling has done it again! She makes all the characters brilliant in there own way....best book i have ever read!I hope she writes another one of these again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much fun","review":"I was worried when I started reading this 5th book in the HP series that it wouldn't stand up to the others...

I'll probably be 25 by the time the next one comes out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY?","review":"You have to read the first four in the series before you read this one. So much is happening to the wizarding wordl and to Harry, it was sometimes hard to comprehend what was happening. Oh, and I cried at then end of the book. It was sad. Why did he have to die? That is so cruel."},{"rating":"2","title":"JK Rowling Works Her Magic Yet Again","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a beautiful, magical story of the bonds of friendship and love. While the novel sometimes deviates from its predecessors in being a deeper, darker and more frightening look at the wizarding world, it does not cease to please the reader with it's charming characters and complex, rewarding plot. Rowling has a certain gift for making her readers share the powerful emotions of each character, especially Harry, whom we see he is growing up along with all of his wizarding friends. This skillfully woven tale is worth reading a dozen times, bravo! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Must Read This Book","review":"Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix is quite possibly J.K. Rowlings finest work yet I got the book at the Barns and Noble Promo party at midnight and finshid 45 hours later. I just could not stop reading it. When I got home I read for 12 hours straight! the book is wonderful all around. you get the classic harry potter adventure theme but this time there is more of an underlying plot that takes center stage in the end. People you think are doing one thing turn up to be doing quite the oppisite. and I think that adds a whole new level to Harry's magical world. I would definatly recomend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big Blue Whale","review":"I don't want to spoil anyone's enjoyment of this book, so I won't say anything about the plot or the characters.

It seemed to me that this book was not written with a passion that the othe were. It was written with the publisher pushing for a release date to sell copies.I was surprised at how little happened in this 850+ page book. Harry goes to school and he is harrased by students, Malfoy, the head-mistress, and he has bad dreams. It is not until about the last 100 pages that anything really happens that adds to the story line.It is too bad that this series has come to this. I would rather wait for a book that has been truly written with some sense of passion rather that receive the publisher's cash cow on a schedule.I think I am done with the Harry Potter series. It was fun while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well I guess one of them has to be the worst of the Potter series","review":"I immensely enjoyed Azkaban and Goblet. In my opinion these two were easily the duo of series champs. So Phoenix had its work cut out for it from the start; having to follow two great reads.The editors must have 1) either been afraid to cut down Rowling's work (or maybe they figured, Hey, we all want to spend as much time as we can in Potter world or 2) Rowling threatened any editor who dare lay a finger on her precious words with a Cruciatus curse. But whatever the reason, the first 220 pages could've easily been pared down to about 80.Other than that, the book just didn't have the ooomph of its predecessors.

I'm a big Harry Potter fan and thought this one was awesome. Any Harry Potter fan would love this book and any Harry haters would too. Like her other books J.K. keeps you turning those pages and staying up all night until you're finished. Even though the spine runs thick fans will flip through them like it's nothing. This book left me highly anticipating the next in the series and wondering, can her books get any better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been up since midnight reading this..","review":"This book definitely followed the trend of the other Harry Potter books in being better written and longer than the one preceding it. JK Rowling seems to get more precise and less like she's floundering around for ideas like in the first books as she keeps writting them. But I don't feel like going into the details of the book, I'm too tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Rowling with a few annoyances","review":"I really liked this book, I would rate it 4.5. My only complaint is in the first 400 or so pages the unfair things that happen to Harry just seem to be getting out of hand. It will frustrate me when reading something and it seems a simple soulution is readily available but the characters don't use it. Or when some simple communication could solve some misunderstandings. I realize these things happen in real life so they are to be expected but I felt bombarded with them in the first half of the book. This is my only quibble though, and really it's not a very big one. The last half of the book flew, I couldn't wait to see how it turned out. I need to say right now that Fred and George Rule!! They are now without a doubt my favorite characters. I could go on forever but what really needs to be said anyway? You know your going to read it even if I said it was the worst one yet.

I don't think it was as good as any of the others. The storyline was too spaced apart and they didn't flow very well. It was a really long book and gave me no new information, except the part about why Voldemort was trying to kill Harry in the first place. There are too many new characters introduced and too many old ones brought back into the story. In truth, I believe it is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was expecting more after waiting this long. Harry Potter fans will of course like it, but I think everyone is left with a feeling of being cheated. The story really didn't advance any, and all the hype about huge revelations was nothing more than the same thing rehashed. Hopefully we'll learn some more in 6 and 7. Serious let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited all that time just for this!","review":"I liked all of the other Harry Potter books but I only got 700 pages into this one.

The fifth one was sad, depressing and I thought that there could have been a better climax to the ending than what she had written. She had written throughout the first four about this boy who's life was changed and his adventures at hogwarts. The fourth book was so good i expected a better sequal than what was published. J.K.

The tenor is different than that of the previous four, but hey, it's the fifth year and times are changing for our pal Harry. I have to defend him. No one can be ever-cheerful in dark times. He's got a full plate. But there are also a lot of places where I laughed out loud. As usual, there are several new twists that will lead into the next book, and there's also a new character whom I think may play a major part later--who knows?

Somethings that I thought would be revealed like stuff about Lily and why green eyes are important never appeared. Or could it have? J.K. Rowling has a way of leaving the smallest clues behind and then after you've read something and you go back to the earlier books you realized that she has been alluding to it the entire time, you just never noticed.

The length of 896 pages is stupifying at the first glance but it is suprisingly fast to read.I was past 200 pages in just over two hours of reading.The rich characters, wonderfully odd locations and the complete richness of the entire storyline and attention to detail that J.K. Rowling has put into her previous books shines through this edition in the story.Rowling has enabled the reader to become a partner of Harry, Ron and Hermionie. You root for them to succeed and wish you could step in and help them.Rowling castes a bewitching spell upon you, constantly inviting you to read on and onuntil you realize you cannot put the book down for the need to know what will happen next.Harry Potter can be understood and enjoyed by any age, regardless if they are a Muggle or Wizard.J.K. Rowling is surely the master storyteller of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter is Stupid!!!","review":"Yeah, I called the entire Harry Potter series stupid. Even the movie that recently came out was the dumbest thing there ever was. I hate to see people engrossing themselves into these books about witchcraft, heathens, and a nerdy boy with a bowl cut, Pepsi bottle glasses, wears black dresses, fights with a stick, and goes to a school named Hogwarts. Wow the name of that place would sure look good on a job application. Now how pathetic is that. This little weakling fights monsters with a stick. Oh no the monster might get a splinter, that you know, might get infected. Why doesn't Harry carry a gun, probably because he lacks the upper body strength to even fire a bb gun.

This is by far the worst book in the Harry Potter serial. I liked the first one, and the second one was okay. But after that Ms. Rowling sort of drifted off, I don't know what happened but I can only guess: No matter how many times she denies it is true: she's being inspired and influenced by a buttload of fans. You don't know it, but she reads what young 8-14 year old fans write on message boards and gets her ideas from there.

By page six hundred, I wanted the dark lord to put me out of my misery.Harry constantly belittles his best friends, poor Hagrid drags about dieing all beat up, and there is no real concern as to what happened to him. Then, If the fifteen year old Harry Potter had talked to me the way he \\"YELLS\\" at the other adults in the story, I would have asked him to move on, not come back, and broke his wand before he left.

I'm also amused by the introduction of Sirius's home, and the inhabitants thereof. We learn the most about Harry and Sirius thru this book, and i won't spoil the ending but i must say i'm sad to see one of my favorite characters killed off.

We get a lot of novelties: a mean house elf, an absolutely obnoxious (understatement) DADA teacher, no Quidditch, bad Draco, Prefects Ron and Hermione, Gred&Forge; at their best, secret societies of young and old and a whole new fan of characters, creatures and spells bound to leave you hooked! And finnaly, the DEATH. One of the most stressing and touching moments of the book...oh, and a prophecy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally.....","review":"I just finished Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix last night and I have to say.... in my opinion it was as good as the fourth book... not as action-packed.... but it gives alot of information about Harry's life... plus, someone dies really close to Harry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again Amazing...","review":"I will not give anything away about this book. I would never want to ruin it for anyone. The only thing I can say is that it is awesome. I plan on reading all 5 over again. I only hope it doesn't take another three years for the next one to come out. When you are reading any of the Harry Potter books you feel like you are right there along for the journey. I look foward to reading the next one and hope that there is many more to come. I am 29 and I felt like I was a little kid again. The second the book came I was so excited all I could do all weekend was read. I don't want the adventure to end so I plan on reading all 5 over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, lousy writing","review":"Suffer through horrid writing to follow a great story.Rowling creates memorable characters and situations, but I really wish she'd buy a thesaurus and take a writing class. Every character \\"beams\\" at each other on every other page, and I don't even want to count the number of times I had to stop reading to figure out who was speaking. A grammar lesson wouldn't hurt her writing either. Maybe she could afford an editor now?I just get the feeling that she rushed these books tp press before she had a chance to polish the writing. (All Harry Potter books have these same problems, but I think the fifth book has the most.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterfully done!","review":"J.K. is a wonderful writer. These stories are going to be read and treasured 100 years from now - like we read Dickens today. Boy, after reading this book, the characters are that much more real to me - I feel like I know the main characters. I really felt Harry's pain throughout this book, and at the end of the story. He is no longer a child. He had to learn a lesson the hard way - not altogether his own fault.In the next two books, Harry will be a young man. Hope his sixth year is easier than his fifth year. When's the next train back to Hogworts?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More to Look Forward To Than a Gryff-Slyth Quidditch Match","review":"If you so much as like any of the first four installments of the Harry Potter series, you will absolutely love The Order of the Phoenix. Rowling wastes no time cutting into the action and diving into the 'X-Files'-ish conspiracies and mysteries that outline the novel. Many new themes and subjects come up throughout the book, including rage, affection, chaos, and many others. The brand new characters really helped to make the book that much more enjoyable, and even though the story is extremely long, there comes a chapter or two somewhere after the middle that marks the point where you have no choice but to keep reading without setting down the book--that is how intriguing the story is. I still love the first four books, but Order totally blows them all away. My Potter rank: 1. Order 2. Prisoner 3. Chamber 4. Sorcerer's Stone 5. Goblet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much happens","review":"This really is a filler novel. I guess Harry needs 1 year to grow up. The plot is a lot weaker than books 1,2,3 and 4 and the ending feels a bit rushed.I hope the next book is better.If you don't expect too much, you won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"Pre-ordered the book and was waiting in anticipation. What a let down!It seems like JKR has written a book for the sake of it and nothing more. There is no coherent plot. Before I read the book, I was pretty sure I'd cry at the death of whoever it was that died, but honestly after reading it, there is only indifference. OKay, so she HAD to kill someone and the pages were running out. So, Sirius, off you go. The HP charecters did look one dimensional so far. By trying to develop a darker side to each personality, she still has not managed to convey depth.Why does fudge suddenly show up and start believing?Totally lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Start","review":"This book was more of a rough draft than a final polished story. Most of the characters were still stuck in the same mold they've had since book one. Harry, though, who becomes this angry kid, grates against the senses as the neglected teenager. His anger while justified does not evoke much sympathy, but rather just annoys the hell out of the reader through most of the book. Besides all of this, the book is much too dark and violent for its intended audience, children. The book had some great scenes though, and it seemed like it could have been great from cover to cover with more time and revision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Rush of Hormones","review":"Yupe! There is no doubt Harry is 15 in the book, and like most 15 year olds, he's angry and prone to doing stupid things. Ok granted he does have more to be angry about than other 15 year olds (Like the whole part about people trying to kill him), but I like the way the JKR has evolved the character. He isn't the same character as he was in SS. The Wessely twins do still steal every part of the book they are in, and their departure from Hogwarts, by itself is good enough to earn the book 5 stars in my opinion. Overall a great read, yes it is cut in the same outline as the last books, but the mood is darker then the rest (of course I'm guessing book 6 will be darker still, but thats just a guess) and provides enough momentum to keep the story going. You won't want to put it down trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"How does this book not have 5 stars as its overall rating?!","review":"Agreed, this book was not the best in the series-- AT FIRST!! After reading it for the second time, I realized how amazingly AMAZING this book truly is. It is the best in the series, and if you don't see it, you should buy one of the Harry Potter super sleuth books which makes you realize the cleverness in this book. I mean, Maybe compared to the other books it isn't a 5 star book, but honestly, look at all the other books in the world and tell me if this is worse thatn any of them? This is the most amazing book I have ever read and if you are debating whether to read it or not, do it for me...I PROMISE you won't regret it and as I said, you may need to read it more than once to get the full spectrum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Read This!!!","review":"You won't regret reading this, I assure you. In this book, Harry goes through a pretty rough time, as you probably know from the ending of the 4th. A lot of people say that Harry has become a really mean person in this book, but I'm a teenager also and Ican only say that's how teenagers act at this age. I just think that Harry is growing up in this book. It's called adolescence last time I checked. The majority of the world goes through it.While reading this, some parts made me want to throw the book across the room because of the content. I ended up reading this book from cover to cover in a day and a half. I couldn't put it down. I woke up early to get to Border's and buy it, then went home and never put it down. My mother had to beg me to go to bed.Don't be frightened by the 800+ pages. You'll love each and every one of them, I guarantee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thing better than a Harry Potter book is.....","review":"WOWIE! ZOWIE! 27 hours of Harry Potter on CD.

Now you can, this book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best books by J.K Rowling so far. Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione are back at the wizard school called Hogwarts again for the 5th year. I connected with it easily especially with Harry and his god father Sirius. I would defiantly recommend starting with the first book in the series.The book starts out in Harry's house were he gets locked up every year. Unexpected visitors come and Harry might not go back to school. Then he escapes on a close call goes back to Hogwarts. Where is the care of magic teacher and what do his weird dreams mean.Even though she describes things well the words can get harder. I would say the age group would be 9-18. If you are someone looking for adventure and a great book I think you should read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I am an adult, but I am a confirmed Potter addict. This book was great! There were answers to so many questions, so much made sense finally. And it was sad, I'm still crying. Too often, when you wait for something you desperately want, you build your expectations way too high. Then when you finally get it, you are disappointed. This book does not disappoint. My only regret is that now I have to wait for the 6th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointing","review":"Yes, I am one of those adults who likes the Harry Potter books. Or at least until this one. Sure, it is still an escape from reality and some of the new characters are interesting, but overall, big thumbs down. The magic and charm (sorry for the bad puns) of the first four is sorely missed here. Book five feels forced, as though she just wanted to get it over and done with. There's no heart or soul to it. I understand that we need to feel the discomfort, claustrophia and pain that the characters are living with, but with nothing pushing the plot along, it was wholly unenjoyable.

Sadly, the new book did not live up to its predicessors high standards. With the whopping 900, it just kept me bored until the eventual end. I was hardly impressed by the lack of depth that the book had, and the ending made me want to tear it to shreds, because I have just read all 900 pages with nothing good to yeald for my efforts, other than the ability to truthfully say that this book sucks. I'm not going to tell you anything about the ending for those of you that don't read this review or don't heed it's advice. All that I tell you is that the ending is completely generic and unorigional and in no way leaves you satisfied after enduring the 900 pages of this boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book was too boring","review":"this book was way too boring, the first four were decent but this was just an agitation. dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"he biggest plus is the book is set the J.K.Rowling universe. Though at times it seems like a movie script - sets are paid way more attention than characters. There is no real character development and the dialogs are often repetative and boring as Harry himself points out (ohn the irony!). The book is not dark by any means, more confused ala teanager finding his place but in no means dark. The second book(CoS) is way darker than this one. The ending is the worst part - be prepared to be shocked by staggering dullness of the revalations. In many ways this is the anti book 4 - no new characters, no new spells, not much going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you begging for more","review":"JKR has done it again. She has answered some questions from previous books, and left more clues. Things that I thought I had figured out now have to be rethought. Must reread the other books.

She's the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Just Keeps Getting Better!!","review":"True to her hints, Rowling has written a much darker novel this time. The Order of the Phoenix signals a change in Harry and his life. He is older, but not necessarily wiser, and is a very typical teenager. Rather than write about a teen who is bypassed by puberty and all of the attendant woes, Rowling has chosen to confront girls, fame, anger, and the fact that Harry is starting to realize much more fully who he is and what he has to confront. While the overall tone of the book is dark, there are some very funny moments and Rowling is at the top of her form. And, Harry is not the only one who grows. More than the previous four books, this one works with an ensemble cast. In addition, Harry's actions have much more far-reaching consequences. Harry and his friends are coming into their own and we are priviledged to be able to watch them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Written for Designated Age Group","review":"I loved this book. My son loved this book. Both of us are outside the designated age group. I have thoroughly enjoyed everyone of Mrs. Rowling's books thus far and look forward to the next one in the series. Unfortunately, this book is too complex for the average 7 to 12 year old (the target age). Even if one is just reading for the pleasure of reading, there are too many subplots for the average elementary student to follow (at least in this country). One would need the ability to delve beneath the layers of complex relationships between Harry, his odd assortment of friends and associates; as well as Dumbledore and his teachers, and his relationship with Harry in order to keep track of the various storylines playing out.Don't get me wrong, I loved it. I can't wait for the next one, and the next one, I hope she can keep the series going in some form or another.

I liked this book better than the last one. The action starts right away, and there are lots of the imaginative details that make these books so great. Fred and George provide comic relief, and as a teacher, I got a big kick out of her portrayal of Umbridge as the teacher/ administrator from hell. It's interesting to watch Harry mature, although his self-absorption did get to me at some points. The past few books are referenced often, and I sometimes had trouble remembering all of the details. (It's been a while since I read them.) Anyway, it's a great read, and I can't wait for the next one"},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly, not worth it.","review":"This book was ok... but it was long, and it seemed pointless. The big finish with Voldemort hardly seemed worth reading, and the prophecy was something everyone pretty much already new- one or the other is going to die. I felt very let down my this book, in the end- a lot of horrible things happened, conflict after conflict, with no real resolutions except Dumbledore's rap up conversation with harry. And the lack of depth spent on the death of one of the best characters in the book was just saddening.Harry is angsty to the max in this novel, which seems rather forced- none of the characters are high in depth anyway, so giving harry a major dose of teen angst just seems odd.After reading this book I just felt very let down and empty, instead of the usual happy feeling I get after reading a HP book. It seems Rowling had a lot to say but didn't quite cover it in her regular fashion- which led to a lengthy novel which covers a great deal but doesn't say much important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"For those of you who have children or teenagers I would advise against this book. JK Rowling has written a book that will drag you through unbelievable foolish depression and out the other side. I hope her desire for depression diminishes and she gets the antidepressants she needs. This book though well written lacks any real heart and I spent more time being irritated by it than enjoying it. The previous books had merit but the further she goes the more not dark but stupid she gets. I am unfortunately stuck until the end. If the books continue to digress I will be glad for them to end. I do hope JK can turn things around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rowling on vacation while writing???","review":"Last year I read all the Harry Potter books, since my kids wanted to. I was captivated.

Harry may be inexperienced in love, but he lives of adventures. The unnecessary length in this book and little detail with new characters gives this book 4 stars.

When are the people in charge, going to tell Harry what is going on? Dumbledore is a well developed character with a lot of depth. His talk with Harry at the end of the book is quite disheartening.

I read the first book, skimmed the second and read some of the third. What more can I say? She is definatly a good writer--but not nearly as great as she is made out to be. I wonder how many pages of this book could be eliminated. Plus, every book needs detail- otherwise whats the point of reading the book? But isn't there something known as too much detail? We do not need to know the scientific name of everything in the room- some stuff has to be left for our imaginations. And what about all the other stuff- movies, toys, EVEN BACKPACKS! i mean...dont just go by what everyone else thinks about Harry Potter.

It is with this 900-page tome that Harry Potter makes the leap from children's story to adult fiction. Gone is the majority of the whimsy prevalent in the first four (or, three and a half, really), replaced with a brooding sentiment of foreboding evil. The cover says it all - it is a dark, monochromatic cover, quite different than the four colorful preceding volumes. Notice also that this is the first cover to feature a grim Harry - gone is his characteristic smile.In summation, for the three of you that actually *don't* have the book yet, don't let any aprehensions about the series running thin worry you. The previous four may have been children's books - this one is literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAS THIS A COLLECTION OF ROWLING'S REJECT PAGES?","review":"There is little magic to this book literally.

People are so hooked on Harry Potter, they will buy it and think it's the greatest book ever even if the plot is drowned in pages and pages of pointless waffle.There are a few good points. Umbridge is a great villain, and there is an amusing joke about complementary medicine. Other than that, and the battle at the end which seems to be the only thing that actually advances the plot, it's all filler.I've been hoping that book 7 will be as neat and to-the-point as the first two, which are easily the best, but after reading this and hbp I have a feeling it's going to be another giant slab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry's back and better than ever!","review":"In her long awaited return to Harry Potter and his gang of Hogwarts fellows, Rowling outdoes herself! 800+ pages fly by in an exhilarating read that shows Harry, Ron, and Hermione more mature, but irrepressable as ever in their continuing quest to defeat Lord Voldemort.This book is more mature than Rowling's last, which may cause parents to want to read it with their younger children, discussing weighty matters such as unfairness, ridicule, and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"No longer only a children's book","review":"Couldn't put this book down! True to JKR's style, it's filled with vivid descriptions, and very subtle hints. Like she said, Harry, in this book, is a very 'angry' Harry. Confused, and like all 15 yrs old, he carries the 'I-know-better-than-adults' attitude. I suspected the demise of the caracter given the hints she gave in earlier interviews, although she kept you guessing until the very end. I still cried, and I look forward to find her reasons.

Harry potter was walking around in a snit for 94% of the book, and I wanted to say get over yourself already, why don't you? The book was filled with some major doom and gloom elements that depressed rather than enticed. I did not get the sense of euphoria that I got from the last 4 books, but I guess since we have 2 more books to read there is not much choice for us die hard fans.

Being the 5th book, and thus the 5th year, since we first met young Harry Potter, I would have expected to find him 5 years older. On the contrary, the Harry Potter in \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" seems to have regressed in maturity, and his prepubescent charm has worn thin. Likewise, none of Harry chums seems to have been developed either, and there flat characters are no more than contrived vehicles for advancing the predictable and wearisome plot. An otherwise great concept was unrealized and clouded by numerous pages of fluff and useless rhetoric. I can only surmise that Ms. Rowling was rushed to get this book to press, and I am sorry I paid full-price for what I'm sure would have earned a T from the Hogwarts staff.

Rowling decided to make everything too dinghy and dark for it to fit in Harry Potter. It was really bad and the characters grew up at an unreal rate. It seems like all the characters grew 3 years older in the space of 1 month. Don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Harry?","review":"This story takes place when Harry is 15 years old,. it's his 5th year at Hog warts. He obviously is at his uncle Vernon's house and Hogwarts, yet he is also at the Ministry of Magic, at his godfathers house,and at St.Mongose. These locations are important because they reveal hidden secrets, adventure, and fun.This book is mostly about how Harry's adventures, mysteries, and answers keep getting more and more mysterious. More than half of it is about Harri, Ron, and Herominie doing things that to them are somewhat normal. What hapens when dementors attack Little Whining? Or when Mr.Weasly gets attacked by a snake and Harry finds out in a \\"dream?\\" Or when Harry's scar hurts and he felt Voldermorts emotions.In my opinion it was the great book. One of the best books I have ever read. It has adventer like all other Harry Potter books, ut unlike the oters it has love. I would recomend this book because it is agood, long, adventer book. It is the best Harry Potter book yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"LSMS Harry Potter","review":"I liked this book very much. It told extrodinary detalies about everything. It is a good book and I think that every kid should try to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Yet","review":"I consider this book the best in the series for many one main reason; Harry is older and not nearly as clueless about the magical world of magic. There is a melting pot (or should I say cauldron) of new subplots and clues as to how it will end. There is a new Defence Angainst the Dark Arts teacher that quickly rises up to power (which, in my opinion, is not a good thing). We learn about a secret D.A.D.A. group established by students, a flight to freedom that envolves Fred and George Weasley, and The Order of the Phoenix, a group that is working to stop Voldemort. All this and more come up in the fifth Harry Potter book by J.K. Rowling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi","review":"It's awesome so read it! It's sad but happy funny mysterious romantic and adventurous! It's a great story to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I decided to read the series","review":"Years ago I read the first three in the series. I decided to start from the beginning and read them all. Glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Good book, but the overall vocabulary was a little too repetitive. Still, the book was amazing. I can't wait to read the Half-blood Prince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeet","review":"This is the book that definitly proves that these are not kid's books. I read it all in one day, and I was sooo depressed the day afterward. Not to mention how much my hand itched. But I really do think that adults should read these books, because they truely are literary masterpeices."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best... So Far","review":"I enjoyed this story completely. Harry is changing into a man and all ups and downs that come along with it. Professor Umbridge is detestable, I really hated her along with the other students. This story drew me in. I could not put it down. I felt like one of the students there on this huge journey. I laughed, was angered, and shocked. Now I can't wait to see what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGICAL!!!","review":"If you haven't picked up this book so far, get it...NOW!!!! The most amazing book in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix does not meet the stantards set by the first four books. It crushes the old stantards and sets the bar even higher (if that is possible)! There is so much suspense and action, especially nearer to the end, that you would be unable to put the book down. Although the author, J.K. Rowling, does leave many little things unexplained, she does answer some questions Potter readers have pondered since the last book. The only complaint I have is that the series should not end in seven books.P.S.- I also hope that Rowling will not make her fans wait for the next book as long as they did for this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessary Move","review":"A lot of people are disheartened at the fact that Harry Potter is growing up; he's not a kid anymore. I agree that at some points \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" does drag a bit, but all the same it fills you in on so many different things in Harry's life that it can't not be good. The book is still exciting in every way, just more subtle than the action-hero scenes that everyone is used to in this series. I can't wait for Book 6- I'm waiting to see if it's going to beat this one as my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"This book was spectacular! I went out at midnight to get it and I finished at one in the morning the next day! Surely this is the greatest installment so far of the Harry Potter series and I was truly esatic with joy once I recieved it! It has so much in it! A truly riviting adventure to another world! There is so much revealed in this book and it was amazing! It's very upsetting and depressing at the end though, but I don't mind because it added so much feeling to the story! It was definately worth the long wait! Congrats J.K. Rowling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Addition","review":"Okay needless to say the Harry Potter series is a biblio-phenomenon. This is another great addition to the series by first-time writer JK Rowling. The book is very dark and full of teenage angst. Family bonds become an even greater force. The book follows the course similarly applied by her other books (intro w/ Dursleys, Train to Hogwarts, education time, final exams, back to Dursleys) but this echoes the lives of every school age kid; if Harry didn't follow this pattern it would be less realistic. There are a ton new characters and more about the wizarding world as a whole. Tensions heat up as Harry gets [upset] about his position as a child with a man's heart (don't we all). Altogether, I kept nodding my head and saying, as a 16 year-old, I know how he feels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter Going to the Pot","review":"There is one reason why this book will not become classified as Classic Literature that will be studied and read throughout time. That is that the book is too transparent. The Harry Potter Series takes too liberally from other classic tales (Lord of the Rings is the highest example), and doesn't create enough of its own charisma to hold its own. They are fascinating, and adventurous tales, and, yes, the very idea of originality is to take and borrow great things to create something entirely new. Something which more and more of the Harry Potter books lack. I am glad to see children, even older adults, reading these tales. But I would hope that they don't expect all books to be as easy and non-descript as these as they delve further into the vaults of Classic Literature. Let's face it, the Series cannot match such books as Ben Hur, Huckleberry Finn, or Sherlock Holmes, to name a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long to say too little","review":"As an avid fan of Rowling's earlier works, I eagerly pre-ordered my copy of the Order of the Phoenix. Regrettably, Ms. Rowling seems to have ran out of Potter material. The author thrashes about for over 700 pages, desperately trying to find some sort of cohesive plot. Finally, at the 11th hour she begins to actually write about something other than Harry shouting at his friends and ends up with a story which is disjointed at best, ill conceived at worst. It's evident the author mailed this one in - her heart doesn't seem to be in in. Perhaps the wealth and fame have gotten to her or she's simply ran out of story for the Potter saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best One Yet","review":"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book. J.K. Rowling has risen above the 'Harry Hype' to deliver an in-depth, mature and somewhat darker novel than her previous works, that still contains the imagination and wonder that made the previous 4 books so magical.Harry Potter himself has undergone some major character development. Now an angst-filled and somewhat moody teen the reader is introduced to sides of Harry's character not previously seen as he undergoes another tumultuous year at Hogwarts. The story line is gripping and suspenseful, punctuated by a tragic twist that will leave few dry eyes.Although containing 800+ pages this is a definite children's classic, can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait ...","review":"J.K. Rowling should continue taking as much time as she needs to create each new installment of the series.The extra time she gave herself for Order of the Phoenix pays off with better writing and even richer characterizations.But the most stiking change is Harry. Adult readers may initially be irritated by Harry's teen angst, but as the story unfolds, you realize that A) you were 15 once and Rowling has simply allowed Harry to feel the anger and insecurity that most teens cope with on a daily basis and B) Harry is reacting understandably to the difficult experiences thrust upon him over the past four years.As for kids, well, it's a great book ... what's not to love.And most importantly, we finally get that elusive piece of the Voldemort puzzle - and the story finally moves into epic territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What an amazing book!","review":"I finished the book the other day, and it blew me away! It was so different than the other books in the amazing series. It was much scarier, and there were a lot of surprises! It's pretty sad, especially the death of an important character........Overall, it is now my favorite book ever, and I'm sure anyone reading this review will like it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Fans of Magic and Mystery","review":"This is by far my fave book of the series. I feel I got to know Harry and his sruggles a little better. I also love growing ^ w/ Harry.I'm his age. I understand the way he feels and I think the whole world of Harry is awsome. All I have to say is this is a great book to read. For adults as well as kids. It's a break from reality and that can be so nice. Let me tell you, I didn't guess what happened at the end. I wasn't even close. So all I have to say is if you're looking for a fun summer book. Harry Potter os definately it."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years... 700 pages.... dissapointing","review":"I waited 3 years practically counting off the days on the calender for this book to come out. Was I dissapointed? Well..I've read it cover to cover 3 times now and I didn't like it as much as he previous books. It can be very long winded at times and harry doesn't even get to hogwarts untill about the 200th page. Harry spends alot of time screaming at his friends and making stupid mistakes that eventually lead to something terrible.If you are a harry potter fan you have to read it. I read it in 2 days when it came out. It gives crucial information about harry and there are memorable new characters.But overall... for being what..700 pages long... not very much happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Boy Harry.. Need I say more?","review":"If you love the bad boy image, you would be as pleased as I am with Harry's transformation in this book. No longer is Harry allowing people to push him around or walk over him. Harry is finally acting like a real 15 year old boy! The only objections to this book is the lack of a Harry and Hermione romance... C'mon! you know they belong together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, of course! Bring on #6!","review":"After waiting 3 years for this book to come out, I must say that I was pleased with J.K. Rowling's continuation of the Harry Potter saga. This book definitely added a lot to the series, and while Harry is quite moody - what 15 year-old boy (or girl, for that matter) isn't?!? I think she got it right on the dot with that. Yes, we'd all like Harry to stay the sweet little 12 year-old he was in the first book, but that's not really realistic now, is it? (Not that trolls, house elfs, and talking hats are, but come on, now...)I am very much looking forward to book six - I just hope I don't have to wait another 3 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible read","review":"I read Order of the Phoenix cover-to-cover within 24 hours of buying it at a few minutes past midnight on June 21. It is incredible. I was wondering how Rowling would pull off Book 5 after all the hype and pressure of the last few years, but she more than lives up to the promise of the first four books, and she has introduced enough new questions and characters to keep us on edge, waiting for the next installment. She has not lost her sly sense of humor, her intricate detail, her ear for character development, or her ability to drive you up and down the emotional scale. It is so rare to find a book that appeals to adults and children, and Rowling has produced yet another one. I am off to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for Book 6.","review":"Wow, my copy arrived Saturday at 4pm from Amazon.com. I closed the book, finished at 3:50am on Sunday. The story, the characters, and the world of Harry Potter had kept me spellbound for 12 hours. Not uninterrupted, my wife and kids rushing around the house while I read. Nothing could get me to put the book down for more than 30 minutes at a time. Great book, and as the title says: I can't wait for Book 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book, but not the Best Book","review":"This is fast, fast reading, but I have to say, not my fave book in the series. It is classic JK, but without some of the main mysteries and surprises that made me love the first 4 so much! There are some great backstories in this book, and we get to see a few amazing new places in the wizarding world. We get more insights into the Snape/J. Potter relationship, as well as some insights into the OWL testing and what it's like to be a prefect.Harry is a lot angrier in this book, something that is classic 15 year old, but sometimes annoying to read about. He's not the happy-go-lucky guy we left in the 4th book. Understandably so, however.As a huge fan, book 3 is still my favorite, but I'm salivating over book 6. I hope JK doesn't make me wait another 3 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not the best","review":"I thought the fifth book was really good, but there were some flaws to it. At the end we never find out who wins the house cup or if he ever gets his broom back. Other than that it was very good. It kept me interested the whole time and never seemed to get boring. The previous writer was right Harry is really anoying. All he is doing is crying about how he doesn't know anything thats going on. All in all it was a good book. The ending was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good!!!","review":"I really like this book. It was sort of confusing, but altogether great! I didnt like that one of my favorite characters died. :( But overall, it was Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looooooong book","review":"First, let me say that I finished this book in about 7 hours, even though it's quite long. The writing is vividly descriptive but I have to say that had this been the first book, I might have had second thoughts about reading the second. The full first half of the book doesn't really move - I kept reading and reading hoping to get to the action. It's not that the first half doesn't paint a good picture - it does. It's simply that nothing truly significant seems to happen until after the second half begins. It is full of tension and angst, and I would not really suggest that any parent let their child read this before reviewing it first themselves. All in all a good read, darker as promised, but still - slow to get going."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed, I cried--need I say more?","review":"This book is definitely the best yet from Rowling. I cried so hard at the end, but I still enjoyed the book so much. I don't know how I'm going to be able to wait for the next book. I am glad, though, that the books are so long, because then I can't read them quite as quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous!","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix is the best installment yet in the 7 book series! I loved it so much I couldn't put it down and had it read in 5 days! When Harry starts his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, fresh torments arise including a truly horrible Defense against the Dark Arts teacher from the Ministry, the Black Family house elf with a venemous personality, and (worst of all) strange dreams about a silent dark corridor and visions of terrifying events that end in Harry screaming and breaking out in a cold sweat! The ending was so sad it made me cry so hard I got the hiccups! Do not read this book if you have not read books 1 through 4 beforehand. This is the best book you'll read all summer garaunteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspired","review":"ok, not exactly 2 but more like 2.5. but it was over-hype definetely. it gets hard to live up too i guess. the last 100 pages or so were alright but the entire first half of the book was almost a day-by-day account of harry's wonderously boring life. cheesy, though amusing, plots were thrown (ie. umbridge, the twins, cho) and dumbledore's big secret was not as shocking as it could have been considering the previous 4 books. the movies have seriously put a dent in the books as well. it wasn't the best but it's obvious that jk rowling's under some pressure to get the books out on time for rabid fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much of Nothing","review":"I was disappointed with this installment. It dragged on (in the most repetitive way) about 500 pages too long. The \\"revelation\\" that either Harry goes or Voldemort was a no-brainer. And, for me, the biggest bummer was that J.K. Rowling didn't advance the romance between Ron and Hermione, which had been building nicely through the first four books. The fourth book, it seems, was long because it needed to be, while this one was long because the author wanted a hefty offering. It's just too bad she didn't have enough of a story to support its length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Unexpected...and Amazingly True","review":"I'm going to be careful and try not to give spoilers out for this book.First off, WOW!!! I honestly loved the book. It was quite dark compared to the other ones and I had to get used to it...the lightheartedness was definitely gone (which is to be expected) but I enjoyed it nonetheless and I feel any avid Harry Potter fan will feel Harry's emotions (so well described by Rowling) are deserved.Again, Rowling brings up good points throughout the story (including the house-elves' viewpoints on being set free). Also, as many of you will know, a prominent character dies which I feel will be important to character development in the next two stories. She also brings up good points involving death...Definitely a must read for any avid Harry Potter fan, with points that reach all ages.Congratulations, J.K. Rowling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book but not quite up to par with others","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was no doubt a very good book but I felt it was missing something very big when I finished it. The book seemed unlike J.K. Rowling's other books it lacked her unique style and creativity. I felt as though it were a work of fan fiction as opposed to the fifth novel in the Harry Potter series. I felt the climax was too short and not suspenseful enough. The rising action failed to build up to it and the falling action was rather boring. The ending was very drawn out and contained about 50 useless pages at the end. Compared to books 3 and 4 it was not as good. This book left me for no desire for the next book unlike the last one that left me begging for more. I would still recommend this book but I have to say as a longtime Harry Potter fan I was disappointed by this latest installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Star Story Stikes again","review":"The new super star story hitted shops all over britain and america on the 21st June 2003. The new order of phoneix had 5 million copys pre ordered and sold on the first day. The book is 1 in 5 and by far the biggest in the searious. I read it in 2 days as well as sleep eat and other things . Its an amazing book buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one yet.","review":"It was worth the wait. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best of the series so far, a massive book that flies by and repays rereading. JK Rowling demonstrates that she has matured as a writer, and that she can write convincingly of teenage hopes and fears (the scenes where Hermione explains to Harry and Ron why Cho acts the way she does is superb). Yes, many questions are asked and answered, and one character does die (no, I won't tell you who it is), and there is great sadness, anger, and danger, but I finished reading it with a smile. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry's growing up....","review":"...and as those of us who have walked that path know, it is sometimes a bit bumpy. This is a superb book in terms of both evolving Harry (many of the characters, actaully) and the whole series. JKR does a great job of capturing the trials, tribulations, doubts, and passions of growing up in a way that easily moves the plot forward. And a great plot at that--action, intrugue, heros, villians--there is not a lot of dead space in its 900 pages. The book is also a great \\"middle book\\"--answers some questions, set a couple of more hooks and generally keeps things fresh--JKR has done a good job in avoiding the cookie-cutter syndrome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful magical Harry","review":"A devoted Harry Potter fun that I am, I had high hopes for this book. I was not disappointed. J.K. Rowling wrote a wonderfuly magical book, full of new creatures and wizards, touching and sensitive, (with insight into adolecence),complex and super-intresting. 36 years old and mother of 2 that I am, I found myself hiding behind a cabinet in atempt to finish reading the book with no disturbances. Well done and thank you for a great time. Please don't make us wait another 3 years for the 6th book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifth Books Rocks","review":"The fifth book, though it maybe longer then the other four which I did not mind in the least,was a great book. Though the third book is still my number one favorite. The fifth book tells alot more of what really happened fifteen years ago when Voldemort tried to kill Harry when he was a baby. Though I could have done without the new teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts, I love what the students do to her especially Fred and George. You really feel Harry's pain and anger when you read the book. ... All in all this book was a great read and I could not put it down. I'm looking forward to 6 and 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Originally my favorite book was the Prisoner of Azkaban but after reading this the changed! While most people may not like it being dark, and violent I love it. If you think it is to violent for kids who sould of seen it coming with a charater like Voldemort. Being a teenager myself I think J.K. made Harry act just just like a normal teenager, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good.. it lets your imagination run wild","review":"It doesn't matter what the adults think of this book.... This book was made for the CHILDREN... letting the kids read this book makes their imagination run crazy, and they won't put this book down... Maybe the adults don't have the same imagination as children do. And it also improves the kids ability to read... The adults can read, but they won't have the same imagination as kids do... So this book is a great book for kids to read. I loved it, and I read it in four days. I don't read books this big for so little days. It really is good"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Empire Strikes Back of the Harry Potter books","review":"I found this new book very enjoyable. If there is anything I wasn't too happy with, it's that Harry is angry throughout most of the story. But I do see the point: Harry is now suffering his teen angst years - who hasn't suffered angst at 15??? A lot of readers may think Harry's lost his charm since the first book, but Harry's not the 11-year-old we met back then. He grows older and matures. And, as shown in this book, he makes mistakes. This is very much why I compare Book 5 to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back - both heroes make big mistakes by being rash, angry and reckless. Both paid a heavy price for their actions and both will learn from it. This isn't a children's story anymore, if it ever were one to begin with. Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical 5th Installment","review":"This book was by far one of the greatest books of all time. The plot was totally unpredictable and Harry getting older was enchanting to watch. The new characters were so believeable I found myself hating Professor Umbridge just like the students at Hogwarts. It took me not even a day to finish this book. It just pulls you in to Harry's world and you'll never want to leave. I can't wait to see what's in store for Harry in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"First I would like to note that i thoroughly enjoyed the first four Harry Potter novels.The new Harry Potter installment was far too long and drawn out . I felt like the book could have been written in 500 pages easily and have been more enjoyable. Entire chapters that are very trivial and usually disconnected from the story are scattered often throughout the book. The only thing in the first 700 pages of the book connecting to the anti-climactic conclusion was a recurring dream of Harry's. I never felt surprised in the novel and the character death had little effect on me. Also Harry's attitude throughout nearly the entire book is that of a whining, slef-pitying brat, which gets very annoying and impossible to enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This book was not the best book out of the series, but i was not disappointed in it at all! I loved it and I think everyone should read it even with all the other bad reviews. It is true that Harry has a little bit of an attitude in this book, but it is intriguing and exciting the whole way through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is just as great as all the others, and even better than some. It is so good that I never wanted to put it down. This book is long, but it never gets boring. Something new and exciting is always happening. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...","review":"Well, i must say i have the utmost respect for amazon.com for shipping my copy of Harry Potter so that it arrived promptly June 21st. I was very impressed by the latest installment of the series, and I enjoyed reading it. There is a lot of tension throughout the book, especially in the beginning. There appear to be many loose ends in the plot, but Rowling ties them up in the end after a stunning climax. ... To sum it up, another wild and satisfying ride throughout the trials and tribulations of a very extraordinary young wizard. In my opinion, it was an excellent book and I can't wait to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"Of the 5 books so far in the series, this is my 2nd favorite (after POA). It returns to the formula of the 1st 3 books where you start at the Dursleys, finish the summer, go to Hogwarts, and then find out some past hidden history about Harry. It includes in the middle part of the book new characters (lovable and not so lovable) and plot twists to surprise you at every turn. She also continues to write in a way that makes you want to read just one more chapter before putting it down. (I read it in two sittings totalling about 14 hours) Harry's progression into adolescence makes this a book harder to understand for younger readers that may not understand the trials of this period of life, but there are still parts that they will enjoy. The ending can be a bit of a shock but it makes you want to know when book six is coming out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but at times annoying...","review":"Rowling continues to impress with her well written book about Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts. Harry is going through adolescence, which is definitely an annoyance to the reader since he seems less able to control his temper and spends far too much time wondering about his love interest. The book, following in the footsteps of previous books, introduces us to new magical spells, creatures and characters, while still managing to build on our knowledge of previous characters. It perhaps isn't as dark and gloomy as the fourth book, but it is definitely action packed. Overall, I'd rate it 2nd in the series (right after book four)."},{"rating":"2","title":"JK Rowlings Order of the Phoenix flying high.","review":"The Order of the Phoenix is number five in the Harry Potter series. J K Rowling is amazing in that her stories seem to tell themselves, they are just waiting for your eyes and imagination to follow. The Order of the Phoenix is sure to make you forget your troubles as you fall into the magical world of Harry Potter.If you think you have troubles, you should read this book. Harry is experiencing angst all through this story, it is not easy being a teenager, let alone a teenager who is also a brilliant wizard. I enjoy reading about all Harry's obstacles and his struggle to win out yet again. Courage generosity and a never give up attitude make him sparkle and shine. Harry Potter stories always seem vividly fresh. The storytelling details make them breathe with reality in a fantasy world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Work, but not Great - This was DARK","review":"This book is much darker, much nastier, quite brutal. Before this, life has been easy and there has always been someone to help out. Now, the situation is becoming more real and the characters are beginning to understand what will be required of them. Sirius says, \\"There are some things worth dying for!\\" to a room full of outraged children. In this book, they learn what it means to suffer. From writing in your own blood to mourning the loss of one you love, this is the best yet. \\"Did you LOVE him, Harry Potter?\\" asks one Death Eater. And Harry fights back.I give four stars for a real, suffering fantasy. Thanks, Rowling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transition book...but still the fabulous Harry Potter","review":"The man reading this book is a genius with voices! Because the book is so long, it does get tedious listening to it, but I still enjoy listening to it while I drive. Although I've read all the books, I still feel like book five is the book that is packed full of information (backwards and forwards) leading you into the last two. Sometimes I found myself bored by all the drawn out descriptions, but I was patient with them because #1...I love Harry Potter, and #2...I have a sneaking suspicion that these details are important for all that is to come. Altogether, a good tie-together of a book. You really have to stay on top of the discs, but still a great listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad!","review":"I was not originally a Harry Potter fan, but I try to keep up with the literature my students read. I loved Goblet of Fire so I was anxious to read this book. After reading the other reviews,I have to wonder if some of the adults have forgotten what it is like to be a teenager. Harry is definitely not perfect in this book. He is jealous of his friends for being chosen prefects (who would not if they were his age with his background). He does have a lot of conflict (some of it due to his connection with Voldemort). I thought that J.K. Rowling did a great job of having the teenage inner conflict. My only complaint is that Harry is so disrespectful to Professor Snape. Harry is completely unforgiving with Snape, even though Snape has worked to help him in the past. Even Dumbledore has told Harry Snape is trustworthy. Overall, I enjoyed the book. It is about a teenage protagonist. Like most teens, Harry thinks he is invincible. I can't wait to read Half Blood Prince."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and predictable","review":"This book was quite simply the weakest of the series. While I love all of Rowlings' earlier Harry Potter books, I found this one repetative and downright boring in parts. As someone who often reads huge novels I was disappointed as I found myself skimming through yet another teen angst-filled chapter and desperately hoping that some sort of villain would appear, other then the obvious ones. I suspect Rowling was attempting to create a feeling of terror by keeping the enemies hidden, but all it ended up doing was making it seem as though there was no real villain. Also, for the 600 odd pages leading up to it, I found the climax pretty anti-climatic...Here's hoping Rowling can get this series back on track with the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of The Bored","review":"This book wasn't horrible if you take it on its face...however if you include the previous four books, you'll begin to wonder how Harry changed his whole personality in the month that is supposed to have transpired between books 4 and 5.I am sorely disappointed, and Voldemort plotting for a year to get a Prophecy? Why was it called a weapon? The book was misleading in spots, plainly obvious in others, and Harry is not the Harry I knew from books 1-4.I think perhaps J.K. has been too busy selling movie rights to dedicate much time to the venue that got her started.I do hope she concentrates more on books 6 and 7, but rest assured I won't be standing in line at Borders when the next one comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting for any one!","review":"When I was 9 I read this book and I LOVED it.It has great discriptons for everything and keeps you reading. This book was so good that I read it in one week.It ties on with the other books and will never bore you. You feel for the characters and you really get lost in enchantment with this book. It is long so it is hard to finish but anyone 8 and older will love this book. I didn't expect to like this series because I am a girl, but my mom got me the series and I loved it. If you did not read the other books by J.K. I recomend those too. Start from the beginning and be wondered with the whole story.My Mom also enjoys this story, along with all the others.Adults love them too!Also just because you have seen the other movies and th new on will be coming out soon does not mean that you should not give the book a chance!It is filled with wonderfull magic on each page and anyone would enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long with too little","review":"The Order of the Phoenix was way too long in my opinion. Most of the time there is nothing happening except school work and all the important stuff is in the second last chapter, period. I had to read way too much in order to come to the interesting parts and I was not as interested anymore. The book should have been half its current size and it might have been good. I would have enjoyed more about V-Voldemort and less about pranks in school.Anyways, hope that the next one is more on the lines of the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" and the \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" which were definitely the best books amongst Harry Potter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phoenix Rises out of Its long await","review":"This is not only the best book in the series it is also the most fun to read. At times i found myself actually laughing out loud at the antics of Fred and George Weasely. But beyond the humour i found this to be the most chilling of all the books.Plot; 11/10 This book has the best plot of any of the H/P books. It is about the order of the phoenix (an anti voldemort group) and how they defy the ministry of magic. With inventive twists and turns this book kept me at the edge of my seat at all timesCharacters; 9/10 Although the characters are intrigueing i couldn't help getting ticked off at harry for being so darn emotionalOverall; 10/10 As i said it is simply the best of harry potter and i highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was there an editor?","review":"I have been a big fan of Harry Potter since the first book, but this one is a monument to someone way too taken with herself. A good editor should have been able to sit her down and say \\"look, it's too long. Yes, it's your baby, but its... too ... long...\\" Way too many sideplots, too many new characters and no time to develop them.Then there is Harry. He goes from a pretty nice kid in June to a tortured, angry, megolomaniac in what--4 weeks? Nope, don't buy it. I wanted to shake some sense into him for the way he treated his friends.The tone of the whole book is dark and angry with the very occasional patches of humour (God rest ye merry hippogriffs!) and did not show the authors respect for the characters.Maybe 6 and 7 will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness and Dread","review":"The fifth book in the Harry Potter series has the darkest cover yet - which is quite an insight into the content. Yes, this is the darkest book yet, there is more of every emotion in this book than in any of the others. In this book you truly feel Harry's pain, fear, anger, frustration - everything. Ms. Rowling has outdone herself with this. This book left me with so many different emotions, it felt as though I was a part of the story myself. It felt as though these people had truly touched my life and I hope that others have felt the same as me. I can't wait to read the next book to have some of my questions answered still left from this book. Some of the content does seem unnecessary and dull, but overall this book is a rollercoaster of emotions and I highly recommend it to everyone - adults as well as children at least 9 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the emotion?","review":"I, personally, was disappointed in this book. The first four grabbed me and made me care about the characters. This one left me not caring about most of them in the slightest. Even the death scene had no effect. The character of Harry came across as whiny, self-absorbed and complaining. Yes, I know that's typical for his age, but I'm not looking for reality in a Harry Potter book; I'm looking to escape reality. Everyone seemed so two-dimensional in this story. Hagrid, Dumbledore, the Dursleys, the Weasleys, everyone...they were all just paper dolls.I don't know. Maybe it's just me. I sincerely hope everyone else enjoys it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just plain bad...","review":"I enjoyed the first four books in the series, but this one was just awful. It's far too long, short on ideas and humour, and the attempt to make Harry a teenager is unsucessful. The Voldemort story doesn't get anywhere, and the 800 pages drag along.As for the new characters, JKR is trying too hard to please her supposed audience. A \\"cool\\" young woman wizard with pink hair, a black wizard etc...as for Harry's girlfriend, please, what's the point? Teenage themes are catered for in different books - we don't want them in the Harry series, particulalrly if they're done so badly!I fear for the last two books in the series, unless JKR can perform a U-turn and get back to the original stlye that made the first four so readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahhhh!","review":"this book is boreing! if you like fantasy, check out the dragonlance books. the first dl book is around 400 pages and this thing is like 6 or 8 hundred but look at the typing! its freakin huge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HARRIET POTTER: No I'm NOT Giving away the plot","review":"No 15 year old boy thinks this way. I am not being sexist, but both my wife and daughter said that he thinks like a teenage girl. You are going to read this anyway. The first and third book are two of the greatest books in English literature. The second and fourth are good. This one is just ok. Nothing new, J.K. has created a world, and this just takes place in it.If you are an adult read Jasper Ffordes three books instead. If you are a child, go and play soccer or baseball instead. In fact, that would be good advice, even if you are an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Harry Potter","review":"My favorite of all the Harry Potter novels, because Harry really becomes an annoying, bitchy teenager in this one -- and yet, you still like him and want him to win. How do you do it, J.K. Rowling?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I was great like all the rest I just can not wait for the next book...This book had a little bit of everything and I think everyone should read it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less mystery, amazement, and humor... more teenage angst","review":"Although I couldn't stop reading, the surprises and revelations are much fewer and far between than the previous books. This one is more about Harry's humanity than the wonder of the wizard world around him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for Book 6 !!!","review":"\\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" is super-thick, and the pace is much slower and not as exciting as the first 4 books. Not much surprise element here as the groundwork has already been laid. I can only hope that the magic that is lacking in this book is because this is a launchpad for future events in books 6 & 7. Don't get me wrong! I really like this book for all its plotline and characterization. The trademark Rowling wit and sense of humor is still evident. There is also a lot more focus on Harry's feelings and relationships with the other characters this time around, and some political intrigue. Overall, despite my mixed feelings, I can't wait to read Book 6. Great job, Ms. Rowling : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the..?","review":"Are you Sirius?? A book this long and it hasn't anymore powerful blow than the previous four? Too much unnecessary detail and too many leads which lead no where. And the ending... by Merlin's beard! it hasn't any substance at all. By far it is the dullest, mind-numbing Potter series ever written. Put more quality in the next ones will ya Ms. Rowling, not quantity, let alone it's pretty boring. Sorry to say, but it is as it is. By the way... the third movie sucks, I'd say you'd better let Chris Columbus do the rest of your films, honestly, and I bet you know why already. PS: don't rush things just because you need to meet some deadlines."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet!","review":"I was so sorry to finish reading this book, I kept wanting it to go on and on. All of Harry's adventure kept me on the edge of my seat, particularly near the end of the book. I can't wait for the 6th!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will continue to amaze","review":"Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed in it's fifth installment, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This book contains more magic, darker secrets, and greater adventure (is this possible?). You cannot finish this book fast enough, but dread the ending, knowing you will have to wait another few years for the next one. Enjoy your first time reading this book, for you'll never get to read it the same way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There isn't much to say about this book other than it doesn't compare to the rest of the series. This story is so bloated by unnecessary scenes that it's frustrating to read.Also, up to this point, all the previous Harry Potter books had an element of mystery to them that this book, unfortunately, did not. The ending seemed forced to be more like the previous book (which was excellent).If it weren't for the fact that J. K. Rowling could write about paint drying and make it seem interesting, this book would be terrible. Fortunately for her, she has that ability and, with as many negatives that this book has, her writing still makes it bearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My least favorite HP book","review":"This is my least-favorite book of the series. It's no fault of the writing, and probably partly a function of being a middle book. It's really all exposition, from the larger view of the series, and it's all depressing exposition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"The series keeps getting better and better. As I've said in previous reviews of this series, these books have been reviewed so many times, I'm not going to waste anyone's time reinventing the wheel. I loved the book. Harry is getting older in this book and I was a bit taken aback at first with some of his anger and frustration - as well as the bickering between Ron and Herminone as well. But, when I thought about it, they're teens now, and who wouldn't fight at that age, especially about secrets and the situations they end up in. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SO FAR!!!!!!","review":"harry potter has always been one of my favorite series. i love all the imagination and magic. when i finished reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix, i was amazed as usual. this book is so carefully written and descriptive. it caught my attention from the beginning and left me wanting more at the end. J. K. Rowling surprised everyone with twists and turns. At the end, i had tears in my eyes. This book is wonderful. i recommend it to EVERYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter book 5 review","review":"This book was so good! I loved it i suggest every one read it. This book gave us a better feeling of how Harry reacts to certain things. I loved this book and I hope she comes out with her new one soon:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Harry Potter","review":"I really like Harry Potter, but in my point of view in this book, it was disgusting. There was no story, and it was very, very boring. If you want to read the Harry Potter books, read the 4th, 3rd, and the 6th."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.K. Rowling sells out","review":"I believe that J.K. Rowling succumbed to the pressure of writing a fabulous 5th book by adding more violence, more anger, and unnecessary vulgarities and foul language. In the first couple of chapters the word \`damn' is used repeatedly as well as the word \`effing.' There is a discussion of someone's buttocks and I am sure the list goes on. I love the Harry Potter books but I don't think I would, in good conscience, let my children read this book. If Rowling wanted to start making the books where Harry is older darker and more like the 14 year old boy he is, then she should make her readers aware of it and let her younger readers know not to read it, which at this point, is like telling a child not to breathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Hope this is Just Bump in the Road","review":"Book 5 in the series was a disjointed, plodding waste of time. The characters were very uninspired (Tonks in particular, boy was she annoying!!) and the whole Order of the Phoenix business seems totally unncessary. I hope that Rowling can pull it all together in book 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always love Harry potter","review":"Harry potter has been a favorite of mine since the first book was released and it gets better every time I read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book rocks good description and awesome detail and I like this book so much so it is not a waste of money buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter #5 . . .","review":"I think Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a great continuation of the Harry Potter saga. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and like the others in this series it'll leave you wishing for more!! J.K. Rowling has written another awesome book and I highly recomend it to anyone who has read the other four books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....What?","review":"This wasn't my standard for a Harry Potter book. Everything was smooshed up at the end, for an untimately unsatisfing end. Nothing in this 870 pages actually ammounted to anything, besides provoking many people by killing off a GOOD character (Sirius), introducing a maddening and useless character (umbridge), and basically going over what we already knew. By adding a few extra pages to the 4th and 6th book, we could have gone entirely without this one at all.I, personally could have done without Bratty Harry, Luna Lovegood, and that whole big fuss in the last few chapters. Not to mention the \\"D.A.\\" and Cho Chang the Cry Baby.Please J.K. Rowling, bring back the magic that you had in all of your other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for.","review":"I'm ten years old. My mother and my grandma have read them to me. I wanted to have this one so much but now we have it I think it's boring. Nothing is funny in this one. Nothing happens for a long time. There is too much talking. Harry just sits and sits and doesn't get to be with Ron or Hermione very much. They keep talking about stuff that happened in the other books that I can't really remember very much and my grandma can't too. I wish it was shorter. I keep going to sleep when she reads it to me and I hate to go to sleep....(typed by his grandmother)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"As soon as I received the book at midnight, I started reading it and could not put it down. Within 10 hours I had finished all 870 pages and I'm nothing more than speechless. I cried when I read the death of the \\"big fan\\" and will sorely miss that character. The book had the best humor I've seen and new surprises about the relatives of Sirius Black, the new defense against the dark arts teacher and the horrible things that happen during the school year completely rendered me speechless. Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite but now I have to say that even though this book is dark, it's my favorite. The book had me laughing, crying, gasping and cheering. J.K. Rowling really sucked me into this book and I feel her writing skills were the best in this book. I look forward to the Sixth!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"J.K. Rowling has lost her touch","review":"What is wrong with this book....there are so many things to name. First off it is way too predictable and more of a recap of the series than then 5th addition to it. Second....this book was boring beyond belief. It was a struggle to keep reading. Three...Too much info involved. In her other novels of the series J.K. won the reader's hearts through witty turns with the words and her magical sense of being able to tie it together. This book lacks that and more. Harry potter yelling at everyone?! That is not typical teenage behavior. Get a life! I hope her next in the series are much better written than this. Oh yea. not to give anything away, but the \\"surprise\\" is a huge anti-climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"My boys and I have spent many wonderful hours reading Harry Potter stories together. However, I am not reading them this one---not for a long time.This book has far too much pain and suffering to be a children's story. I realize Ms. Rowling created these characters and can treat them any way she chooses, but some characters have such a complete personality change that it makes this \\"believable fiction\\" feel so truly unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have loved each of the Harry Potter books, feeling each was better than the previous book, until now. The 5th year is the only one I have found to be dark and unenjoyable. It was not a fun read like all the others have been. There was no humor. Many characters were uninvolved and the ending was unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know how she does it.....","review":"This is a brilliant continuation of Joanne Rowlings famed series. Sure, it's overrated, but for a good reason. The storyline holds together, its getting the dotcom generation to read- how much cooler can it get? Especially love the parts with Harry's parents in it. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Rowling continues to enthrall","review":"There must be a spell J.K. Rowling has put on the Muggle Community. Even after a long hiatus, she still delivers the goods with the newest Harry Potter book. I was impressed by the length and the depth of this book- it conveys emotion and feeling better than any of the other books. Don't get me wrong, the other's were awesome, this however, struck a chord with me. As a 17 year old, I am not far away from 15 year old Harry, and I can vouch that he has some of the same feelings that I had at that age. This is a magical read for anyone who wants to continue the saga, and even for the skeptics who don't believe that these books are fantastic. Give it a try, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a treat that leaves you hungry for more","review":"'Harry Potter and the order of Phoenix' livs up to the high expectations .Though it is not the best of the series,it succedsfabously in showing the changes that come in harry as he reaches the crossover age from childhood to adulthood.the action is slowin the first part witch tests the patience of the reader a bit,but the end chapters make up for it.J.K Rowling has agreat ability to weave the story together .the characters and their emotions are uncanningly life-like .in he fifth book this ability is more prounced.No one is shown infallible even Albus Dumbledoer.The death the last part of the book is unexpected and leves the reader in the same state as harry ,wishing feverently that ther was some way to bring him/her(not telling) backThe book seems better on second reading because one can pay more attention to details and there is no rush to reach the end.over all it is a spell-binding book,though it just wets the appetite and leaves us hungry for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the mystery?","review":"All four of the previous Harry Potter series culminate in the solving of a mystery. They are like detective stories, keeping the reader on his toes, constantly guessing who the bad guys were. The newest installment, however, is utterly predictable. The book ends without any significant revelations. A true disappointment, especially considering the Goblet of Fire was such a tour de force."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on the audio","review":"I actually haven't listened to the whole book as of yet but I need to address something that bugs me about the audio version. While the story is great, why does Jim Dale pronounce Hermani's name totally different than he has in the past 4 Potter audios? He says almost like the word harmony or something. He does a great job the rest of the time. Just bugs me that's all.

Three quarters of this enormous, formulaic book is Harry feeling sorry for himself. Not without reason. Everyone's out to get him. That theme is completely worn out. Wouldn't you think that after all these years the adults would start trusting him more? He's always proven to be right in the end.The book drones on and on. I didn't need another long, long description of a quidditch match.Finally, in the last quarter of the book the plot starts moving and gets interesting. The book could have been trimmed 500 pages and been much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not standard hardcover","review":"Although this is a hardcover book, it is not the same version as the ones you see in the stores. It is a smaller version with no dust jacket and looks very cheap.

It didn't seem as if there are ANY happy moments in this novel. Depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to long..","review":"I have waited a long time to get back to my adventures at Hogwarts and to say the least I am very confused.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, however, was a highly disappointing purchase. Between Harry's unusually negative attitude and the overall dark feel of the book, this fifth addition proved no where near its predecessors. Excitment is lacking and the only modivation the reader has to continue reading is the hope that the plot will improve, but only to finish in disappointment. To top the book off, a miserable and very unnecisary death of a main character takes place at the end, leaving the reader feeling empty and thouroughly depressed. Though I rate the other books five stars and this book did keep the reader interested, I must say that it was a very depressing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet!","review":"My mom bought this book for me and I can't pull myself away from it!

They are interesting and filled with incredible detail, and best of all touch that secret dream in all of us that looks for magic in life. I am so bored with people who have no talent or imagination of their own that lash out at these books by saying they promote witch craft. That's like saying fictional mystery books promote crime.

Rowling is a great and descriptive author and can get into her \\"character's skins\\" really well.Having said that, I have to say that the new Harry Potter book seemed to be not quite as great as the last four. It seemed a lot darker than the other books- Harry seemed like some disturbed teenage maniac and was furious for the entire duration of the book; I don't think that any teenager could be that furious.This book is just so dark... and not in the dramatic way. More than less in the twisted way... I still say that it was descriptive and better than a lot of books that I have read, just not as happy or... intricately woven... as the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!Wished it would never end!","review":"I am 27 yrs of age, and I along with many other adults are fascinated with the books of Harry Potter.. Of all of the books in the series this one by far is the best!This book was very hard to put down, and never a dull moment for being almost 900 pages..But don't let that deter anyone from reading this because so much happens and you will become so enthralled that you won't even realize how long it is.I was soo disappointed when I finished with the book because I just wanted to keep reading more and more into the world of Hogwards and Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like someone else said, thick plot, thick spine","review":"All in all, I have to say this book was great. It kept the spirit of the other books and delved to deeper issues more so that its predecessors did. I think that as her original target audience grows older, they demand more plot and Rowling delivers tremendously. Meanwhile, the rest of us lap up her text just as eagerly as the youngsters do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book, It would have been my favourite, but because of some problems it's not that great.I don't really like Harry getting mad in the beginning, acting like the hero, and at the end, where the main part happens. He needs to lighten up a little, and be more humble, not like he is the greatest one in the world.I liked the addition of Professor Umbridge and what she did to make the students do what they do.It was also interesting to learn about Sirius's past, and family, and lily's, and james's past too.I think Sirius went a little to phyco in the book. It was kind of scary, being very unruly, acting like Harry was James. That is another big change from the fourth book, where he was acting wise.Also the length is okay, but it could have been shorter, but It's okay. The best part about the length, though is the fact I can brag to my friends about having read the book in 14 hours.Overall the book is great, but could be even better with some changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many spoilers in these reviews!","review":"No spoilers in my review, but watch out reading the rest of these reviews, there are some serious spoilers here!Now, for the book, it's not a \\"fun\\" read like the first four, Harry is struggling on several fronts, and it shows throughout the book. But still it's brilliant, Harry really came alive for me, so many times I wanted to reach out and shake some sense into him! And the Weasley twins were absolutely fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less than expected","review":"Like most of the world it seems, I eagerly awaited the arrival of the 5th Harry Potter book. When it came I read it straight through in less than 24 hours driven by the exciting endings Rowlings always has waiting. But as I read on the ending became more and more predictable. Upon finishing, I was a bit discontented. The book was extremely good compared to most other books. It provided excellent characters and intriguing plots. Fred, George, and Ginny once again were hilarious and had me laughing out loud. My disappointment came in the ending where Rowlings failed to give the readers an unexpected twist as she had before. Overall though the book thoroughly enraptures the reader and should not be overlooked because of its size."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay, but three years was not worth the wait","review":"In this installment, Harry again faces issues of growing up and growing as a wizard. The item that negatively jars me the most in this book was the fact that where Harry previously was an upbeat character with a strong support network of friends who strove to overcome the adversity that life through at him in this book he is foul tempered, shrewish and self serving. While it could be argued that it is a natural progression for any teen to feel a variety of emotions and to question authority, I found myself becoming tired of his endless self pity and truculent attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story!","review":"This book, although full of darkness, is another great addition to the Harry Potter set. My stomach was in knots from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"Being a huge Harry Potter fan, I immensely enjoyed the 5th book. However, I do not feel it lived up to 1) all the hype and 2) the previous 4 books. It was too long; an equally great story could have been written minus a couple hundred pages. Harry's depressing attitude, while probably realistic for a teenager, continued throughout the entire book. This book is a transition from Harry's childhood years to adulthood, but I hope we do not lose the parts of Harry's character that we've come to know and love. While I have to admit that my heart was racing while reading the end, I did expect more. A variety of new and interesting characters were introduced, and many of the previous ones resurfaced. Some were not developed fully. Nevertheless, the story was fun to read and I can't wait for the 6th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an overhyped book","review":"Not the best book in the series, but once J.K. Rowling has you hooked, you're hers for life! I'm not saying this book wasn't good, I was just a little in disagreement with the death of a certain character. But great props to Rowling for having such great character development with Dolores Umbridge that sometimes I wished I could reach out and strangle the woman, regardless of the fact that she was only a character in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Books I've Ever Read","review":"This was one of the dumbest books I've ever read and in my opinion, the worst edition in the series so far. First of all it was way too long and you could've taken about 200 pages out of the book and it would have had the same effect. The character development was off and even though she was showing them during their adolesence, they were very obnoxious. Also, it took a very, very long time to get intereresting and I found myself procrastinating and finding excuses to not read it. Overall, it was a horrible book and a waste of a week reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Extension of the Series","review":"Like the first four books, I finished this book in two days flat. The first chapter of this book answers many questions raised by the previous four books, and raises some questions of its own. The second chapter is magnificently written. Throughout the book the characters are developed into every 15-year-old you've ever met (as a youth leader, I recognized them instantly). After reading this book I have only the most profound respect for Fred and George Weasley (I'm chuckling in amazement at their departure even now)! As I read through the book I was certain I knew who was going to die, but just as certain it would be someone else, then someone else, etc. Rowling has once again nailed the art of suspense and woven the storyline perfectly in every way. And given what Professor McGonagall said concerning Harry's choice of careers (p. 665), I can't wait for the next book! Until then I'll be reading the first five books again, and again, and again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"someone","review":"I loved the book and will give it five stars. I have to admit some parts of the book were upsetting (...) and some other things were annoying. But the thing of it is, is that J.K. Rowling wrote a book that is just as good if not better than the rest of them. It was different, but would you really be just as interested if Harry met Voldemort every year, defeated him and had a wonderful life? Moved in with Sirius, Sirius' name was cleared and he was happy? I don't think so. By writing the way she does, she keeps us on our toes. It was a good book overall, and I am seriously hoping that there ends up being an extremely good reason for everything that has happened in book five, that will be shown in book six."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped","review":"JK Rowlings is a very good writer and I must say that I've enjoyed the first 4 books of the Harry POtter series. After reading book 4, I couldn't wait to read book 5. However, I finished reading it yesterday and I didn't enjoy it that much. The series has become formulaic and rather predictable. The adults act too stupid for words ,even Dumbledore whose explanations for his actions are so weak and full of holes...Too many flaws in the book and I was often bored reading the book.I even remember the first 4 books better than this one.At least the death scene wasn't grisly but at this point in the book I found most of the characters irritating and I wasn't sorry to see the person die. The annoying thing though is all the hype made in the media about JK Rowkings crying after she killed off this character.The book wasn't that bad, I'm just irritated about all the efforts made(JK Rowlings claims its to protect the children. YEAH RIGHT) to keep this sub standard plot secret.DISSAPOINTING!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely mindblowing book!!","review":"I just got the book yesterday morning and 10 hours later, I am done with Order of the Phoenix. It was amazing!! I don't want to give anything away, but be prepared to cry, laugh, and be very angry with Voldemort. I cannot wait to read it again and again. My favorite part is when Lucius Malfoy gets his due."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still like Goblet better...","review":"Well, this book definitley had a darker turn on it which is what I expected but I was pretty disappointed with how much time was spent with the reader in the dark. I felt that Rowling was dragging out some parts more than necessary and finished with not quite as big a bang as I had expected. I felt that the whole of it was in kind of a lull and the ending wasn't quite as exciting as I would have hoped.Still.... it wasn't a bad read all together. Though I feel more in favor of her other books, this one still had quite a bit of interesting background filling which helped make the other books a bit clearer.I'd recommend this book if you feel like some light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Yes, the book is long. Yes, the characters are growing up, and yes, someone does pass on (I'm still waiting for more information). But it's in a world many of us have come to love. And this book definitely gives us more time with those characters and places we love to read. We're even reunited with some that we haven't heard from in awhile. All in all, it's an excellent book. Rowling is getting better after each one, and for me, it's hard to pick a favorite. After reading Phoenix, it left me wanting more. It has a great flow, and I couldn't put it down. The plot develops wonderfully, giving us a hint of what's to come so that when we finally get there we're trying to point the characters away from the dangers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoeinx","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was an excellent book!! In my opinion it was the best Harry Potter book yet. J.K. Rowling keeps you wondering when Voldemort will surface just long enough to build suspense. The characters are changing and growing up and Rowling does an excellent job showing this! I plan to reread the book again, simply for fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL read!!","review":"I was not in the least bit disappointed with this latest installment in the Harry Potter series. In fact, it might be my new favorite. Absolutely couldn't put it down. I love Harry's new teenager attitude, and lots of questions were answered, leaving the story open for more interesting twists and turns in the future.Only downside--I don't know how I'll wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish i could give the whole series a 100 stars!!!","review":"WOW i all i have to say... How does Rowling do it??!!! even under all the pressures of writing it, she made it one of the best! Yes, this is a darker sadder book, but in the end it is and amazing one!!! My all time favorite chapter was \\"Snape's Worst Memory\\". Though i felt a little sorry for snape, it was awesome seeing well i wont give it away, but i thought sirius and james were pretty funny! Though i dont think a review is much needed on a book like this( if you have any sense you've already read the first 4...so why would you not buy this one?) Trust me: It will NOT disappoint! My favorite book in the world! (besides prizoner of azkaban)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply magical","review":"JK Rowling, who deserves every bit of her success as a children's writer, has skillfully allowed her hero, Harry Potter, to mature at the same pace as the readers who fell in love with the world of Hogwarts and all that is magical with the publication of the first installment in the Harry Potter series.This, the fifth of a planned seven-novel series, is a well-paced book; the main plot events are spaced nicely throughout the novel and the level of excitement never flags.The characters are as vivid and well-written as we have come to expect from this anthology. A number of past favourites make welcome reappearances, and we are also treated to some new characters - some good, some evil, and some of a dubious nature!The more intense part of the story, which comes at the end, is treated with a great sensitivity and insight that left me in tears. The much-publicised \\"death\\" scene and its consequences make this a truly touching coming of age novel.Another masterpiece of children's fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have Ever Read","review":"Astounding! This book is so well written, so well put together that I couldn't put it down. As soon as I got it I read it straight through for six and a half hours! The whole book is full of mystery, plot twists, character twists, and an ending that I had to read twice just to make sure I read it right the first time. I can't believe the end. The answer to why Voledmort is after Harry is so amazing it kept me wanting more. I hope it won't be 3 more years until #6 comes out!! I don't think I can last that long!This is a must read for all Potter fans!! You cannot go without reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix DVD","review":"The DVD was defective and would not play the movie properly even though the disc was not visibly damaged or scratched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I was really pleased by my purchase,but I am an avid and obsessed Harry Potter fan. Those who read what they pay for and like that type of stuff will be happy with this I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This was my faverite! It was funny, and brang in many new/old people. Iwould love to be in the world of wizarding"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disapointed","review":"I waited two years on pins and needles for this book, as I got everyone one at worked hooked on Harry Potter I am such a fan that is all I listen to at work, over and over again for two years.Finally she comes out with the new book I was elated and within the reading of the first chapter my heart sank, somewhere along the line she turned Harry into a whining spoiled little brat who cared about nothing but me, me, me.I hoped it was just me and as I got into the book it would get better but it didn't then to kill [a character] off at the end made me want to get on a plane and go to England and shake this women and ask her \\"Why did you do this, he is no longer the boy you wanted to protect and show that love was possible.\\"I can assure you I will not wait with baited breath for the last installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but 200 Pages too long","review":"As always, Rowling generates an enjoyable, creative and asorbing book. The descriptions of the secret societies, political machinations of the magical world, and the misdirection about character's motives are well done. Some characters like Snape, Neville and Hermione really seem to mature and acquire depth which is rewarding to previous readers. Unfortunately, Rowling falls back on several common themes that seem to disappointingly familiar. At nearly 900 pages, you often wish Rowling spent less space describing Harry's inner monologue and self-doubt and pared back some of the less important storylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth waiting for!","review":"Wow! The latest Potter book is the best one yet. Much darker and more mature than the first four, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix really delivers. If you liked the first four, you'll LOVE this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait!","review":"It starts off a bit slow, but this book is a winner! An honest-to-goodness page turner, I could not put it down. While it lacks the cover-to-cover emotional intensity of \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\", it does have a great number of shining moments.There are any number of surprise appearances of almost-forgotten characters from other books. A few scenes had me laughing out loud, and a few more had me weeping. One of my most beloved characters, Neville, plays a bigger part than ever before...something that had me grinning from ear to ear.And a final note - this is a dark, dark book....WAY darker than \\"Goblet of Fire\\". To be honest, I don't know if I would read it to anyone under the age of 8 or so. It was great...but dark.Can't wait to see where this series goes next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't that great","review":"The book wasn't that great. Much ado about nothing. Irritating characters, predictable storyline. Ah well, it is a kid's book.At least there weren't any gruesome rituals like in book 4. I preferred the previous 4 books . There was just too much fuss made over the plot so I expected something spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Rowling!","review":"This is the fifth book in the Harry Potter series, and they just keep getting better. I don't know how she keeps coming up with new, interesting stuff. There is a lot going on in this book. A lot of changes at Hogwarts, characters doing new things. I don't want to give anything away, but there is *a lot* more action in this book. We also find out some interesting things about some of the characters... We find out more about Harry, more about James Potter, more about Snape, more about Neville. This is a long book, but I didn't want it to end, I am already hungry for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.K. Rowling Has Written A Wonder!","review":"Once again, J.K. Rowling has hit the nail on the head with this extraordinary book! With twists, turns, and a compelling plot, she keeps her readers (at least, she kept me) wanting more. I wasn't able to put the book down! When I heard that the 5th book was coming out, I was scared that she may have run out of ideas, and the fifth book may be a traditional sequel: worse than the others. However, I am glad to say that I was wrong. This book is as good, and maybe better than the other 4! I would recommend buying it even if you haven't read the other 4 books. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best it's awesome!!!","review":"I loved this book, i read it in 7 hours, even thoungh at some point it was sad, but i recommend this book for averyone, and to j.k rowling, keep doing the good work!!Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry's a whiner.","review":"Unfortunately Harry is reminding me more and more of Luke from Star Wars. \\"But I wanted to go into Toschi Station!\\" He is becoming a character I don't respect much. I also felt we got too little of Dumbledore in this installment. The book was still good though. Good enough to read in two sittings. ****/*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book, though it may be heavy, is a work of art. It was almost worth the wait, but, I'm sorry, few books would be worth 3 years. However, it was excellent. With everything Harry has to deal with in this volume, I'm surprised he doesn't burst. He has to deal with poisonous Professor Umbridge, girls, and of course, the rising of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Though his mood swings make it hard to discern at first, Harry really does get a lot stronger in this book. I would reccommend this book to anyone willing for an adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter","review":"Harry potter was a great book to read. This book is alot like the others,but J.K. Rowling knows how to make it better.This is very suspensful and brings you into the life of Harry Potter. I would reccomend this to Harry Potter fans,anyone who likes fantasy books. All the books start out slow but in the end it goes fast.This is about how Harry's life is at school the way people don't like him and think he is a liar about Voldermont coming back. Will he hold through and show that he was right or will he do something stupid?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The long awaited disappointment","review":"I was very hesitant to purchase any of the Harry Potter books. After the first one, I was hooked! I LOVED every book up until this one. 1st, its too long. This book could have been condensed to about 300 pages without losing any of the story line. It was very slow getting into, and the ending was horrible! I believe we all like the Harry Potter books for the adventures at Hogwarts, this book didn't have much of that. I really hope the movie of this book isn't as disappointing as the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I found it very depressing. Cruel in its treatment...the incident of Harry's hand being sliced open and bleeding was nasty. I wondered if Ms Rowlings had had bad experiences with teachers as she made some so vicious. I did not think the story of Harry's father tormenting SNAPE added anything to the story line. The story carried the line that Harry HAD TO learn to control his own mind yet turned him over to the worst teacher for this. Did not make sense at all. And the Centaurs, once Harry's heroes, have turned into villains.I bought copies of these HP books in the past, for family and friends. I will not buy anymore of this copy. I would not recommend it for children at all. I would not recommend it for anyone who loved the HP books in the past. Ms R. took a wrong turn somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"KILL YOUR DARLINGS","review":"There's nothing wrong with an 870 page book. There is, however, something wrong with an 870 page book in which half of it DOESN'T MOVE THE STORY ALONG. In a good book, every single word should keep the story moving. J.K. Rowling needs to learn how to KILL HER DARLINGS. This means if she has a chapter, subplot, paragraph, etc. that does not move the story along, no matter how much the author likes it, she must ELIMINATE IT. If this book was reduced to 350 pages, it would be a compelling and incredible novel. Instead, we are bored out of our minds end with things like Harry's pathetic romance with Cho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Then The 4th Book","review":"I could not wait for this book to come out, I was one of those people who waited for the book to be sold at 12:00 midnight. I enjoyed this book so much more then the 4th book. This book did not disappoint me, I enjoyed reading the adventures they went through it was a different from the other 4 books, I think it goes more to the dark side, It is still a great read.Happy Reading Lisa"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Can't Get Any Better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The 5th book in the series is BY FAR the most exciting, dangerous, and best overall book in the series and in the WORLD. The book has a Fantastic plot, with everything somehow tying into everything else. How did J.K. Rowling come up with this stuff!?!? I read the whole book in 2 days it was so good! The new characters are AWESOME, except for Professer Umbridge maybe. She gives me the creeps! How could anyone make a student use a blood quill during detention? The only gripe I have is that things are so obvious, like Harry being saved at the end and Umbridge finding out about the DA, but Harry not getting in trouble. Overall, this is the best book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. If you like the Harry Potter books, try reading the Series of Unfortunate Events."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantasygirl","review":"this harry potter book is very dark. it is interesting but it so dark and really isn't as great as the first four. It also has many pages and gives a headache.But this is a good read for someone with a taste of fantasy an darkness.the book is really good but you shouldn't read it if you don't like sad stories"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent read from J.K. Rowling and Harry!","review":"I am a middle school guidance counselor (7th grade), so I like to keep up on what my students are reading. I've read the Artemis Fowl series, The City of Ember, So You Want to be a Wizard, and, best of all, the Harry Potter series. This book is the darkest of the series, but it is still a very good read. It gives a great deal of background information about the motivation of certain characters. Of course, one of my favorite characters is killed off in this volume (sniff), but I still enjoyed it. I read the whole thing in one day, which angered my dog, and left my husband to fend for himself for dinner. But I could not put it down! Some reviewers have said that this book is boring, or that it's too long. I did get a little bogged down in some sections, but Ms. Rowling was always able to get the ball rolling again. A worthy addition to one of the best series I've come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"In this book Harry is in deep trouble,he has a hering at the ministry.His only helpers are the Order of the Pheonix,a group Sirius,Dumbledoor,and his parents used to belong to.Harry has nightmares with a door and a silent cooridor.Why else would he be waking up in the night screaming in terror?"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Our opinion is that we really enjoyed this book. In the last book, Voldemort almost killed Harry and he's looking for a new weapon to use against Harry. Now in this book Harry will get attacked outside of Hogwarts, and Harry and his best friends Ron and Hermione will help him fight Voldemort. If you want to find out the exciting events in the novel Harry Potter Year 5(Order of the Pheonix)then read this book. We would recommend this book to people ten years and up, and to people who have read the first four books.Danen and Luke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Order Of The Phoenix Does Not Disappoint!","review":"With all of the anticipation and suspense surrounding this publication, I am thrilled to say that this book did not succumb to the pressure of it all. I had a difficult time putting this one down to attend to the business of life! J.K. Rowling is my hero! Way to go! Keep them coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling has done it again!","review":"I cannot get over what a fantastic imagination Ms. Rowling has and she has proved herself as a wonderful writer once again. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the darkest and most serious book in the series, but that does not mean that it is not entertaining. The reader is taken on a ride as Harry struggles with his own fate. Each and every character develops even more in this book, especially Neville. I was pleased to learn more about Neville's character and Ginny Weasley as well. Ms. Rowling manages to make the reader feel like they ar part of the magical world and I know that I wanted to strangle Professor Umbridge just like I was a student at Hogwarts. If all you are looking for is fun and games this is not the Harry Potter book for you, but if you want to know more about what make the character's tick, this is a superb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"I've been waiting for the Order of the Phoenix ever since the 4th book hit the stores and I've been surfing the internet and reading every single rumour i could lay my eyes on, but nothing, nothing came close to the actual story. its by far the best yet, being the longest and the most long awaited for(its been 3 years since the goblet of fire was published). i dont live in the england or in the states so i couldnt get it as soon as i would (12:01am 21st june) but i went to incredible lengths to get it 2 days later and it was definitely worth it. one problem: i dont know how I'm gonna survive until the 6th book comes out and i've heard that since Rowling will be working on the third movie, which is comin out at the end of next year, we can only expect the next book by 2005. all in all, JK Rowling is definitely the best author of our time, harry potter beats every classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!","review":"The fifth installment of the Harry Potter series is definately a moodier and more thoughtful piece than its previous novels (although we notice the first signs of this darker storyline in Goblet of Fire) and comes off as possibly the most successful book in the series yet. At first I was dissapointed at Harry's new-found selfishness, then I remembered, he is a teenager! Being one myself I found his change of character and thought patterns to be very accurate, and while annoying to read at times (the books only downfall) I must give kudos to Rowling for being so correct. She has a way of making you hate other characters (hem hem, Umbridge, Malfoy, Fudge) and for building up suspense to a magnificent fight scene. It all plays like a movie in your head - scene to glorious scene. It is a long, but incredible read. I only hope it takes her less time to write book six."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good....","review":"I own all of the harry potter books, and of course, i bought this one. Order of the Phoenix was a huge let down. The story was incredibly boring in the beginning and end, and half of the events were pointless. If you like harry potter you could take your chances and buy this, but if you are just starting to read the series, read book number 2, because it is the best, and it is much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It! - especially there developing feelings","review":"I love it!I love how characters are starting to change. I found this very much in the Harry and Hermione relationship, where it is becoming somewhat ambigious in certain scenes about what they think about each other. This could set up a walloping triangle between the 3 principle characters. I also like the \\"beginning\\" rivalry between Hermione and Cho Chang. I hope that this rivalry develops even moreso in the next book.I am somewhat getting bored with all this \\"scar\\" business, so i would like J.K. to get rid of Voldemort at the end of book 6 and leave book 7 to be well open for a nice climax rivalry between Harry Potter and the evil, dreadful Draco Malfoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just As Good (If Not Better) Than the First Four!","review":"Order of the Phoenix goes deeper into the wizarding world, showing the reader places they've only heard about. Harry doesn't even arrive at Hogwart's until page 200. The death that Rowling dreaded came to me as a shock and I know it will have SERIOUS reprucussions in the next two books. The characters are changing, too. Harry's dealing with a lot of angst. ALSO, a big shocker about the character of James Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, surprising but a little long","review":"When looking at this bulky book, I wondered how all the nine and ten year olds were going to hold it while reading it. Each page was filled with an unexpected emotion or event that made me as the reader ready to turn the next page and the next. The plot was awesome however, I would have to say the third book: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban had the most awesome plot ever. I was a bit taken back by Percy's betrayal to his family. But I am glad my favorite character: Sirius, plays a very great role in this book once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Enjoyment!","review":"These tapes are in very good condition, and I listen to them a lot.

IT's too amazing!I don't want to ruin anything for you if you haven't read it so just READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very deep. Much unlike the first four. MUST READ!!!","review":"When first reading, a few things struck me. First of all, not everyone was cheerfully happy as in the other books. Real human emotions were dealt with in this book. It foreboded a story that was highly more involved than the others, a story that would delve far deeper into human intellect, into human minds, than the other Harry Potter books. And I was right. This book is definitely the most profound of its series so far. You feel the frustration, you feel the love, you feel all the emotions as they are brought to the surface in this book. This book truly moves you, and when you're done, you get the feeling that by reading it, you were made part of something profound. A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book yet: Fascinating","review":"In this book, everything comes together as we head twoards the climax of the series. Not only is Voldermort back, but so is sirius, Lupin, and Made-eye, who combine in a secret society to fight evil. While the ministry continues in darkness to conduct activities, this group called the Order of the Phoniex recognizes the undeniable fact that Lord Voldermort is back. Not only is this book fast paced, and a great sequel: it has a fascinating political scenario for the Wizarding world. Never before has fantasy been so well woven together with the regular world. A superb book for all ages, well their are some refrences to intimate parts of the body and swearing, it is always done in the most respectful and humorous way. A delightful Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you thirsting for more","review":"I got my copy [and] stayed up most of the night reading it an dI am proud to say that it did not dissapoint. The new defence against the dark arts teacher really annoyed me and at times I had to fight myself so that I didn't throw the book acrossed the room. Just as I thought that I would have to give in to my violent urges, Fred and George came to the rescue. IN The book, Harry seems to have changed quite a bit and his temper seems to run short on every occation. That taken into accout, \\"The Order of the Pheonix\\" still comes in as one of the best books of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ministry of Homeland Security at Hogwarts","review":"This is a very difficult book for me to read. While it does advance the story arc and realistically presents the 15-year-olds, the introduction of the political aspects of society too closely parallels the United States in the early 21st Century. The nightmare of the government manipulating the press and education is all too real already. Ms. Rowling does her Swiftian best holding up the mirror while remaining true to the context in which she's writing.High Inquisitor Umbridge, the microcosm's John Ashcroft, Tom Ridge, and Alberto Gonzales, frightens and appalls me. Classic Aristotelian Pathos.

This book has magical spellbining words and trumedicle dedail no matter what it is still harry potter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"I doubt my nine-year-old daughter will get a lot out of this book, but I had a great read. She thinks it's a little slow, which it is, but the story telling style is changing to be more interesting and revealing on a personal level. Harry is now older and is beginning to realize all the ambiguities of being a human being. Rowling revealed a great deal of emotion in this book instead of relying solely on plot to keep the reader involved. This made the read much more personal. The story telling is changing as Harry's maturity changes. I can't wait for the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive Reading","review":"JK Rowling has taken a lot of criticism from other authors that her books are not \\"serious works\\", are \\"badly in need of editing\\" and so on. Bollocks! They have characters that make you care, plots that are action-driven and seem to develop in complexity as the characters get older. It's not Shakespeare - but it's well written fiction. In this book Harry is angry throughout - but he has three things driving that: loneliness, fear and possession by Lord You Know Who. The people who ascribe it to adolescence haven't read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Borrow this book from your local library. The reader learns almost nothing new about the characters, except maybe for Aunt Petunia, but the plot doesn't thicken past what we learned about Harry and Lord Voldemort in the fourth book.I understand that pubescent young adults go through a rebellious stage. But couldn't Rowling have given the progatonists an identity crisis to preserve what we like about them -- rather than make all of them plain angry and obnoxious? Harry and Ron were not likable. Authors of young adult books rarely make the characters obnoxious to indicate that they are going through changes. There are other ways to imply that. Oh well. We writers learn from each other's mistakes.Sirius and Lupine were flat characters with no personality, as were ALL of the other characters. This book was not loved by the author when it was being written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for HP fans","review":"This book is a little \\"darker\\" than any of the others - more fighting between the factions. One of the other reviews complained about HP being whiny and cranky, what's the surprise? They are kids going through puberty. Don't understand the complaint about it being boring, there is something happening on almost every page. I'm just trying to figure out how long we'll have to wait for the next one and how is she going to top herself again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIT DULL AND NOT MUCH HUMOR LIKE THE OTHERS","review":"Did I read somewhere that J.K. Rowling had writers block and had a difficult time finishing this book? I just finished The Order of the Phoenix and was not all that impressed. It seems to me that her writing style changed- the \\"spark\\" just wasn't there. This book just didn't keep me captivated! I kept thinking it would get better but unfortunately it lacked the wittiness and humor of previous books. Hopefully the movie (whenever that will come out) will make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down","review":"After waiting in line to buy this book I read it straight though without sleeping. I have to say I have never been let down more by a book ever. The plot wanders all over without advancing the story line, it was as though Ms. Rowling was writing for writing sake. I am sorry that I was so excited for this book to come out. I will not bother reading any more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding but slightly predictable","review":"The book was outstanding... I couldn't put it down from the time I started reading it. How Harry evolves and matures is so true to real life. I don't want to give anything away, but there were a couple of things that were predictable.... but the rest more than made up for that. If you're a Harry Potter fan it's a must. The reviews about the book are right on... it's a little darker than the other stories. I think it's really setting the stage for the last two books. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has alot of action, probably more than any of the others. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Outstanding!","review":"I received this book Saturday morning via FedEx and immediately started reading. This book is MUCH different than the past four, feeling alot more 'dark'. I have just finished reading this book, and I must say, it definitely was worth the three year wait. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super story","review":"With plot lines twisted and convoluted as a sack of snakes, hearty battles twixt our heros and the villians, Harry, Hermione, and Ron coming of age, Order of the Phoenix comes across darker then its predecessors. From the opening volley to the final sentence, one is transported thru the inner agonizes of an emerging teenager. Not only battling the external evils of Lord Voldemort and his minions, our hero must also confront his own developing sense of self. In true adolescent fashion, Harry whipsaws the reader rapidly thru the conflicting emotions that plague youth. Truly a masterfully written missive.From the moment this book reached my eager fingers, neither it or I rested until the story ended. It was with a pang of regret that I closed the completed book for now the wait begins again for the next installment of Harry's continuing adventures.Mrs. Rawlings, Outstanding Ma'am. Truly outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of the first chapter!","review":"alright alright so I got this book on the 21st @ midnight right and while I was waiting in line I started reading the first chapter. Now I didn't get to finish it while I was in line but when i got home around 2:00am I opened the book back up and finished reading the first chapter. Guys I got to tell you. This book so far is WICKED AWESOME! It's definitely a book worth spending [item price] on. So if you haven't got it yet, go out and get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but sad.","review":"Sirius was one of my favourite characters. He was funny and really good! Why did he have to die! To make the story more interesting? Although I do like how harry gets the house eve though I hate that house.I love the Magic of Harry Potter. This Book was my favourite though. Anyway I'v always like Magic mixed with adventure. But only if this was real.This book is perfect for people who love to read! I reccomened it to everyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, but not as fun as Book 4","review":"Like all the Harry Potter books, this is extremely well-written. Rowling does an excellent job of portraying real adolescence with all its frustrations and disillusionments. However, this one wasn't nearly as fun as Goblet of Fire. There is no quiddich match, considerably less humor, and a less compelling ending. \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" is an enjoyable book, but not Rowling's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most excellent","review":"I'm not going to spoil who dies for you, but it'll come as a bit of a shock. Don't believe any stupid Internet spoilers that came out before the book was released; they're all false.The book drags in spots, and be prepared for teenage angst. However, the action scenes are great, the new characters are excellent, and Harry finally get somewhere with Cho! I stayed up until 3 AM finishing this book, and don't regret it at all.Not as good as book 4, but excellent nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is awesome","review":"I love this series and HP is the best. I actually do not like the 5th book as much as the latter two. I feel that the plot takes a long time to get to the action. It seems that it spends so much time with drama in Hogwarts and it takes a while to get to the juicy part. Great book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I reading the wrong book?","review":"From all the four and five stars that this book is getting, I can't help thinking: am I reading the wrong book?Due to loyalty to Harry Potter, I endured a lot of aggrevation and frustration in finishing this book, at many points too angry with the book to want to continue. In short, this book has no story, no mystery, and no humor. I read the first four books about five times each, but I will NEVER read book five again!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.K., where are you?","review":"I was VERY disappointed and, based upon my discussions with others, I'm not alone. I can honestly say that I didn't begin to even partially enjoy this book until the last 200 or so pages, always waiting for that UMPH. The writing seemed to have changed - less geared to children, and the tone was far more depressing, sometimes leaving me anxious. Although life in reality does have its ups and downs, Book 5 makes Harry's life seem almost suicidal.I was left with the feeling that J.K. is either bored, has lost interest, or would rather move on to other things. I still look forward to the two remaining books; but, let's hope they are more in line with the tone of the first 4 and, for goodness sakes, please give Harry some semblance of optimism!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Least of all Potter books","review":"I say I don't like this book not because of the superb story telling of JK Rowling but rather because of what's becoming of my favorite character. I've read all Potter books and I say this one is my least favorite. Harry has grown to become an arrogant brat while Ron, Hermione and the rest of the characters has retained their personality. Every 3 to 5 pages you'll come across Harry being upset and losing his temper over something non trivial. This book also dwelled more on his studies. There's really no action to this. The climax of the story is mediocre and short. A waste of pages If I must say. This won't make a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"As I read this book, I was getting upset as the things that happened to Potter continued to get worse & worse throughout the story (conflict), but as I approached the climax, and the conclusion, every moment was worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"harry potter whines in 870 pages","review":"Wow, I waited two years for this book? Poorly written, badly edited, long, boring and disjointed. Rowling has never been a friend or known a teenage boy in her life. She needs to do some research. It sounded as she did not want to write this book but was forced into doing it. It needs tightning up a great deal. The characters are flat, they run in and out of the story without any continuity. You wonder who wrote the first four this one is so bad. From Hagrid ghosting n and out with a large contrived brother that is there only for a loose end later. I could go on, but will not waste any more time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry is growing up.","review":"What more can I say that hasn't already been covered in over 3,500 reviews?!?Probably nothing. So I won't bother trying.As the owner of a popular Harry Potter fan site, Snitch Seeker, I have been awaiting this book with great anticipation for a long time - as we all have.This is a fanastic book, if not a bit wordy at times. I often found myself thinking, \\"ok move along already!\\"The good far outweighs the bad, and though this isn't the best book in the series (both 3 and 4 are better), it is certainly a worthy addition to the series and makes us look greatly forward to Book 6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"boring start, but gets better","review":"I have just finished reading 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', and I thought that the book started off slow, and until Harry got to Hogwarts, I wasn't constantly reading it, but when he gets to Hogrwarts the book starts to get really good, with their new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher being 'almost as bad as Snape', too much homework, and OWLs coming up, this is still a must read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another year, another duel","review":"J. K. rowling has an obvious formula, Harry Potter is misunderstood but sincere, under attack by evil forces, the victim of his unpleasant Muggle family, and the book climaxes with, what else, a duel to the death (someone else's death of course) with Lord Voldemort. Lots of distraction in the form of the Weasley twins' new joke store, new magic animals, and new teachers.However, it is a good read, although I found the absence of Dumbledore throughout most of the story to be strange, I think he is one of the most interesting characters. Rowling has been compared to Dickens, and although her writing is not of the same quality, she shares with Dickens the ability to write a really satisfying, loooooong book that will keep you reading for several days.Too many tricks, not enough substance, but still interesting and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charector","review":"As I have read many reviews, it disappoints me to see peoples reaction to this novel. A lot of readers have metionedd there dislike toward the change Harry's charector. If your locked up in a house with people who treat you lower than dirt for an entire month with out the slightest bit of information of what is going on with Lord Voldemort in the wizarding world, i would not be mad. I would be furious! Harry is a normal teenager who has feeling, eventually all the preassure of being Harry Potter does get to you. Additionally, in the previous year he witnessed not only the death of Cedric Diggory but the rise of Lord Voldemort. All of this had to get to him. So if the readers still did not pick this up, then truly you dont UNDERSTAND being a teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait...","review":"Book five was a MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT. I am sure any reader of this review will read the book for his/herself, but you will see what I mean. Rowling has really lost her touch somewhere in all her wealth. I am NOT looking forward to Book 6, which probably won't be out until 2007 anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A splendid book!!","review":"Harry Potter and the order of the Pheonics is a fantastic book. The only downfall of it was that it sometimes took to long to get to the point of somethings. Some people may say that this builds suspence but when it keeps happening it makes the book drag on unnesessarily. But apart from that it is a fantastic book that makes readers never want to put it down. I suggest to anyone to read the Harry Potter series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and desperately needing editing","review":"For uncritical youngsters, already immersed in the world of Harry Potter, this book continues to please.However, I found it very poorly written, with little memorable dialogue, repetitive scenes, and poorly constructed sub-plots (as pointed out by numerous other reviewers). Harry is essentially unlikeable in this book, with his constant complaining and self-pity. While that may be an important part of Ms Rowling's over-riding vision for the series, we don't need 800 pages of it!I very much hope that Ms Rowling allows an editor more input into her next attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort","review":"I felt this book could have been better edited to create a more seamless storyline; there were times I felt the prose was a bit rambly and not particularly pertinent to the story. However, I am so impressed by JK Rowling's ability to really engage all ages of readers and to have young children excited about reading the book.Harry is DEFINITELY a teenager! JK did a great job of capturing the angst and anger. Younger kids may not quite be able to relate to that aspect.Looking forward to the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter and the order of the phoenix","review":"this was very long slow but a good book. it was funny and exciting ,like all the books it very fun to read . some of the book is cinda confuseing and you have to pay attention to it . but it was good and any fan of harry potter would love it.eric parmer a 12 yr old reader"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 5 is a 4 out of 5","review":"I think Harry Potter, Order of the Phoenix was very informative, but not as exciting as Book 3 or 4. It started kind of slowly, and some of the side storylines were not that interested. However, we learned a lot about Harry's past, and he grew up a lot. I also think Hermione and Neville grew up a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I read this book in about ten hours, straight and thought it very well written but that not enough major events happened in the book.. It was more of a filler book, a link to reveal more of harry's past and a preview of what is to come with Voldemort. I enjoyed the book but thought it wasnt the best one as long as it is, not a whole lot significant happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Follow-up","review":"We've all waited a long time for this book to come out, but it was worth it. Thebook is filled with emotion. As Harry has grown into a young man, he cannot seem to control his temper. I, myself, could hardly control my temper after reading what Professor Umbridge did to Harry in detention! Even though the book is a hefty 870 pages, it is an easy read. There are intricate twists in the plot and in the character development that kept me turning pages. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was worth the wait","review":"The book was pimp with a capital P. Even though it took a long time find this book it was worth the wait. Even though it is a long book once you turn to the first page and read you will be hooked. When I was reading I could not believe that I was actually yelling at the book that I was so into it. It is like you are right with Harry the whole time. In the end you find out that ****** dies and you are awstruck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh come on....","review":"Out of the 5 Harry Potter books written so far, I definitely wouldn't say #5 is the best; personally, I feel The Goblet of Fire is the best. This is because it's the first book JK Rowling wrote that actually was descriptive and up to my reading level, at the time. The Order of the Phoenix, however, was a great disappointment compared to The Goblet of Fire. Though it was descriptive, it lacked a good plot. There was no point for the author to kill off Sirius Black -- the character had not yet been developed to his full potential. We had not yet had the opportunity to feel for the loss of the character as much as we could have if it had been one of Harry's friends who had died. It was also a sad thing that JK Rowling did with Harry & Cho Chang. The author never developed Cho's character enough for us to care if Harry ended up dating her or not. I still give the book a fair rating -- it was a good book except for those plot problems. I hope Book #6 is an improvement !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Book to Read","review":"I would really recommend Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix to any Harry Potter fan. Harry is back at Hogwarts for his 5th year, but there is a new teacher that is really mean and makes the school weird. She teaches according to th Ministry of Magic, which is different from the way the other students were previously taught. The way that J.K. Rowling writes this almost 900-page bookis very entertaining and interesting to read.She is really desccreiptive in her writing, but the book has so many pages. It also has a really sad ending. I can't wait for the next Harry Potter book to come out after reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book after a very long wait!","review":"This book is simply amazing!I was one of the many people who waited in a long line (in the pouring rain) at midnight for Order of the Phoenix! Proud to say i got the first book! And read it all in one day!It is one of the best books of the series (my favorite being Prisoner of Azkaban) and lives up to all the hype! I laughed, I yelled, I cried, but above all I enjoyed it!The first chapter gets you hooked into the world of spells, wands, wizards, elves, corrupt Ministries, loving families, moody teens, new DADA teacher, terrible potions, O.W.Ls, laughs, dementors, giants, and Harry Potter! from beginning to end this book is amazing!anyone who loves the Harry Potter series will love this next installment!it does not disappoint!we can only wait anxiously for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JK Rowling loosing her focus and her magic","review":"Three years of writing have led to a quite disappointing result:too many pages, not enough plot.In Harry's fifth year, both Voldemort and Dumbledore have chosen to take a one year leave. Voldemort forgets that he wants to seize power. Dumbledore that he should take some action to stop Voldemort.What did they do to reach these goals? If anything, it is not revealed in the fifth book.The book is not unpleasant to read, but it lacks the magic of \\"The prisoner of Azkaban\\" or \\"The goblet of fire\\", which combined a good plot with innovative spells and characters, both of which are surprisingly absent in \\"The order of the phoenix\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"i dont understand","review":"Harry potter series...stale?? getting old? the death of the character in this book wasnt major?never. get this book. read it. in fact, it deserves 10 stars and two thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After years of waiting I expected more from this book. I thought there was too much time spent on story lines that would never come to fruition, and of the 870 pages in the book everything significant seemed to happen in about the last 50 pages. The ending then came abruptly, as did the much awaited \\"significant character\\" death, to say the least. This book was, perhaps, over-anticipated and had no chance of ever meeting the expectations created in the years of waiting. I do feel this was a challenge created by the writer, herself, and she certainly did not meet it. I cannot help but be disappointed by this newest voyage into the world of Harry Potter. Until now I was able to forget that this literature was designed for children, unfortunately the immaturity of the literature, and perhaps the writer, was painfully clear. On the bright side, the wait for the next novel will be less grueling due to the low expectations I now have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Stunning Piece of Work from J.K Rowling!","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is another stunning book written by J.K Rowling. Harry now in his fifth year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry faces many challenges now that He-who-must-not-be-named (Voldemort)is back. With almost the whole not believing that Voldemort is back Harry often has times when he is anrgy which I find is the worst bit of the book. The book is very suspenseful, funny, action-packed, and fun to read. I couldn't put it down! This page turner is a must read for reader ages 8 and up! Though I adivse any reader to read the first four books before this amazing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step Up for Harry Potter","review":"All the die-hard Potter fans will enjoy the book, no doubt, but beware for a change of pace. I rather liked the change. The book reads a little differently from the others, the humor and personality that has always been a part of the Harry Potter books still present. If you did not have a problem reading Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix's 120 extra pages is no big deal. The writing style seems to appeal more to a higher age group than before, making things a little more insightful. Although it tends to be quite predictable, it still has some unusual twists, interesting discoveries, and the same air that made these books so popular. It continues the Harry Potter tradition with class. All Potter fans should enjoy it, and the book leaves the reader with the same dread and speculation the fourth book did in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but needs editing","review":"OotP is not disappointing but could use the help of an editor. It's long and drags in places; there are also a few minor errors. My biggest complaint is the death scene. J. K. feigns so many deaths throughout the book that when the \\"big one\\" comes, it's anti-climatic. In fact, the near-death scene at the middle of the book was more emotional for me.Don't expect any plot twists or much clever new material. It seems J. K. becoming bored with the story or perhaps she is too occupied now with movies, fame, kids and a husband. Having to pay the rent seemed to force more/better creativity from her!Still, I would rate the book a \\"must read.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I have loved all the Harry Potter books up until now. It wasn't until I was almost 3/4 of the way through it before anything happened-and really, not much ever did happen! The change in Harry's personality was not believable, the storyline was a stretch in many ways and the characters were very weak in this book. It was as though Ms. Rowling really didn't know where she was going with this book and just rambled along. Please, Ms. Rowling, take your time with book #6 and give your readers quality, not quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wait was too long for too little","review":"I thought that this book was well written, however was far too long and the promised climax never came. The book seemed to continue almost indefinately with very little plot or substantial story development. I was very keen to read it, and I will still read the rest of the series however I found this a very long and disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An AWESOME Book!","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best books of the series. Its so intriguing and keeps you wondering about what is going to happen next. You wont want to put the book down! There are so many surprises and new people. Youll LOVE it! And people of all ages can read it. I recommend reading the other books before it in the series because you need to know what has happened before. Once you start you just cant stop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This book was truly amazing. Rowling has stunned me again. This book had a truly amazing plot (I will not tell it because I don't want to give it away). It was truly an emotional book for Harry (and myself).The only flaw to this book was Harry's mood swings. I can understand that he is a teenager going through puberty, but my goodness he had a moody problem every 5 seconds.Otherwise, this book will stun you. From Dumbledore's big secret to the death of one of the main characters (which was really sad by the way and totally unexpected).To me this was the best book Rowling made. I do think it was really annoying it took 3 years to write this book and I hope the 6th doesn't take as long. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is growing up","review":"I have to admit, although I loved this book, Harry frustrated me the entire time! I know the purpose was to make him a typical, sullen teenager, but sometime I just didn't want to read it anymore. I was frustrated with him because he didn't even trust Dumbledore. My only other complaint was that besides the BIG things that happen - there were characters that I expected to have some evil intentions who just turned out to be nasty people. Sometimes when it seemed like there should be a great scheme there was not.In general the book was great. I think it is great how Rowlings is writing them growing up. I wish there were more with Hermione. Don't miss this book! I cannot wait for the next installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but Dark.","review":"This was a good read. I love the series but I have to agree with the negative reviews that this is not her best in the series.

We love you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disenchanting Magic","review":"For a series as stunning as the Harry Potter series, the fifth installment seems to be J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The charm of the first four novels is not evident within a boring, disenchanting first chapter. Rowling's flow seems off, and unfortunately, this was the doomsday for this book. After a long wait for this book, the first chapter wasn't worth the wait. The book isn't worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"OmG L3!K i7 R gR8","review":"This book is the best one i have read so far. I am a soldier in Iraq and it helps pass the time.

The biggest so far, having 870 pages, it blows the reader away with a superb plot and story line. It starts with suspense and imagination, but soon enough, Harry is transported back into the magical world of Hogwarts, the school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But this time, something is different. After the happenings of the last book, Harry is different, and supposedly, there is a murder out to kill him. With a fantastic climax and plot twist, I recommend this book to all avid fiction readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I had just finished the book, and it does give quite a bit of information throughout the book, especially at the end.

Order of the Phoenix has answered so many questions readers have had since the very first book- and raised many more from where those came. This tale is a delicious break away from the cookie-cutter image Harry was dangerously falling into of perfect little hero. We get to see Harry's darker side, much of which has been brought on because of his guilt over the death that occured in Goblet of Fire, Voldemorts return, and the lack of any information he is receiving from the wizard world. Rowling introduces scores of new characters, some of which play small roles now but can been forseen to play bigger ones in the future. The book takes you on a roller coaster of highs and lows- You feel this book when you read it! I don't recommend this to the younger than middle school set though- It's a bit too dark, and may be slightly too much in the comprehension level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Well Rowling never fails in her efforts! This book was just as wonderful as the other 4. I am rereading the entire set again! I look forward to number 6 also. This book seems to be a linking book for the inevitable that is to occur in the next 2 books. I am hoping her reference in part of the story leads us to hopefully believe we will see more of Harry beyond his years at Hogwarts! :-) I feel that that her style of writing as always has a purpose and not all over the place as some reviews have stated. She has defined a different world than most could imagine and keeps us up to date with that world and seems to have the insight as to how the various ages of children would react, from Ron's being mad about newby fans of his favorite Quidditch team to Harry's selfish behavior in other parts. (Don't you think by now he deserves to be a little self-centered considering all he has endured.) Anyway a wonderful read just keep them coming Ms. Rowling! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"pleeeeeeeeeez read!","review":"the reason i rated this book so low is because i think it is just to dark ! books 4&5were(i think)really dark and shifty i think some happy things need to happen like ron and hermione go out or somthing.pleeeeez dont get me wrong i likrd the book but i almost stopped reading it cuz i was tired hearing how everything went wrong with harry potters little perfect life i mean i think j.k. rowlings made him very selfish and self absorbed!same thing in book 4!"},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter the book of everyone","review":"harry potter is a wonderful book and is the best.it is about a boy called harry potter and his fifth year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizadary.it is a book worth reading for grandparents,parents and children."},{"rating":"1","title":"What crawled into Rowling brain to make her write horror?","review":"This is the most depressing book I have ever read, there are pockets of light and nothing more. It's chapter after chapter of anger, of mistreament, of cruelty...and 870 pages of sadness is more than anyone should have to endure. I do not recommend this book at all. It's tragic that after 4 extremely well written books, Rowling felt she had to follow it up with this dark piece.How this book could ever be made into a movie, I surely wouldn't pay to see it.And now I really doubt I will read 6 or 7. Why did she ruin the series by penning this angry and cruel book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"They are all here","review":"All of the amazing and interesting characters reappear in Book 5. Lupin, Sirius, and many others appear in the book and Ms Rowling shows us more about them and how they factor in Harry's life. Even fringe characters like Mrs Figg have surprizes to offer.The tempo of the book (like the others) is very fast. And the pace keeps up through the length of the book for an entertaining, can't put it down read (a long, 870 page read!).It is a great book, but dark, scary and sad. Harry's struggles in learning about himself and his place are a little tough. I found myself frustrated with Harry's frustration and anger, and trying (like the characters in the book) to be patient and understand.I had to read this book. I am now excited about the next one...Ms Rowling has again given us a thrilling and creative year at Hogwarts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"I found this to be a rather bland, boring, book. Some of it was intresting, but Harry's constant nightmares and temper tamptrums just killed it. Professor UmBridge just made me want to strangle her, that evil woman! Perhaps the worst part was Harry's crush on Cho Chang. I just found that to be sickening and repetitive. Speaking of which, here's a humorous alternate scene I've written that goes on the same theme. If anything it helps lighten it up a bit.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so poor it's unbelievable","review":"Okay so we waited forever...FOR THIS GARBAGE!. Harry was so THICK in this book even my 13 year old brother said it was garbage! I have a feeling that the book was written more for the movie than for the purpose of being a 'good reading material'. Harry was so rude, whiny and over-bearing it's unbelievable, and at the very end Dumbledore appeared to be a blabbering idiot allowing Harry is temper tantrums. There were a few bright spots in the book, Ron being prefect and NOT Harry. And the 'spark' that started in Book 4 with Ron and Hermione seems to dwindle just a little and what'swith 'weeping Cho'. Believe I have three brothers and they were never that THICK, LOUD, STUPID, RUDE or WHINY in the teen-age years!...I hope the next book is some redemption,and as for the book being dark... please someone had to die it would seem unfair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the 1st page","review":"too boring. unbelievable!!! the fourth book was boring too. the only one I really liked was the first. now harry potter is a mindless idiot. lying on a flower bed? come on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfuntioning Washing Machine!","review":"Oh duh! Harry the hero now becomes Harry the spoilt brat! And I'd compare J.K. Rowling to a malfuntioning washing machiine, because all the colours of this \\"piece of clothing\\" totally comes off! And Harry Potter thinks he's the greatest one all around, and goes sulking, screaming, and crying because he arrived two weeks late to the Order of the Phoenix HQ. He's supposed to be 15 years old, but he acts like as if he is a 15-month-old baby! He doesn't accept ANY opinion, and distrusts even his closest friend. What's he good at, besides Quidditch? Any problem, from Devil's Snare to homework, it's either Ron or Hermione! He didn't even know WHAT is magic is and now he thinks he's an expert on it. Sorry, but can someone fix the washing machine or just throw it into the dump?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Fail expectations","review":"One word sums this book up. Superb.

It is excellent, and not at all in the same \\"format\\" as the last ones. Harry is now 15 years old, and has the temper tantrums, confusions, frustrations with authority, feelings of unfairness, anger, and girl-problems of a typical 15 year old. I found myself frequently frustrated and angry (like Harry is) with the stuff that keeps happening to him-but things aren't necessarily \\"made right\\" immediately-he has to suffer. The situations he finds himself in are dark and teach very good lessons about holding one's tounge and how life is frequently not fair. There is very little focus on Quidditch and in the end they don't get into a silly little bind that seems too easy to get out of (even though you know they will.)It is really a very well written book. At times frustrating, at times funny, and full of heart and people I really feel I know. Great character development. A must-read. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who else is ordering a paper copy because Pottermore/Prime is a pain?","review":"I'm ordering a paper copy of this book for my son exclusively because ordering through Pottermore or being forced to sign up for Prime is too big of a pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"As you can tell from this title, I'm doing the review for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It's going to take a while writing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix over, and over again so, I'm just going to say HP5. Now, into the book. HP5 is about Harry, of course, and his adventures. This book gives so much information it's amazing! It is definitely challenging, but, unbelievable! In this book there is something that will blow you away! So many surprises and, you will meet the worst type of person imaginable but, I can't tell! Be ready to cry, laugh, and scream. I must tell you something that occurs in this will keep your eyes goggling! My favorite part was when Harry broke something very valuable to you know who. Too bad I can't tell you!

I finished it in less than 2 days. The plot was for an older child, perhaps a teenager. It has the Harry Potter charm and as an added bonus lets you see in to Snape's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet","review":"Wonderful, well worth the wait!! J.K.Rowling makes you really care what happens to all of the characters in her novels. She introduces new characters and makes you care and/or despise them instantly. I like that she has let Harry finally get really angry at the way people treat him, and the way that people keep him in the dark. It was good to see Dumbledore admit that maybe he should have let Harry know more about what happened in the past and why. I also like that they showed a memory of Snape with Harry's parents, and Harry's Dad didn't come off so well. It let's you understand where Snape's animosity comes from.

Well this book doesn't give you it. All this book is is description, no action. The other Harry Potter books were good, even if not great. But this book is horrible. I would never recommend this book to anyone. I'm sorry if you find this insulting, but it's the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily long and bland","review":"This book is not at all like the first one, which is very imaginative and interesting. It is very boring and felt it was unnecessarily elongated. It was too cliched and you can feel the author's fatigue all around. She does not need to make it this huge, if she can keep it precise and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved the other books. This one is terrible. I could not get through this book. It is sooo boring. I stopped at the middle of the book. The book mentions Professor Umbridge like 3000000000000 times...talk about annoying. And Harry acts like my one-year old brother when he is in a very bad mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movice","review":"Don't waste your time with the books...go see the movies. I read the first four books before the movies came out and wished I hadn't. J.K. Rowling spends an inordinate amount of time on filler material. In \\"The Goblet of Fire\\", we had to endure Ron's anger towards Harry for way too many pages. All right, he was mad. GET OVER IT! In \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\", it was Harry's anger over not being told what was going on. Again, GET OVER IT! Her books don't have to be 700 or 800 pages to tell a story. I love to read, but in this case, I prefer the movies to the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe!","review":"Just like the four that went before, this is talentless hack writing at it's very worst. A triumph of marketing spin over ability and imagination. Potter is plagiaristic, plotless, claptrap. Poor grammar and syntax just put the finishing touches to yet another Rowling volume that should never have been published. If you (and your kids) want to read something genuinely original, stimulating and beautifully written; pick up anything by Phillip Pulman (esp. His Dark Materials trilogy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite book in the series","review":"What I Loved: I loved the introduction of the new characters that will mean so much in the books to come. It was great to get more Lupin, Moody, and Sirius. Plus, this was the first book where things really got serious for everyone. The interactions between the students was a delight.Just a note: This is my favorite book in the series because it shows some real growing up by most of the characters. Harry was my least favorite in this book as I felt he was a spoiled brat---from the moment Ron got Prefect till the very end. However, I think this is a true representation of how he would be--if you were used to being the center of attention, being the best (even with good intentions), you don't like to give that up. Plus, 15 is a hard age. I think Ron and Hermoine though both grew by leaps and bounds!Who I would recommend it too: AnyoneWhy I gave it a 5: Another well written book by JK![...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good installment","review":"Having read 4 books, I of course was eager for the fifth book. This book was a definite solid installment in the Harry Potter series and was at least better than Book 6. Dolores Umbridge is a character that you simply love to hate! She was also portrayed excellently in the movie, and wow. What a memorable character!Things get intense as Harry learns more of his past (and Volcemort's past as well) and the action really heats up. This is definitely a darker book than the first - each book becomes a bit darker than the last. Given Harry's burgeoning maturity and adulthood, this feels rather appropriate, in this book, it was well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"While listening to this book, I found Harry to be very easy to relate to. In this book he is in a difficult position and his emotions are getting the best of him and I think we can all relate to that type of situation. After my father died I read these books for the first time and I found a lot of comfort from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Harry Potter Scales, Bad!","review":"If I were to rate Harry Potter 5 out of all the books, 5 being the worst, this is 5!There was really no main theme in this book like the other ones in the series. The \\"order of the phoenix\\" didn't really lead to a thrilling ending like the rest of the books.Going from Harry Potter 4 to 5 was a HUGE difference. For me, The 4th book was the absolute best, but the transition from the two books was just awful.If you're a Harry Potter fan, read this just to say you did, but you won't get much out of it! I personally hope the 6th one will be a lot better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Surprising!","review":"I have to say, first of all, that I did not enjoy the last four books. I had to put them down, pause for a month, and start reading from the beginning in order to finish it. With \\"harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\\" I read for hours on end. I'm not finished yet, but this book is difficult to put down once my neck starts to stiffen. Thus far, I've noticed rather significant changes in old characters and changes in character addition. Harry seems more like a real person now also. This book seems to leave you hanging with something on every page. I think this is really the first time I can say that I've gotten lost in a book. J.K. Rowling most likely did us a favor by taking such a long time on this story. I also think it helped that no information on the book was released before it's actual release. I am thoroughly enjoying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Winding and Almost Pointless","review":"Is JK being paid by the word? I read the first half of the book before realizing nothing had really happened and the point of the plot was no where to be found. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book but it is overly long and more on par with the quality of the first or second book and well below the gripping suspense of the 3rd and 4th books.Overall this book reminded me of a lot of middle books in three part trilogies. They are continuations of the first book but really only filler setting up the third book. This was a lot of filler with a rather lame excuse for a plot and ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rowling is losing her touch","review":"Is it just me, or do these books get increasingly filled with fluff in each successive book?I thoroughly enjoyed the first few books, even the fourth book maintained my attraction despite it's ridiculously long monologue at the end.What's the problem with this one? It's just a teenaged-fantasy soap opera for 80% of the book! NOTHING interesting happens until the very end, which in itself was short of satisfactory. I was expecting every little tidbit and subplot to make full circle (as she so cleverly did in her previous books) but nothing.I hear the 6th book makes up for this disappointment. I hope they're right, 'cuz i'm pretty close to waiting for a DVD rental of the movie. That's right! I said it! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book but moves too slow","review":"I would say that the the plot and the story is all good but it moves too slowly and there is a very little bit of voldemort only towards the end.there is a drastic change in harrys behavior and is just to fast and the book has several mistakes and must definetly be edited again but otherwise you should buy the book and its definetly worth the money and the wait.so buy it and enjoy reading it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet.","review":"I read this book in three days and I loved every minute of it. I think some people don't like it, because the tone has changed from excitement of discovering the world of wizards; to dealing with some penent up emtions, which have finally over-flowed. The tone of the book is bitterness of the situation that Harry is put in. It is a typical rebellious teen additude of feeling left out because now more than ever he feels that he can contribute to the \\"Cause\\" as an equal. Unfortunatly Harry is still treated like a kid which only angers him futher. For those that have watched Star Wars, this is the Empire Stikes Back of the series. To me Dylan Thomas the poet has said it best for the theme of this book and that is \\"Do not go gentle into that good night\\", \\"Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"potter and bureaucrats","review":"This book has harry potter battling the bureaucrats. if you think that bureaucrats don't make for interesting villians, you are absolutely right! Lacking in storyline, the author tries to fill the pages with Potter's constant yiping and gnashing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another remarkable volume - three thumbs up","review":"I thought the book was just as fantastic as the ones before and totally immersed myself in it. My only regret is of having read it too quickly, as now I am once again yearning for the next volume, which undoubtedly will be another long wait. For those who have never touched a Potter book - I HIGHLY recommend them. They are truly for any age and Rowlings writing style is one that you feel you actually are in the book and become fondly and emotionally connected with the characters. Harry Potter books take me places I could only dream and the magic of these books is something very very real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five is Alive","review":"Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is a wonderful read, full of imagination, plots, characters and emotions to satisfy anyone interested in fantasy reads. I would not call these books \\"children's fiction\\" anymore. J.K. Rowlings writes very well and I am reminded, in many ways, of Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's just put this series to bed","review":"By now we have all discovered how much this author \\"admires\\" the Lord of the Rings books. Harry and his pals are fluff characters and this series will soon go the way of Cabbage Patch Kids and Tickle Me Elmo~ initial novelties, now annoying. Read the L.O.T.R. saga. It came first and it's the best fantasy story ever. Then, read Harry's drivel, compare notes, see where admiration ends and borrowing begins, and, oh, yeah, make sure you read them from the library, don't waste good money on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not worth the wait","review":"I had very high expectations for this book, because I loved the 4 preceding it. However I think Ms. Rowling does not really know where she is headed with this series, it just gets more and more rambling. The teenage romance was cliched and derivitave. I did not want Harry to be \\"angry\\" coming into the book like I heard he would be, but it turns out it was more \\"disgrunted\\" than \\"angry\\" and of course, Mr. Potter is so politically correct, its less \\"disgrunted\\" and more \\"whining\\". Oh well...hopefully book 6 will be better :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I'm exhausted after two days of reading (and not sleeping), but it The Order of the Phoenix is well worth it!

When does Book 6 come out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"The product I bought from amazon was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and it is in great condition it looks like I just bought it right off the bookshelf at a book store. I am very pleased with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Word above Fantastic","review":"I love ALL the Harry Potter books, and I am \\"older than the suggested age level\\" for reading this book! It truly is a book series of the century. These books will last and be popular for a very long time. Every book is unique and filled with adventure and love and war. These books draw on ancient mythology and Latin and Roman roots, which makes them all the better for people like me who love learning about the ancients!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got my hopes up...","review":"...but I was very disapointed when I finally got to read the book. I have loved all of the other books in the series. The fifth one just lost its touch. In the begining Harry was totaly miserable. In the middle Harry was totaly misreble. In the end Harry was totaly misreble. There was no style just Harry not knowing what was going on. JKR should have made him at least match the personality that he was at the end of the fourth book. At the end of the fourth book it was like he was getting ready for some huge battle and then in the fifth book all he did was sit around and get tortured by some teacher"},{"rating":"2","title":"the magics still runnin","review":"Okay, okay, it may have taken 3 years, but this ones woth the wait. This book is just amazing. As each of the 3 books seemed to be unique, and the 4th was kinda linked alot with the 2nd, i was wonderin what this one would be like. Turns out this one was like a summary of all the previous ones. It had all the old charactors(Harry, Ron, Hermione, of course, and also Cho, Sirius, all of the weaslys), a couple of returns like with Lupin and Moody, and tons of new important charactors. The story is your classic HP story, mixed in with the stress of being 15 years old. This book has romance(boring)and fights and, of course, plenty of secrets and clues, and action. It seems now that their struggling with OWL's, the Ministry, Voldermort, and, for the first time, with each other, meaning all of the hogwarts students and the members of the Order of the Pheonix. I'm not going to say to much, but its a sad ending but with alot of answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Order of the Phoenix","review":"The Order of the Phoenix (Book number five in the Harry Potter series) is 766 pages long, a third longer than the Goblet of Fire. Nonetheless, it only took me a day to read it in because I simply could not put it down. This book takes a darker tone than the last four, with Harry realising that sometimes those adults who he thought unbreakable can make mistakes. As the whole world seems to be turning on him, we see a surlier and more angry side to his character, showing his progression from boy into adulthood. Although the plot encompasses many more themes than the others, it still keeps your attention. The story takes a truly heart-wrenching turn towayrds the end, and I would recommend anyone reading it to keep a box of tissues handy. I was scared this book would be a dissapointment because of all the pressure J.K.Rowling faced in writing it, but she has once again come thorugh. A brilliant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"they just keep getting better and better!","review":"I must admit this isn't my favorite book in the series, but it was full with as much magic as the last four books.This book in the series has a lot more sensitive issues and darker meanings. Especially with the return of Lord Voldemort.But, still, it will entrance readers and they will not put it down till they're at the final 870th page, just like me and the rest of the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Harry Potter yet!","review":"This book is great. It shows that young adolescents always face the troubles of increasing age. When Harry finds that Voldemort can see into his mind and that Harry can be in Voldemort's mind, things start changing. Then there's that thing about love. Will Harry ever get kissed or get a girlfriend? Maybe but who knows? There are many surprises in this book and you'd be a fool not to pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry is a little too angry.","review":"I waited (like everyone else) for what seemed like ever for this one. I was a little disappointed with Harry's rage. In many respects, it is to be expected (he's had a hard life and he is a teenager) but part of what makes Harry so endearing is that he is still such a great, sweet and likeable kid in spite of everything he has gone through. I know that all is not well in the wizarding world, but part of me wants to feel good at some point during the book. That being said, I think that Rowling once again demonstrates the ability to keep readers enthralled and craving more (at least I am). Not the best of the series, but given the build up and the wait, it was probably next to impossible to live up to everyones expectations. I am still axiously awaiting number 6!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read but not her best.","review":"When I picked up this book I was extremely excited thinking it would be very good. But I was shocked 2 find it actually more defining and explaining and even settings after the action packed 4th book. I noticed through out the book they repeatedly made references 2 the other books. The plot though extremely good towards the end, appeared 2 be more based on explaining all these things that have already happened. I'm now more anxious 4 the next book bcoz compared 2 the others this seemed well less mysterious and more of a recap of what has happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written!!! A must Read!:)","review":"Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix, is my favourite book from Rowling's Harry Potter series. And is worth all 5 stars.I love how Harry Potter is finally protrayed as teenager..moody, angry, confused. I like how Rowling showed the other side of Harry. Finally in this novel, Dumbledore explains all, everything comes together. Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Harry all team up together to fight at the end, and that is my favourite part. So much happened in this novel. Ron becomes Keeper, they have O.W.LS to write, Harry is having horrible dreams, and feelings, he's facing the threat of expulsion, the new Defense against the arts Teacher tests everyone's limits, and so much more!! Rowling, is an incredible writter and it shows in this novel, it is worth every penny!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the five Harry Potter books","review":"This is the best of the five harry potter books. Some people may think that it is too long. But it is so intersting and entertaining that it doesnt take long to read because you cant put it down. I dont really like to read but this book made me want to read it. I like that there was alot of adventure and alot of action. Some books that are that long dont have alot of adventure or action but this book has action and adventure though out the entire book. From start to finish. J.K. Rowling has such a big imagination. I dont know where she comes up with all of it. She is a very great and intersting writer and I hope to see more Harry Potter books soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Harry Potter Book!","review":"The fifth book in the Harry Potter book is as good as the previous four, if not better. Without givig too much away, I will say that many of the unanswered questions you may have had are answered in this book. You must read it...it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me back....","review":"This book was incredible. It made me feel like I was a angsty and emotional teenager again. It also took me back to when dealing with girls was confusing and talking to a girl was almost impossible. The plot and storyline was straightforward and I have never read a book that made me change ages like that. I don't want to give a longer review because I would hate to give away plot, but it was worth reading to me. It brings out new facts about Snape, James and Lily Potter, and the rest of the crew that is close to Harry.I couldn't put it down from the time I purchased it to the time I laid it down completed. It was great. Now I just have to wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The spirit of Harry Potter","review":"Harry Potter, the biggest book in America. I too have been caught in the Harry Potter craze. Having read all of the books, in order, several times, I found that J.K Rowling creates a rhythm between the books, so that you feel like you are a part of Harry's life. However, I thought the flow of Harry's life was disturbed in the fifth book. Harry has been at Hogwarts for four years know. Now, in his fifth year, we meet new characters that we have never even heard of before. I felt that there were so many other characters that Rowling could have developed instead of inventing new ones. The readers have almost no information about Padma Pattil; however, we have seen her before; same story with Semes Finnagin. Perhaps her reasoning will be revealed in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"What a disappointment this book is. Halfway through the book I was still waiting for it to pickup and get moving a little faster...my 9 year old even commented that J. Rowling has lost her touch (BORING!). The new characters are good, but it seems that the storyline is lost in the same thing throughout. Nothing special here. I guess we'll stick with the new Lemony Snickett book coming out next month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst One Yet","review":"This is the worst Harry Potter Yet. It is boring and does not hold to what the standards of the last Potter Books were at...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic is still there!","review":"The Order of the Phoenix is a wonderful continuation of the Harry Potter series. When it seemed that Ms. Rowlings was continuously fine-tuning the book, I feared that it would lose its magic. Fortunately, this was not the case. The book is a bit darker and more brooding as befits a 15/16 year old Harry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful addition to the series.","review":"I was pleased with this book. There are some wonderful twists. As usual, Rowling's writing is such that it is interesting and easy to follow. Rowling furthers the plot, while ending the book in the usual tidy fashion, leaving the reading only with the quetion of \\"Well, what is going to happen next?\\" Even though her longest to date in the series, the book was so good it went by in just under a day. It captivated me. I leaves me wanting for book 6. Obviously, it's a must have for those following the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"This book was more exciting than the other four, but Harry was getting annoying, being mad at everyone all of the time. Over all, this is a very good book. I'm probably going to read it several more times, like I have with the others. Eventually, I want to get the French version, but it hasn't come out yet..."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good start for the next two books","review":"Althought my favorite book is the harry potter and goblet of fire, I found that this book have a lot of information that I guess would be useful in the following two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still magical but not top of the heap","review":"Long awaited and maybe that was part of the problem, no book could have lived up to the hopes and dreams of waiting for 2 plus years. It was an easy read for a book of such girth and I did enjoy the fact that we learned more about the magical world like the ministry,The Black family tree and Harry's background. I not only read the hard cover but also listened to the audio and I could never give Jim Dale enough praise. He does an excellent job - makes you feel like instead of one person reading that an entire cast is in the room. I will of course be awaiting entry number 6 but I hope the wait is quite as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"This is a great and thrilling book. It might get a little slow for some young readers in the middle but otherwise it's just great. You just can't put it down! J.K Rowling does it yet again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Confusing","review":"This book is full of angst and depression, not nearly as good as I thought it would be and definitly my worst favorite of the series. In the beginning, it will be confusing and hard to understand but you gain understanding as the chapters go by. It difinitly gives you a taste of the darker side of life.Harry's personality gets a change after someone close to Harry, REALLY CLOSE, dies trying to protect him. If you don't mind all of this, I'm sure it would be a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"I have read all five of the harry potter book and I have even read the first four to my little sister. However the book seem to be getting worse as they go. The order of the phoenix is the worst of the five. Nothing exciting happened during the first 500 hundred pages or so. They could have made this book half as long and it would have been twice as good. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you have read the other four and want to keep up with the books then I would read it, but there are a lot better books to read for your summer reading. If you do not have lots of time on your hand and your not 14 or under don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"?????","review":"I think the book was awesome. everything fit together perfectly but the end was horrible. Harry has been through so much already and cant go through the death of the only person he had left. The only person that has been like a father to him and i dont think that he should have died!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished In One Sitting","review":"How could anyone not LOVE this book?? If I've learned anything, JK Rowling is a stickler for detail. I don't think anything that happened in this book was insignificant so it HAD to be as long as it was. And if the ending wasn't a surprise it was because people sold it and read it before the release date!!! I couldn't have been more angry that those people tried to spoil it for the rest of us. Anyways, Harry is growing up and he's going through the same pains the typical teenager goes through - no one understands, angry at adults, trying to figure out the opposite sex. And the plot thickens. ^_^ When does the next one come out??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet!","review":"This is the best Harry Potter book yet. (It's also the darkest but I've been reading The Demonwars, Shadowdale and stuff like that and so I'm used to it.) I only give it four stars because of the character death. I don't have to say anything about the plot or anything because everyone else has! (And to the person who gave it a one and said if you want a cheerful, enchanting fantasy novel read the Discworld books instead of Narnia. They make me laugh!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling does it again!","review":"Brilliant. She's brilliant. Of course, she did take about THREE YEARS to finish the book...but we still love her anyway. Who couldn't? She's provided us with more wonderful words to read about our dear Harry--and this book is perfect. I couldn't ask for more. I got it at 11-o-clock Saturday night and got lost in it--I couldn't put it down! The book was also surprising...I would've never expected \\"The Death\\" that was supposed to occur...and found myself suddenly not surprised as to why she cried while writing it. Vividly written, and it now seems to cross the line of children's literature and into great classics. But it's always been one of those. I also enjoyed how real-seeming it truly was--from the perfect descriptions to Harry's new attitude. All-in-all, the book was wonderful. I can't wait for the 6th, so hurry up Mrs. Rowling!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HARRY RULES!!!!","review":"I have three favorite books I've read in my short teen life.

They just keep getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is as awesome as the rest. I got it and from the moment I started I was hooked on the familiar excitement and magic. I would recommend this book to any seasoned harry potter veteran or to a newbie to the business. If you are new you should read the first 4 books first. All I can say is wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth waiting for.","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a wonderful book, fans will not be disappointed. This book is crammed full of more people, places and events than the previous four, but it can be read without confusion. Many new characters; the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher will have readers clenching and shaking their fists, but she is very well written as are the other new additions to the Potter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a turning point in the series","review":"This book really demonstrates a fantastic feat of writing by Rowlings - each book seems to be written for an audience the same age as Harry is in the book. The first one was perfect for 11 year olds, and this one is definitely a teenager's book. Harry is taking more control over his life, asking more questions and being more critical. He got a lot of answers in this book, to questions we have been asking since book one, so in some ways there isn't as much to wonder about as there was when I finished the last book. But, this one left us ready for a real showdown in the next two books - the fate of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whiplash from wrapping the whole book up in 4 chapters","review":"I love these books! Rowling does quite a good job developing characters with her writing style. And her writing style and vivid imagery is why I keep going back and while I'll eagerly await the next bookHOWEVER, with 150 of 870 pages left to read, I started wonder how she was going to wrap things up that quickly when she hadn't even presented the real crux of the conflict yet. I braced myself for the let-down to come. Did she just get tired of writing it? Was the publisher impatient for her to be done? Did they just truncate at the page count for marketing considerations? If that was the case, they could have done with less \\"Harry waits for news\\" at the begining and more meat at the end.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book from Rowling","review":"Unlike some authors, Rowling keeps the uniqueness of this series throughout all of her books. None of the charm of Harry Potter has been lost.The overall plot of the Harry Potter series begins to make more sense, and a fairly important character even dies.This book would make a great gift. I've been reading the series since I heard about it before it became very popular. Even in fourth grade, I loved the first one. Now I am in ninth grade and I still enjoy these books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book yet","review":"I really enjoyed this book - I thought it was definitely the best one yet. There were many things in the earlier books that annoyed me (like everyone always muttering and gritting their teeth), but these annoyances either weren't there as much or I didn't notice them as much this time because this book is much better-written than the past ones. There are very few fiction authors that I enjoy - I am mostly a Stephen King fan - but Rowling's mix of good old-fashioned story telling, suspense, and humor have definitely won me over. One word of caution, though, this is NOT a childrens book. The first one may have been, but successive volumes have become more and more adult. Perhaps a good guideline would be that the reader's age match Harry's age in each book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"I think this is one of the best books I've ever read. It's like a whole new world opens up to me when I start to read this book. As for the rest of her books (Harry Potter 1-4) those were also great. It's like a world of magic. Unbelieveable things that you just wish could be true, you want it to be true. She is an unbelieveable writer, one of the best out there! Great book! Highly recommended.As for the best who said \\"This is a bad bad book. It teaches not to respect government or your parents\\" I think you don't know what you are talking about, and you should not even be posting things like that. How can it teach us now to respect our parents? It's just a book for one, and another thing! his parents are dead, and his aunt and uncle don't treat him right. It teaches you about child abuse more like it, and that' it's VERY WRONG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"What can I say? I'm not a Potter fanitic! I read all the books, but they're just not ...there. It's predictable, Harry wins evil looses. I loved George and Fred, they're so funny, and cute in the movies too. I think this is the best of Harry Potter yet! It's funny, but seious. It's not all happy go lucky, but enough happy. It's great how nothing is over-done. I finished it in one day, yup, 800 something pages.In conclusion, this book is sillier as in funnier than the rest, you would want to read it!Good Luck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a disappointing word","review":"Yes, I am one of those crazy Harry Potter fans who actually turned out at Borders for the midnight release of this book. I like to think I did so because my brother couldn't wait until Saturday to begin reading it, but if I'm honest, I did it because I couldn't wait until Saturday morning to begin.And I haven't been disappointed. If you were worried that this book might not live up to the great tradition and quality of the previous four, don't worry about that--there is not a moment of disappointment. If anything, Rowling's writing has grown even more clever, with hints throughout the book of unexpected things that a careful reader might notice even before Harry does. I'd give it ten stars instead of five, but alas, the rating system doesn't go that high."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Addition To The Harry Potter Books","review":"This is the best Harry Potter book yet! I thought it was better than Half Blood Prince because it had more of the formula that makes the series so good. The battle at the end was my favorite and the humor gave light to otherwise dark situations throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Jim Dale is now in the Guneess Book of World Records for recording over 134 disctinct and different voices for the reading of a single book! He almost \\"acts out\\" this book for the listener. Great to involve younger children who cannot reaad at this level yet, or for those w/ limited vision. Also good for long car trips to keep all occupants mesmerized."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I had already read and loved all of the Potter books but I was missing this one. I now have the complete set and will probably reread them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent audio-book!","review":"The audio book is truly excellent. I strongly recomend it, not only to youths. The CD is a full version of the book. It's performed by Jim Dale, who does an excellent job so that it's hard to believe that there's only one actor.MK"},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient and fast","review":"This product was in perfect condition with a really low price. I also received it within a few days of ordering. This company is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling Does it Again!!!!!","review":"Another fabulous read of Rowling, I can't wait to see where she goes with the rest of the series. My fear was that the books might get worse, but there's no danger of that, she just gets better and better!!! Go get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant!!! Great Villain!!","review":"Excellant Story With a terrific Villain in D. Umbridge. The whole girl trouble thing got a little annoying. I mean, Harry was ok, if not a bit of a baby, but this broad he is fawning over is annoying......The ending of this book was a little anti-climactic, but all in all - a very good book!The death in the Goblet of Fire was much more gut-wrenching than this book's death...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I really like the way Harry is beginning to mature in the 5th book of the series. Rowling has done it again. She also does a great job with the death of one of the \\"main characters\\" and Dumbledorf's revelation to Harry of his prophecy. Looking forward to Book 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed after such a long wait.","review":"I am twelve and have read all the books cover to cover. It took me until today to finish this very long and somewhat boring book. Harry has become nasty and the other characters are not much better. I have seen a lot of the sentences in other books, and the magic has left both the plot and the writing. I think Mrs Rowling should make the next book shorter and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest (and most boring) of the series","review":"Hey, I'm no Harry Potter maniac, but I really dig reading the books when they come out. They are so much fun! I've read several of them more than two or three times. It's been a satisfying series.Until book 5.Five HUNDRED pages of nothing happening. Five hundred.I don't care if Harry became kind of jerky. He's a teenager. It's only appropriate. That wasn't my problem with this book.The previous books have been action packed, funny, and interesting. This book just drags and drags, and it actually becomes painful to read at some parts.My only hope is that it was an inevitable bridge to the next, more interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"This book was good except I don't feel that it lived up to all the other four books. It does have a good and gripping plot, but it didn't seem to be as dark as the other ones. The real adventure of the book didn't really start until nearly the end as they had to find someone important (I won't say who) to rescue. Other than that, the book had it's interesting and funny parts. The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher had her interesting and funny parts at the end of the book when you find out what happens to the teacher.The book was pretty much centering around Harry's anger and his problems but it was nonetheless a good book. J.K. Rowling should have had the book edited a little before it was released because some parts of the book don't make any sense whatsoever. But it was a real good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Order of the Phoneix\\" Continuesthe Wonder","review":"I felt that this book continued the delight of the Harry Potter series, in addition to introducing several new plot twists. The beginning of Harry's troublesome teenage years, dealing with girls and dating, as well as new feelings of rebellion, was handled with class. I thoroughly enjoyed this new book of J. K. Rowling, and recommend it to all Harry Potter fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"J.K. Rowling has done it again, and the Harry Potter series has evolved brilliantly. Anyone who has raised a teenager will recognize the moodiness Harry displays throughout. He is growing up, and finding that it is not so easy. The book may have started a bit slow, but it picked up steam nicely and answered many questions. I look forward to the next book and hope to learn more about Harry's parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"when's the sixth one coming out?","review":"Order of the Phoenix is a good read; nothing more nothing less. Some people complain that it is just too long. I would tend to agree. One of my more disgruntled friends put it eloquently \\"Just split it into two chapters: Harry is angry and Dumbledore is weird\\"Although I agree that many repetitive parts about Harry's teenage angst could have been slashed, I still feel that this did not spoil the book simply because of Rowling's skill. Her smoothly flowing storylines and a steady supply of wisecracks (the Weasly twins) are what prop this story up and prevent it from becoming a tedious bore. In fact, I found fault with the Harry Potter movies because the script cut so much of the humour that is inseperably part of the books' lure.The best part of the book in my opinion is that it finally reveals the secrets that have we have been pining for since Book 1. So I wouldn't mind the next one being equally long as long as Rowling can tell us a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoeix is number five out of a seven book series. What I don't like adout this book was that the begining was so long. What I also did'nt like that Harry was exspelled just because he cast a spell to help his cosin witch he dosen't like. What I liked about this book was that Harry left his aunt and uncle even thought he was exspelled from Hogworts. I also liked that Harry got to see his friends this year. This is what I like and dislike."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"How can I possibly wait for the next book??? I hope it is not 3 years.This adventure was rich and wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disapointing, but still good","review":"...I had been waiting for this book since the end of the forth grade. When it finally came out, I was so glad. I read it and thought, 'this book isn't all it's cracked up to be' it was still good though. If I could rate the books in order, they would be Goblet of Fire, Order of the Pheonix, Scorcerer's stone, Chamber of Secrets, and Prisoner of Azkaban."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIP-HOP-HAPPENING","review":"Its GREAT!! Trust me, the book is really good. No doubt that its a bit long, but C'MON GUYS! Its not a comic which you expect to finish in a span of 3-4 days. Rowling has really POURED her heart into it. It is filled with surprising new characters and twists'n'turns. You just cant put it down. I think that you should go for it. AND YOU NEED NOT BE A HARD CORE POTTER FAN FOR READING IT!!ENJOY N ENCORE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was certainly...interesting","review":"Upon reading this book I felt quite ambiguous. On one hand I found the majority of it very cleverly written and certainly worthy of J.K. On the other hand, there were parts, and I stress only _some_, that I found to be badly done. Simple words, sentances, that weren't exactly flowing and showed clearly the stress that she was under to create another masterpiece. I didn't love it, I didn't hate it. I simply liked it very much. And I will still be hanging around to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"This book is by far the greatest book that I have ever read. Harry still goes through his usual conflicts with his aunt and uncle, but fortunitely he does not stay at their home for the entire summer. Harry has even more problems to cope with in this book than any of the others, especially since most of the students at Hogwarts beleive him to be some stupid, lying, show-off. He goes through a lot of pain in the book, ending up losing one of the people that he cares for most. This entrancing book really keeps the reader's interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmmm...unsure","review":"I have to admit that I loved this book. It's just...some things didn't really seem to gell. Prof. Umbridge, for example. She's just too horrible and the ministry is too. And occlumency. Why doesn't Harry try a bit harder? And the way he is so moody. I suppose it's just adolescance and all, but it seems a bit sudden. Before he had more passive opinion, but now he shouts it for the world. Harry Potter has grown up in the short gap of about a month between the 4th and 5th books. Perhaps it's puberty, come about 3 years too late? I have to admit, it seemed a bit odd that he seemed exempt from most of the normal things that happen to a growing boy... except for Cho, of course. God I hate her! Die, Cho! I hate her even more than Umbridge.Overall, this book was a bit odd, but a great read. Except... what's with the american covers? If you're going to buy a copy, get the Australian one. It's so much more tasteful, and accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but worth it!!","review":"The book paints a glowing picture of the suspense the final 2 novels will hold. It ties up a lot of loose ends from the previous books and sets the stage for the grand finale to come. Introduces several new characters who seem they will play key roles in the future. Looking forward to it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I am an adult fan of Harry Potter. Loved the first four books and anticipated the release of this book. I was very very disapointed. It was like someone had written this book trying to \\"copy cat\\" Miss Rowling but just didn't get her specialties down. Very disapointed that she killed off one of the main characters also. But I am reminded that Harry Potter is HER creation and she can do with how she wants, but I feel like that I, the die hard fan, got...with this book and the story just didn't go at all the way I had hoped. The first part of the book my thoughts were, \\"she's turned Harry into a whining little brat.\\" I realize he's in his teenage years but sheez give it a rest. He levels out a bit more later in the book. Again, I just feel like I...off, although I am still a Harry Potter fan and will look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best So Far","review":"After having watched the first two movies, I decided to read the books.

It was exciting to see Lupin and the rest of the \\"old\\" crowd back.This book was my favorite book in the the series because of the more mature and darker storyline and it didn't hurt that Im fifteen. Great book but don't make us wait so long for the next one. P.S sorry if there are any spelly errors"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best of the Five, but Still a Great Book","review":"J.K. Rowling has done it again. Order of the Phoenix was a highly enjoyable book full of ups and downs and could match any soap opera for the amount of drama it contained. Though I wouldn't necessarily say that the fifth book was the best of the five...It was still a great book that I would highly recommend to anyone. The series has been full of adventure and while this book certainly has it...it seems a bit more subdued. I can't see this one being a movie as it seems much more of a drama than the action packed plots of the previous four books. If you're a Harry Potter fan you will definitely enjoy Order of the Phoenix. IF you're new to the series you will definitely need to start with Book 1 as each book builds off of the previous volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite disappointing","review":"I would expect more from this book. However, the book seemed to fall into the pattern of good guy being repressed and misunderstood, the authority being ignorant, and the bad guy gradually gains his power, too typical a soap opera. By breaking the reader's heart to cover the lack of inspiration the writer used to have. I used to read into lines in previous books, since there is too much fun to skip. This highly anticipated book only took me little time to finish since i kept skipping boring details."},{"rating":"1","title":"we waited for this?","review":"We've been waiting nearly three years for this installment of the Harry Potter series and, after reading all 870 pages, it hardly felt worth the wait. For instead of the fun, magical world that Rowling has given to us in previous books, this one feels stale and lacks the fluidity of it's predecessors. It is entirely too long and could have easily been trimmed to keep the pace livelier and entertaining. It does drag in places and hardly feels like the Scooby-gang mysteries the other books have treated us to. Bring back the magic J.K.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"We all looked forward to the latest Harry Potter installment, but I felt it was very disappointing. There was NO cohesive plot, just a lot of babble. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did (at least not until the end!). What I love about reading, that feeling of being on the edge and not being able to wait to turn the next page to see what happens, just never happened with this book. Harry was surly, rude and disrespectful to everyone, even his friends. If I had not wanted to know who died, I would probably not even have finished this book. I also feel that this book was written strictly toward being a quick, cheap movie that will put more $$$ into JK Rowlings already over-flowing pockets. The death of what I consider to be a minor player was not worth the hype we've endured for so long. Over all, this was a very disappointing book and I hope JK Rowling forgets about her pocketbook and goes back to writing great fiction for our kids and ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, tedious and too conflicted","review":"Book V was disappointing. I read it page to page. It seems like the author wanted to show the turbulent world of the adolescent but there seemed no end to the upheavals and barriers that they faced. Harry was always angry, Hagrid was always hurt, and everyone else was chained to uncertainty. The book did not give the message of hope like the others did. It was too long, the kids did not learn too many new things considering they were in the fifth year and Dumbledore's behavior was illogical and out of character. It left me feeling disappointed and unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"we waited for this?","review":"Very disappointing. JK Rowling has done much better work but after finishing this I feel as if she wrote it just to make a quick buck or satisfy a contractual obligation. Shallow plot and pithy use of language do not make a book. Maybe once she realizes this she can return to the magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This was the worst one yet. I was really looking forward to getting this book and it was a big let down. The important stuff wasn't explained in detail but all of the trivial stuff was. What's up with that? I could care less about half the stuff she drags on and on about. It almost seemed like she was just trying to make the book longer. The ending was good but not very well explained.Good luck staying interested in this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that all about?","review":"The plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese...two of the best characters (Hagrid & Dumbledore) were hardly seen or heard from...the \\"reveal\\" at the end didn't explain anything...I'm just hoping this volume is a \\"transition\\" to provoke questions that will be answered in 6 & 7...otherwise, this book is simply \\"The Goonies\\" meets \\"The Craft.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Dissapointment","review":"When I heard the title of the new book, I was looking forward to it. After seeing the size of the book, I was eager to get my eyes through it. This book was the biggest dissapointment so far :( It was pointless! We learn that Harry's going to kill Voldemort if he doesn't kill Harry first. SO WHAT?! That's a GIVEN is it not?! How dare she write such a long, pointless book. And what was it with Cho and Sirius?! Surely she could have written a lot better. Her best book was Prisoner of Azkaban. Her worst was this. If you're a big fan of Harry Potter, go ahead and read this .... Otherwise, don't bother. It doesn't get you anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not seem to be for kids anymore, but good for Adults","review":"When I read \\"The Goblet of Fire (Book 4)\\" I felt that the themes were becoming more mature. Perhaps as Harry matured the themes do too? Book 5 seems to follow this trend. The book has taken on an even more mature theme dealing with aspects such as death, anger, frustration, changes and unpleasantness. I enjoyed it but it felt dark and serious most of the time. I would be hesitant to give this book to a child under 14 to read, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. As an adult reader I would give it 5 stars however."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yet","review":"this is seriously the best harry potter in the series yet. i dont get why people complain about the charchters not being realistic. most teens act like that and its more realistic than the first. i dont know how good of a book for an 10 year old this is as to get more of the points and emotions you have to either be 15 or already been 15. 11 and 12 yearolds might not get it as much. i read this book in the first day i got it, starting at 6pm and not stopping until i finsished which was about 13 hrs later. it justs pulls you in. one of the reasons this book is so great is that you feel basically every emotion while reading it. there were places were i cried, places where i got so embaressed, places where i was mad and places where i was happy. you could go from being sad to laughing and vice versa. i really recomend this book. there are only two series of books that i even care about and thats harry potter and the vampire chronicles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly disappointed!","review":"Wow, what a complete let down. Apparently, JK is too busy with other things (spending money?) to put out any quality with this book. Not like she didn't have time or anything to think of a good story. The \\"multi-plot\\" is sketchy and weak, our favorite characters (good and bad) are defaced. The unbelievable Umbridge is such a stretch, it was a complete joke. The book is frustrating and angry and completely negative. There is such a lack of imagination. Although we were all waiting for Harry's teenage years to kick in, he was never so disrespectful & angry & sour--or so stupid. Even Voldemort was lame and lifeless. It wasn't scary or dark, it was poorly written. All of the magic is gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not the best of the series","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. I like the older Harry, watching him deal with things like a real teen and getting cranky and emotional. This book was very dark, which I knew about beforehand. As with all the books (in my opinion) all of the real action happens at the end, after slowly building up to the major plot points, the reader is finally satisfied in the last few chapters. I can't wait to read number 6!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They keep getting better!","review":"I received it and read it in 2 days. It was amazing! From the first pages it keeps you in suspense and pushes you on to read more. It's very hard to put down. The main characters are developed further and the adventures are more intense than ever before. Rowling does another excellent job sucking you into Harry's world and keeping you interested from page 1 to page 870! Wonderful read! Can't wait for #6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still awesome, but...","review":"Order of the Phoenix keeps up the excellent standard previously set by Rowling. Read it in two sittings, couldn't put it down. That said, I have one minor complaint...why has Harry turned into such a self-centered, sniveling, whining little crybaby? In this book he is constantly whining and complaining and feeling sorry for himself and it gets kind of old...shouldn't he be maturing as he gets older? Shouldn't all his previous experiences have helped him to be less selfish and less apt to complain as he gains more perspective each year? Why the sudden regression? I hope she fixes this with the next book. Two straight books full of Harry's whining new personality will begin to really annoy me. But other than that I still loved the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best.. but still amazing","review":"The Harry Potter series is my favorite. I am so obsessed with them. When i finished this book i was very disappointed. I loved and I am rereading it right now. but I didn't think it was anywhere as good as the others. Harry just doesn't seem as happy and so i become unhappy. There is a new teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who is trying to get rid of the all the teachers and make the school what the minisry wants not Dumbledore.Overall, this book had many good parts and many bad parts. This interview may sound like I hated it. But I don't I was just dissappointed. I guess it didn't reach my expectations. I'm rereading the book now so i guess that I just had to get used to it because I am liking it more the second time. I can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps getting better!","review":"The story is more complicated, the characters have more to deal with and the action, twists and turns never stop. Just like being a 15 year old. It was impressive to see the writing continue to grow up with the characters while still maintaining the same spirit of the previous 4 books. I cheated and bought the book on CD over the weekend and plowed through it on a long trip. Now I'm going back and actually reading it. A full and satisfying experience from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book, even though it was \\"darker\\" .","review":"When I first read this book, I, too, thought that Harry was angry and sullen too much of the time. But after reading the first 4 books again and then re-reading the 5th, I realized that JK Rowling had captured the personality of an adolescent boy who had gone through a traumatic time witnessing the death of a school mate. (Anger is a stage of grieve as well as PTSD.) Add to that the changing emotions of adolescent and what do you get? Harry Potter in the 5th book. I enjoyed \\"hating\\" the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I also enjoyed how Harry's friends stayed by his side throughout the book and especially at the end. Can't wait for #6!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed in Dallas (4.5 stars)","review":"I'm somewhat disappointed in book #5. I like the plot(s) and the characters and the ending, but the book has too much...\\"filler\\"? in it. This book should have been 500 pages long, and it would have been a classic. As it is, it's a good book that has too much \\"filler\\" in it.Yes, I'd read it again, but it was NOT a book I couldn't put down. The \\"filler\\" material made it slower than her first 3 and reminded me of #4. The ending is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone else felt it was a waste??","review":"Hi I could not wait for book number five and stood in line from 8 pm till midnight to purchase the book and finished reading it in a mere 4 days and what a rip off it was!!

It is the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX after all!","review":"At 3,800 chapters and 255,000,000 words (many of them not even in any earthly tongue!) everyone said this book was too long. Well, I say it's not LONG ENOUGH! I was enraptured by the ten-page description of the various license plates on Privet Drive. I wanted to know MORE about Malfoy's dental records! Why, for example, did he not have that wisdom tooth taken out? Couldn't he have done so with his magical powers? These are delicious details readers are simply clamoring for! To those who say the book's too lengthly, remember, the Brooklyn phone book is a mere page longer, and a much better read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Liturature---not","review":"Why are so many kids obsessed with this stuff? If you ask me, a story about a kid who goes to a special school is not a great story. I heard that J.K. Rowling used Lord of the Rings to make her books, but if you ask me, L.O.T.R. is a lot better. Try books like 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, The Hobbit, A Series of Unfortunate Events, War of the Worlds, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, and stuff like That. If you ask me, there a a lot better things than these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"It was stupid and sad and depressing... but not as much as the 6th season of buffy.Serious died and he was my favorite character and the wierd punishments and umbrige.This is coming from a fan of the books"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!","review":"I just cannot enjoy this book at all. It is poorly written and the charactures are boring. This book also seems to see rebellion as a good thing. Pathetic. If your looking for a good book, read Lord of the Rings. Do not waste your time reading this book,or any of the Harry Potter books. Like I said, these books are just plain pathetic. Why are they so popular? I know! Because people do not know what good literature is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best in the series","review":"This book is awesome, the best in the series. It not only shows new innovations in Rowlings magical world that we all love, but goes much beyond this, showing changes and newness in Harry himself. This book tells a coming of age story that we can all relate to, and is recommended for any reader of any age. There is just so much there, we can all relate. Go get this book now if you do not already own it, and get ready to be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is awesome, the best in the series.

When is the next book comming out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid Addition to the Series","review":"I got it Saturday morning and finished it by 7pm Sunday. So of course on the good side, I had trouble putting the book down and am sorely wanting the sixth book already. Throughtout the book (based on the other books) I sensed that one character would meet an untimely demise, but it was in fact a different character with whom all readers will likely find a stronger attachment to meet their end. Rowling did an excellent job of evoking emotions at that moment and I had to re-read the entire chapter to get a feel for all of the events of the scene. Overall there was some good plot and character develoment. Much of the quality of the series has to do with character flaws of the people in the book, especially harry, making the whole experience more easy to relate to, despite the fantasy setting. Overall the series has not shown a sign of let down that other series of long length have done and I heartily endorse this volume as a good follow-up story for the Potter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The darkest one yet","review":"My husband snatched this away from me and read it first. Luckily, he reads fast so he was done in 2 days. He didn't like it, because of who was killed, since it was one of his favorite characters. I, on the other hand, loved this book just as much as I loved the other 4. It is definitely darker than the other 4, but that doesn't bother me in the slightest. Harry is getting older and more mature, so his experiences have to reflect that. Why some people don't get that I'll never know. Anyways, JK Rowling only gets more talented with each book. She really knows how to suck her readers in quick, and keep them entranced until the very last page. I don't think anyone saw more than my forehead peeking up from the pages until I was finished with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon duped by FAKE book, as have I been","review":"I am returning this book for the SECOND time. Both times I've ordered it, it has been advertised as a hardback book. It is nothing like the other books in the series, it has no jacket, the cover looks digitized, the paper is poor quality and cut on an angle at the top of the page so the writing slants up to the right. It is not a classic hardcover book, it looks like a cheap knockoff. Perhaps it is a library binding, I'm not sure what those are, I always order hardcovers. Hardcover Harry Potters are especially important for my son, since I am reading them to him in hopes that he'll keep them and read them again when he is older. So, now I'm headed to Barnes & Nobles to purchase a decent copy with two shopping days before Christmas. Someone at Amazon hasn't done their homework.

All three of us said the same thing about this book....\\"This book isn't going anywhere\\" The other four Harry Potter books were much more superior. There were no \\"Harry Adventures\\", the characters were poor, and very frequently felt that issues in the book were not resolved. I purchased all the Harry Potter books, but got this one from the Library....luckily I didn't spend the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overhyped","review":"This book is poorly written and boring. At this point in the series, the characters are starting to get quite weary and shallow. The huge number of characters leads to a painful lack of any real relationship between many of them and reduces any empathy the reader might have had in previous books in the series. All the spells and magical hokus-pokus failed to entertain anyone in our family. I recommend people quit after book 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"THIS ONE IS THE BEST OF ALL! GREAT! FULL OF CHARACTERS YOU LOVE TO LOVE AND OTHERS YOU LOVE TO HATE! I WOULD RECOMEND IT WHOLE-HEARTEDLY TO ANYBODY (SO LONG AS THEY HAD READ THE PREVIOUS FOUR)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"This book was very different from the 1st four. I found it hard to get into. It dragged and it was full of anger. Yes, Harry is now 15 and suffering all teenage dilema's but the anger extended throughtout the whole school year. I felt maybe the author just wanted to get the book written as it had been 3 years since the release of book 4 and she really didn't have her heart in it. Maybe she was angry and it carried into this book.I believe the author would not finish the series if there wasn't such a great following. It didn't have nearly the humor of the last books. I was very disappointed although the new character added something to the book. I read the first 4 books 3 times each and have listened to the audio tapes of all books. I doubt I will buy the audio tape of this book nor will I read it a second time. I will not get inpatient for the next book. When it comes, it comes. I feel the author let me down in this installment. It was too long and drawn out. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"Having read the first four books two years ago I have been anticipating this book for a couple of years now and I was completely unimpressed. The book had a lot of great things going on, but was still completely disappointing. J.K. Rawling sometimes wrote about Harry as though she didn't even know him and the ending was not nearly as climatic as it should have been. Although I love the Harry Potter series, this book was a major let-down. I doubt that it will stop me from reading the next book but hopefully there will be an improvement. For the next book, I hope she spends less time on marketing and more time improving the content of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 5--best yet","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite book in the series and after rereading it a few times it's easier to say why. Book 5 is darker, of course, especially psychologically. The character developement for Harry is especially rich (it is for the rest of the characters, too) and, simply, he grows up. This adds a whole new texture to the book, but Rowling does it gracefully without losing the humor.I also liked the fact that this book isn't all mystery and sleuthing--for Harry, this isn't child's play anymore. There are bigger things to be dealt with.JKR has left her signature clues (and herrings :)) in this book and I can't wait to read it again and again.I highly recommend this book.--Meagan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best","review":"I have read everyone one if the HP books atleast a 100 times. In everyone of the books there is a hudge suprise. In this book it ended, and I frankly wasn't that suprised...

It is all in all a great book and I can't wait till the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book. I really like all the Harry Potter books including this one.

I like this book but still I think POA is the best one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another year at Hogwarts... FINALY!!!","review":"Anyway, as ecpected, the fifth novel in the awesome Harry Potter series is to die for. If possible, I think this one highly overshines the others. I can't keep my nose out of this book for a second! (well... except for right now obviously)The plot in this book is HIGHLY developed. In my opinion, Harry seems more like a real person in this book. His personality is more defined and understandible. And he finaly TELLS PEOPLE OFF!! Even if it is the weird british way of telling people off. In my opinion, everyone, including his friends, finaly get what they deserve. (tho, he could yell more at teachers than at Ron and Hermione)And of course there is another wonderfly evil Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher. But I won't spoil anymore of the story here.Well... seeing to how typing this is cutting time away from reading the other half of the book, I'll just say this... This book was worth the ridiculous wait, and is the best one so far!!!13..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely different, but no less fun!","review":"When I first started this book, I was overwhelmed with thoughts that, \\"Wow, this is different\\". I don't want to give away too much to future readers, but this is definitely a bit darker and much less 'bright and cheery' than the first four in the series. Nevertheless, it is still Harry Potter through and through, and definitely the most enjoyable HP experience I've had so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"This was a great book. It was very stressful at times. Harry is now 15, and very moody. Not only is he dealing ...death, and Voldemort's return, but he's also dealing with The Ministry of Magic trying to discredit him.His relationship with Dumbledore is different in this book, but his friendship with Ron and Hermione is as strong as ever. A lot happens in this book, including Harry goes on a date... and we finally learn why Voldemort is after Harry. A lot of loose ends get tied up, and it makes you really excited for Book 6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2nd best in the series","review":"Ok, to all those who say that this book was dissapointing must not have actually read the book. Ive read a lot of these reviews and I have to say that you people who didnt like this book were dissapointing. I have to admit some parts i didnt like, (the death) but overall I beleive this book is the second best in the series. Ive also noticed while reading these reviews that some people thought the 4th was the best, I would have to say that the 4th book is at the bottom of my list. Im a fast reader and I re-read books a lot and base my opinions on books after re-reading them and I have to say that I enjoyed re-reading this book far more than the 4th. And if the length freaks you out, dont worry. I personally love how the books are getter longer and longer.

Even though Harry is alot more moody and angry in this novel, Fred and George are really funny( like always!), as well as some other characters. You meet some really funny students, such as Luna Lovegood! A lot of kids might think this book was too long, but I thought it was the perfect length. There are some suprising twists in the book that I hadn't expecting. There was one thing wrong though- I think J.K. Rowling's writing might have been influenced by the movies. Of course, I'm not positive, but that would be a real bummer. There are also some awful things that happen in the book. My favorite character dies in this book (waah!) but I'm not telling anyone who it is. You'll just have to read the book to find out!I am a really fast, and it's good to read a book in a week instead of an hour. I can't wait for the sixth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Despite my worst fears Harry has gotten emotionally older. He is now sullen, sarcastic, egotistical and a teenager. This book was worth the three year wait. I'm not going to reveal any secrets but they're there. My only regret is that book number 6 isn't coming out tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many explanations, but the fight is to begin","review":"In the fifth book of the series, Rowling increases the action, and the explanations. We'll meet the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic builiding and, unfortunately, we'll witness an unpleasant death (I am not going to ruin the expectation for those who haven't finished or even read the book) Yet, it's a book whose story becomes so cumulative and with many things that sort out making difficult to understand at first reading all the names, situations. This can be denominated the book of the parted ways: those who know the truth of Voldemort's return against those who are blind. In the end, we'll discover that the real fight is set to begin on next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" was a real let down for me. It was really slow and hard to get through. Harry was protrayed as a conceeded little brat, who only thinks about himself most of the time. There were a few good parts in the 800+ page book, but they hardly made the book worthwhile. This is a book you will definetely want to borrow if you want to read it. I hope that the next book will be better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What can I say, I did not like it. There is barely any story at all. It could have been summarized in two or three chapters. The rest is ... unnecessary and not interesting. I felt that two third of the book could have easily been avoided and I don't think quantity is quality (in this particular case). Pity, I loved the other books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too whiny.","review":"Most of the 2 days I spent reading this book I wanted to kick Harry in the face. I found it very disappointing that Rowling found it neccessary to make him the stereotypical teenager, when plenty of people go through adolescence and maintain a normal attitude and way of thinking. There were far fewer comic elements to this book and I missed them sorely. If Harry is just as bratty in the 6th novel, I'll stop reading it halfway through. I think Rowling is abusing her power as an author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Not wanting to give anything away, I'll simply say that this book is phenomenal. Brilliant on a number of levels, it presents its themes and sympathies candidly, though with a subtle undercurrent and mood that permeates the book. It answers some of our questions, leaves us hanging on others, and brings up a whole new raft which we will undoubtedly debate hotly until book 6! These are the most wonderful books I have ever been fortunate enough to read. Though long, it keeps its plots lines clear and easy to follow, and never become dull or slogs along. JK Rowling is truly a gifted, gifted writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent continuation!","review":"As an adult, I've enjoyed these books greatly. I found this new book truly an excellent addition to the series. I only hate that I will have to wait another two or three years for the next one!It's still so soon after the release, that I won't give any real details except to say that it lives up to the hype, and that it reveals a lot about Harry and Albus that's I'd always wanted to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best and Most Mature","review":"It is true that the ending of this book is not the most lighthearted, especially compared to some of the other Potter books. But compared to the LAST one, I find this one a bit less foreboding and tense. True, the death is very impactful and saddening, but it is not as vividly described and darkly surrounded as the death in Goblet of Fire.The rest of the book is highly enjoyable. In fact, it's the most fun I've had reading a book in a while. With Order of the Phoenix it isn't a chore to read, it's a pleasure. The book fleshes readers' favorite characters very well, especially Neville Longbottom and the Weasley Twins. Harry himself gains more personallity as his temper gets the best of him throughout. The usual wit Rowling puts into Hogwarts make the 870 pages seem like a breeze.Bottom line: It's a must-have for any fan of Harry, fantasy, or classic novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to the series.","review":"If you are a Harry Potter fan you have probably already read the book. If not, now is the time to start. The second half of the book had me laughing out loud at the Weasley twins and crying at the end. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still excellent","review":"This is yet another excellent book in the Harry Potter series. Order of the Phoenix has gone into a different direction than the other books and the tone is much more serious with a darker plot, not to mention Harry being angered throughout the book. But--like the others--I found the book hard to put down and finished it in about 2 days. JK still keeps Order of the Phoenix as suspenseful and humorous as the other 4 books, which makes it an excellent book, not to mention a must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book yet.","review":"no words can describe this book.it was literally amazing.VERY layered, emotional.more so then all the other harry books, which i appreciated a lot.

BOOKS : 1 2 3 4 6 ARE WAY BETTER AND HOPEFULLY 7 WILL BE THE BEST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for kids!","review":"This book is not suitable for kids! Rowlings seems to have turned from writing a fanciful tale with a little scary adventure to writing horror novels. No wonder the reviews inside the cover feature Stephen King. The Goblet of Fire went over the edge as well. I can't recommend that kids ages 9-12 read past #3 in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it for the sake of the series.","review":"Harry whines IN CAPS. Life at Hogwarts sucks.That sums up like 700 pages of this depressing installment.The remaining 170 pages deliver some interesting story development, as there should be after the stunning 4th book, but it's mired in very slow, very depressing, and very repetitive series of events.At least it makes it easy for the movie makers to edit stuff out and leave the good bits in.This one should definively make a better movie than it did a book.Still, read it. The 6th one is good, I just hope the 7th makes better use than the 5th of all the dead tree involved in making 800+ pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"I thought that J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job writing all of her books except the fifth one. The fifth one was sad, depressing and I thought that there could have been a better climax to the ending than what she had written. She had written throughout the first four about this boy who's life was changed and his adventures at hogwarts. The First four were happy and adventuris, then came the fifth book which was gloomy, sad, and very deppressing. The fourth book was so good i expected a better sequal than what was published. J.K. Rowling just had a minor set back, and I still love the all the books. I can't wait till the sixth one comes out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner that keeps you wanting more!","review":"I have read all the Harry Potter books, and I enjoyed them all. Not many writers can hold my attention the way this book has. I actually miss the characters, and feel as if they are friends of mine. After getting to the end of these books, I recommend Mystic Deja, The Maze of Existence (Book 1), by Tina M Randolph. It is a fantastic science fiction series, that will keep you entertained while you wait for the next HP book to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books in HP","review":"This book was so dark, hateful, on Harry's part,and [complaining] on Umbridges's part, but it was very well written and kept me reading all night!

Rowling...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the 5th book in the Harry Potter series. Although the book was a little slow in the beginning, it got better and more exciting as I read more and more...by the end, I couldn't read fast enough! It was interesting to see how the character of Harry is maturing. He often seemed grumpy and out of sorts, which was a little disheartening compared to the somewhat happy-go-lucky character we read about in the earlier books. Of course, he is 15, so it is probably somewhat typical behavior. Overall, this older reader (24 years old) thought it was a great book and can't wait for the next in the series to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, a bit lengthy","review":"A great book, it follows the same basic formula for success that Rowling used in the previous 4 books. However I think you will find that its resolution is not as well defined as in previous books. Its well written and the character development is excellent. Perhaps the only reasons I thought is was unworthy of 5 stars were the tangents the Rowling went on, i.e. Hagrid's trip to the mountains, which I believe sacrificed flow and added unnecessary length to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Tale","review":"The saga continues but the story darkens. No longer is this a \\"children's story\\", but a tale of a young man who is dealing with a dark past. He has lost his celebrity status and is viewed as a liar with exagerated stories. Harry is changing, and I fear not for better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Audiobooks","review":"I have read the books and seen the movie. I bought my first set of audiobooks on a whim. I love them, I listen to them when I am driving. It helps to block out all the frustration from the heavy traffic in southern calif. I don't mind the time it takes to get home anymore. Sometimes I even sit in my car in the garage to hear the end of the chapter. I also pickup on things in the story I missed before. I want all of the Harry Potter books cuz I like listening to them over and over. But there are alot of different books that are audio now. There is even a rental club like netflix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the Series","review":"This is the absolute best book in the entire series. Not only do you see Harry grow, but Ms. Rowling really dives in and shows us how each and every character has grown from the begining. Neville Longbottom really becomes more of a man and starts defendind himself in this one. I was really happy with that because I always felt sort of sorry for the poor kid. Order of the Phoenix has a tad darker tone than the previous 4 in the series but it adds to the seriousness of what is coming in that world. Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix was definitely worth the long wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait!","review":"This was an amazing addition to the Harry Potter saga. I was captivated throughout its 870 pages and couldn't put it down. Rowling introduces us to a more mature and more emotional Harry, who, in addition to dealing with his Voldemort problems, must also go through the everyday trials of a teenager. I was able to relate to Harry more as I saw more of his emotions coming out in this book and has he becomes more of an adult than a child. A fantastic read - I recommend it for both children and adults who have enjoyed the previous books. My only complaint is that now we will have to wait a while for the next installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"I absolutley LOVED this book. It was amazing and it defintley lives up to the standard the other titles in the Harry Potter series have set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful and a great read","review":"I am 15 and I find the Harry Potter series very good. I have to strongly disagree with the 12 year old reviewer who gave it a one, how does it disrespect the government or your parents. It does not indirectly or directly say that at all. It teaches that we should be united, like the US stands for. And the people in the book respect thier parents very much, Weaslys for example, your comment is totally irrevelant to the series. I find your comment totally ignorant, you don't want to see the positive outcomes from this series, such as getting young people to read and respect eachother as fans. Your comment is ignorant and I hope you take the books for what they are, fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is fun potter","review":"Harry potter ia the most amazing book i've ever read. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I had to stop about every hour to just take it all in. It's the best childs book i've ever read. Mind though that it is also extremly long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill out Harry- still good though","review":"OK, so Harry's adolescent and dealing with a lot but strength of character should pull him back from a lot of the thresholds he broaches in book 5. Not to give too much away but lets have a bit of respect and STOP ALL OF THE SHOUTING!!!!!Beyond that, I hated to see it end. I wish I had another 800 pages to go but I'm sadly resigned to wait for the next installment. Let's hope that Ms. Rowling doesn't stay too fat and happy and make us wait another two years for book 6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best One Yet","review":"I finished the book last night and I loved it! My opinion is OOtP is the best one of the 5. In many ways the previous books were teasers. After finishing each of the 1-4 I was left itching to learn more of the background about Harry's parents and what it was like before Brother Riddle was vanquished. Book 5 pulls it all together for the fans of the series. When you finish this book... you feel like you can't wait for #6.Thanks JK... for another masterpiece"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phoenix from the flames","review":"What a book! Bought at midnight on a freezing cold Friday night, we adults stood around too excited to be embarassed. 20 minutes later clutching the book in my greasy paws I started reading. I haven't eaten since! I honestly couldn't put it down.The plot picks up where the fourth left off, with you-know-who still at large and Harry as always with the Dursleys on Privet Drive. This book however follows more closely to the fourth book than the first three as it is HUGELY dark. Harry really grows up in this book and has a few teenage tantrums along the way. About time...We see some of the first signs of romance in Harry's life and we also start to see more of the links between Harry and You-Know-Who. Harry takes his O.W.Ls (Ordinary Wizarding levels) and things at Hogwarts start to go badly wrong.I'm doing my best not to spoil it for anyone, just buy it and read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"May Be The Best Yet","review":"I read this book in two days and I only put in down when my nose was in the center of the book due to sleep deprivation. I immensely enjoyed it to the very end. Yet I was sad and horrified that J. K. Rowling killed one of my favorite characters...but you have to read it to find out who. The book was dark, and I didn't think it very appropriate that these small children were reading this, but if it gets them to read I suppose everything evens out. Rowling has a talent for making the readers care for the characters, and experience what they are going through. The book definitely makes you laugh, but it also makes you cry. There is also a certain character in this book you love to hate, surprisingly other than Draco and his father. I loved all her books, and I definitely added this to my collection at 12:01 the Saturday it came out. It is a mixture of everything and comes together brilliantly. J. K. Rowling has truly created another magical masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Plodder","review":"The long awaited 5th entry in the Harry Potter series is a monumental disappointment. In 870 pages, almost nothing of substance happens. And most of what we read is not connected in any way to anything else. We plod through scenes of Harry on a date, the giant Hagrid hides in the forest, etc. And there is nothing in this book that contributes to the overall story of the return of Voldemort. We knew he was back at the end of Goblet of Fire, and by the end of Order of the Phoenix, well, he's basically still just back. Except that he's spent the entire book more or less in hiding while his Death Eater cronies try and get their hands on \\"the prophecy\\", which tells us no more than we already knew about the characters. And yes, the end of the book leaves us on the dawn of a new wizard war, but we figured that was going to happen at the end of book 4.Skip this installation, and wait for number 6. You'll have missed nothing but a lot of Harry yelling at his friends in bold type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potter Mania...will it ever end?","review":"Unlike the previous 4 books in the series, 'The Order Of The Phoenix' takes on a more darker and deeper side.Harry is definitely taking on far more emotional pressure and mental strain than ever before and this novel is gripping and more 'moving'.Once again we are transported to the magical world which J.K.Rowling creates through her spell-binding words, and 756 pages later we are still mystified and truthfully, begging for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it's good-don't get too hyped up.","review":"I noticed that I am one of very few to rate this book with anything less than a five. I'm not saying that it wasn't a terrific novel. I am saying that myself and most of my friends would not call it our favorite. Between us, we think the best Harry Potter book would be the third (The Prisoner of Azkaban) or maybe the forth (The Goblet of Fire). Now, just because it's not the best doesn't mean that it shouldn't be read. Definitely read it (if you're into the series) but don't expect too much if you really liked the 3rd and 4th."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's finally here!","review":"I have just finished the Order of the Phoenix and I have to say I can't wait for the 6th. While I did find the initial start of the book to be somewhat slow, it was definately worth the wait for the book. You will find out so much more about Harry and all of the characters in the book. Look out for Neville, he definately steps in this book. Good job to JKR. Impatiently waiting for the next book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"an ok read","review":"If you are a total Harry Potter lover, like I am, you can stand getting through this book. Other wise, you probaly won't like it. After J.K Rowling's other books, this one was a bummer. I highly recomend that you read her other books before you judge this one. Harry ,throughout this book, was snappy and inconsiderate, true, but hey, he's going from kid to teen. This story is more for 11yrs and above."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for a most impressive book!","review":"This book bring many thoughts to my mind: Dark, different, surprising, fast paced, but the number one thought it brings is Extraordinary. I could not put this book down when I bought it (the day it came out, June 21, 2003) and finished it very quickly. It's a very good book, with new characters, events, and surprises. For those who have read the book, I hope you loved it as much as I did. From an awful \\"Defense\\" teacher to Harry's most awaited first kiss, you will love every letter of this book, and that's a fact!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Series","review":"I am not an avid reader, but could not put any of the series down once I began to read the books. I got all 5 books at once and started with Book 1 and did not stop until I had reached the final page of Book 5. I finished the series in about 4 weeks. My only disappointment with Book 5 is that you did not find out how the students did on their O.W.L.S., so I'll have to wait until the next book is published. Excellent choice for any age... I'm 56 and enjoyed the series that I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter Gets PMS","review":"How can a boy change so much over the summer. This book begins the summer after the fourth book leaves off. Within that time Harry Potter goes from being a well mannered and yet mischievous young man to being a spoiled, self centered, and often hard to like, child. Finally, literature has come out with a male character who experiences PMS just like girls do. There are some good parts like bringing back Lupin for one, and seeing some of Snapes childhood, it is interesting. I hope the next one is better because had this been the first book in the series I don't think the publisher would have bought it. The book is a must read if you follow the series and want to understand some key points but the book is disappointing. Nobody is perfect including the author of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"I loved this book....finished it in no time flat and have started reading it again....Rowling answers so many questions in here but still leaves some unanswered...the chapters dealing with conflict keep you rooted.....the new villian is thoroughly despicable and the death (that we've all been guessing about) is completely unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet!","review":"This is a fantastic read that really delves into souls of the main characters more than ever before. It is a wild ride that pulls your heart along through the story. I found myself trying to coach Harry the teenager as I read, and I shed tears for him during his struggles. I only wish I hadn't read it so quickly--now I have to wait even longer for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Exciting, and Thrilling!","review":"The best yet of the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix proved to be most exciting. Twisting and turning and leaving me unable to sleep for nearly two days straight, which is the time limit in I finish every book I've ever read. The story really leads you into feeling quite attatched to it's characters, feeling what they feel. Of course, I have come to think on the fact that the story gets rather dreary, sad, and depressing, but I can only hope better things will happen. A page turner for sure for any who are true fans of great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker, But Very Satisfying!","review":"This is an excellent read! The longest of Rowling's books so far, it is also darker, but very satisfying. Plot elements that have been working for the last four books are brought together. Not all questions are answered, and there is more mystery generated that will need to be cleared up in the next two books, but Book Five is very satisfying to read. I highly recommend it! Enjoy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, not that great","review":"The lead character is no longer interesting, he is simply dour and selfish. There are no clever plot twists and the sense of a great mystery is absent. The wonderful scenes of past books, like the World Cub, are also absent. Furthermore, we learn NOTHING new.What a sad, sad dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fantastic story telling web... a real page turner!","review":"WOW! I couldn't put it down until I finished reading it! I highly recommend this book! Harry Potter is now 15 and though this book is a bit darker than the rest of the series, I found it simply entrancing. When do we get the next installment?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix-A book of wonders","review":"I think this is a wonderful book that every Harry Potter fan (and others) will thoroughly enjoy from cover to cover. I love all Harry Potter books but this one really sets the books apart from others. This is an incredible experience that everyone will enjoy. Read it yourself with your friends to your siblings with your {grand}parents! With whoever you read it or whenever you read it it will be an awesome adventure for you (and your friends or family). Trust me buy this book! It'll blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of the series. With The Order of the Phoenix, Rowling seems to have lost her way. Specifically, none of the characters are likable, there is no comic or fantastic relief (the Dursley's are hellish, Sirius's home is hellish, Hogwart's is hellish,...), relationships are trivial (I expected a lot more out of Harry/Sirius, and Harry/Cho), and the great prophecy is a total yawn. Most fans of the series could have come up with a more entertaining list of events, plot twists, settings, and character transformations than are contained in this installment.I haven't been this surprised in a bad way since Aliens 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurry Up J. K. Rowling!","review":"Best of the series so far! I'm no teenager (in fact I'm the mother of two teens) and I ripped into this book as eagerly as a 5-year-old plows into her presents on Christmas Day. I was not disappointed. That was last summer and I've read this book five times since then. I rarely read a book twice, forget about six times!This book is dark and almost claustrophobic. I felt completely wrapped up in the wizarding world from the beginning. The main characters are growing up and learning more about the past and how it may affect their futures. They are true teenagers dealing with hormones, teen angst, the delicacy of friendship and the opposite sex on top of the dark world that looms ahead of them. Harry is growing into the wizard his world is going to need in the very near future.Hurry up, J.K.! Have mercy on us and get Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince on the shelves soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment","review":"I've started following Harry Potter when the 1st book was published and nobody had waited for it excitedly. What an excellent series it has been! \\"Has been\\" is the point here. The 5th book is such a dissapointment! First, it should've been much shorter, there are just too many boring lengthy descriptions/discussions that lead nowhere and do nothing for characters. Second, boy, what an anti-climax ending! I mean, let's think a minute: A prophecy as a weapon???! And what new did we find out from that prophecy? Makes no sense at all. The only good thing about this book is \\"that Umbridge woman\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.K. Rowling Never lets us Down","review":"I love all the books and I thing each one subsequently has gotten better and better. Many thought the book was too long, but I found it captivating from page 1 to page 870. If anyone complains about the length it is because they are too lazy to actually sit down and read a long book. They want to know the story and they want to know it in 500 pages or less. But I say, what about the details. The harry potter world is completely different than ours, and i find the descriptions of it fascinating. As for those who say it is too sad and gloomy, get a hold of yourself, it's just a book. Sure, I was sad when one of my most favorite characters died, I cried and everything, but that is what made it good. It evoked emotions from the reader. But you don't have to be mad at J.K. Rowling about it, i mean, come on, it's not like she can't introduce more great characters and have even more alluring things occur. This is a compelling novel and a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollicking good read","review":"The latest installment in the Potter series deals with many teen and adult issues and how they interact with each other. the underlying theme of good verus evil in all of us is very dominant in this book, i feel.The lessons learned for everyone in these books is superbly done and entertains as well with imagination and humor. I do not understand how anyone would say these books were works of the \\"devil\\".Read them enjoy them and let your kids roam the imaginary world. it is far safer than this real one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just About the Best Book in the Series","review":"This book is totally awesome. It is very intriguing and makes you never want to put it down. I was reading until 1 AM until I realiized the time. It is intresting and you really get into it. This book is most likely the best book in the entire world second to the Bible. If you need a good book, this is it. I would recomend this book to 8 or 9 and over because some content is not necessary for younger children. Eight year olds should only read it if their parents or older siblings are there to help them understand the difficult words. There is one part which maybe a bit scary to 8 year olds and younger. This is a very good book and I can't wait until the next book comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these books!","review":"This one wasn't as action packed as the last, but it creates some really great suspense for the next books. I can't wait for the next books to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry is growing up!","review":"It is nice to see that Harry shows emotions and how exciting; dates for the first time. Unfortunately his school sweethart is not the right match so he moves on. Harry is quite a complex character which will be more and more exciting in the following books. Who will survive and who will die. I think we are looking forward to some wicked and wonderful experiences in the future.As a muggle, I can not wait!Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"One extremely good read","review":"This book was astonishing! If you liked the other Harry Potter books, then you won't be disappointed here. From battling death eaters to exploring the ministry of magic's greatest secrets, this book definitly has the greatest sense of adventure yet. The plot has all the twists and turns expected from J.K. Rowling, and then some. Not only has the adventure improved, but so have the charaters. Rowling really pushes the characters to develop to their full potential, and it shows! However, if you really could care less about the literary structure of this book, and are just looking for a great read, look no further; this is it. Read, and follow Harry from the ordinary muggle (human) world, into his world; the world of friendship, adventure, and of course magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great","review":"This book on the whole is great. Albeit Harry throws too many fits and it is a tad too long but it does not spoil the over all magic quality of the book. Anyone else who enjoyed this book should go here: http://www.outwar.com/page.php?x=1719175 it has some great stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry grows up....a change his previous adventures.","review":"This book was fabulous. I am sure that all fans, especially adult fans, will thoroughly enjoy it. Harry, Ron, Hermione and other young characters grow from children into young adults. There are more dangers as well as more surprising information and new places than in the past four books combined. This is a dark, intense, and at times tragic installment of the Harry Potter series, so be prepared. But I am sure you will come out if it loving J.K. Rowling's characters and wonderful storytelling ability more than ever before."},{"rating":"2","title":"finished reading day after release! AMAZING!","review":"This book was sooo good, I will read it a thousand times! The plot was increadable! There was only one thing I disliked, the way Harry was so angry alot of the time, and he took out his anger on other people. Hopefully in Book six he will have a better attitude. Can't wait until the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is Back!","review":"One thing to say: J.K. Rowling is a great writer. She includes vivid details and all of her stories are put together very well. This book was great, but it was my least favorite in the series. The whole time, Harry was in a bad mood, and yelling at his friends. Nothing exciting happened in the first two hundred pages, and when something did happen, it was sort of forgotten eventually. The book was still in my top ten, and I still have to give J.K. Rowling a ton of credit for writing these wonderful books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Series By Far","review":"OotP was definitely a dissapointment compared to the rest of this wonderful series. Although it began to piece together some of the many questions the previous books introduced, the many chapters it took to get to those answers was a little painful. Harry's new teenage attitude is hard to deal with, the romance is fairly shallow, Hagrid is dumber than he usually is, and the new teacher at Hogwarts is more annoying than anything. Do read it to fill in the blank pieces of information regarding Harry, but chances are you won't find it as enjoyable as the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little more work to get through","review":"When The Half-Blood Prince came out, I realized that I somehow neglected to read book 5, so purchased both. Last week, I re-read book 4, then 5 and finally 6. I couldn't put them down until I had finished. I loved them all. What great fun and a magical escape from one's life. I don't want to be a Muggle anymore!! Can't wait for book 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rise of the Dark Lad","review":"Harry is in trouble again. It's not just the Dementor attack or the new DADA teacher he must face - he must also deal with his own dark side. Harry is showing all the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - paranoia, anger, nightmares and flashbacks.And then there's a coup at Hogwarts, and Harry must rally a secret cadre of revolutionary students to combat the new fascist regime. In teaching his friends real charms and spells for defense against the dark arts, they are prepared for the book's climactic finale, an all-out battle with Death Eaters in the halls of the Ministry of Magic.Harry will find allies he never knew existed, will learn new and unsettling truths about his parents, will lose someone close to him, and will emerge even more prepared to meet the destiny awaiting him.Rowling does a great job of moving the plot forward, and showing Harry's transition from boy to man. This is a fine addition to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry's Growing Up and Rowling Keeps Pace...","review":"This is a much darker installment of the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. Persoanlly, I think it brings some much needed depth to the characters. I admire Rowling's decision to do this as she knows that her core group of fans are also maturing along with Harry. For adult readers, she is able to balance that line of fiction for both young and old. It is an excellent, excellent book - and I won't give any plot spoilers here! This series has encouraged the reluctant reader into becoming the eager reader - for that alone, Rowling deserves high praise. There is nothing finer than a good book, except a kid that discovers the love of reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is by far the best of the Harry Potter books, and one of the best books I have read in a long time. The depth of the characters, the intelligence of the writing and the emotional truth and complexity is extremely engaging.This may not be as enjoyable for younger children, but as a book for adults it is stunningly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you've read the other books, otherwise avoid...","review":"I found this book didn't feel as fun or engaging, but still a very good read. Harry's angrier a lot of the time and there's a lot of heavy stuff for him to take in, plus a lot of favourite characters are barely anywhere to be seen. I also felt like nothing really happened until the last third of the book. Even the last third felt like it was being set up for the final two books.But still - this is without doubt an excellent piece of writing, despite my gripes. If you've read the previous four books, you absolutely cannot go without reading this book - it's much more accessible to adults and sets the stage for what promises to be two truly gargantuan books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolutely Thrilling Page-Turner","review":"I read this book in three days, and that was by spacing it out. I looked forward to the release of the book more than my high school graduation, and after reading the book I was not disappointed. I enjoyed every inch of this book. I felt as though there were not as many plot twists as there were in past books, and Rowling relied too heavily on dreams, but other than that I really enjoyed reading this book. My little brother is reading it next and I am egging my parents to read this book. So often I am disappointed by cultural phenomenon, Order of Phoenix is the exception. Everybody should read the Harry Potter series. I anticipate that this series of books will become the next Narnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"great continuation of the series","review":"Another great read. i promised myself i wouldn't stay up past 2 for this one like i did for the last couple, but there i was rushing through the last chapter at 3 in the morning. What I love about these books isn't that it's great literature or has insights into the human condition. What I love is disappearing into J.K Rowlings world, a wild ride from beginning to end. And unlike a trip to the Luna Park rollercoaster, I always feel better at the end than I did at the start. Coooool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Order of the Phoenix - The best one yet!","review":"This by far is the best Harry Potter book ever. I couldn't put it down. I thought the character developments were the best yet. Harry's emotions are so intense. This book keeps your emotions flowing. With every turn of the page your expecting something amazing to happen and yet you are surprised evey time with what is going on. This book also fills in a lot a blank spots, answers old questions, and reveals new secrets. There are almost no words to describe how totally awesome this book is. I am left with an overwhelming feeling of wanting more. Lets hope the next book is released very soon!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Depressing Book I've Ever Read","review":"This is the most depressing book I've ever read.

I loved the first four Harry Potter books, what happened here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"After waiting 3 Years I was dissapointed","review":"I really enjoyed the first 4 Harry Potter books, but I was very dissapointed in this book. What kept me reading was that I kept thinking that it would get better and I wanted to know who died. I missed so many of my favorite characters that had limited exposure in this story line. I also did not like the way the 15 year old Harry acted most of the time. Hopefully number 6 and 7 will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to the Magic??","review":"What happened to Rowling's brilliant language and humor that were seen in the first four books??? The plot was disappointing and not all that coherent or credible. Here's hoping for recaptured magic in Book 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Disappointing! Disappointing! Disappointing! It seemed JK Rowling ran out of her imagination on Harry Potter series. Nothing exciting so that she had to create unecessary death to cover it up. The excuses for protecting Harry Potter were really ridiculous. I hope JK Rowling will do much better on book six. Otherwise I am afraid nobody will remember Harry Potter at all in 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After looking forward to this book for a long time, I was sorely disappointed. The book lacked energy and excitement. The characters were dull, especially Harry who ranted and raved like an out of control two-year-old. It must have been difficult to follow in the footsteps of The Goblet of Fire. Too much Hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This is quite frankly a marvelous book. Whatever the reason for delaying its release it definitely paid off in the end. Those looking for a light hearted tale would do well not to be fooled by the story's deceptively simple surface. Year 5 is at once more serious, darker, and more intensely philosophical than any of its predecessors. If the series keeps going in the same direction I'll be surprised if they keep stacking these in the children's section. One thing that surprised me was the different way we see the characters, Harry in particular...you see a much more complex side of them. More weakness, more bickering...but also more strength and emotion..ultimately the characters gain a measure of humanity. You might not always like what you see but you can identify and feel for the them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing miss","review":"Harry Potter 5 was very disappointing--(1) it was very descriptive and repetitive (2) the actual climax does not come till the last 100 pages which were goodOverall the plot was average and Book four really was far superior and had may aspects like the Triwizard tournament, etc3 yrs of wait really dampened itI think perhaps the author may have been distracted owing to the motion pictures being made and perhaps the quality of the book may have sufferedDefinitely not the best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"Previous Harry potter books were entertaining, a joy to read to my children. This one, however, was daunting to say the least, because of the tiresome repetition (repeated, and repeated, and repeated ad nauseum, events we, who have read all the previous books, were already quite familiar with - and those who were not - go buy the books and play catch-up!) of detail, the length ( none of us mind long books- if they are well written) and the non-plot.So disappointing! Felt as though Rowling has lost herself in the Forbidden Forest of Redundency.Might be a good idea if she does start listening to her editors because the book reads as though she's stubbornly written this on her own with very little positive input anywhere!Can only hope there will never be a \\"5\\" movie- guaranteed to be a 'ho-hummer' at best. Hope that Rowling pulls herself together for her next book.MeE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rowling Needs to be Held to a Schedule","review":"There are moments of brilliance and half hours of tedium; you can tell when the author just wasn't in the mood to write. The writing was more taut, suspense-filled, and funny when the author was a struggling single parent. Harry's anger can be explained, but gee, he isn't even close to being a scholar; he seems rather stupid sometimes. Ron has virtually no character at all, and Hermione is a first rate whiner. Its hard to admit, but the evil Dolores Umbridge has the most well-written character in the book. The publisher(s)/editor(s) need to get and keep the author on course and interested. Otherwise no one will much care if there IS a book 6 or 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst in the series","review":"I'm an adult fan and I can honestly say this book was a big disappointment. It seemed to just go absolutely no where for the long. You thought she must be building up to something great and the climax was so anti-climatic I felt so let down. This book did not need to be 766 pages long, it could have been wrapped up and been more exciting and suspenseful in about 500 or so. I'll read books 6 & 7 when they come out but I won't be reading 5 again that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"It was a long wait, but it was worth it. Book 5 is a worthy continuation of the series in that it allows the characters to grow and change without betraying who they were in the earlier books. This story has more danger, more anguish, than the others, but it reflects the darkening situation with Voldemort's reappearance on the scene. The action is fast-paced, and there are not many dull moments in this year of Harry's life--and there are some that make him rethink his view of Hogwarts as his personal Utopia. He deals with things that aren't nice, aren't fair, and that don't seem to have solutions...in other words, the real world.As a mother, I'd be wary of allowing a young child to read this one alone; parents need to read it, too, in case there are some personal issues for their child that they should be ready to discuss--including the death of someone close."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more grown up Harry Potter","review":"In this book, Harry shows a much wider range of emotion than in the previous books. He's truely a 15 year old boy with not only the normal puberty, girls, and classes on his mind but also the weight of dealing with the public opinion of the return of Lord Voldemort. This book has a lot of detail in it, which I'm sure all Harry Potter fans will eat alive. It makes it a slightly slower read than the other books, but the book has natural pauses rather than lulls in the story line. The ending helps to tie in the ideas from the other books to give the reader a better idea of how Harry and the story have evolved and where its going. Its definitely a book that I highly recommend and will read more than once, whenever I get my copy back from my friend who borrowed it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than words can say.","review":"Amazing.Fantastic.I stayed up all night and then some to finish this book. and it was well worth the 3-year wait.there are many new characters who have very defined personalities, and the same old characters who, as you can very much tell, have changed incredibly.Many new feelings and subjects but it is a definite must read.it's a feast of wonderful humor and suspense.Don't let the size of this novel intimidate you, i guarantee you will rage through these pages and at the end be hungering for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"saddening","review":"With this, the fifth book in the series, the quality has taken a nosedive, which rather leads me to suspect that the whole series is going to crash in flames in book 6 + 7. It's a pathetic example of what happens when an author runs out of fuel - no plot, no interesting characters, nothing. The aspects that could have been deeply interesting - such as the relationship between Snape and Harry, and Neville Longbottom's family background, are only mentioned in passing and then apparently forgotten about by the author. I won't bother with the rest of the series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book!!!","review":"By the end of the book, you won't really care what happens to Mr. Harry Potter. He's not the same Harry as we know from the other books, instead, we have to read about a snappy little smart mouth who has no reguards for people's feelings. But the author says that that's ok because Harry is a teenager and teenagers ARE SUPPOSED to act like that. This book sends a terrible message to any youth who reads it, suggesting that it's ok to be a pompous little twit, because that's how teenagers like Harry Potter are supposed to act! Cry me a river Harry!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know what people are complaining about.","review":"Well, another Harry Potter which I have been waiting with baited breath for... and once again it does not disappoint. Though a lot darker, more psychological and less of a children's book than the past four, but that is hardly a bad thing. Harry's growing up and the story is getting more complex as we learn more and more. I feel like I have lived in their world, and know each character personally. And that is about the best praise I can give a book... something which makes you believe that every character is real..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling fails to dissapoint","review":"Although not the best in the series (Book 3 Wins), still one of the best books out there.

This one had a lot more to do with Harry's mind, and his connection to Voldemort.What I thought was really different in this book was that Dumbledore actually makes a few mistakes, whereas in the former books he was always very sure of himself.Before the book came out, I heard that someone important would die. I was really freaked out, because I was afraid it was Hermione or Ron.Also, a lot of mysteries are cleared up in this book. Several things that were mentioned in former books, like the Department of Mysteries and Professor Trelawney's other prophesy, are explained in greater detail.If you liked the first four Harry Potter books, you'll love this one, but be prepared for quite a few scary scenes and another death."},{"rating":"1","title":"she got bored, perhaps?","review":"weeell...i think she got bored. there was no passion in the writing, so we didn't feel what was happening. we weren't there. however...i loved how snape turned into a person rather than a villain. he treats harry a bit better, more like an equal. \\"So...have you been practicing?\\" conversational and so on. i loved the chapter \\"Occlumency\\" because it had my two favorite characters at odds with each other...yet again. snape is at his sarcastic best. \\"Are you calling me a coward?\\" \\"Why, yes, i suppose i am.\\"but it was weak. the plot was awful. it was more aptly named \\"Potter's Pity Party.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GET TO THE POINT","review":"THE STORY TAKES A WHILE TO GET OFFIT LINGERS ON POINTS OF NO INTRESTFOR MUCTH TO LONG[THE CLEANING OF GRIMMAULD PLACE]BUT THE GOOD OUT WAYS THE BAD BY A LOT LIKE1-THE MINISTRYS ATTACK ON HAGRID'S2------------------------ DUMBLEDORWE3-THE D.A CLUB AND THERE BRAVE FIGHT AGENIST THE DARK LORDTHE DEATH OF BLACKBRAVO FOR NEVILLE LONGBOTTOMBRAVO FOR GINNY FRED AND GEORGELET THE SECOND WAR BEGIN BUT LET IT BE SHORTER[WELL NOT TO MUCH]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter 5","review":"Although this book is pretty good, I would say that it is definitely not J.K. Rowling's best. Harry is too teenagery, if you get what I'm saying. He's always mad and you get a different (not good) image about him then you do in the other books. Also, I don't think there should be any boy-girl stuff, it just makes it not seem as magical... I dunno I just didn't like that aspect of it! It is also hard to get into the story, it takes too long. Maybe J.K.R. should just get into the story right away and then the book might not be so long! :-) But if you are a Harry Potter fan, this is a must-read, since it reveals many things unknown!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT *sobs*","review":"I love this book SOOOOOO much. i am a harry potter fanatic and have been waiting for this book for 2 years. I have to say that it is well worth the wait. It has drama, and friendship so strong that not even the evil of voldemort can break it. It's funny and breathtaking. I couldn't put it down! I found myself up all night reading for hours until my eyes couldn't bare it anymore. It kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. this book is the best in the series and it is well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Yet","review":"I loved this book. It starts off like all books with Harry at the Dursley family's house. He goes walking when he runs into some dementors. Anyways he is with Dudley when the whole street turns pitch black and Dudley starts getting scared. He thinks it was Harry who made the street all black so he punches Harry. That's where the dementors come along. Since I can't say too much you will have to figure out what he does when he sees them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine Harry Potter adventure","review":"Ms Rowling has done a fine job continuing the Harry Potter series. Order of the Phoenix extends Harry's legacy as the child vanquisher of He Who Must Not Be Named and his supporters. I think this volume was not quite as well written as prior ones (Goblet of Fire most notably), because it seems to drag a bit through the Orwellian theme that makes up a good portion of the story. The majority of the action is concentrated in the last few chapters (unlike Goblet), and it seemed to be a long time coming. Phoenix does position the reader well for the continuation of the series. Too bad we now have to wait two more years for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An outright disappointment.","review":"(spoilers ahead) 870 pages of what? Well, nothing really. The only bit of interest is the dreams Harry keeps having. Which everyone understands, but nobody bothers to explain to Harry that it is most likely a trap. And in the end these dreams turn out to be an elaborate plan by Voldemort to get a prophecy that everybody already knows. If that's all Rowling was going to give us, she could've done it in 200 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to cry ... Sooo pathetic and boring","review":"I was waiting for this book so eagerly and was properly punished... it was just awfully annoying and boring. Harry was so tiresome, ridiculous and pathetic that his behaviour almost made me wish Voldemort caught him! And beacuse of his stupidity he lost his godfather. If I wasn't sorry for Sirius (NOT for Harry though) I would have felt it served him right. His arrogance in thinking he can save Sirius and a bunch of well-trained wizards will not be able to do anything ... It is just too much. His least positive feature that really made me dislike him is that he envied Ron of being a prefect. That was also conceited and so mean.I could go on and on about the negatives of Harry and this book but I would abuse the time of the readers, just as HP 5 did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry is a true adventure for all readers-especially adults!","review":"Like Peter Pan, the Harry Potter Series has been pigenonedholed into the area of childrens literature, but like Peter Pan, Harry Potter tells a story that is relevant to adults. We see Harry gaining knowledge and losing his innocence. Parents should read this series, especially this latest addition, with their children. Teenagers should read the series to understand the frailities of adults, and adults should read the series to rememember how difficult it could be growing up. There is darkness and danger you will not find in Pooh's Corner or The Cat in The Hat. Rowling has developed a character who can be considered a true hero in the land of children, teens, young adults, and adults. The only fear I have is that children will not understand the underlying themes that are being revealed. That is one reason this is a book for the ENTIRE family to read together. Turn off the TV . . . sit down and READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rowling...what happened?!","review":"Up to the third book of the Harry Potter series was really good but this one...ugh! It was such a pain to read. The only thing that made me finish it was Rowling's great style. Darn, why does the style have to be so good! Harry Potter has gone from a fun magical person to a depressed teenager. What's the deal? Does Rowling think that becuase she's rich, she can stop putting effort into these plot lines?! URGH, it makes me so mad!!! The whole series started out so good. It's really a shame. I don't know. Maybe Rowling's just tired of having to write the same series for so long. I don't blame her for that but she shouldn't have promised seven books, if she wasn't up for it. I don't know. I just wish her luck with he next book! Good luck, J.K. Rowling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a continuity editor","review":"In general, it is a very enjoyable book to read, very suspenseful as always - BUT the pleasure of reading it vanished entirely for my part in the 7th to last chapter:Without SPOILING too much, I can say that it was a major letdown that Harry loses his wand and so has no means of defending himself and Hermione - and in the next chapter his wand is back in his hand without no explanation. I was so disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!!","review":"Okay, I know JK had to get married, have a baby and write two screenplays while assembling this book. I just wish she didn't try to write the screenplay AS a book!She goes way too deep, forgets what her readers already know (or should know), and takes too many pages to describe key events. For instance, in book one the attack of the troll takes less than four pages. in book five it takes her longer than that to have Harry's broomstick confiscated, and nearly 100 pages to get through the climactic scene which was worth about 50!The plot was good, the story line fine and the characters as good as ever.Too bad the writing was SO POOR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"As a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, I can only say, what a a disappointment.

I finished book 4 in January and have been on pins and needles since. My husband and I both had copies of the TOOTP in our hands by 9:30 am release day and were both well into the book (~500 pgs)by bed that night.We both have this feeling that in Goblet there were problems but at least there were pick-me-ups in between. There were not nearly enough pick-me-ups in this book. It is a great book, very descriptive and gives a LOT of background to the story, but it gave me the same feeling of wanting when I finished reading it as Empire Strikes back the movie did when I was a kid. You want more, you need more and you feel like you got to the climax but did not get to see the outcome. I think this is probably intentional to give the final two books someplace to go...but I don't want to have to wait three years to see what happens next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love Harry potter but the ebook is better!

You can feel Harry's every move, and hear his every word with the discriptions she uses. I would highly recommend it for kids and adults both!! You will not be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Go Home!","review":"The Harry Potter books are listed on the 100 most frequently challenged book list, published by ALA. Personally, I think that these books should be on the list because the vocabulary is too challenging for little kids under the age of eight. The books and movies are also scary for little kids. J.K. Rowling makes the stories about witches and wizards in a make believe school called Hogwarts. The school is inhabited with ghosts and monsters. In addition, the subject of witchcraft and wizardry is against the moral teachings of many people/families in the United States. Harry Potter must fight off Voldemort throughout the books, and the scenes are violent. Although good wins over evil in all the stories, it is my opinion that the subject matter is too intense for young readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the book, I want to get off.","review":"Honestly, I've read fanfiction that made more sense and was more enjoyable than this.

I do not understand why these Harry Potter books are so popular. The charactures are boring and dull, the attempts at humor were pathetic, and these books are plain boring. These are just another fantasy series where its been there done that if you know what I mean. If not, then I will explain: modern fantasy is all going down hill, sort of. There are some good writers out there that are excellent. However, Harry Potter are those books that are going downhill. The writing is very poor and the dialogue is very hard to follow. I also did not feel as though I was there: another mark of poor writing skills. Overall, I give this book one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"This is the wors of the arthours book.

Harry get a little bit rebellious and cocky. Dudley is now muscular instead of fat and porky. Now I thought he would be more of a challenge for Harry but Harry kept him at bay. Though out the whole book where a bunch of surprises especially Harry parents and the unexpected leave of absence from Dumbledore. I'm always shocked and surprised every other chapter. Well, I can't wait to read part 6 and it may be a few years when that book come out but I be waiting for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but different","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, a book to quench the thirst of any Harry Potter fan, is an excellently plotted book, but the writing was different. J.K. Rowling's style of writing seems to have changed greatly when compared with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, not in its paragraph length, but in its preciseness. Before she would have said \\"He left to get the drinks, paying for them himself. When he tasted it, it warmed him to his fingertips.\\" If she had written that now, she would probably describe how he walked away, paid, walked back, and given the drinks. The plot elements were interwoven in a traditional way, but the writing needed to be shortened. Though very good, it needed some work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Luster & Excitement","review":"Well, after highly anticipating the arrival of this book and finishing it from cover to cover, I must say that I was greatly disappointed.The book did not give me the overall thrills compared to the previous volumes. There was not enough action and when I heard that one of the main characters was going to die, it was not what I expected.Now I am hesitant about reading the next 2 volumes, wondering if they will lack luster. Hopefully the series will not end that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"After book three and four, this installment was a big dissapointment. It could have been easily edited by about 200 or 300 pages, and the expected plot twists and turns developing the mystery never really gels. The ending is anti-climactic. Furthermore, some of the characters become more and more flat and unlikeable; Harry turning into the angry, unreasonable teenager, and Cho the hysterical emotionaly-needy chick.That said, I am a huge fan of Harry Potter, so I think any fan will find any part of the series engaging.

The only real problem I found was with the death at the end. I found it to be just too much, given everything Harry has had to deal with in his short life. Also, it made me cry an awful lot! I found Cho to be extremely irritating but I warmed to Hermione more than I ever thought I would or could. I too wanted to hit Dumbledore and smash up his office at the end, but I think that is only because I was rather upset for Harry! In all, it is really a brilliant book (though book 3 is still my favourite), and I cannot wait for 6 and 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"When's Book 6 coming out?","review":"Having received The Order of the Phoenix on Sunday, I rushed and read it just about cover to cover. I have to say, that for the most part, Rowling continues the tradition she has laid out over the first four books. Her portrayal of Harry as a teenager is dead on. Anyone who ever was or knows a teen would agree. Importantly, this book answers many of the questions that were on the minds of Potter fans while opening us up to new ones. My one criticism of this current installment is the straight forward nature of the story being told. For the first time, Rowling failed to add a twist towards the end of the book, making the climactic scene while very enjoyable, somewhat predictable. However, I still find myself sitting here wondering when is book 6 coming out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Book 5 Review","review":"This was one one of my favorite Harry Potter Books.

Questions we have had for years are answered and yet Rowling leaves us wondering just what is in store for our beloved hero in the next two books.

The big action scene at the end dragged on forever. The first books had lots of new, charming, and exciting characters and events and spells.

Each book I enjoyed more the previous. I just did not enjoy this novel nearly as much as the other four. This book simply lacked the adventure and action that Rowling has brought us to expect. This book does a great deal of explaining about Harry himself and his family. It gives a great deal of detail about characters that makes you wait for a big ending that never comes. This book also makes sudden changes to key characters. These changes just occur at the beginning of the book with no explanation. I also, however, see the genious in this book. This novel sacrificed a little of itself to make the next two novels amazing. The sixth and seventh years that Harry spends at Hogwarts will require minimal explanations.

The history and politics are very vividly portrayed while all of the suspense and detail that we love in this series remains!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but good read.","review":"This chapter in the Potter book might not be the best in the series, but overall it is a very fun read. One of the biggest knocks about this book is that Harry is so angry all the time, but that is how 15 year old teenagers act.The major villian in this book (Unlike the other novels in this series) can mirror someone in your life at any given time. It is not the magic with this character is scary, but the need to control what you think and do.This book also feels more of a setup to six and seven. Book five is much better the second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible","review":"This is a dark book in which Harry's lifetime of problems come full circle. He's angry, and refuses to listen to what anyone tells him to. Harry's blant disregard for authority gets someone killed. And once again Dumbledor knows all but refuses to tell anything until the end of the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and was among those in line ahead of time to get this book. I got it the first day and finally finished it last night. All of the other books were finished within 2 days. It just did not have the excitement and energy of the other books. It was far to descriptive of the little details and lost alot of the excitement because of it. It dwelled to much on the dark stuff and really never came together for me. To many references to history and not enough new stuff. The final battle was uninspiring and the book could have been cut in about half and still ended up with the same impact. Umbridge was just to mean. I hope the next book is better....."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"The highly anticipated book was a let down. The plot made no sense and dragged on and on. even for a world of magical things, the key points were highly unbelieveable. Major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Sure, it was good writing and very thrilling, but Harry was not a very nice child in this book. He was disobedient, got away with all his wrong doings and rule breaking and was rude and \\"cheeky\\" to his elders. I found that this book had a lot of violence in it: i.e. when he had to write lines and the words were carved into his hands and bleeding and swelling up. I think that this book teaches other kids that it is okay to disobey those in authority and to back-talk your elders. The use of bad language and language that in England is unknown to Americans, but is actual cursing.... very bad cursing, was totally inappropriate and unnecessary. I would not recommend this book to anyone as I found it quite horrid in parts. I am done with this series......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the Magic","review":"I am a great fan of the Harry Potter series and feel that the author is gifted, however, this book was disappointing. It was so slow getting started that I almost stopped reading it several times. The plot seemed to lack originality and purpose. I was expecting someone really important to die like Hermione, Ron, Hagrid or Dumbledore but it was just Sirius. I was not very impressed with Dumbledores confession to Harry. The book was too long and I remained bored throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be half as long.","review":"Book Five was extremly disapointing, too long, not nearly enough editing. Most of the time when I picked up the book, I got a sinking feeling in my stomach. I LOVED THE FIRST FOUR BOOKS. I have read them all at least five times. They are very entertaining. It makes me feel good when good vanquishes evil. This does not happen in Order of the Phoenix. Evil and bad feelings rule in this book. I finished it, but it was very painful. I will not read it again, and I will not buy the CD version. I own the CD versions of the first four books and still listen to them all the time. I would not be surprised if this is the last Harry Potter book. Rowling will buy her way out of writing the last two books. I have not met anyone who enjoyed this book. It stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best Harry Potter yet!","review":"I just stayed up all night reading the latest Harry potter book. Let me tell you, it was worth the wait! In this volume, Harry's uncle, Bilbo, gives him a very powerful ring. Harry doesn't know what to do with it, so he asks his wizard friend, Gandalf, for advice. Gandalf tells him to find someone to marry and the give the ring to that person. Harry agrees and goes off on a quest to find a wife. He decides to bring his friends Merry, Pippin and Linus along with him.I don't want to spoil the fun for the rest of you. Let's just say that Harry does indeed find a wife. You'll never guess who it is though! I'll give you a hint: the wife's name rhymes with Bollum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Dissapointment","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is perhaps one of the biggest let downs ever. This book was horrible all around. The addition of the Umbridge character was the biggest mistake ever. She took all excitement out of the book and made it so long and drawn out, I could barely stand to finish it. If i was just an average fan, I never wouldve finished the book it is so bad. There are only 2 chapters where some form of excitement happens, ... The book is horribly predictable and long. Everytime you think it may get better, it doesn't. It gets worse.The fourth book was so great, but this book just is an embarassment. I only recommend this book so that you know what is happening during the sixth book. This book was a big let down folks, if you don't see this, then you're incredibly naive, or just stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry has a dull year","review":"This book is a perfect example of what happens when the author perceives herself to be greater than the editor. Clearly the weakest book of the lot. 500 pages into the book and absolutely nothing has happened. My family and I struggled through this endless tome. How disappointing was the silly ending? And the entire book could have been ended on page 10 if only someone told Harry what was going on. Everyone in the world knew except Harry. They should have named this one \\"A Chronology of Harry's Boring Fifth Year, Except for a Few Hours of Excitement Near the End\\"The money JK knew she was going to make on this book required that it be masterful. It wasn't and she took an extra year because she knew it wasn't. This was a two-star book but it really should be a zero star book because of what it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book","review":"I am reading this entire series out loud to my kids. They cant wait til I get home so I can read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is predictable, lame, boring, and implausible","review":"Before I start, I must say that I had enjoyed books 1-4 and I have read each one of those books multiple times, but book 5, HP and the Order of Phoenix is different. I read it once, and I don't plan to ever read it again. It was one of the worst books I have ever read. Of the 870 pages in this book, maybe 100 of them were interesting. The rest was continuing repetition of stuff she had said many times before. The plot was predictable and implausible. Characters were one-dimensional and weak. They basically repeated the same exact things they had said before. This book was obviously not ready for print. She should have taken few more years and put out something readable. I have lost all respect for this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I bought this to complete my daughter's set, she loves the books but doesn't have this one, the others are from her grandmother and were first editions, with slip covers. This binding is done in a new way, it didn't look very good, smller size compared to the other hardbound volumes. I returned it and searched for a first American edition, to match what she has ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Book 5 is awesome","review":"All I have to say is that this book is absolutely amazing...I think it is the best so far. JK Rowling is an AMAZING writer and you can't help but fall in love with these books...this book totally lived up to the hype. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I give this book an A+!! I couldn't put it down, I was the 20th person in line the night it came out, I went home and finished half that night and the next half the next day!!! Everyone will enjoy it!!!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to the Series","review":"This book is a great addition to the series. I've recently reread them all before reading this one and it's amazing how much stuff was foreshadowed in the earlier books. I wasn't extremely pleased with losing my favorite character but it made sense and figure that's who was getting the axe when i heard the rumor that a character died. One problem I did have with the book was that it took a really long time to get on with things, but once they started happening it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eeek! Only a few more chapters to go . . . ! ! !","review":"I hadn't read any of the Harry Potter Books until this year. I read the first four books in the last six months. Intrigued though I am, I would have to say Rawlings did a fine job writing this last book, but I am unable to find myself as obsessed as most of the world with the book.I give it 5 stars for her character development and plot twists. I will probably read the last few chapters of the book and go on with my life without any lasting impressions.Thanks to the writer for the experience. It was a nice ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst so far","review":"This was by far the worst book in the series so far. Rowling went to extremes to obliterate all connection one fomerly felt for her three main charachters. (Harry, Hermione, and Ron)Unlike her previous works in the series she seemed to be forcing in information to be expounded upon later rather then writing from the heart and discovering the tidbits later. I felt throughout most of the book that I was waiting for something important and exciting to come but reached the end of the book before it arrived. Maybe what I was hopeing for might arrive at the begining of the next book? Unfortunately the next will probably manage to be even longer. Well heres to hoping the next book recieves more effort and less TIME.If you want something worth while reading, read The Lord of the Rings. It is only a little bit longer, but has much more depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel let down!","review":"This book was really bad. I am 10 years old and a great Harry Potter fan. This book was disappointing because it was not up to the standard of JK Rowling's other books. For one, it was too long and had a lacklustre beginning. And then, there was a lot of repetition of plots and ideas. I plan to write my thoughts to JK Rowling because it was so bad and felt extremely let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited all that time just for this!!!!!!","review":"This book is soooooooooooooo boring!!! There might have been a few exciting bits near the end but even 700 pages into the book I was still asleep. If you are a big fan of Harry Potter books I guess you will have to read this because it contains information you will need to know for book 6 and 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.K. has missed her mark -- and lost me as a reader","review":"This is the last Harry Potter book I plan to buy. I was thrilled with books 1 & 3, and I enjoyed books 2 & 4 almost as much. But in learning to develop her writing style, J.K. has turned a light-hearted, fun-to-read series into an adult melo-drama that seems to explore HER frustrations rather than engage me in the delight of reading about the adventures of Harry and friends. The latest book was almost humorless and definitely not an enjoyable read. My nephews have never finished the book...they stopped less than 1/3 the way in the book because it \\"wasn't fun to read.\\" I agree. With Harry showing little respect to Dumbledore towards the end of the book, I'm not sure I would WANT my nephews to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good because it was Harry Potter. Not for it's content.","review":"870 pages is a heck of a big book. However after the first 300 pages nothing much has happened and what has happened is rather poorly described. The plot slowly gets going and only after 800 pages does it really hit full stride. Then it finishes 10 pages after the final scene with you wishing that there was more. Not because the book was so interesting, but because the book didn't really say or do much.The main reason it was enjoyable was because the kids are still as mischevous as ever. Of the five books it is the least enjoyable of the five. Considering the hype and amount of time this book had taken I was quite diappointed.I reccomend this to someone who was read all the Potter books, for if this is the first Potter book a person reads they might not read any of the others.Read it because it is Harry Potter. Not because it is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings a new depth to Harry and the gang...","review":"Yes, it is long. Yes, there are parts that serve to define characters rather than advance the plot. But, for those readers who are invested in the characters and looking for more than a surface adventure, rewards await in this 870 page novel. A very different read from the first four, JK has masterfully captured maturing characters in a way that is uniquely her own. A real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's back!","review":"I will need to re-read this book because I know I read it so fast that I must have missed things. However, Harry does it again!Harry and company are growing up and it shows. Rowling captures the mercurial quality of Harry's emotions perfectly. How can anyone expect Harry to be perfectly civil all the time given what he has been through? There are plenty of foes this time around. Not just people, but, the emotional battles Harry must go through.Rowling sets the stage perfectly for the next books. She is clearly letting everyone know that she means business from here on out. To that end, this book was not *nearly* long enough.I don't understand why people are upset with the \\"dark\\" tones. Disney films are loaded with dark currents and imagery (not to mention, death).At any rate, it was a pleasure to be back in Rowling's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, as i expected","review":"The only problem with the book i had was that it was sooooo big, so it was hard to read COMFORTABLY! but other than that, i will not ruin it for people. I love the whole series of books, and this was wonderful. JK is so creative and imaginitive, i just can't believe it! I am in awe from the book, and I couldn't even put it down. It is always like i am right there in the book. I recommend this book to children, all ages, Adults any age. WHOEVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but overly long, no spoilers...","review":"A good book, nice continuation of the HP series. Interesting twists and turns in the plot and development of the characters. I enjoyed reading it, but it seems that the books could have used a little tighter editing. Just seems that at almost 900 pages that some parts of the book could have been left out since they didn't do much to forward the plot (of this book, could be used for future books) but just added page count."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...alreadly read it twice","review":"The book moves alarmingly FAST and ends like all the others.... I want more Harry Potter i cant wait for BOOK 6. It took 1 day to read the first time, I couldnt put it DOWN. With all the roumors leading up to i was worried at what could happen and still TOTALLY AMAZED. PICK UP BOOK 5 AND DONT PUT IT DOWN TILL YOUR DONE! Happy Reading Fellow Muggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Author in Need of an Editor","review":"The fifth installment in the Harry Potter series is as good as ever, and as long as the first three books combined. It's a thick, heavy book -- so much so that it's uncomfortable to lug around and even to hold as you read it.Rowling's prose is as thoughtful, entertaining, inventive, engrossing, moving, and well-crafted as ever -- there's just too much of it. There are so many small episodes during the school year that have little or no bearing on the story and could have easily been left out.One minor quibble that I have with Rowling's style is that the characters, no matter how nicely defined, are either totally good or totally evil. In each book I keep wishing for some shades of gray. \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" offers a tiny amount of grayness in Professor Snape and Petunia Dursley, but that's it.This is an incredibly good book, for both children and adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":"I am completely amazed at how BAD a book can be. If I had a dollar for all of the reason that I like this book, then I would not even have enough to buy a Pack Of Gum. I've read the other four and they are amazing. This one(#5) makes me feel like I was completely ripped off. Rowling obviously spent no time writting a book that would make him millions of dollars on the name alone.Amazingly Bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop reading!","review":"The Harry Potter Series is getting worse and worse! You could notice it in the 4th book and it was obvious in the 5th. The author is either writing only for money now,or she's becoming a worse author. I'm not even going to bother reading the 6th one. The book was like a soap opera. Everything was overdramatic. The ending was most dissapointing. I wont bore you with deatails. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats with all the hype?","review":"jk rowling has sold out! tthe first one was ok, second one, meh, third one, uhhhhh, fourth one, 900 pages!? what are they gonna do 4 the movie! fifth one, AGH thats allPS-the movies r gonna catch up to the books and eventually daniel radcliffe will be too old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This was the most boring book ever to be published, how can one author babble on about the same teen tantrums, and the same love sick kids and the same boring bad guy who is never caght! I happen to have loved the 1st-4th, and the 6th, but come on give me a break all of a sudden harry turnes into this angry, self centered, odd ball. Tell J>K> to get a hold of herself and publish a good final book!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS","review":"While I like all the books so far (1-5), the last two installments are just too dark and scary and gory for kids. They discuss instant death curse and pain-inflicting curses in detail, and all the killings are just too scary even for older kids. Furthermore, the parts about the tortures are just disgusting. I bet younger kids will have nightmare if they read those parts. The part on Harry secretly teaching other students about defense against dark arts doesn't help either. I don't recommend these two books (4&5) for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn attack on a one way street","review":"Seriously How can anyone stand this stupid book or any of them after the first. Once the first came out it was clear that Harry Potter was really popular and wouldn't stop for a while so a second book was written assuming the popularity of Harry Potter they would keep on writting books and having it turn out happy-ended. (Yawns again) it's the same plot over and over: Oh no! Something bad is happening at hog-warts. Zap, Zap, oops, aha, uh-oh, yeah we win! Same sequence over and over fits in halloween catagory and because of it's popularity people will keep giving the publishers money when the plot's all the same and the movies are just a good way to get away with being lazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DARKEST BOOK YET","review":"JK ROWLING'S NEWEST BOOK IS THE DARKEST ONE YET. HERE NOT ONLY HARRY IS AT HIS ANGRY BEST AND THIS IS THE BOOK WHERE........DIES.I WOULD NOT BE THE ONE TO SPOIL THE FUN FOR THE OTHER READERS,PLZ READ AND BE ENTHRALLED AS NEVER BEFORE.THIS IS THE BOOK WHERE FRED AND GEORGE LEAVES SCHOOL TO FOLLOW THEIR AMBITION,VOLDY(I'M NOT SCARED)RETURNS ONCE MORE WITH HIS LONG FINGERS AND HIS REPTILIAN FEATURES GLEAM WITH MALEVOLENCE,HERE CORNELIUS FUDGE REALIZES HIS TERRIBLE MISTAKE AND WE GET A SNEAK PEEK IN WHAT TYPE OF A CHILDHOOD SNAPE HAD.I HAVE RESERVED A TOTAL PARAGRAPH FOR DOLORES UMBRIDGE, THE BUBOTUBER PUS IN FORM OF A HUMAN WHO JOIN OUR HEROES AND MAKE THEIR LIFE HELL.READ IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Rowling has lived up to her expectation to please, the characters and greatly pronounced and vivid, along with the magical world of Hogwarts. A must-buy for Harry Potter fans and anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Sleep Draught!! Tedious and Uninspired","review":"A waste of time and money. Rowling must have thought she was writing a Tolstoy novel instead of a \\"can't put it down\\" thriller as in the first 4 books. Hopefully this will be rectified in the next volume.Although Harry's behavior is like that of a teenager,the book lacked cohesiveness and anything totally captivating.I am disappointed after all the hype and also after the quality of the previous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"YELLING AND LONG","review":"I enjoyed the book for the most part. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10. The problem I had with it was, I think, JK Rowling could have cut out some of the pages - about 150 of them. Harry is justifiably angry throughout the book but the YELLING/WHINING got a bit old. Dumbledore doesn't help him, in my opinion or Harry's opinion, or doesn't give him the emotional boost he usually does. I like what she did with George and Fred Weasley and Harry and the D.A. I think THAT professor for the Dark Arts should have been torn limb from limb by Grawl, but that's just me. I'm sorry who dies but I'm glad it wasn't one of the kids. Draco Malfoy could have gone with his father. I know that books 6 and 7 will be the culmination of Harry, Hogwarts, Dumbledore, et al. I certainly hope that Draco gets everything that he has coming to him three fold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surely not the best, but still.....","review":"Well, I've read the book six months ago, and I think it isn't the worst, nor the best. It's somewhere in between. I expected more from Joanne, and I daresay I'm a little bit dissapointed. The ending is perfect, but when I now look back, I see that the book was like a bridge to connect first four sequels and books six and seven, because nothing had happened, the book ends just like the fourth one did, nothing special in it. I really hope the upcoming books are going to fix that problem which the book 5 caused. The book is interesting, but I was very dissapointed when I realized that Quiditch isn't much of a deal in this book. I was very furious. My favs stayed the same: HP4,HP1,HP2,HP3. I'm waiting for the next book, til then BYE!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Horrible","review":"J.K. Rowling's new tale is, to put it simply: amazing. I gasped aloud several times during the first chapter alone.Harry Potter is a little older and a whole lot angrier. Even as he struggles to cope with the tragedies he experienced in his fourth year at Hogwarts, he has more hardships: attacks, a corrupt government, an appallingly cruel and sadistic Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and more death. Be forewarned: this book is not for young children. The events in this book are frightening, and the death of a major character can be traumatizing.It amazes me how a book in which the title character goes through so much hardship can be so wonderful at the same time. I read it in less than 12 hours. The spell Rowling cast with Harry Potter is far from over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Brilliant","review":"Couldn't put it down (obviously, as I received it the day before yesterday). I feel that each successive book has been darker and more thrilling than the one before, and Order of the Phoenix is the darkest yet. Ms. Rowling has the remarkable talent not just for creating a large cast of fascinating characters but for endowing them with astonishing depth and emotion... and the surprises never stop! Several passages brought tears, several hoots, and I lost most of one finger to gnawing through the exciting parts. As an adult fan and a mother, I would recommend parents read these novels prior to or together with your children, particularly the later installments. It's a fantistic world to share. Thank you, Ms. Rowling, for yet another classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"Rowling did a great job setting the tone for this book in the first chapter. She revisted several past threads, and threw in some tantalizing items to speculate on. When staid and shrill Aunt Petunia blurted out that dementors were the guards at the wizard prison of Azkeban, I was nearly knocked off my chair. The goings on at Hogwarts were equally interesting. I especially liked the potrayal of the new Defense of Dark Arts teacher, a poisonous queen bee if there has ever been one. Harry's expanding relationship with other Hogwarts students, and their formation of Dumbledore's Army, set up some promising prospects for the future. I was a bit disappointed at the end of the book, however. The secret being closely kept from both Harry and Voldemart seemed a bit of an anticlimax to me. I still enjoyed the book greatly. Any book that can keep both me and my 17 year old son home reading all weekend is quite rare, and precious indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocense lost","review":"The age of 15 was the worst year of my life. Revealing nearly every emotion tied to my adolescence, Rowling conjours a veracious portrayal of the human condition throughout Harry's latest adventure. You will despair as Harry's world crashes down around him, and dangle from the building blocks of hope with the resolve that destiny has placed it's mark, and for better or worse, you must see it through. Potter fans could not have dreamed for a better continuation, and is by far the best of the series. Brilliant. Nuclear. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I love Harry Potter and wanted a replacement for my battered second hand hardback copy of \\"Order of the Phoenix\\". I was really disappointed in the quality of this book and no jacket cover. It's much smaller than the one I own. This book has a hard cover but the quality of paper is equal to that of a paper back book. So if you want a quality hard back Harry Potter book, this isn't it. If you just want the book to read but not save, then save yourself some money and order a paperback copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"harry fan","review":"I believe that all the books should be read. they tell the whole story, there are so many things left out of the movies that you get to explore in the books..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Capturing, and Highly Imaginative","review":"While Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a hugely enthralling book, full of interesting plot twists, off-beat characters, and a very vivid background, this book is not without its problems.I find the weakest aspect of this book is Rowling's repeated use of devices such as dreams/visions to advance the plot, coupled with the last two chapters being dedicated to Dumbledore's explanation (similarily to three of the four previous Harry Potter Novels) instead of a more linear plot throughout the novel.The second problem I found were some of the unpalatable characters. Professor Umbridge was very flat, portrayed as a power-hungry, inept wizard, while Cornelius Fudge was shown to be an uncharismatic, paranoid fool, despite his election into office and years of service.Despite these problems, Rowling has written a truly amazing work. Empathy is impossible not to feel for the protagonists, the plot is gripping, and Harry continues to amaze us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought provoking","review":"The major theme is that of loyalty. It's amazing what the characters will do to stay loyal to Harry and to Dumbledore's cause. It is this loyalty, more than anything else, that creates the sort of desperate tone present throughout the book. This is definitely more for older readers, and the ending is very, very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and sad","review":"This book is much darker then the rest of the series: Hogwarts is under a fascist regime from the Ministry of Magic, Dumbledore seems to give Harry the cold shoulder, and Harry's connection to Lord Voldemort is growing stronger.After the events in the climax, the resolution does not bring the energy into an up swing. This is not a happily ever after finish.It is the use of dark images and feelings that make us realize how evil Lord Voldemort really is. Excellently written. If a child is reading the book, it should be discussed with him or her when finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"less would have been more","review":"I like the Harry Potter books and have read all 5 so far. This is my least favorite. It is too long and doesn't really have the oomph that the other books had. I imagine Rowling would not let her editor trim the book down and thus it suffers.The quality of the writing itself could use some improvement, too. Phrases are used too often. For example, everyone \\"turns on his/her heel\\" and Harry sees Cho and and his stomach \\"feels like he skipped a step going down stairs\\" more than once.I also was irritated that Rowling kept building up aspects of the plot and \\"dangling\\" them in front of you, but not giving it to you until the end. Then when we finally get it, it is fairly anti-climatic. This book doesn't really teach you anything new about the characters, it is mostly just there. The new things we do learn could easily fit into a book 1/10th the size of this one and not leave anything out.To sum up, the other HP books are good, this one was OK, but mostly a let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is by far the most captivating HP book yet!","review":"WOW WOW WOW and more WOW!!! J.K. Rowling is the best author! This book starts out with intense action, there is not one moment where the reading strays from the topic. There are so many different plots and problems weaving in and out of the text that the reader is constantly on their toes! I am on page 655 right now, getting really close to being done, and i must say, i am dreading the end of yet again another fascinating tale of Harry Potter! I hope the other two sequels will be along shortly, in a much quicker fashion than this one, but i will tell you, it was definatly worth the wait- if this is the only book you read in your life, i highly recommend it!!! 5+++++++++++ stars on my scale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the best","review":"Even though Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my personal favorite, Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix is a book that gets your heart and head pounding!

This one truely tore at my heart. To read and then feel Harry's hardships and how he felt about all the secrets kept from him, kept me so in touch with Harry and wondering about the rest of his world. These novels are show that humility, love, caring and determination can over come adversity. J. K. Rowlings has truly allowed the novels to grow up with the children/adults who are reading them. From the smaller novels to this one which was long, you are captivated by everything that happens. You truly come to hate the \\"villians\\" in the story. I can not wait until Book 6 comes out. Oh, to be Harry and slip away to his world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great continuation of the series (no spoilers)","review":"As JK Rowling promised, the Order of the Phoenix is darker and more intense than the previous books. While all of her books are rich with colorful characters and vivid imagery, OP surpasses them all. Several new characters are introduced, and many more aspects of the wizarding world are explored. It is exactly the kind of magnificent banquet that HP fans have been dying to gorge upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Edgier Harry","review":"After reading the first four books, I was anxiously awaiting the fifth installment. I was not let down. The book was pretty good. I enjoyed everything about the book except for Harry Potter. He is very stubborn, selfish and downright rude in this book. I thought he was more mature at 11 then he is at 15. Harry was extremely moody, not that I could blame him, he's been through a lot, but where is the Harry from books 1-4? Besides Harry's attitude problem the rest of the cast was great! New villians to hate, new hero's to love. Plus we got more insight into some of the old characters. Mrs. Rowling has such a great imagination, never would I have imagined all the plot twist and turns she put in. If you have not already, read it, you'll get use to Harry's attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voldemorts Plan Made No Sense!","review":"I really liked most of the book, although I would have enjoyed it more if it was a few hundred pages shorter (and without Cho Chang), however I did notice that Voldemort did not need to lure Harry into the Department of Mysteries when his Death Eaters were already there and most able to find the prophecy themselves. That's the only thing that bugged me! Otherwise, the story's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Latest Potter Book Does Not Disappoint","review":"Though it takes a while to get going, this was a thoroughly enjoyable read. Rowling did a wonderful job of not making things too predictable and, though I feared the worst, the ending was wonderful. I'm already looking forward to book 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP fans, hang onto your broomsticks, it's a wild ride!","review":"Too long? No way -- we love Potter and we don't want the fun to end. The opening line of \\"year 5\\" is deceivingly quiet. Before the first chapter is over, Harry and his ignorant cousin Dudley are attacked by Lord Voldemort's dementors, and the action continues on a fast pace. The drama seems heightened by Harry's teenaged angst (when we were teens, everything was a drama, wasn't it?). Another plus, if you've followed the series, is finding out more about some of the more curious characters: Snape. James Potter. The bumbling Neville and what happened to his parents. At the center remains the friendship among Harry, Hermione, and Ron, though their bonds are tested to the straining point. The concluding chapters were too engrossing to put down, so keep an hour or two set aside once you get to chapter 33."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","review":"Overall, I am very disappointed in this book. I have enjoyed the others very much, and I expected the same from this volume. The book is entirely too long. I feel as though the entire story could have been told in no more than 300 pages. Harry Potter comes across as a very sullen, moody, unhappy person. It's very monotonous to read over and over Harry screaming at people, moping around, mad at everyone, etc, etc. The other characters aren't much better either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Number 5 is a charm!","review":"This book was better than expected. When I bought the book, I wanted to hurry home and read it. To me, The Goblet of Fire was excellent but The Order of the Pheonix was brilliant. I have one work for J.K. Rowling... GENIUS!!! Excellent storyline. This is automatically the best book of the five books that have come already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"I have read all five of the harry potter book and I have even read the first four to my little sister. However the book seem to be getting worse as they go. The order of the phoenix is the worst of the five. Nothing exciting happened during the first 500 hundred pages or so. They could have made this book half as long and it would have been twice as good. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you have read the other four and want to keep up with the books then I would read it, but there are a lot better books to read for your summer reading. If you do not have lots of time on your hand and your not 12 or under don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Order of Phoenis","review":"I received number 5 by owl delivery from Amazon the day it was released and started reading right away. I put the book down only to pick it back up Aug 3/03. Although I found it easy the first time to put down, once I started reading again I couldn't part with it. J.K. Rowling is a brilliant writer. I will admit that Harry's anger was starting to get on my nerves however, it makes sense in the end. Like Albus Dumbledore, I had forgotten what it's like to be a teenager. I'm a late HP fan. I only started reading the series when number 4 came out. I read them all within 1 week! Thanks J.K. Rowling for sharing your talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but not as good as the other","review":"I waited in suspence for three years for this new book. I got it at midnight when it came out and spent the entire next day and most of the night reading it. It was a amazing book, surpricing, sad, funny ect.....and I dont have many complaints. The only thing that bothered me was Umbridge(she annoyed the crap out of me) and Harry's temper. I was also upset that my favorite character Ron wasn't in it very much. After all he is Harry's best friend! Anyways it was a great book and I would say it was my third fav book in the series, falling behing POA and GOF. So go out and read it you may be a little dissapointed in parts but you will have a great time reading it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far...","review":"This is the best of the series! The way J.K. Rowling developed the characters (old and new) was amazing. You begin 2 find another side to Harry which makes him more human and not the hero you're used to. All the problems that Harry faces this year, from the Daily Prophet's cruel words about him to loathsome Professor Umbridge, get very frustrating for him, but with friends like Ron and Hermione everything seems a lot easier. This is a must read over the summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling chapter but otherwise not that good","review":"The chapter 'Beyond the veil' is absolutly thrilling. The description of the fight along with the timely arrival of various people is too good. The description of every detail is amazing.But beyond this there no peak exicitment phase. Harrys Outburst on Dumbledore is surprising considering Harrys respect for him. The first few chapters are a bit boring. harrys quarell with Cho is not very realistic.Any it is quite a decent book. Probably just better than 'Goblet of fire' and just worse than 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. I finished in 1.5 days so i guess its quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice edition indeed.","review":"A very nice book. Binding superb, and kudos to Gran Pre for the new Artwork. A nice edition of a nice book of a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!","review":"SO ENTERTAINING I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE 6TH ONE TO COME OUT I LOVED IT SOOOO MUCH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Harry Potter book!","review":"J.K. Rowling has done it again. The world she creates is so rich that it just envelopes the reader and makes you lose all track of time.I agree with the other reviewer about the person she chose to kill, as they were my favorite character, and that's why the 4 star rating. Though I think she may have left an opening for them to reappear later. See Harrys last conversation with Luna Lovegood.My only other complaint is I waited so long for this book, finished it in less than a week, and now have to wait probably 3 years for the next one! Get writing, Ms. Rowling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry is better than ever!","review":"This book is so good. If you've read the first 4 Harry Potter books this is a must read. If you havn't, read the first 4 so you can read this one! The tone of this book is much darker than even the Goblet of Fire, but it is right for this part of the series. Harry is much angrier too. You find out alot about what happened in the wizarding world before the first book. This book is reaaly long at 870 pages. But once you start you don't want to put it down! I can't wait for book 6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling Does It Again: Pure Magic","review":"Amazing...trully amazing. Harry Potter's fifth year at Hogwarts is his finest and darkest hour yet. Line after line, page after page, chapter after chapter, book after book, the series only gets better and better. If the quality of the book were measured by heat, Ootp is fresh magma from Mt. Fuji--no pun intended. I've read the book twice already and my wife nearly wants a divorce. Though Harry is not as likable in this book, the other characters pick up his slack. I hate the English but boy do I love their literature and those delicious biscuits. No I'm not talking about breakfast biscuits. I'm refering to cookies, the silly English call them biscuits. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had a hard time putting it down!","review":"The fifth installment of the Harry Potter series was most definitely NOT a disappointment!Be forewarned that the book is much darker than the others in the series (we read the others aloud to our young daughter, and she enjoyed them immensely, but I will probably not do so with this one). This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who read the fourth book--it didn't end on a note that would lead you to believe happiness was forthcoming.That said, it is clear that Rowling has NOT lost her touch! The suspense starts by the second page and barely lets up to allow you to catch your breath. In spite of the overall dark tone, there are still light moments, snatches of happiness for our beloved characters, and of course, flashes of humor!I would say it was definitely worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing, of course","review":"As an avid reader of the last 4 books, I scurried to pre-order this book in january as soon as it went on sale. When it arrived on June 21, I spent the entire day engrossed in the pages, and was not disappointed in the amazing story that unfolded before me. Harry goes through all the emotions that any 15 year old does - self pity, angst, anger, puppy love, & guilt over feelings he has. As I read, I was swept away into memories of similar emotions growing up. Rowling hits it right on the head. Some might complain at the length, but I cherished every adjective & description that make Hogwarts so real. Reading this swept me away into a world that I can't wait to re-visit when I re-read each book over and over. Bring on book 6!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad Reader","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm CRAZY about Harry Potter books, but the 5th book as let me very disapointed. I was eagerly awaiting the 5th book, I stayed all night at a Harry Potter PArty just so I could be one of the first people to get the new book. Usually Harry Potter books are the kind of book that you can't put down, can't sleep until you finish it. Well with book 5 I could have put it down at any moment and been perfectly fine. The book was WAY to long, and the story seemed to just keep dragging on and on. At the end you finaly get some action BUT THEN SHE KILLS Off ONE O THE COOLEST CHARCTER!!!!!!!! I really hope that JK comes up with something that measures up to her first 4 books, for her 6th book, until then though, I will remain, A Sad Reader :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Our friend Mr. Potter","review":"How Mr. Potter has changed over the past 5 years. This book is darking than the previous four but for good reason. Harry is growing up and is going through a lot of changes. J.K. Rowling is a master at story telling. I enjoyed this book. A bit to long but a wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter and the order of the phonenix","review":"Harry potter and the order of the phoneix.I would reccomend this book to others because youhave so much fun reading it and its all you want to do. It is funny, and scary.When you're reading it you feel like you're the one in the book.my favorite chacacater is Ron because he always has to deal with harry getting all the attention.My favorite part is when harry is teaching defense against the dark arts. Because he is having so much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Book!","review":"This book is the best book I ever read out of the whole Harry Potter series. Harry Potter and the Order Of Pheonix is definetly a book for the reader who likes adventure, mystery, and magic. This is definitly a good read! You need to check it outat your local library as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Harry Potter, so far","review":"This is the best book of the series. It is very dark, though. If you haven't read the book, please don't read any further.I am kinda mad that they killed off Sirius...It is an interesting theory that he isn't dead, but I don't happen to think that it is at all possible... Hmmm maybe it is possible. All it does is just make me wanna read Book 6.My next topic is the thestrals... they are cool. I also thought it was neat that you could only see them if you had seen someone die.A topic that touched close to my heart, was when Luna \\"Loony\\" Lovegood mentioned the reason that she could see thestrals was because her mom died when she was 9. The reason why this is something that I mentioned, is that my mom died when I was 2, and my friend's mom died when he was 7.That part actually made me cry......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Any Potter Fan!","review":"I admit, I'm one of those moms who loves Harry Potter and his adventures. I got hooked on it from the first book on tape, read by the truly amazing Jim Dale. I've listened to every book since then on tape. I have to admit, I was disappointed when he wasn't in the first two movies - I do hope they put him in one of the future ones! This book is much longer than previous ones and I was almost afraid to get to the end. The characters are memorable, as usual, especially the new ones (some of whom are especially nasty). I don't want to give anything away to those who haven't read or heard the book yet, but hang on until the end - it's well worth the \\"trip.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one yet!","review":"I made sure I was up at the crack of dawn so I could get this book.

These are for 'kids' of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected at all","review":"My rating would be like 2.5. The book started off so good it was really interesting, I was so excitied because I love these books! I was upset after reading the entire middle finding out it was not as interesting as it was said to be. I did not like the ending of the book though, just one word TWO, how can there be two? But, I loved the hints Rowling threw at us. I knew what was going on the entire time. I expected more from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is growing up...","review":"and the world is not a nice place. Harry suffers from being a teenager, and we know how tough that is! But even worse, he is not allowed to know certain vital bits of information because he is still perceived as being too young! He is being protected by those who care for him the most - and it may cost him more than he can bare to face! A very different story now, Harry's life and those of his friends are being affected by the truly dangerous place that the world has turned out to be, far worse than Harry's darkest dreams...An altogether marvelous and wonderfully deepening story - please, JK, please don't keep us waiting another three years for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"short but sweet","review":"The Harry Potter books are all sweet but this one has everything and more. Harry kicks some serious butt and has a bit of a temper. There's more wand duels and its sweet because everyone participates in helping the cause. Well except Fudge, who in the last book did not believe Harry. He is a real pain in this one. It only took me 16 hours to read this and I hope the next one is twice as long. I have just one more thing to say and that is READ this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"And your point is...","review":"I'm sorry, but this book was pointless. Even worse, it seemed bent on making us all hate the characters. Ok, Harry's a teen, but does he have to be a brat? And does his 40 year old godfather have to be worse? Not to mention Snape, of course, and Umbridge. What exactly is she trying to prove with the parallels between Sirius and Harry, anyway? I had a hard time caring what happened to Harry, and frankly it was kind of a relief when Sirius well...you know. Why did Harry love this creep anyway?? Sorry, but this book was way off course. She would have done better to allow Harry to develop some kind of meaningful relationship with an adult--if not Sirius, why not Lupin?--for once. He needed Sirius, Sirius needed Harry, and JK turned let them both down and turned them into incredibly nasty people. So nasty, in fact, that it's hard to understand what motivates them to fight evil. Why doesn't Harry just go over to the dark side and stay there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace","review":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in my opinion was a complete fiasco made sheerly out of anger, hatred, and confusion. The very end of the book where Dumbledore explains everything does not explain anything at all, and his excuse for not telling Harry over the years does not make sense at all. Harry supposedly is entering puberty with his hormones. He needs anger management desperately. Still a complete fan of Rowling, this book seems like a major set back from her first four fantastic books. I hope she isn't losing her touch, but it sure seems like it with her latest addition to the Harry Potter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book","review":"Very awesome book! Very detailed but wished Harry's personality didn't make it so \\"evil\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!","review":"This book is, in my opinion the absolute best book in the series so far. It explains Harry's struggles in life as he approaches the end of his time at Hogwarts in almost unimaginable depth, along with just about everything else in the book. This book is the best of the series because of all the mystery, excitement, and anxiety that J.K. Rowling has put in. Sure, the other books were good too, but this book has darker plots, deeper meanings to the smallest things, and much more insight into Harry's past...and even his future...This is the best book in the Harry Potter series! I very highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't already read it yet...and I highly anticipate the next addition to this fabulous tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is book 6???","review":"Book 5 was really good and intense. But I would have to say that it is my second favorite to The Prisoner of Azkaban which is my favorite of all five. But I am getting very impatient for book 6. You don't here anything about it, what it is going to be titled or anything. I really hope it comes out soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been better","review":"This movie was just OK. Considering the actors involved, I expected better acting. A movie with the title \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find\\", should have focused more on what a \\"good man\\" endures and tries to accomplish in his everyday life.The lead male character is a blue-collar worker who is married to a newly accomplished MBA graduate. The husband has paid for her education and at one point in the movie she practically emasculates him by saying that his brain is small and she should have never married a blue-collar man. Oddly enough, her despicable behavior in this scene is never addressed again in the movie. This is one of the things that is experienced by many good men in the African-American community. A man who tries to be the best man he can be, but is constantly berated by his woman, because he drives a bus, or cleans floors. The movie could have dealt with this on some level, but failed to really make a point in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I loved the dvd. It arrived in good condition.

My son is so pleased with these tunes that he has already has the CD loaded on his IPod and has listened to it several times since receiving it just yesterday! I've had the pleasure of listening to it as well and I think the recording sound quality is excellent. The music was recorded at two different places in France about 30 years ago with detailed liner notes that are written in French with English translations.

The CD contains syrupy, overproduced and uninspired versions of children's songs that simply do not interest my children.

It is very relaxing, and it makes you feel warm all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a kids CD, but magical nonetheless...","review":"This CD is much more about grownup kids than kid kids. Of course, there are things here that kids will love. The melodies are beautiful...the arrangments lush and peaceful. But it's more a nostalgic look back at the music of childhood from an adult's perspective. The song selection is very strong: Rainbow Connection, House at Pooh Corner (with a third verse about passing down the magical tradition of Pooh to your children), All the Pretty Little Ponies, The Last Unicorn...the truth is, there's not a weak cut on the album. In our household, this disc is beloved by adults and kids alike. If you love great music...and have a heart for good music targeted toward kids, it's hard to see how you could be disappointed in any way with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite CD","review":"I bought this for my sweet little ones and it has become mine and their favorite CD! I can't say enough wonderful things about this sweet and tender collection. The music is perfect for the simple and treaseure filled childhood I work so hard at creating for my children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lullabies for \\"Children\\" of Any Age","review":"Another reviewer said 5 stars were not enough. I totally agree! I bought this CD for myself, just because I love Kenny Loggins. The beautiful songs have helped me relax after many a difficult day.I couldn't wait to become a grandmother, so I could share this music with my grandchildren. I am now awaiting the arrival of my 5th grandchild! I know she will love it, too!At Baby Showers for \\"first time parents,\\" this CD is tucked in among any other gift I buy. I always receive a phone call after the recipient listens to the CD for the first time.Thank you Kenny Loggins for creating a CD that is loved by so many generations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We call it the \\"Magic CD\\"...","review":"Long before I was suitable dating material, my wife bought this for her own enjoyment. With the arrival of our son, we've found the music to be powerful, calming lullaby magic in both the minivan and his bedroom. It is perhaps the most familiar sound to him as he passes in to dreamland. And we haven't gotten (too) tired of it either.There are a bare handful of albums that seem evergreen, even on repeated listens (I think of the Indigo Girl's first album, George Winston's December, the Jackson 5's greatest hits... your taste may vary). This is one such album. Buy it for yourself, and for your children. Sweet dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift to Parent and Child","review":"If you don't receive this CD as a gift, buy it for you and your child. Some of my sweetest memories are of rocking my children to sleep while listening to this CD and it's the gift I ALWAYS buy for baby showers. It's a gift that parent and child can enjoy for years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids and parents","review":"I recently saw Kenny Loggins perform songs from this CD, I wasn't really a fan before, but I am now. He said this CD is for kids and parents and it really is. My 3 month old baby listens to it until she goes to sleep and my husband and I finish listening to the rest of it. It has interesting arrangements and great harmony and is very relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny Loggins Return to Pooh Corner","review":"My 10 month old son loves this CD from the first note to the last. He hums along to it and looks lovingly at the CD player. He is a mellow man after listening to Return to Pooh Corner, perfect for naptime or bedtime. I remember most of the songs as favorites from my childhood. It is wonderful to share these special songs to my child."},{"rating":"2","title":"soothing and reminiscient","review":"Not only would this album be good to send babies off to sleep (Loggins tested the songs on his own five kids), it's a good way to de-stress for adults, too, though maybe a little oversweet in parts. The poignant nostalgia of the revamped House at Pooh Corner, the sweet longing of Somewhere Out There and Neverland, and the wry humor of Paul Simon's St. Judy's Comet are great to play on your way to a rough day at work, or while driving home from one. This appeal should also help keep parents from getting sick of the album when kids request it every night for a year, as they always seem to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i wanted","review":"I ordered the text intro to finance but received the study guide. So now I am right back where I started with 3 weeks left in class."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'm holding up my smoking gun...\\"","review":"Miranda Lambert's stunning debut album, Kerosene is a great mix of slow and uptempo songs. I don't normally care for country music, actually this album is my first country record and Lambert delivers an almost perfect disc. Standout tracks include: Kerosene, Me and Charlie Talking, There's a Wall, Love is looking for you, Greyhound bound for nowhere, I wanna Die, Bring me Down, and Mama I'm Alright. The rest of the tracks are kind of boring so I can't give this album five stars. The title-track is kick-ass! Such a cool and liberating song. Me and Charlie Talking is sweet and romantic, the first time I heard this song I was hooked. Her ballads are really strong, she has a knack and a talent for writing catchy and haunting melodies. I see a huge career ahead for Miss Lambert, can't wait til her next album, she is the real thing. This album is worth a listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh new voice to Country music!","review":"After seeing Miranda Lambert on Nashville Star, I knew the contest's results would yield more than one new \\"Nashville Star\\". Miranda's voice is a breath of fresh air in an industry where female artists often sound alike. This CD is a terrific start for this new face in Nashville. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. And I can't help but think what a great duet Track 5, \\"I can't be bothered,\\" would make with another Nashville Star sensation, Jody Evans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listen","review":"Never been a fan of country music. I heard about Miranda Lambert from watching the Voice competition. I checked out this CD. Now I am a fan of Ms. Lambert. She has a beautiful voice. I would recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing talent","review":"Miranda Lambert's cd is full of songs that anyone can relate to. She is a talented young woman. She writes her own songs. Her voice is beautiful. This cd is a must buy for country fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Debut Album","review":"After I heard Miranda's 2 main singles Small Town and New Strings I got both her cd's straight away. This album in particular just blew me away. She is very different to a lot of mainstream country artists and this can be heard in some of her lyrics like in Kerosene. Not only the fast songs like that one, but Bring Me Down and Greyhound Bound For Nowhere are not your usual country radio type songs either. Once I read the liner notes and saw she wrote most of this herself I grew even more respect for her. A great talent that should go a long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great country album!","review":"I bought this album after seeing her music video \\"Me and Charlie Talking\\" and after listening to the whole cd, I was really impressed! Miranda dosen't seem to be going for the current pop-rock/top 40 country career. Her songs do well on the charts because her music is reminisent of the traditional country/blue-grass genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"RANTASTIC ALBUM!","review":"MIRANDA ROCKS!I saw her in concert last week and it was unbelievable.

After I heard it once I was hooked.Miranda has a one of a kind voice that can not be compaired to anyone else. If you like good ole down home country tunes..this is the album for you.My favorite song on this album is, I Wanna Die. It's all about meeting that guy, you know you shouldn't be with. But you have no choice and if you're going to get burned...you want a fire!This album has a good mix of good ole toe tappin country as well as slow beautiful balads. If you're looking for someone to compaire her to (which you really can't), then I guess you could compaire her to Shelly Fairchild mixed in with a little Gretchen Wilson on the side?This is an album that if you are a true country music fan, you can not do without. Expect GREAT things from this little lady in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"I didn't think that I would love this CD, but it really surprised me.I really love the song \\"Greyhound Bound for Nowhere\\".

Miranda isn't just an average country singer, she's amazing.Every song on this album is beautiful and enjoyable to listen to unlike some albums that you have to skip songs.Miranda is also a songwriter and wrote most of this album.This chick is the real deal! I would give her more than 5 stars if I could. If you haven't purchased this album go get it or buy it here on amazon. You will not be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I was seriously taken aback by how much i enjoyed this cd. I didnt do what i normally do and listen to snippets beforehand. I wanted to see if could get a cd and just enjoy it straight from jump. I did in a big way with Kerosene. Miranda Lambert is a seriously talented artist and just as good songwriter. She has a hand in almost every song on the whole cd and i can't help but feel that touch on all of the songs on her debut cd. I know that it did well overall not that it would have mattered. i still would have made the choice to purchase this cd by a stunning up and coming artist no frills, no gimmicks or anything just natural talent and that is why i really enjoy not only Kerosene but music in general. You have a new fan in me Miranda. Keep on doing what you love and people will be there to buy it. You rock, best of luck..awesome debut CD.Favs - Kerosene, Greyhound Bound For Nowhere, I Can't Be Bothered and There's A Wall (all of the rest rock as well)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great tires","review":"The best tires i have bought for my motorized beach cruser bike(26\\"murray beach cruser) because they have wire beet in them.

It so reinforces the stereotype of 'girl' singers. When 6 out of 10 song titles either start or end with the word love, you know something is wrong. I don't have anything against love songs, but there's no need to be so squishy about it. In some songs, you can hear traces of her trademark gutsy drawl. I only recommend this for die hard fans or people who appreciate early 1980's pop country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Solid Cookbook With A Texas Orientation","review":"As my rating of cookbooks has been classified by some as rather demanding, please understand that 4 stars is not a slight.

This book just about covers every single one of them. Not just do they talk about the pros and cons of each of the schools listed, but they also explain to the reader what they should expect once leaving film school. This is a vital part and it may not be something a film school hopeful whould have at the top of their lists of deciding factors in a film school. But as Kelly and Edger explain, some schools prepare students for the movie industry better than others, and they are not always the ones you might think of. The only drawback I could find was that they don't list MA programs. The fact is there are many good MA programs out there in film. But they do explain why they don't and I tend to agree with them. None the less I would love to see them come out with a book that rates 25 MA film programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm glad i bought this","review":"I am actually looking for undergraduate programs and this book seems to focus more on graduate degrees but it was useful anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rating of various graduate-school, film programs.","review":"I am a high school senior applying to film schools across the country, and I found FILM SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL to be a very helpful book. Not only did it rate the film-schools in various categories , but it also gave an in-depth analysis on each program and an HONEST review of each program. The reviews of each film-school are given from the perspective of a student, rather than a perspective from a teacher. Unfortunetly, the book focuses on Graduate-film studies, rather than undergraduate studies (but the book is still helpful). About 40 of America's top film-schools are reviewed. In conclusion, I would have to say that this book is a MUST-BUY for anyone who is thinking about attending film-school. It gives concise and honest reviews on most of the top film schools in the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, but should have known better!","review":"I knew this dvd would not be worth the price, but I was lured in by my 2 yr olds love of the Higglytown Heroes and JoJo.

We have another Playhouse Disney holiday vhs from a few years ago and it was the same thing, one holiday episode and the rest not holiday at all. While my kids and I love Playhouse Disney, you would be much better off recording the shows yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Military families!!","review":"My children love this video. However, I will not let them watch it. I was very upset with the Higglytown Heroes episode. Twinkle sings about Christmas and that you can't have Christmas without your family around you.

The secondary cutting edges are at the top and bottom in the picture and only extend in a 1/2\\" or so from the outer edge.It goes without saying (but I will anyway :)) that a bit this large MUST be used in a router table and run at a slower speed.

The lush melodies combined with her vocals and guest harmonies make it a treat to listen to anytime you need to relax. \\"Moon and Me\\" is my favorite.

When you become a parent -- you better understand your connection to God and how he must also feel about us! I frankly believe that if God (or whatever you choose to call him) were in our lives more -- we would be in a lot better shape as a people!My son asks for it now that he's 2-1/2 and sings some of the songs.

The songs are very soothing, with wonderfully sweet lyrics that are easy to sing to your baby. When we're having trouble settling our baby, I put this music on, and it almost always does the trick.A previous reviewer complained that some of the songs had a religious overtone, and I just wanted to clarify, that while this is true (and something that I like about it), that it is not specific to any particular religion.

Thinking about the lyrics still brings tears to my eyes, even though they were first introduced to our family over seven years ago. My son did NOT like to sleep prior to toddlerhood, but popping this CD in and swaying around our living room with him in my arms always knocked him out, if only for a little while. Years later, my strong-willed four-year-old melts into a puddle of goo when I sing \\"The Moment I Saw You\\" to him at bedtime. That song in particular is such a sweet and simple articulation of the love between parent and child. Now that we're expecting a third, I realized that it's time to replace this CD because I can't imagine not giving our third child the same warmth and tenderness that these songs with their simple melodies and sweet lyrics have provided to our older two.

This is a tired sleeper, even for a child. I removed it from my collection. As far as her other c d's, they are ok....but nothing really stands out, or hooks you. Lotta Love, is the winner. If you were to buy just one c d...I think her Best Hits would be your best bet. Love her vocals, always have. She just never found a formula that would work for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum for Baby","review":"Prospective purchasers should listen to the tracks before picking up this baby. Personally, I think this is an awful album. I didn't know anything about it when I purchased it. All the tracks have that annoying electric symphony stuff, and Ms. Larson's singing reminds me of the Tiffanies and Debbie Gibsons of yesteryear (or current teenage bubblegum artists). One thing that really disappointed me about the CD was that I was hoping the songs would be arranged in such a manner that I would be able to sing along, eventually learning to sing them by myself. But with all the heavyhanded symphonic activity, the songs are not conducive to singing along, and frankly I find the album repetitive and difficult to listen to. I would give it zero stars but that isn't possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone actually like this?","review":"Really can't stand this CD.

I just finished listening to this album for the first time, and as I did, I looked her name up on the net and was stunned to read that she left us over three years ago. I admit that I was not a huge fan of Nicolette's during her heyday in the seventies, but this is pure gold, a loving collection of gently arranged songs (traditional, comtemporary and newly written) that any child will find soothing and comforting. I will play this for my children often, and honor the memory of a woman who left us something unique and wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this is an excellent lullabye cd for infants & mom","review":"I bought the cassette tape before my daughter gave birth. I wanted some new lullabye's to sing to my new grandchild. As I love Nicolette Larson, I was surprised to see this tape. I did not know she did a childrens music tape. I loved it. The songs are very meaningful if there is a baby in the family. My grand daughter is now 3 months old, and I never tire of listening to the tape in my car. It calms me while I am driving. The music is pleasant and the words mean quite a lot. I especially like to sing these songs to my grand daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"full of wonderful bedtime lullabys","review":"I was given this cd before my son was born and listened to it at night at bedtime; now he loves it.

The sound is nice and loud and it is so lightweight (Flash Memory vs Hard Drive)that I take it on my bicycle rides.

The heart is extremely large and heavy, measuring over 1 1/2 inches wide and 1 inch tall. It weighs very heavily on the delicate chain. At this size, the finish is way too shiny and reflective. Perhaps if on a thicker chain, or even a shorter chain, the pendant would not weigh down and pull as much. This is definitely not a piece for every day wear, which is what I was looking for.This necklace is gorgeous, and I love the message, but I don't want to spend more money and time trying to find an appropriate chain and I'd rather wear something not so large.If you're looking for something like this, and also don't want an extremely large piece, check out the \\"Far Fetched\\" line by \\"Something Silver\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving Image","review":"Worst purchase online!

It was hard for me even to get through this text. A trusted friend of mine was a close associate of Agnes Sanford and trusted her implicitly, witnessing many very beautiful and freeing healing events at her hands which were hands of Love. Ms. Grumprecht's book is a rigid, narrow look at a person of great integrity and deep Christian faith...\\"by their fruits ye shall know them...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentalist Christians","review":"Some very literal-minded Fundamentalist Christians will love this book. However, people who have open minds and hearts and who believed Jesus when he said, \\"The Kingdom is Within\\" will not care for it. Gumprecht uses unbelievably rigid scriptural interpretations to justify slamming one of the greatest healers of the 20th century. She obviously has so much fear of her own past traumas that she asks the reader to believe that Jesus wants us to avoid our own memories (many conscious people call this \\"living in deep denial\\"). Gumprecht is the type of religious person who is very threatened by people whose experience of God is different from her own. Unless you are also this type of religious person, you won't like the book.Thank you Agnes Sanford for making the world a better place and for helping so many people understand that God really wants us to heal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abusing the bible","review":"Let me sum up this book, the author disagrees with everything Agnes Sanford said, did or stood for except when she ( sanford ) indulges in some self criticism. The author uses her detailed knowledge of the bible, puts her own ( influenced ) interpretation on it and then uses this to somehow disprove sanfords theology as demonic! The author accepts that the bible in its present form is as originally written despite many translations and re-interpretations (eg I am told that some very old versions of the bible have no references to hell ). Sanfords book \\"The healing light\\" is a message of hope and Love. This book fosters doubt and despair, the author sits in judgement of sanford, I dont know why she has taken the time to write it. I think it will appeal to all christian zealots who are easily influenced, critical and on the authors similar vague quest for recognition and re-assurance, possibly other members of the \\"we are on earth to suffer\\" brigade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear is a powerful driver","review":"This poor frightened author! How very very sad to operate from a base of fear so powerful that one must condemn any who vary the slightest in their belief or approach. Agnes Sanford did good work and devoted her life to helping others. Most fundamentalists declaring that anyone different from themselves is BAD are simply very frightened people. By attacking and condemning others they make themselves feel a little bit more secure in a world that is scary and at times overwhelming. I am so sorry she is spewing this vitriol in an attempt to feel safer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This books thoroughly and scripturally exposes the grave danger that is predsent because we have, somtimes innocently, allowed pop psychology and New Age thought to filter into the church disquised as Biblical truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not dissagree more with this author","review":"Bad writhing Book you have senses when you read this book that the author Jane Gumprecht's have some suffer from some serious kind of mental problemI don't believe any word in this bad writhing Book makes me sleepyHorrible book don't waste your money to bay this Book not worth it even to read this worst crapp ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you intrigued...","review":"There is no other word to describe how I felt about this movie but INTRIGUED.

I was a huge fan of Olivia Goldsmith's First Wives Club and even though this is written by a different author, thought it might be a fun tale of the other side of the coin. I couldn't have been more wrong. Four vapid, self-absorbed women who, each in their own way, cut a married man from the herd and roped him in through deceit and sexual conquest, get together once a month to kvetch about the first wives and whine. This read like a bad soap opera with none of the women experiencing any real growth or moments of self-realization. Even the conflicts are solved by happenstance, not by any mature action by the characters. The razor sharp wit described in the blurb is non-existent. The only time I laughed was when one of the protagonists got hit by a car. And that was because I was thrilled to see at least one of these catty broads got knocked down.

I bought \\"Jar of Flies\\" after hearing \\"I Stay Away\\" and \\"No Excuses\\" on the radio. They are such amazing songs, but the amazing thing is that the best songs on the album aren't even heard on the radio. \\"Don't Follow\\" is a fantastic song with an unimaginably great harmonica solo underlaid by a toe-tapping grove set up by Sean Kinney and Mike Inez. However, the pinnacle of this album has to be \\"Nutshell.\\" This song has been my favorite Alice in Chains song ever since my first experience of this song. The simple beauty and heart-wrenching lyrics are enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm-sounding CD is change of pace for AIC","review":"This is the perfect album to listen to by a warm fire in the dead of winter, where I actually first heard it back in 1993. From the low and throbbing intro of 'Rotten Apple' to the jazzy 'Swing on This,' the guys in Alice in Chains pulled off a stunning, creative and unexpected album in their prime. The songs come off as intimate, relaxing and homey, while the lyrics are isolated and dark, at times describing the band's loathing of an invading media that pursued them in the early '90s. AICs' desire to just be left alone, away from the media frenzy, is once again evident in spades here. Though 'Jar of Flies' is short -- only seven songs -- it somehow seems just right. The band easily could have added three more sleepy tracks, but maybe it was for the best that they didn't. I would recommend this album even to people who hate AICs' normally grinding sound. It's that different from their standard stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"1. Rotten Apple: A+2. Nutshell: A3. I Stay Away: A+4. No Excuses: A+ (me favorite)5. Whale and Wasp: A6.

They show great versatility with this alb","review":"AIC's album \\"dirt\\" use to be my favorite album of theirs. \\"Dirt\\" was a heavy and dark album. The songs made you want to peel yourself off the wall. \\"Jars of flies\\" is dark but it is not as heavy. The combination of an acoustical sound and the screach from Layne Staley, and the smooth voice of Cantrell they acomplish a sound unheard of before. The best song is \\"Don't Follow,\\" they employ a harmonica and it gives a feel you have never heard befoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Softer side of Dirt","review":"This is one of the better albums from Alice in Chains, albums, not Compilations. This is a softer version of Dirt, and just as Dirt was not heavily diverse, nor is this EP. This EP is all slow jam rock, when you are sitting with your friends passed out for whatever reason this will be on. The highlights of the EP are I Stay Away, which had great radio airplay and sticks in the mind of many with its great vocals and lyrics. No Excuses is mostly acoustic before it kicks into a rock guitar and a slightly reverbed chorus. It is also a bit more peppy than any of the other songs on this EP. Whale And Wasp is probably named this because of its whaling guitar, while a bass guitar and what sounds to be a cello hum along. This is a totally soft instrumental, but a good addition to a soft CD. Swing On drifts through with a country feel with a harmonica, a light guitar and lyrics of deep thoughts. Good EP, however it is quite short like much Alice In Chains releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I were stranded on an island...","review":"I would *need* to have this album with me and something to play it on.

I know 2 hits came off of this: \\"No Excuses\\", and \\"I Stay Away\\", but they stink as well as \\"Whales and Wasp\\". It's a shame that they rushed this out after breaking through big time with \\"Dirt\\", but I guess the label knew best. The best on here is \\"Swing On This\\". This is another bad memory of my first few months in FL."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest EP of all time? I say yes!!!","review":"Hopefully you already know by now that Alice In Chains was easily one of the most talented,underrated bands of the 90's. With that said this in my opinion is their finest hour and greatest musical offering. This is where it all came togther. With Layne and Jerry's voice blending together over Jerry's guitar playing and the incredible musicianship of the rest of the band, everything just comes together to create some of the most soulful, heartfelt music you could hope for. The absoulte greatest thing about this cd though is that it features, \\"I Stay Away\\" which is possibly their greatest songs. This cd is easily worth twice the price so just go out and buy it damnit!

Last April 20th, the ROck 'N Roll fraternity watched \\"the needle take another man\\"... as Neil Young once sang of Danny Whitten...

Although different it is just as good and if not for the fact that it is not a full album and the subpar \\"Swing on This\\" this would be a masterpiece, still it's damn great. This CD has always made me think of Dirt as AIC's \\"heroin trip\\" and Jar of Flies as the \\"come down\\". Sonically the sound is completely different as Jar of Flies is almost acoustic. It's mellow but extremley haunting like Nirvana's \\"Unplugged\\" CD. And just like that CD showed Nirvana's versatility this does the same for AIC. To be able to do songs like \\"Them Bones\\" and \\"Junkhead\\" on Dirt and then to be able to do a song like \\"Don't Follow\\" which is a polar opposite of those songs is simply amazing. Still gives me chills eleven years after hearing it for the first time.

It's easy to see why. This 7 song album deals with many of the same dark subjects that Alice fans know and love. Yet this time, the band not only gave way to a more quiet, subtle darkness, they also had more upbeat songs. They let the naysayers know how talented they truly are (were) I mean Whale and Wasp is strings! I have a fairly short attention span, and had never found an album I could listen to every single song before I bought this. There isn't a bad song on it. However, if you want to rock...get Facelift or Dirt, or AIC. If you're in the mood to hear some awesome soft Alice, this is your EP. If that wasn't amazing enough...the guys wrote and recorded JoF in about a week during the LA riots!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindblowingly amazing","review":"Truly a testiment to Layne and Jerry's songwriting and playing abilites, Jar Of Flies was a huge step in AIC's career as they tune down the guitars and go all acoustic on this one, but that doesn't stop it from being any less awesome, Rotten Apple still sends chills down my spine to this day, the 6 other tracks are truly kick a$$ as well, including Nutshell, I Stay Away, No Excuses, Whale & Wasp, Don't Follow and the trippy Swing On This, maybe the best EP of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrowing","review":"This EP is beautiful. That is really the only way I can begin to describe and write a review for it. Staley's tragic death gives the bleak and desperate lyrics on \\"Jar of Flies\\" a harsh reality.

An amazing EP that any fan of rock music should listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layne Staly at his best","review":"Jar of Flies lyrically may be the best Chains cd recorded. Staly's voice is haunting along with his lyrics. This cd is a must for any Alice in Chains fan and attention should be paid to what he is saying in the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jar of Flies","review":"This is a great album. One of the very best by Alice in Chains and Layne's singing is fabulous . Rotten Apple is Austin hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've heard it you know - if you haven't pick it up","review":"If you've felt anything in your life this is something you want to hear. Reflects on so many things. So many things. I'm just visiting it for the first time again right now. Rainy night. Layne Staley has a voice that reaches out. The man is better off dead in his own right, but his pain is there for you to understand. He wrote good songs.I did an airband, as stupid as it sounds, to a song from jar of flies, with a friend who has since died, and this brings me back - track 3 - i stay away.Has nothing to do with the song - just my bud who i'll always remember hanging out with the first time, and i had this playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST DEFINATLEY WORTH IT......","review":"EP's used to be an art in themselves. A smaller collection of music than an LP, for a smaller price. Nowadays they are usually a single with a few extra B sides.NOT THE CASE with JAR OF FLIES. This is as complete as a full album, which is why it is no suprise that it was released as it was.This peice is a bit softer edged than most ALICE IN CHAINS, but it will surely hold your attention strait thru.Nothing short of excellence here, could possibly be the bands best songwriting ever. If you don't have this one, dont delay.PERSONAL FAVORITES:ROTTEN APPLE; I STAY AWAY; and DONT FOLLOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!!!","review":"Jar of Flies is beautiful. As heavy as dirt is, this is equally mellow. It's definetly a respect worthy album.Stand Out Track include:#1 Rotten Apple- Hey na na na. I don't really know what to right about this one, the song is good though.#2 Nutshell- This reminds me of his death. His songwriting skills are really showcased.#5 Whale & Wasp- A creepy instrumental Jerry wrote, then it starts to sound sad and beautiful at the same time.#6 Don't Follow- Starts off slow then escalades into some kind of harmonica enthused hoe-down. It's really good though.\\"I Stay Away\\" and \\"No Exuses\\" are good but i'm almost completely burnt on them though.OVERALL THE ALBUM IS REALLY SAD, DUE TO LAYNE'S ONGOING DRUG ADDICTION AND THE BANDS LATER DEMISE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best of Alice in Chains","review":"An album that gave us great classics like Nutshell, I Stay Away, and No Excuses. On this CD Layne's vocals are haunting, but amazingly powerful. I'd recommend this CD after Dirt for anyone new to Alice In Chains. Finally, to the reviewer saying that Alice in Chains ripped off Godsmack, just look at the editorial review for Godsmack's self titled debut, it blatantly states that Godsmack took its name from the Alice in Chains song \\"God Smack\\". If anything, Godsmack ripped off Alice in Chains who paved the way for many modern bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exuisite","review":"This is a great album, although very short, but its still of very high quality.Rotten Apple: Good opener, starts off with a real good bass line. 10/10Nutshell: One of their greatest songs, simply incredible. 10/10I Stay Away: Not one of my favorites on the album, but still very good, mixed a little bit of string in on this one. 9/10No Excuses: Good song, I love the beginning. 9/10Whale and Wasp: Great Instrumental, wish it could've been longer. 10/10Don't Follow: A personal favorite, they bust out the harmonica on this one. 10/10Swing on This: Good song, doesn't really fit the album though. 9/10.All in all, excellent work by an excellent band."},{"rating":"2","title":"No excuses, I love this album...","review":"For only 7 songs, this has to be one of the greatest albums EVER recorded, and it was only done in 7 days. So what if it is not as well-known as Dirt or Facelift, it's their best e.p. (but yes, Sap was good too).1.Rotten Apple-It's good, and very long, great way to start the album.2.Nutshell-I place this among my favorite AiC songs, just listen, you'll understand.3.I Stay Away-The single that should be played so very much.4.No Excuses-Oh, so you say you don't like this song? You now no longer have any (good) taste in music.5.Whale And Wasp-People hate this song. But it's only 2 minutes long, so it's tolerable.6.Don't Follow-For some reason, I really like this song.7.Swing On This-Different from all the other songs, and at the end you can hear the only dirty word on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"We would recommend this series to everyone!

It contains a very accurate history of the shroud and it is very well mixed with fiction (not something absurd). I didn't give the whole five starts since the ending wasn't that good, but at least it wasn't something totally unbelievable.I would definitely recommend it, especially to those interested in very good historic novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been","review":"The author should have consulted someone in medicine or anatomy/physiology before writing this book. Being without a tongue does not render one incapable of making noise. There was reference made in the book to the \\"mute not being able to scream\\" because he had no tongue. It is the vocal chords that enable us to make noise - the tongue enables us to form words. The sound comes from the vocal chords, so unless these men had their vocal chords severed, they were still capable of screaming. As a reporter, one would think she would have done more in-depth investigation prior to publishing. It also raises the question as to the efficiency of her editors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written","review":"I can't believe I stuck to this book through the end. I started skipping the \\"historical\\" flashback chapters about half way through the book. The last 25 pages were not clearly written, it was up to your imagination to fill in the gaps. The reporter is off doing her thing but we have no idea how that relates in time to what the main character and his entourage are doing until the very end. The writing about Jean (a very minor character) and the reporter read like a story from someone in junior high. I, also, will not be grabbing a book off the shelf with this author's name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jejune ramblings of an adolescent","review":"Were I to guess, even knowing that the author is reportedly a respected journalist, I would guess her to be 16 years of age and possessed of a starry-eyed notion that she too could cash in on the Dan Brown phenomenon by writing a thriller using different material. The only problems with this strategy are: (a) Dan Brown is a very good Writer, (b) Julian Navarro is not a very good writer. Do yourself a favor: don't buy this book. It is unfocused, coughs up historical material that lacks any depth (I found most of the Armenian information online in about 5 minutes) or any degree of believability, and has all the elements of a romance novel though written by a young woman possessing few writing skills. No character in the book is drawn with any skill or depth, and no plot element has any degree of credibility. In short, this is a silly, useless book and its publishers should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This book can be recommended to those who:1. seek witness of personal Faith2. have insomnia and are bored (not annoyed) by sectarian propaganda.Otherwise you can skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-semitic propaganda!","review":"Isn't it enough that Mel Gibson has to embarrass Christians all over the world with his blatant anti-semitic dribble; do we really need a book from Spain to do the same? The story is anti-semitic dogma from Opus Dei. The author clearly doesn't care about truth or who she hurts. Almost all of what she writes about Jesus was refuted in apologies to the Jewish peoples by two Popes. In addition, the story is quite boring. I urge Christians to save their money and spend it on good literture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative","review":"Woven around the holy shroud of Jesus, the tale seeks to explain why scientific carbon dating of the holy shroud do not match the era when this shroud supposedly came to be. In doing so, the story unfolds with two shrouds. The original shroud miraculously transfers to a piece of 13th century linen used to wrap it, every feature and blood etching of Jesus. The Templars through bloodied generations contrive to secure the original and duplicate and transport both from Edessa with the journey, centuries later, ending in Turin. Much of the events in this book could have happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great drill","review":"Great drill but the batteries do not last long.

In case you don't know, which is highly unlikly, that is the motto of the new series which is replacing Goosebumps, Goosebumps [Series] 2000. A girl named Allison runs over a cat with her bike. Or at least she THOUGHT she did. When she looked down, the cat's head was still on! That's not the worst of it. Not even close. Allison has brought the cat back to life! It interupts her drama practice. It scares her. She can't turn a corner anymore without first looking for this eerie creature! But now, the cat is thurning ALLISON into a cat! She gobbles three, count 'em, THREE cans of tuna right out of the can! For help, she goes to this girl named Crystal's house. Crystal's house is right in front of the location that Allison had the accident. But what she finds out about Crystal, her mom, and Rip (the cat) is way too scary to tell right now.

I think that the books should be really scarey. I mean, the book was just about a dead ,mean cat that's walking. All it's about is Alison, running over a cat, and Rip and his slaves haunt Alison. Then Alison finds out a way to destroy them. Please keep your books comming, But make them as scarey as possable! Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very scary.","review":"I think this book is very scary because it gives me freaks and I do not recomended to children under 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and Imperialistic","review":"This is an adventure tale fine! To say the least, Mr.Henty was biased and he was not properly informed of the time during which the novel was set.More than once, Henty describes that the British force was heaven sent to liberate the shackled kingdoms of India. However, he had forgotten that the British gained foothold in India by chicanery. I don't think in any of his succeeding novels, he brought to light the tyranny of the British in India. He was an imperialist to the core. (To quote Wikipedia, \\"Henty was a strong supporter of the British Empire all his life. According to literary critic Kathryn Castle:'Henty... Exemplified the ethos of the new imperialism, and glorified in its success' \\" )Tipu Sultan, was painted in such a poor light. Not to say he was the best of the individuals. At least, he wasn't fiendish as portrayed in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This is possibly the best book I have ever read. It is beautifully written. Christopher Pike's space/time theories are very interesting and prevoke much thought. Parts of the book are sort of confusing. It is very sad, I was crying after the fourth page. Sometimes the best books are the ones that make you feel sad. This kind of book stays with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I remember reading this book when I was in high school and it was one that I loved. Christopher Pike is an amazing author and one that I would love to continue to read even today. I'm 28 now, but I remember reading many of him books. I recently found the Remember Me set bound into one book and I bought it because I loved that series a lot. Also, when I found out that my dad worked with his brother, (this was when I was in high school that I found out), I loved his writing even more. Maybe it was the fact that I knew someone who knew someone that knew him. ROFL I know his books qualify as young adult, but I suggest these books for adults too if you're looking for some lighter, but great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very imaginative.","review":"I really enjoyed this book the first time I read it in middle school. I was a very big christopher pike fan back then. i liked the way the plot progressed and became so complex and intricate. and the way it works itself out it reminds me of the terminator movies in a way. one action changes the course of history kind of thing. it just shows the imagination this author has. although I think he may have run out of ideas for \\"the hollow skull\\". I think \\"the starlight crystal\\" was one of his best works. If you liked this novel, try some of his other books like \\"The Last Vampire\\" series. That was good too. If you didn't like \\"the starlight crystal\\" chances are that either 1) you're not a fan of sci-fi or 2) you have no imagination. That's just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"What words can I use to describe such a beautiful and inspiring story? I have read this book so many times, but yet everytime I do, I find myself becoming more and more enchanted by Mr. Pike's words. You clearly have to go beyond the surface of this story to really grasp the depth of just how spiritually written it is. This is absolutely my favourite book by Mr. Pike. It gives the feeling that there's something more out there for us. That our concept of life as we know it becomes even that much more complex and gradifying. But I think that it was Paige's undying love for Tem that really gets to me. She created her whole life,and our entire universe based of that love. She opposed all odds,and had to go on to fullfill a destiny that no one person could ever imagine possible, and to come to a conclusion that could never belong to a person unless they were as brave as she was."},{"rating":"2","title":"True love conquers all","review":"I picked this book randomly on a shelf one day and it has since become one of my favourite books.A week from leaving Earth for 100 years, a young Captain's daughter, Paige meets Tem and falls in love.

Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"objective assessments of effectiveness","review":"The merit of this book is to show that the poorest sections of a developing country can be effectively reached with health services. Following the requirements of the Gates Foundation, the various methods described here were scrutinised for effectiveness. Something that historically was rarely an emphasis in this field.We see that some methods of delivery of services can be proven to be effective. In areas like malaria and tubercolosis treatments.

Cleans perfectly to remove all dust, finger prints, grime, oils, anything from your car's interior. I am fairly heavy into detailing my car and this is easily my go to cleaner for the interior. The only issue I have is that it leaves a finish that is a little too shiny for my taste (hence the one star down). But with it's cleaning ability, and the fact that I use a protectant for my interior on top of this cleaner (leaves that matte finish we're all after), means that this is still the one to use. I have compared it to many pro detailing products from manufacturers such as Chemical Guys and Poor Boys and for the price, it works really great. It does not, however, have the ability to clean up stains or spills from your carpet so if you want that, look elsewhere.Great product and great shipping as always from Amazon Prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I have a VW Beetle convertible. The black dash was looking shabby from, I suppose, too much Florida sun. I had used Armorall way back when (way before Florida) with good results on tires, interiors, etc.I thought this is what I was purchasing. Wrong! I guess ArmorAll and Meguiars are two completely different products.

It has no intrinsic cleaning power of it's own beyond that of water. In other words, it will clean exactly as well as a damp cloth. Any dirt that can't be lifted with a damp cloth will stay put. It does have a nice scent, which dissipates in a matter of hours. You'll probably want a more effective product if your car gets a lot of use and/or carries many passengers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cleaner. But spray mechanism not good","review":"It cleans navigation/console well, though I haven't tried it on any big stains yet and it smells good too.But the spray mechanism is bad (leaks some drops), these products must come with spray and stream setting. This one has only spray. Stream setting is good when you want to point it to a narrow area. I'm planning to move some contents to a different container which has this setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I expected (but only just)","review":"The other reviews are right - this really doesn't do much. I bought it to wipe off the wood grain/navi screen of a new car, and it does do that, but it doesn't add anything, only removes the fingerprints.Thats the bulk of what I wanted it for, but I kinda feel water could have done the same thing... oh well, maybe it blocks UV rays or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best if you like originality","review":"As the title says if you like the original finish of your dash board, I personally don't like the greasy wet look that feels sticky for the next three days, this however cleans and protects against dust and does not make the dash greasy whatsoever, another great product by meguiars, would definitely buy this again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did i get a bad batch?","review":"I tried this out based on reviews and couldn't have been less pleased. The stuff does not smell good at all. It actually made me about choke it was so strong (and this was with the doors open while spraying). Doesnt seem like it does much of anything to be honest. I feel like when i'm done, my rag is soaked but there is no protectant on my dash. I like everything else i've tried from meguiars, but not this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for matte/soft touch interiors","review":"I used this product on the inside of 2008 Volvo S80 and I could not be happier. A large part of the center console area is covered in a rubbery soft touch material that is visually very matte. I was concerned about a cleaner leaving a greasy or shiny look and completely ruining the matte finish of the interior. This product easily wipes off and leaves no residue behind. It's exactly what they claim and extremely useful.It also works wonderfully on other parts of the interior such as the seats and steering wheel. For $5 it's hard to argue with the ease and quality of this product as well as the piece of mind of not using something that's going to destroy the look of my car.Another important note is that it smells decently good but doesn't leave a strong scent after being used. The car definitely smells clean but after a day or two the smell is gone which I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product!","review":"By far, the BEST interior cleaner I've ever used.

This stuff is very light and non-greasy. Leaves surfaces non-shiny. Light enough that you could use it weekly with no kind of build up. Smell is decent, sort of a minty crayon leathery smell.... Hard to describe but clean smelling without smelling soapy.The bottle lasts forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"As good as using plain water","review":"I tried the current version of this product (I understand there used to be an earlier version) and it simply didn't work for me. There were some stains inside my car and even after letting the cleaner sit there for a minute or so, and rubbing very hard with a microfiber cloth, the stains are still there. Basically, cleaning with this product is no better than cleaning with plain water. As much as I like other Meguiar's products, I can say without a doubt that this is the WORST interior cleaner I've ever used. The only positive thing that can be said about this product is that it won't leave surfaces shiny and greasy, for the simple reason that it does absolutely nothing! My take? Save your money and get something that has REAL cleaning power, or just use plain water and a microfiber cloth."},{"rating":"1","title":"New version is not so nice.","review":"I always buy this stuff for cleaning the interior of my car. I saw the listing on Amazon and decided to order from here since I had a gift card. When I received the product I noticed the bottle was different and definitely not the same quality of the old bottle. Instead of the nice mist that the old design gave this one does the mist plus the big drops of spray that most cheap spray bottles give. Also the new formula has the same basic smell but it is a lot stronger and definitely more of a chemical smell in a bad way. I do not like this new formula!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This was amazingI love how she put this thing together it was truly amazing and I loved it yes"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"This book began well-I appreciated the beautifully descriptive language used in regards to the scenery. The characters were interesting and seemed ver likable as well. However one major flaw, probably due in part to the time period it was written in and the historical era referred to, it had very blatant racial stereoptypes. These included rude and racists labels, as well as stereotypes. Most of the villans were mexican, while all the heros seemed to be caucasian. I found this to be highly offensive, although not being of that race myself, and in particular the derogatory names used, and the discriptors as well, especially towards the end of the book. While it was not the main message of the book, it was a strong idea that ran throughout it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not into this book.","review":"Just not capturing my attention at all.

Forsythe, a really competent actor, plays an IT expert who becomes a Rambo-like hero, wet t-shirt and all. He is joined by Hunter Tylo, a marine biologist, who matches his Rambo shennanigans shot for shot, in this preposterous and ludicrous tale of genetic experimentation. Jeffrey Combs (REANIMATOR) is the mad scientist and its probably the worst I've seen him in his many films. The sharkman is never seen enough to judge the effects, but what one can see is pretty shoddy. The movie offers no suspense and is so jumbled, it's a real farce.

The beats on that album are great and I give that album 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Although it may seem a bit old now this album is one of mc eiht/cmw best efforts alongside \\"music to driveby\\". The beats a strong and deep and mc eiht lays hard gangsta lyrics over them in his usual impressive fashion. This was when he was at his prime, so if you like his new albums these will impress you even more. Around this time there was contraversy about rap, and sony have put an extra sticker on the album declaring that the views expressed are only that of the artist, this is probably because of the usual (but great) gangsta lyrics, but also because of the song dissing DJ quik \\"def wish\\"3. All the tracks are great and are started by mc eihts catchphrase \\"jehha...we in the house!\\" or something similar, and suprisingly that doesnt become annoying. An all time classic.

I considered abandoning it, but chose to plug on. For me, it lagged because of the initial focus on the political setup of the island and the machinations of the settlers involved. I detest politics and books about politics....but it is well-researched I'm sure.Having said that, once you get past the politics and into the people....for me, it gets interesting. It edged a wee bit into bodice-tearing, which I also don't care for, but chose not to go there completely.I found the characters, once they had a chance to introduce themselves properly, to be very interesting and enjoyed the book for the rest of its story.

And as a high school teacher I make very good use of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books that I have ever read","review":"Bill Bryson has raked together a sampling of all the technical knowledge that we have.

The more I listened, the more I knew I HAD to own a print copy. Then I found this Special Illustrated Edition and WOW! Am I glad I own it! This is the kind of book that's fun to read for all ages -- explaining some complex topics in easy-to-understand language. No, it's not a textbook nor a source for research. But it does its job of getting even the non-historian and non-scientist reading about something worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up, people.","review":"I give this book my highest rating because I really enjoyed reading it, and that's what I really value you in a book. There are some negative things about the book - some explanations can ramble and get a bit dry. But the book is densely packed with fun facts and history from the perspective of the layman and Bryson's writing style makes it fun to read while maybe learning some things as well.What I don't get are people that slam this book because it's poor science. It's Bill Bryson, not Stephen Hawking! This a common man who went on a quest for knowledge and is sharing what he learned. He doesn't claim to be writing a science textbook here. And I think he does a fair job acknowledging his weaknesses and portraying things in a tone that upholds his goal.However, readers should know that this is not the fun romp of 'A Walk in the Woods'. It's more dense and not as funny, but still funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It certainly could do with the 'nearly everything' part","review":"The book is readable, but it just really skims the surface of some important topics. A far better use of someone's time would be to read 'the secret history of the world' by Laura Knight-Jadczyk. But of course it depends on whether the reader actually wants to know more about the true nature of mankinds current predicament and how we got here, or is quite happy wasting a few hours with some mindless tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned so much","review":"Bill Bryson's enthusiastic voice leads the reader into an amazing concise history of some branches of learning.

Additionally, every single person should read this book. Everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Look","review":"Bryson did a fantastic job of pumping fresh life into subjects and historical figures that have long gone cold in modern re-tellings. Newton, Einstein, Linnaeus, and a host of scientists crossing every discipline come to life as real people in the times, often bizarre times, they lived in. I could not have been more impressed with the ease with which he writes about complicated subjects and the sheer joy and astonishment captured in his prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with \\"I didn't know that!\\" moments.","review":"This is just a fun book to read if you have any interest in science and the world around us.Bryson claims he got the idea for this book while flying over an ocean and thinking, \\"I should know know more about the world and what makes it tick\\" or something to that end. However he got the idea, the result is a solid book. Short History breaks down into the scientific history of the Universe, the Earth, and Humans. Almost every page teaches you something fascinating and there is an underlying message about how the truth, when new, will be fought vigorously almost without fail.The whole thing is written in a witty style that keeps you turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"making the unobtainable readable","review":"Another fascinating book by Bill Bryson, the champion of turning the most extraordinary (and often unreachable) subjects into readable, engaging, addictive, and mind-blowing books. Here, he tackles the small subject of the history of our little blue planet, from the great cosmos to the tiniest atoms, from the creation of the universe to our species' first steps. Bryson's prose is chock full of wonder and appreciation and simple entertainment at the awesome wonders of our world. Most impressively, he manages to embrace that universal truth of science: the more we understand, the less we know. And that is also the beauty and awe of science, of all that goes into our magnificent world. It is an amazing feat that we are here, that anything is here, and we are all made of the same stuff and come from the same stuff. We should not only appreciate that to its fullest, but we should do everything in our power to take care of it.

Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great AND Fun History of Nearly Everything","review":"I really, really loved this book - it satisfied my brain's love of learning with my funny bone's need for smiling. It's also a long book - so it becomes a sort of daily pleasure to pick it up and read a bit - the kind of book that when it's over you wonder how you will replace it. The only somewhat negative comment that I have is that the beginning half actually was a little more fun to read than the ending half, but that might be because as the book became less historical the author Bryson became more involved with the subject matter, so it was less amusing to him, perhaps. Definitely the most fun way to read about history I've found so far. When I finished this book, I read many of his other books - this was by far the best of the bunch, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and informative","review":"I love reading Bill Bryson. I have this on my Droid phone and it is a great book for reading snippets while waiting in doctor's offices, etc. He gives an historical perspective to scientific discoveries with insight into those who made the discoveries. It is a real jewel of nonfiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Knowledge","review":"This truly enchanging book covers everything from the expanding universe to the smallest building blocks of matter.

I cannot stress how highly I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting history of science","review":"I was introduced to this book by a colleague and since passing along the recommendation to others, I assign sections to students. It is incredibly instructive in all of the interesting facts usually left out of science textbooks. It is written in an easy to read form and with humorous anecdotes.

We feel that it is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I had downloaded this book and listened to it over a few weeks (it's 18 hours long) but enjoyed every second. I realized I had to buy this book because it would be such a great reference work. It's not minutiae, it's the back story, the why we know what we do and how we got there. Sometimes it's noble, often it's petty. The illustrations make the work even more understandable and add depth to a wonderful work. Put simply, you must read this book. If not for the science, then simply to see how an excellent writer writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"I thought this would be awesome. It was terrible. Boring. Stupid.

This book has more errors than any pop sciencebook I have seen in a long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not hold back by lack of any knowledge","review":"Bryson has written a book on the historical development of science that reads as easily as a crime story. However it is too obvious that the author has not any knowledge of physics. A comic work for physicist. For all others: don't take it too serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it last on your list","review":"If you want to learn semi-humorous anecdotal stories about scientists, then maybe this book is for you. But if you want to learn solid reliable science, look elsewhere. With heavy doses of sarcasm, Bryson spends as much time ridiculing scientific knowledge as he spends promoting it. Hence, this book has the potential to set civilization back several decades, because it discourages scientific curiosity rather than encouraging it. Indeed, Bryson comes across as a kind of anti-Sagan. Whereas Carl Sagan was able to inspire people to want to learn science, Bryson's between-the-lines message seems to be that there are too many insurmountable gaps in scientific knowledge, and therefore science is a waste of time. This makes me wonder about Mr. Bryson's political/ideological leanings...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it ought to be","review":"An interesting read in places, but he badly mucks up genetics and flatout ignores quantum physics - two of the most fascinating developments of 20th Century science. Read anything by Laurence Krauss or Richard Dawkins instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most fun book.","review":"I am a big fan of Mr. Bryson. But I found this book to be tedious. His travel books are wonderful because of his insight, warmth, charm, wit, and irritability. But this feels like a book that he wrote based on books he's read. It doesn't really play into his strong suit - his ability to articulate his personal experience. I guess I just don't see what this book offered that I couldn't get elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science History without any Science","review":"A facinating topic but written by someone that clearly does not understand the science. So you get lots of somewhat dubious anecdotes about the quirky lives of the scientists but no feeling for the science itself.For example the discussion of Newton \\"discovering gravity\\" does not even briefly mentioning what he did (with the moon) and thus what it was that he actually discovered. There are also many many errors and misunderstandings.No doubt the book will sell and people that have no idea of science might like it. Bryson writes well about topics such as travel and popular history because he understands them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson is....","review":"brilliant, simply brilliant.

I really ended up enjoying it. It's a different kind of book. It's kind of science, history, and everything academic put in terms that John Doe Americana can understand. I guess I liked it because if felt like a prep course for the \\"My Fractured Life\\" chapter on the game show \\"Jeopardy.\\" Hey, if Bill Bryson can make me understand science and history and actually make it interesting, it's got be good, right? Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Bryson does not achieve his goal of understanding.","review":"On the fourth page, Bryson admits this book is not really a short history of nearly everything. And it isn't. For the subject matter it actually explains, It is a verbose account of scientists' idiosyncrasies. Explanations of phenomena are rare. Until page 37 and 38's six meaningful paragraphs, Bryson chooses to only explore trivial matters, like how Newton stared into the sun or inserted into his face a sewing needle. If you like trivial facts like this, this book is for you. If you like actual scientific concepts and meanings, but find it troublesome to follow the extensive mathematics, I'd recommend theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking or neuroscientist Sam Harris or chemist Cathy Cobb... If you like the history of the attempts to achieve some answers, but not the answers themselves, this book is okay. At least Bryson's heart is approximately in the right place."},{"rating":"2","title":"ILLUMINATING","review":"So interesting and well written, I had a hard time putting it down. Byrson does an outstanding job of explaining what we think we know (at least at present) about the universe, earth, matter, and the development of life, without becoming bogged down in boring technical detail. At the same time, the information is not dumbed down to make it readable. I particularly like the fact that he exposes the fact that many advances and discoveries are credited to people who really were not responsible for them. This book belongs on the bookshelf of anyone curious about the natural world around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Short History of Nearly Everything","review":"Wow! If someone wants to learn about our world--and practically everything that it compasses, this would be a required read!

To borrow a much-cherished phrase from another one of Bryson's books, my \\"apprenticeship in the harsh milieu\\" of intellectual snobbery (made possible by an MS in aerospace engineering) has taught me that \\"experts\\" hate it when someone makes the \\"hard stuff\\" entertaining while refusing to bow in homage to those who *profess* to understand it.If you want an extremely entertaining (yet nonfiction!) read on the history of some of the issues and discoveries most fundamental to our understanding of science and our very existence this book may just be one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Short History of Nearly Everything You Didn't Want To Know","review":"Bill Bryson is the quintessintial American writer and pretty much he touches, turns to Gold. But not on this book. I felt as if he spent more time providing a history of *individuals* responsible for the discovery of different things throughout history. Where they were born, what they ate, who they talked to, and what they worked on. Interesting to some, but not to me.What's worse, is that I really didn't learn anything about History! Probably becaue I didn't finish the book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"One the worst books I'v ever read","review":"I've been reading science books since I was seven years old. This is not only one of the worst science books I've ever read but one of the worst books period. The author presents contradictory facts and figures. The book is poorly edited. Worst of all, he ends each topic with a message of fear and uncertainty. If we let each of his little fear factors into our brains we would live our lives in fear of the very improbable. Examples include, asteroids, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, disease . . . Life and existence involve risk but to focus on risk is misleading and unhealthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information needs to be verified","review":"This book is well written and presents some interesting information.

This has made me question all the information in disciplines where I have no experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we trust this author","review":"I almost bought this book, but after reading the review from FrKurt Messick, (a 5 start positive review of this book), I was intrigued to also order \\"The Mother Tongue\\" by the same author, for my wife (a spanish teacher). However, when I read the reviews of \\"The Mother Tongue\\", I found numerous linguists stating that the author had made numerous, inexcusable factual mistakes and he stated controversial concepts as facts. To me, an author who does this in one book, should not be trusted to tell us true, factual information on \\"The History of Nearly Everything\\" (a much more challenging book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the book","review":"I can say not everyone would accept what he states as fact.

After reading some of Bryson's earlier books, I assumed that this would be a good read, as well. Midway through the first chapter, I was asleep, presumably because it had nearly bored me to death and I had to go into a life-saving stasis to prevent any further brain damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Skewed History of Almost Everthing","review":"This book was given to me as a gift,and while I enjoyed reading it, I found it to be more Science-Fiction than science. While Bryson presents several theories as fact (Big Bang, Oort cloud, and macro-evolution), He is honest enough to admit (many times over) that the evidence is either scarce or non-existent. He attempts to present the un-proven and un-provable as fact, and it is actually quite humorous at times. Instead, I would recomend \\"Science and the Bible\\" by Dr. Henry Morris."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Short History of Nothing At All","review":"Amazing!

I think it would make a great text for student science requirements for those not interested in pursuing science careers.This really is a short history of nearly everything. He does miss a few points: (a) science history between prehistoric times and the industrial revolution. The ancient incans, greeks, phoenicians, egyptians, chinese all had fascinating contributions to science. Bryson really misses this point. He covers the dawn of earth through prehistoric times. And then he picks up at the industrial revolution where he does a great job of detailing science history.For those who don't like history, Bryson does a good job of making it interesting and fun.

It covers a lot and held my interest all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"The science lesson you've always wanted","review":"A wonderfully written little trip from the beginning of... well, everything right through to the ascendancy of humans. Bryson's mastery of language and his ability to turn a phrase are put to good use in taking a look at the theories and science behind astrophysics, geology, archeology, paleontology, and several other \\"ologies\\" as well. The best part is that Bryson manages to cover all this without being boring or overly breezey.Almost everyone will find some part of this book interesting. Even if you weren't a straight A student in science class back in high school or college, the bits of science you do know are probably woven into the grander tapestry of science and time in a way you'll appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short History Of Everything","review":"One of the best armchair books on science ever. The author is very fair, setting the record straight wherever he can by giving credit to the smalltime guy where credit is due. Bryson explains things (in this case, science) in a way that is meaningful to everyone. I agree with a previous review I read that says the only other book that accomplishes the same is Remick's \\"West Point: Character, Leadership, Education, Thomas Jefferson\\" in which the history-philosophy behind America-West Point (therefore, no way in conflict with Mr. Bryson's book about science) is explained in a way that's for everyone. Mr. Bryson's book is a fascinating and exciting journey through the history of science. If you take the trip, you'll both enjoy it and have a short education on nearly everything. I highly recommend it. You might also want to read Remick's book after you read Bryson's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" to have a \\"short history of everything\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, but yet entertaining","review":"I enjoyed the humor in the writing and the logical thread. Written at the novice level, it may be a good book for those not ready for the James Burke's Connections series. However, it is obviously documenting the process of discovering science by someone who has a high school exposure to science. This may be the main value of a Short History-- making science palatable. For those who are educated scientists and read about science, this book disappoints because of the lack of any new synthesis or perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Report on Popular Science","review":"For me, this book was very disappointing. Rather than being a well-thought out book on science, it turned out to be a book report on the best-selling science books of the last twenty years. If one looks at the bibliography and the notes at the end, it becomes obvious that Bill Bryson gets most of his information from sources aimed at the general reader. I think one would be much better off reading the books in the bibliography that go into each subject in-depth and are written by specialists rather than getting this summary version.Bryson also seems to have a fixation with all the ways nature can destroy our civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double dose of amazement.","review":"First,I read the (library) book.

I hope that there is a second book of it's kind somewhere in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining, taken with a grain of NaCl","review":"OK, I am not a scientist, I'm just an architect with an interest in certain fields in science. So perhaps this is not a book for \\"real\\" physicists, biologists or geologists -- but it is certainly a good read for someone who has not touched a science book in a while. Bryson is an excellent nature writer, who is at his best (and is most humorous) when he is writing about the historical figures in science -- which, fortunately, is a big part of the book. So buy this book and relax, but don't tell your know-it-all physicist brother-in-law that you are reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good read","review":"This book is a good read for the generalist interested in the history of natural science.Bryson goes from astronomy to paleontology to anthropology. One of the constants in the book is how little we actually know about everything around us.Some of the other reviewers have taken Bryson to task for missing on the science, and I won't argue with them. At the same time, the broad strokes are close enough for most readers.The cover of my copy of the book (with a screw, washer, and bolt) was misleading to me. I thought there would be something about engineering, but there was not.Probably the best part to me was how scientific accomplishment is often the result of luck or completely ignored. It's really kind of scary. Overall, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TechBook ever for layman","review":"Just as the title says, A Short History of Just about everything. No respectable school can exclude this from their curriculum . I have it as an EBook on my iPad , very convenient.

I will be playing part of these cd for my biology class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and eye-opening","review":"Bill Bryson has the ability to take textbook subject matter and make it far more entertaining than anyone else. His creative perspective fosters an enthusiastic following and I will be sure to continue reading all of his works. If you like science and are interested in the big-picture, this is definitely the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING & PROVOCATIVE","review":"Any person who can think beyond a sitcom should enrich their existance with the educational, challenging and often humorous perspectives so well presented by Bill Bryson. A particular PLUS relates to the non-partison evolution vs creation presentations - form your own conclusions with a bit more information (& the hope that even more data is on the way ...).The 1st book I'm making sure my kids read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb introduction to life, the universe, and everything","review":"This book is an imminently readable, funny, moving history of the universe, solar system, planet, life.(...). Bryson, as always, is an engaging storyteller who has done a great deal of research on his subject. Three things make the book stand out: Bryson's sense of humor, stand-out ablility to make pretty much anything he writes about fascinating, and the broad scope of the book-it covers everything from the big bang to string theory. Additionally, Bryson offers many brief sketches of the great personalities of science, the overlooked ones, and the infamous conflicts. If you want to stand out at parties, or just know a little more about nearly everything, and do it without putting yourself to sleep, this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5 List","review":"This book provides a fantastic overview of both the history of discovery and the information learned. It covers a multitude of scientific fields, from their origins to prevailing (and often disputed) beliefs. Contrary to most scientific text books, however, Bryson makes it all understandable amd mostly memorable. After reading, it is impossible to look at our physical surroundings the same way. Excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"Bryson is a great writer. His travel journals made me laugh out loud. This history is far more serious (although not totally so) and offers a wealth of information on history and science. My only complaint is that I needed to stop reading regularly and take notes so that I wouldn't forget Bryson's insights and information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings life to science.","review":"As a chemistry teacher, this book ranks up there with \\"Our Demon Haunted World\\" by Sagan as the most important book I've read. Bryson fills in the missing spaces of our bland textbook education and make scientists seem human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!","review":"Simply put, this book should be in every classroom on the planet. It makes interesting reading of some of the dullest subjects on the planet. Yet it is a total page turner and is filled to the brim with fascinating data, information, facts and figures. I learnt more reading this book in a couple days then I did in years of science and history classes at school.Buy itRead itLove it!A total and complete work of art from Bryson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"This book was so amazing. It explains everything so that even a dumb person can kind of understand it (even though no one can really comprehend the universe). Its so amazing. This book lets you explore the universe and gives you an understanding of so much that you probably never knew before. If you're not ready to be completely flummoxed through-out the whole book I don't recommend it. But if you are, get ready for the experience of a lifetime. Another book that i highly recommend is \\"HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid book","review":"If you want to get really excited about areas of science that have seemed arcane and inaccessible, Bill Bryson's book is the one to read. For ordinary readers like me without any but the most rudimentary knowledge of science, this book is informative, entertaining, and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HIstory of Time Well Spent","review":"Bill Bryson's survey of scientific discovery and advances is wonderfully comprehensive and engagingly written. Bryson conveys a sense of genuine personality throughout both the sciences and the scientists he discusses, even as he presents a wealth of concrete information. Listening to these CDs (via my IPod) made my morning and evening commute time very well spent indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need I say more?","review":"Yes, Mr Bryson. Perhaps you should have said more.This is a good book, very captivating read, filled with a glorious selection of science topics that could leave you and your mates rambling on for years. The problem is that Mr Bryson seemed to have done too good a job at stating his impartial case. At the end, I'm not sure if I believe everything that I read and I'm left with the overwhleming sensation that there is more to come. This reflects itself no more than in the last chapters of the book.Initially I thought Mr Bryson got bored with his own book and rushed to complete the manuscript. But, now I'm wondering if this is not a ploy from the publisher to get one to buy more books? Congratulations! Success! I've ordered 7 more books on some of the topics I like and I'm looking forward to Mr Bryson's next book.Al in all, 4 stars for being interesting and a quick read. But I need to check on the facts..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Attempt","review":"The truth is I had never before read a book from Bill Bryson, though I have to say he made a good attempt telling the story of Natural Science. The thing is Bryson is no scientist and to make matters worse I'm pretty sure he didn't knew much about the subject before he decided to give it a try. The book is a pleasant reading since the author's style is coloquial and fluid. Also, it seems he made an extensive research to backup his writing, and that too is a book plus. Basically the four stars reflect my opinion on the way the story is told (not the style, but the order of things and the lack of connection between Bryson's history) and on the lack of clear and deep scientific explanations bounded to history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual Knowledge Supreme.","review":"This is the most fantastic book in print. Every human being should read this book. It containes a huge store of factual knowledge. Every person should know at least this much about the universe they live in. This type of scientific understanduing will have a bearing on the decisions you make concerning your future. I am a bibliomanic and have a several thousand volume personal library and there is no other book I would reccomend more highly; --- for young and old.Jess Culpepper, Humble, Texas, 77338."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully boring","review":"I was looking for something with a humorous twist to it, sort of \\"the story behind the story\\" but this wasn't it. Bryson did, in fact, do his homework and research in gathering facts, but the book read like a boring high school science/physics text book. As I tried to get \\"into\\" this book, it became more boring as each page was turned. What could have been said in a few sentences took several pages. I don't know how others feel, but David Bodanis did what Bryson failed to do in the excellent \\"Electric Universe,\\" and \\"E=MC2.\\" If you're looking for the story behind the story and understanding the chain of events that got us to where we are, Bodanis would be the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasonably disappointing","review":"While it is probably an overstatement to call it a bad book, it is true that it is lacking in many respects.At the sentence level it is, as you would expect, very well written, It does contain some well researched and entertaining anecdotes and oddities about the historical figures in sciences. But beyond those two relatively superficial amusements there isn't much. I find the structure of the book wanting; the science is hardly illuminating; the focus on the personalities and the conflicts between them gets more than a little tiresome .... It reminds me of a celebrity gossip \\"news\\".Mildly entertaining airport reading at best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Easy Reading","review":"Thought this book was going to be a bit easier to read. I don't recommend this book to someone who is looking for some easy reading on \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\". The layout is way to tight and you cannot find info on any particular subject easily. Sorry Mr. Bryson.....I guess it's just not for me or the Father's in my life. I had bought 4 of them for Father's Day gifts and had to return all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Dull, Dull....!","review":"I have read most of Bill Bryson's books; in fact, I'm a major fan. Usually, he makes me laugh and teaches me fascinating facts I am happy to acquire. (However, he does seem sometimes to try too hard to be witty -- wit is wonderful if it doesn't seem strained.) I never thought he could write a DULL book...I was wrong. I bought this as an audio book from Audible.com, and I could get through only a couple of chapters. All the arcane data about the universe, our solar system, and the earth itself, not to mention the personal and political proclivities, idiosyncrasies, and conflicts of scientists and mathematicians -- while doubtless engrossing for a scientist or mathematician -- was deadly dull to ME. Of course, I am an English prof, and advanced science and math have ever been enigmatic to me. Sorry, Bill . . . this is just NOT my cup of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"This book is a waste of time and money. It's more of a gossip column, not a study of science by any means. Maybe 10% is science and the rest is gossipy trivia with a definite negative bent.Mr. Bryson's \\"humor\\" is nothing but sarcastic wise-a** glibness. It takes him a paragraph to state a simple fact, with all his \\"humor.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"no self control","review":"I wanted to give it a nagative star meaning this book should not be allowed to be published. The author is a pack rat in words--he can't trim and get to the point, every single tinny bits info he has to save. He unfocused those could be interesting subjects into blurry by blah blah blah blah blah (using 5 blahs to show how he couldn't stop himself). I haven't encounted such a bad book for a long time and I will not pick up a 2-inch thick book ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Data","review":"I was reading A Short History of Nearly Everything. What took me by surprise was the claim made by the author, Bill Bryson, that the Saturn V rocket's blueprints were destroyed years ago. My initial reaction was shock, so I researched a bit online. Wikipedia and NASA's website claim the story behind the plans getting destroyed was urban legend. It isn't like the book was written a long time ago; 2004 seems recent enough.I stopped reading it. If an author can not get their facts straight or make a valid represenation of the story, then why read them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson does a great job with this one.","review":"I have a BS in Medical Microbiology and Bryson's book even clarified a few things for me. This book covers a lot of the physical sciences and his writing is very readable. This is written for the layperson or for an expert in any scientific field. Two thumbs up and a good, fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't think I would finish this book","review":"A co-worker passed this book to me. I didn't think I would like it as I barely got through high school science. I was also afraid this would be like Hawking's \\"A Brief History of Time;\\" that is, nearly unreadable. I read this because I've liked Bryson's other stuff. I read the whole thing saying \\"OK, in another 20 pages or so I'll stop.\\" I didn't stop until the end of the book. Bill Bryson is, simply put, an amazing writer. It was a mix of science, history, and anecdote in just the right proportions. A previous reviewer spoke about the doomsday stuff about impending asteroids, earthquakes, and other natural disasters; that's true and if it keeps you awake at night, this isn't the book for you. But if natural science is a dark cave and you're looking for the guy with a flashlight who is 10 feet ahead of you, this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Macro to Micro - 100% Astounding!","review":"At nearly age 70, I thought I was past any ability to absorb and comprehend anything \\"scientific\\" beyond knowing what the periodic chart contains. Bill Bryson has REALLY done it! I not only have at least a beginner's grasp of this universe of ours, I am awestruck by it and by the men and women who have dared, through the ages, to probe and poke around in it. Every time I re-listen to this amazing book, I learn/understand something new and give a hearty thumbs-up thanks to Mr. Bryson."},{"rating":"1","title":"This short history is really too short","review":"I'd heard quite a bit about this book so decided to finally read it. I'm not a professional scientist, but have read widely on evolution and astronomy. However, even I found this book a bit too short. It's really geared toward people with little understanding of the science of astronomy or life. Having said that, it might be a good read for people with no prior interest or knowledge of these fields of science. Hopefully it will encourage more people to pursue careers in these fields. But it may not entertain readers with more background in these fields."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and very funny science book!","review":"I ordered this book for a senior citizen (OLLI) class I am taking. I wanted to know what information had been learned since I was in science class at least an eon ago. Expecting a dull recitation, like books in science that I was exposed to, I was surprised and thrilled to read a fascinating, informative and very funny book that I could not put down! None of that chapter a week, them let's discuss it for me. I read it from cover to cover, then ordered one for each of my sons. You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I wish I had read this in high school, maybe I would have actually enjoyed science classes.

It explains everything so that even a dumb person can kind of understand it (even though no one can really comprehend the universe). After about every 10 pages, I had to stop and think about what the author said because it is so amazing and dumbfounding. This book lets you explore the universe and gives you an understanding of so much that you probably never knew before.

It came in the condition that was stated on Amazon.com. I would buy from this seller again.I am not finished with this book yet, but definitely recommend it to anyone with a thirst for more knowledge! Very very interesting, but a little hard to get through. There is so much scientific information in it, so you wouldn't read say, half of it, in one sitting. I do like Bill Bryson's style, and know many others who have enjoyed his novels. - I admit, there were a few words/terms I had to look up; but his writing style is easy enough. Much of his personality shows through - a good thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A text book for humanity!","review":"Bill Bryson's writing style is so user friendly that he makes complicated topics like DNA structure understandable. His \\"short history\\" covers everything from the big bang theory to, well... us. Along the way Bryson explains nearly everything that one should know about this planet on which we live. He makes it perfectly clear that you are extremely lucky to be alive. The odds against you bing here, now, are astronomical! Just the section on cellular structure, DNA and the creation of life is worth the price of this book.A SHORT HISTORY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING is one of those rare books that will make you feel smarter just by reading it.

Easily readable, Mr. Bryson makes what should be a very difficult subject quite comprehensible. Provides an amazing compendium of factual information. I think everyone in high school should be given this book to read. It makes science enjoyable and understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enlightening","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book. Gets bogged down just slightly with the DNA bit, but that is just a minor speed bump in an otherwise well-written work--and written so most of us can understand it. I really enjoyed the part about us being the product of in-breeding. hahaI recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Written, Witty & Informative","review":"A great introduction to science for the layman. Bryson covers topics ranging from geology to biology to cosmology and others in easy-to-understand language that even those who are usually intimidated by science will find informative and interesting. Bryson includes many funny anecdotes and amusing stories about the scientists whose research and discoveries he covers in the book; some are laugh-out-loud hilarious while others are scandalous, but all of them help to bring the scientists and their work to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"I started to listen to this on audio book, and inadvertently started with the last disc first. I had expected that Bill was going to be using his great sense of humor, but this was just a dry book with scientific stuff, which I could look up on the internet if I really wanted. I was very disappointed that in his research about DNA that he failed to mention that the woman who took the crystalograpy x-rays literally gave up her life because she got cancer and died from taking all those xraya and it was proven that SHE really discovered DNA, not the arrogant Crick and Watson, who treated her very badly. So, Bill, you missed the mark on that one.So then I put disc one in and he started talking about the big bang theory, which he obviously believes. I just couldn't listen to any more of this. It was like being in high school again and having scientific facts crammed down our throats. Sorry, Bill, you missed the mark on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"evolution of scientific thought and knowledge","review":"This book is full of well known and obscure scientific discoveries and something that surprised me was the bickering and infighting within the scientific community over the centuries.The subject matter is handled with wit and easily understood. Science is not my usual reading fare and I somehow got through it.The place of Homo sapiens in the world was somewhat humbling and their wanton destruction of species a bit unsettling. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative","review":"If you are at all curious about the reality of our existence in this life on another level, you'll love this book. Lots of interesting facts and figures that give pause for thought. You don't get mired in too much scientific gobble-dee-gook.

It is about the personal baby mama drama of scientists. Few to no words are actually devoted to explaining discoveries, and when Bryson does talk about actual science he often gets it wrong or gives bad emphases. For every word on actual science he spends 10 words talking about feuds, marriages, business ventures, and basically on trying to be funny.The book does not live up to its title or its jacket. This is a softball, lazy way to talk about the history of science that has already been done countless times before precisely because it is so easy to do. Most if not all of his material is derivative and can be found in other, better books that came before him.Thoroughly disappointing, I won't be wasting my energy reading anything from Bill Bryson ever again.Bottom line: This is not science, this is relationship drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a great book","review":"I love science from a historical perspective. The people who do the science and the cultures that surround them make for exciting and inspiring stories. The book starts out well, but gets bogged down in the last chapters in a depressing rant against the human animal, and it is sometimes filled with pages of details that seem to lead nowhere. A really good science editor is needed to make this book what it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex subject matter made enjoyable","review":"It's no surprise that Bill Bryson is able to make almost anything enjoyable to read, and the same is true in \\"A Short History...\\" Although points of his research sometimes superfluous to the average reader surface throughout the book, Bryson presents the reader with just enough information to have a grasp on - no pun intended - seemingly nearly everything. The read is slow at times, but the concepts are incredible and mind-blowing; Bryson has evidently cut no corners. What is also commendable is that Bryson avoids often controversial subjects while portraying what is thought to be the closest interpretation of the truths of the world as we know it today; evolution is discussed and the beginning of the universe is pondered without presenting disagreeable tones or underlying interpretations. Overall, the read is definitely recommended to anyone who has the intention of understanding the workings of the world without ever having to step outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Short History of Nearly Everything","review":"Bill Bryson has taken what it is and what it will be to a new height and makes reading about science fun along with expanding your mind. This book will help the average person without a clue of what makes life around us tick, have a good idea after they read this book.

It fit the bill as a primer since it covered many topics.Now I'm in search for more knowledge on this subject matter.I would appreciate anyone's recommendations for further reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read for Bryson fans","review":"If you enjoy Bill Bryson's writing then you'll probably enjoy this book, particularly if you're looking for a grand overview of, well, nearly everything. It's short (well, considering its scope), and it gives an overview of a vast amount of material. And the thing about Bryson's writing is, it is tremedously accessible. He writes in a style that is easy to read and easy to grasp. This is not a text book nor is it intended (I think) to be a rigorous text. It is what it is, which is an enjoyable introduction to a bunch of scientific thought. In an age when science education is seemingly under attack, that is no bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous! Hilarious!","review":"This entertaining and enlightening book, which I purchased in a shop in Frankfurt am Main airport, was my introduction to Bill Bryson. After buying this book, I was delighted to find that Bill Bryson is quite a prolific author, and have in turn acquired several additional works by him.

I did the same with Jilly Cooper and subsequently Fraser's Flashman series, and was looking for a new favourite author...looks like I found him."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating read","review":"Bryson's history of science is well executed, informative, enlightening and there are great facts sprinkled through the book that you will be able to share for years to come. I loved this book so much that I also bought the audio book and listened to it on an 11 hour trip, and have since bought 2 more copies for friends. I woud add that my kids hated the audio book and said it was \\"boring\\". Ah well maybe it is an adult read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History of Everything","review":"Wow, what a delightful surprise -- not what I was expecting. At first, disconcerting that the book is read by the author (not quite as clear and smooth as an \\"actor\\"), but I quickly adapted to his speech mannerisms and flow. Now I love the idea of the author reading his own book. And I am totally FASCINATED! Facts and theories so immense I can't get my brain around them, but leaving me with wanting to know and understand more.

It's a fun listen, but would probably be a dry read. You won't pass any college physics classes with this, but it sure will help you if you like the show Jeopardy.It covers about 5 billion years and lightly touches on a lot, so it has little depth. However, Byrson keeps it interesting and does a good job tying it all together. I would say it's a good buy overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This book digs into some pretty tough scientific thought, but is always easy to follow. Gives the reader much room for thought on these subjects, and also makes you realize that all of the brainpower and genius that has gone into this scientific thought has not prevented the ones with the brains from being human.The history of science is full of intrigue, back-stabbing, petty quarreling, arguing, refuting and 'cooking the books' to promote your pet theory. This book tells these human stories too.Recommended most highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book I have ever read twice, back to back","review":"Bill Bryson's A short History of Nearly Everything rates as nearly the best book I have ever read.

A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, thought provoking.","review":"I read this and then bought a copy for my kids, with the endorsement that this is great \\"conversational science\\". It is, in fact, the author's rambling thoughts on topics ranging from Archaeology through Zoology and includes great discussions on the origins of life and its ephemeral nature.

I believe that you will be more likely to stay awake. I find it interesting that if you try to browse throught the sample pages at Amazon.com all you see are the cover notes, table of contents and the index.

I have had it on LP for a while and decided to give it another listen for recollection. At first, you imagine the sun rising over some distant Indian landscape, but the album never does rise to anything. The orchestra is way too melodic in the sense that they all play the same charts in unison. The composition is just boring. Perhaps that is how the meditative mood is presented, but I could not meditate to something so poorly composed. I think the problem is that there rises no singular voice, no instrument that rises above the background symphony, just all background, poorly composed.

I only bought this movie for one reason: the lovely Phoebe Cates is topless in much of the movie. (Okay, so make that two reasons.) On this point, I was not disappointed.That said, I made the mistake of trying to watch this turkey of a movie from beginning to end. I believe the makers of this movie were confused about who their target audience is.On one hand, the film contains a lot of nudity and sex. On the other, the film features dumbed-down, bad dialogue and patently groan-worthy attempts at humor, the kind of humor that only 5 year old children would find amusing. Really, the scenes with the monkeys were as childish as they were totally out-of-place in a softcore porn flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite \\"Blue Lagoon\\" rip-offf","review":"And of all the actors in Hollywood, who decided to pair beautiful Phoebe Cates with Willie Aames in this story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for Phoebe, -1 for the movie itself...","review":"Plot? Acting? Dialogue? Please. You're buying this movie for the same reason everyone else did... and for that alone, it gets 4 stars. The incredible Phoebe Cates is, indeed, both topless and fully nude several times, yet the nudity is actually done very tastefully. (And yes, not to be sexist, if you're a female fan of \\"Charles in Charge,\\" you also get a glimpse of Willie's willie.) As for the alleged use of a body double, the shower and swimming scenes are 100% Phoebe (hi-def super slo-mo doesn't lie).This ridiculous debate over whether this is a rip-off of \\"Blue Lagoon\\" (which, IMO it is) is a moot point.

Some books are a disappointment, though, because the recipes are poorly defined or too many are unappealing. \\"The International Chocolate Cookbook\\" has many wonderful recipes that will appeal to the chocoholic and the \`normal' audience. Complex techniques are carefully explained, step by step, with hints to understand WHY the chef needs to follow these directions. I particularly love the creative ways to use chocolate suggested by the author. She details how to make boxes, \`birds nests', leaves, small bowls, and more - all out of chocolate.To add to the enjoyment, the author gives descriptions about where the dessert comes from and what makes it so appealing. The pictures are stunning, and are part of what convinced me to buy the book originally.

The biggest problem I had was tangled cord. They folded the cord in half, then wound it up as a pair of wires starting at the point of the fold. With the first cable, I just undid the ties holding the wire in the loop, and kind of tossed the roll to unroll it. That was a huge mistake - it took about 1/2 hour to untangle the mess. On the second cable I took a couple of minutes and unrolled it very carefully, then rolled it back into a spool starting at one end of the cable. It saved a lot of time and prevented the cable from ending up in a big tangle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Quality is sub-par","review":"I ordered these cables to go along with a Swann system I installed at our small business.My first observation was that the cord is much thinner than the stock 65 ft cables provided with the kit I purchased. This may me because there is less shielding around the wires and that the wires are thinner in general.The video quality was very poor in my opinion. The picture was fuzzy and grainy compare to the stock cables. Maybe you won't notice on a 400 TVL resolution system, but for our 660 TVL system, it looked pathetic. So much so that I returned two of the three cables I purchased. I only kept the one I opened since I took it out of the package.

However \\"First Love, Last Rites,\\" written albeit very early in his career, while offering us snippets of dark humor and polished prose, are for the most part one-dimensional tales of sexual rites of passage.

Pit bull bites as reported in the media are more often than not actually other breeds that have been misidentified as Pit bulls. Pit bulls used to be called nanny dogs because they are so great with children. You better get your facts straight Dr. Schmitt. He also picks on Saint Bernards, Dobermans, and German Shepherds. As a former nanny I have seen far too many parents not supervise their children around the dog. Too many children are rough and not very nice to the family dog. Dogs have feelings too and do not deserve to be hit, bit, or have their tails pulled. Regardless of the breed, dogs can only take so much inhumane treatment before they growl. A growl is their warning and parents and kids need to realize that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Child Care Book Ever!","review":"I have read a lot of child care books and this one is the BEST!

My sister-in-law raved about this and, after reading the reviews here, I picked it for our book club. I read this in two days and I'm not sure just what we'll discuss when we meet. I found the writing to be totally juvenile, about on par with a teen novel. No depth of character anywhere - not one character was developed enough to make me care. The idea that the doctor and sheriff would continue to be best friends with, and socialize with, the judge and his wife, who are so totally without moral compass is ludicrous. Exactly what was it they were afraid of?? The story was predictable to the end, and disappointingly so at that. There - discussion done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent novel","review":"As other have noted, some of the motivations of the characters are a little odd.

None of the characters were that well-developed, the writing was quite juvenile and the story weak. There was an awful lot of absurdity in this story. For example, Abby steals Mitch's bird right after he leaves, and in this small town of \\"close\\" friends, the Judge and his wife never knew she had it? Even after 17 years? Ridiculous!I have never been a fan of the books by Fern Michaels and Belva Plain, but if you are, then you might enjoy this one. Otherwise, it's best to avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Fine Effort","review":"For the most part, THE VIRGIN OF SMALL PLAINS is a very well done mystery. Pickard does a great job building the story, and all the characters are interesting and sympathetic. This book has a lot of good twists, and I was genuintely surprised by the ending.The middle of THE VIRGIN OF SMALL PLAINS is somewhat slow, and almost resembles a Harlequin romance in spots. The plot did have some unbelievable holes in it, which some other reviewers have pointed out in detail. I am also not a big fan of books where coincidence plays a large role in the plot (which happens multiple times in this book). Still, the book is very enjoyable despite these minor flaws.This book was nominated for the prestigious Edgar award, and won the Agatha award for best novel.

Our bookclub read it and each one of us had the same reaction--a waste of time and money. Poorly written with typos and redundancy--it was so predictable. The plot had distinct possibilities and in the hands of an Elizabeth George or Barbara Kingsolver could have been a tremendously interesting adventure but Nancy Pickard's writing fell far short of the mark. Our discusssion in bookclub regarding this book was mostly about how such an inferior piece of writing could get such great reviews and two book awards, we're mystified..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely kept me reading, but","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I grew up in the Flint Hills, went to high school in Council Grove, and felt that the storms that overwhelm that part of my beautiful state are vividly recreated here. The characters are interesting and Pickard kept me fully involved in their stories.So why not five stars? Just because I figured out the mystery of the frozen girl far too early, well before halfway through the book. I'm not a regular mystery reader, but I think anyway who reads carefully will solve the mystery behind Sarah's death quite quickly. That doesn't mean they'll want to quit reading, because the story is well-told enough that I sure didn't mind finishing it to see how everything would wrap up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kansas Suspense","review":"This is an excellent mystery.

This novel is an easy read and once you begin, you would not want to put it down.Pickard wrote it beautifully and it is not confusing at all as with most suspense novels.

The plot takes forever to unfold and then is very convoluted with a bunch of \\"surprises\\" at the end that have not been integrated into the character or storyline before.And what's with the tornado that \\"brings together\\" all of these people or the so called \\"red herring\\" character who is as obvious a red herring as the \\"adopted\\" son is adopted. Not to mention the silly miracle worker \\"virgin\\" which would work better as a comic interlude than an actual thrown in story that makes no sense.This reads like a high school girls attempt at a writing project and was a total waste of time.

It felt like reading a bad TV movie. Hurts me to say this cuz I have been a fan of Nancy's other books, but this really felt beneath her level of writing ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"The novel started off good enough, opening right off with some romance and a mystery. Then, everything went downhill. The worst part was the characters, who were unconvincing. The 30-something female protagonist acted like a 16-year-old for the entire novel, instead of the 1987 sections alone. One of the 30-something male protagonists was so emotionally immature, that it was impossible to root for him. Other characters, not even just minor ones, seemed plain stupid. While I can believe that strange things go on in some small, rural towns, this story had too many holes. If one could get past that, he or she would surely get tripped off on the one-dimensional characters and their stiff, unrealistic dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have previewed first","review":"I must admit that this is one of the best stories I have ever read. It's a hard-to-put down book with much suspense and a lot of surprises all along the way. But the drawback is this: Why did the author have to use the name of the Lord God in vain? I would have considered this a five-star rating but because of the use of God's name in such a way, I have dropped the rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, extremely contrived read","review":"I saw that this novel had won the 'Agatha' award for 2006 so I picked it up at the library. Overall, I was disappointed in this read. It starts off well enough with an alluring premise and it's a very quick read but the mystery is very easy to figure out and the many contrivances break the story's back. This is one of those mysteries that completely relies on believing that 'best friends' of years and years and years never talk to each other to sort out a major issue like MURDER. Also, the motivations of the characters are one-dimensional and for the most part don't ring true. I can't imagine most of it really happening. The sad part is that there's a good story here, it's just told badly told. It's like some ridiculous episode of 'Cold Case'."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be a novel for preteens, not adults","review":"I can't quite understand the 5-star reviews.

First of let me tell you this I have never ever seen anyone breastfeeding in public I always see people bottlefeeding and so has everyone I know(I asked). So basicly what this writer is trying to do is scare her beliefs on to her readers and thats totally wrong. How you decide to take care of your child is your choice and if you go and buy a baby guide it should be just that not some idiots opinion. Now I'm not agains't breastfeeding I breastfed my daughter but I am agains't people that force their opinions on you until you are blue in the face.Oh and another thing about this book is that she is constantly contradicting herself.

My daughter even asked me that same question!! Pls can anyone tell me. It gives a very bad example to kids implying that homosexuality is a normal behavior.

This collection of case studies and essays may be written for the clinical professional but I think it has much to recommend to anyone interested in adult survivors of abuse.The layperson can skip the super-clinical articles and devour the rest for a glimpse into why some children and adults are more invulnerable than others to abuse and tragedy whose wounds are often a crippling or mortal blow. It was a remendously validating experience to read these stories of why and how others have done more than survive devastating abuse and tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break out the barrettes","review":"Unbelievably, people are already nostalgic for the 90's. There's VH-1's \\"I Love The 90's,\\" the recent outpouring of affection towards Bill Clinton, (even our current President seemed to miss him) and now there's The High Water Marks.They revisit a particular 90's phenomenon; multi-gender band dabbling in cutesy melodies with screeching guitars, and containing at least one tall, lanky member who usually resembles veteran character actor James Cromwell.Like those 90's bands, (Veruca Salt, Belly, etc.) the HWM's main flaw is that they try too hard to be adorable. \\"Have Another Dream\\" is perfect for babytalk and cooing with your loved one. The feedback in \\"Things To Do\\" sounds more like dolphins fornicating than a guitar. Even \\"Suicide\\" will make you think of cute 90's alternative girls with barrettes in their hair.Finally, as if pushing a joke way too far, they're actually on Eenie Meenie records."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit redundant","review":"This title shipped more quickly than I had anticipated and, being a big fan of the 1998 edition, I started in on it right away. So, while the format and the new articles were satisfying, I was a bit miffed that there were also many articles that were re-prints from the 1998 edition. I suppose that it's an old game with textbooks and those considered supplements to them, to revise, call it a new edition, and force students to pay the premium, but with a title like \\"Current Perspectives in Geology\\" I was hoping for the latest in information. Some of the articles are dated from the 1970's. Drawing from publications that include Science, Discover, Nature, and others, I would hope that there would be enough new material in the last two years to not require as many repeats. Still, five stars for those who have not read the 1998 edition, three for those of us who were hoping for more new info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Financial Scorecard ...","review":"If you would like to pay... for basically two pages of a high level summary, than order this document.

It is a story full of realistic characters, dreary settings and a look at the darker side of Maine and all of this... did absolutely nothing to intruige me.It is an amazing tale of overcoming obstacles which is nothing like my usual war/ horror novel tastes.Advisable if you are after a moving read, but if you are older than twelve and younger than twenty with no taste, stay well clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not by a Long Shot \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"","review":"I had read that this book was a little like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" and it got 5 stars, so I gave it a shot. Well, it isn't like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" And it didn't deserve 5 stars. It's an OK book, it's not horrible, it's well-meaning, but it's amateurish.

The author portrays a great understanding of Urban American life. While the book is full of fantastic description the author sometimes takes it over the top and describes the same situation in so many different ways that its easy to lose track of the story.

For a commited reader this is a fantastic piece of writing but for most others it is (I'm sorry to say) down right boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Sam - Little Sam","review":"The Reappearance of Sam Webber was a very well written book which i did enjoy reading. The author told the story very very well and you could really feel for Sam, sometimes it even felt like Sam was a real person because of how much i could understand how he was feeling. It also shows clearly throughout the novel how much Sam matures after the disappearance of his father. I really think you should take the time to read this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"the reappearance of sam webber","review":"i thought \\"the reappearance of sam webber\\" was a satisfactory book. it didn't have any great highlights to it and the ending wasn't very strong because i was waiting for sams dad to come home or something more exciting than how it did end. there were some good points to the book about racism and the troubles of a teenage kid but apart from that it wasn't very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reappearance Of Sam Webber","review":"When Sam's father disappear, Sam and his mum has to move out of their nice town to a rough city.

I was mowing grass that probably should have been cut with a bush-hog rather than a finish mower, but within 15 minutes of first use, both belts had rolled over in the pulleys and ran on their side rather than within the normal \\"V\\". This caused them to overheat and jump off the pulley, which allowed one of them to wrap under the mower and get cut. I replaced both belts with Kevlar wrapped belts and haven't had any problems since, even in the severe-duty use that I subjected them to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it but a bit disappointing","review":"Loved seasons 1 & 2, haven't been able to find season 3 anywhere.

When we decided to purchase the Baby Checkup Center we expected the usual quality. NOT SO. FP boasts portability but the legs to the table slip in and out of position so easily my 2 year old can remove them. The stethescope is made of three parts that come apart with a light tug. The scale is removeable to access the height measure but my adept 5 year old can't even get it back on. The backing to the center is made of flimsy cardboard that is held in place by prongs...hope you get the picture. I will be discarding the table and scale - holding onto the Dr. doodads.

The stethoscope fell apart, as did all of the other little pieces. The legs constantly fall off and never seem stable, the back of the table falls off. In fact, every single part of the toy easily comes apart, making it very frustrating for my 3 year old. After a few days of trying to keep all of the pieces intact, we just gave up.The concept is a good one, but the way this toy was made is very poor. The design is good, but there is no thought in keeping the pieces together. The quality of all of the medical apparatus is very poor. For my 3 and 5 year olds, this toy just did not hold up.

The legs do not attach at all making it very unstable and unsafe. I've had to take most of the pieces away from my daughter because they are very small and could easily be swallowed.

My 9 month old had the Blood pressure checker and the Stethoscope toren apart in to many pieces before they had much of a chance to even play with them. It is a total waste of time and money.

It is pretty comfortable in the hand, for shooting. Even after your hand gets a little sweaty, the grip material does not slide.I would have given it 5 stars if it actually had come with the hex driver.

It goes deeper, gives you a wealth of threads for further investigation and contains some spicy asides regarding other distionaries.

Lean is a philosophy and the biggest gains will be in the \\"buy-in\\" in the organization.

So I picked it up. I am glad I did. There are many aspects about raising daughters that are well outlined in this book that I had not considered. The author does a great job of outlining the issues, thought processes and decision-making processes he and his wife used to address the issue, and the hind-sight view of those decisions throughout the book.It was a pleasurable read that I completed in just one day (while on an airplane) because I just couldn't put it down.

Many of the points in the book can be applied to sons as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very thoughtful book","review":"I bought this book to help provide me tips on raising my daughter. I found the book to be very applicable to both my daughter and my son. In fact, I would even say that it's a good book for not only fathers but for both parents. It is very conservative which I personally like and carries a traditional approach towards raising daughters. I found it helpful, insightful and very encouraging.

If you want to raise daughters to be free, open-minded beings, this book can only be read as a handbook on what not to do. Chapters devoted to tricking girls into religious beliefs, and how to keep them conservative and away from feminism are among the highlights.

He homeschooled his children (which is fine), but he hand picked their friends. He chose his daughters' boyfriends from young men that worked for him, and if I remember correctly each daughter married their first boyfriend. I'm sure his daughters are happy, but he has raised submissive robots. Quiet scarry actually. This is called: \\"How a Man Prepares His Daughter for Life\\".

My guess is the issue has to do with the thermostat. Unit says it's at 375' but it's only at 275-300'.

That part all worked fine. But the VHS player was SO noisy--I had it set to record at a certain time, and when it came on (as I was reading) it was so annoying I had to turn it off. The second unit I got on exchange was exactly the same. It is the motor that drives the tape that makes the noise--as I played a prerecorded tape with the same problem.The other main drawback is all controls are on the DVD side, even the recording of the VHS and the elimination of channels for the VHS tuner. This is very awkward. Logic does not tell one to go to the DVD side to set up VHS items.On the plus side, the tape tracking automatically sets itself so all tapes play well, and the HD output for the DVD (won't work for VHS)is good. Can't get past the motor noise--it's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, better get out the ear plugs !","review":"I brought it home from Best Buy and unpacked it.

I bought it, and after only a month of moderate use, the laser system on the DVD player went out, kaput. Samsung customer service was friendly, but the only thing they would do - I guess this is standard procedure for the junk electronics being made now - was to repackage it and send it off to a repair facility; at my own cost, of course. Based on what I've read in other reviews, apparently I'm not alone. I realize people tend to write only when they're not satisfied, but what happened is totally unacceptable. When the guy at Samsung customer support told me the laser was shot, his only comment was, \\"It happens.\\" Apparently, even he knows they're junk.

I see other people complaining about this and I should have checked here before buying but I was on the road and it looked like a good deal with the HDMI and all.From the look of the customer service rep at the store, I suspect a lot of these units come back.

You never get the feeling that they needed a couple of \\"filler\\" songs and threw together some crap in the studio (and lets face it, this is exactly what most bands today are doing).I first heard this album on my way home from our senior trip in high school (circa 94). I had the fantastic experience of listening to the whole disc through. I was amazed when it ended...and left wanting more. So, i started it over and listened to it again. Amazing stuff. I mean, how many times in life do you run across an album that you feel compelled to listen to all the way through TWICE?Every song is valuable and an experience unto itself. If you like to think, reflect and maybe even mourn a little, this disc is perfect.stem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Windmills","review":"Windmills is my most fav song ever...love the steady beat in the background, with the guitar line over it. simple and beautiful. there's a sad, brooding quality to a lot of their songs - but at the same its kinda uplifting. good stuff - give it a listen.Btw, it's cool to see toad fans raving about their music. I think i'm the only person in NYC who still knows em - seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't work","review":"I recently bought this on clearance while looking for some cheap powered speakers. It never worked in that capacity, but the blue LED power indicator light is surprisingly robust, and could double as a flashlight in an emergency.

The previous reviewer mentioned the recipes at the end of the book. My kids and I have tried two of them (the cinnamon sugar plums and the frosty fruit squares) and they were very successful. My younger daughter gets a kick out of reading the book now and hearing the names of the cookies we've made. I love the rhythm of Rylant's words and the warmth and security she presents without making her stories sappy. This is a great book for the 4-6 age range. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet dream of a book","review":"My children, 5 and 6, love this book. We checked it out so many times from the library I finally had to buy it so other children could enjoy it. While my children liked the images of a cat's peaceful and safe life (and the cookies), I liked the book because it reinforces the message of showing kindness to animals. The bakers' kindness and humanity towards the cat and children is a message which can never be repeated too often. We also liked the cookie recipes at the back of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply drawn and a cozy story about an adopted stray cat.","review":"My 3 year old loves this story. I think it's my husband's favorite too! While the pictures are simple, they work for the story. The pages are bright and colorful. The story is about an old cookie baker who adopts a stray cat. This cozy cat is loved by the whole town, from the old man who found the cat, to the man at the fish store and the children who stop in and let him lick the milk drops from their fingers. It gives you a warm fuzzy feeling which is perfect for bedtime!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a \\"must have\\" for your child's library!","review":"This is one of my daughter's favorite books because of the colorful and lively illustrations, Ms. Rylant's flowing story line, and of course the recipes in the back of the book are a treat. I love the book because it teaches children to be kind to animals. It is a lovely story of a kitten who found the perfect home."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a litter bag","review":"Sorry but the product description is misleading.

Will the mean old rich lady get her comeuppance? [organ chord] Will Milt find out who his *real* father is? [organ chord] Will Becky and Ralph get back together again? [organ chord]Tossing in a Columbine-type element doesn't add the *contemporary* touch that the writer hoped would elevate this beyond soap. Without it, all that would be missing would be the Palmolive ads; with it, we just get the heavy hand of nastiness.Several have mentioned Nobody's Fool (a truly great movie) as a parallel, but that's like comparing King Lear with Days of Our Lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire Falls 2 DVD set","review":"A real treat, visually, emotionally, an a cast that just doesn't get any better.

Even the excellent calibre of actors couldn't do more for this mediocre story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I see why people get all crazy about this \\"film\\" - it depicts what people THINK us New Englanders are like, when in reality it's not even close. This movie/tv-special was packed with stars, but I couldn't tell you WHY. It's pretty boring. I read the book and didn't like it much so I couldn't tell you why I bothered to watch this thing too. Yah, the acting is fine, but the story is cluttered and confusing and there is NO RESOLUTION at the end. These people spent all this money and put all this effort into making this thing only to kill it all with a ridiculously stupid quick ending.People like to think New Englanders are hokey home-town people but really we're not. I don't go to a local diner and talk to people and no one I've ever known does either. I was very disappointed in this movie cause the ending is just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it","review":"My book club read the book, so I watched the DVD already knowing what would happen.Nevertheless I loved the movie. Yes it is long, but it covers the story very well. Paul Newman steals the show. He made his character even better than in the book. Helen Hunt was fab as the ex-wife.Putting the book to pictures really fleshed it out. I love in the end when you see the mill, turned into an L.L. Bean outlet. That's so typical of today's economy -- good jobs gone retail clerk.So yes, it is long, but the story is engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I have ever seen","review":"The plodding, boring plot was bad.But, the poor acting was even worse.We kept watching the whole thing, wondering if it would ever get better.Alas, it just got more boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Cast & Story -- Don't Miss!","review":"Missed this when it originally aired on HBO. Living in Maine, I had to see it. It follows the book very well, which BTW is also a good read.The cast of Empire makes Russo's novel come to life. Ed Harris as Miles Roby is just how you'd picture him. Many memorable scenes by Joanne Woodward (Francine Whiting) and Paul Newman (Max Roby) add just the right amount of humor. The other actors play their roles convincingly. Helen Hunt's character reminds me a bit of Carol in As Good as it Gets. Dennis Farina, Aidan Quinn, Danielle Panabaker and many others round out the cast and make this a truly enjoyable movie. It is presented in Chapters, and at times is narrated.I highly recommend this movie. And, if you're ever passing through Skowhegan, Maine, look for the Empire Grill, complete with the indian sign out front."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and slow-paced","review":"Although a star-studded cast, this movie seems to have no plot and moves ever so slowly. I usually love HBO mini-series and love the late Paul Newman and his wife JoAnne Woodward; but this was a very poor vehicle as one of Newman's last; although Newman was the only superb about this mini series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect even after the 20th time.","review":"I wish I could give this 100 stars. Even after watching this numerous times, I laugh and cry every single time. The performances are flawless, the story is heartbreaking and at the same time, uplifting. A beautiful story beautifully acted by everyone in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really well-done","review":"I really like this movie/ miniseries. Ed Harris is amazing, as usual (see Pollack). I give it a 5 relative to movies of it's type. Citizen Kane it isn't. But, for a laid back story about real people in a real setting, it couldn't have been done better. Re:Another review that called it slow-paced and boring, what do you expect? I assume you need a car chase and gunshots every 15 seconds to be satisfied. Stick to action junk. I like reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire Falls","review":"We accidently ended up in Skowhegan, Maine one night last Fall while on a leaf peeping tour. There we ran across the little jewel of a diner, The Empire Grill. The food was great, but its history was even better. We had to buy the book, which was a wonderful read, then ordered the DVD. I thought that the characters in the story were perfectly cast and the acting superb--Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Phillip Seymore Hoffman, Ed Harris, Helen Hunt, so no wonder. The movie was true to the story and its setting evoked the sense of the place. In fact, I'm going to read the book again now that I have a mental image of the Russo's characters, the diner, and Empire Falls. What a wonderful story and an excellent movie portrayal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mavericks Gold","review":"This is a great either for fans of the Mavericks or for those of us who are fans and introducing their music to friends and family.

I almost got pulled over listening to this album so use caution, but if you want good Electronica, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Renditions of Billy's Classics!","review":"This is arguably Blanchard's best work. Smooth, soothing ballads and groovy upbeat renditions make this album fly by. I'm not a big fan of trumpet muting, but he employs it here without being shrill or annoying. The vocals are wonderful too. Jeanie Bryson does Billy's emotion justice while adding her own dash of sultry swing and flair. It's a great performance on all parts. Many of the ballads are reminiscent of \\"I'm Old Fashioned\\" by Coltrane and \\"Blue in Green\\" by Miles Davis. If that's what you like this has it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blanchard","review":"I was happy to get a good product of a low price.

And he sure sounds good. Maybe 1 of those days he'll take up the stage or take up the place as the next level of Quincy Jones, John Williams, Henry Mancini, Leonard Bernstein, Elmer Bernstein, Jerry Goldsmith, just to name a few.When I fell in love w/ this CD which I checked out at a local library I was amazed. This s**t is poppin when I heard it was good.

I've used other Holmes humidifiers in the past that have been great, but this one is a horrible, low-quality product. One leaky humidifier is a fluke, but two means shoddy craftsmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"To call this \\"ultra-dry\\" is the overstatement of the year.

Kind of disappointed to find that it is the same old pop nonsense that 90's record execs spent the decade trying to pass off as \`alternative.' A typical lyric? \`Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.' If you have any interest in originality; if you listen to PJ Harvey or The Geraldine Fibbers, if you owned \`Bleach' before \`Nevermind' was even a twinkle in Kurt Cobain's eye, if you still have VU and Nico on vinyl-give this CD a wide berth.

While the album is not a complete snoozefest, it is the kind of music that can be easily forgotten and thrown onto your shelf, not to be seen for a couple years. While the extreme energy of \\"plowed\\" makes you want to run in the streets or start your own band, songs like \\"molly\\" and \\"rotting pinata\\" are enjoyable to listen to a few times and quickly start to become a drone. This is a good CD to pick up at a used CD store if you are into the mid 90's sound or you are like me and are captivated by \\"plowed.\\" In conclusion, even though singer Vinnie wants you to \\"plow [him] under the ground,\\" this album hardly does any such effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"It seems every record I look up on Amazon has at least 4 stars. they really all can't be that good can they?

The name sounds familiar, like one of those post-grunge acts that has none of the heart or soul of the first wave of bands that originated the genre. Just buy a Pixies album instead. There's nothing to hear here but a droning mess of noise, static, and a monotone nobody with nothing to say. Grunge was all about nobodies with a tale to tell. And it was occasionally catchy. Unlike Sponge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just found out yesterday that \\"Plow\\" wasn't by Mike Ness of Social Distortion","review":"When someone buys a full-length album, and grumbles about how it only has one good song on it, this disc is the kind of album they're talking about.Sponge is a fitting name for this band; they absorb and concentrate all their good music into one song. And I swear to God, I actually thought \\"Plowed\\" was a Social Distortion song until I saw the music video on VH-1 (literally) yesterday for it. No wonder I couldn't figure out why Mike Ness was singing over a power pop ballad. It was an impersonator.I give this album half a star for one good song. It would've gotten a full five stars had \\"Plow\\" actually been from Social D on an album surrounded by equally-good Social D songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankfully","review":"Since the record stores seem to only want to carry top 40 and rap (which for some sad reason makes up most of the top 40 anyway) its nice to be able to find the music I want somewhere still.

What a mistake that was! When I returned from over seas a few years ago I dug it out of my closet and listened to it all the way through. I have to say this is one of the best rock albums to come out of the 90's. There something I just can't put my finger on but no one else really had a sound like this then or now.

The project wandered in the weeds, the book wandered right along with it. I thought the book (as Soul of a New Machine did for building a computer+software) would capture the excitement of software development. It didn't.Maybe the Chandler project is really a team containing some very reputable people stuck in the doldrums, and maybe there would be some point in reading about it if the author made me feel the struggle of the developers trying to break out of the trap.

There's nothing worth reading there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soul of a new machine","review":"The book starts off well but I abandoned the book about two thirds of the way in and began skimming to see how it ends.

It is mainly about a digital calendar project called Chandler and the issues around it. What makes the book so unique is that the author manages to narrate the technical and not so technical aspects of the project in a familiar way. As I was reading the book, I could relate to the difficulties people in Chandler project faced. In addition to the main story, the author mixes in general software knowledge along with brief touches of computing history and philosophy at the right times in the right amounts which made the book even more enjoyable. It's a good read and packed with lots of insight and useful knowledge. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"After the first chapter I was skeptical. After the second I was depressed.This is the kind of humour that I imagine really motivates low level techies who assemble computers for a living and makes them feel superior to the entire world because they can plug in a video card. Remember the tech guy that insults you from \\"Saturday Night Live\\"? To be clear its intellectual arrogance about stuff that's not that intellectual.This is the field I'm going to base my life's work on. I don't need to read how hard it is. I want to read about successful projects and how ppl coded great applications. I mistook this book for \\"Beautiful Code\\" which I'm guessing is a lot closer to something I'd like to read.I wish I could send this book back but it was bought as a gift for me in an airport.

Many times I have pushed the state of the art, at least the commercial state of the art. This book ticked me off because I see some of the pieces I think these supposedly great software folks missed. It bugged the hell out of me because after all that and even a book about it the software, Chandler, really sucks. Is this supposed to be anywhere close to the best we can do?It sounds to me like an awful lot of time was spent on navel gazing, self congratulation, being a prima donna and trying to get over that, and ego-tripping politics.

It really describes via examples and a 'journal'-style events that had happened in the past with me and most likely anyone that has been involved with software development in a professional manner.Some of the ideas and facts exposed can either let you down and make you think twice about creating software or at least, what was in my case, to rethink about the way you have treated the software industry in order to not repeat the same mistakes.I consider a must have book for anyone that wants to create software no matter which technology/language/platform or area (programmer, architect, manager etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"Dreaming in Code documents the struggles that we as software developers, architects and project managers face with nearly every project.

After the first time that I drove with it on the seat, I noticed that the material had torn in the area where the back piece meets the seat piece. It tore a little above the seam, not at the seam.

I think most fans out there would prefer to wait a year, even two years or however long it takes to release a proper package including the Harold Ramis years, which are on par with any other comedy show's peak years.That being said, I don't think this package would be all that bad had they actually released the original series first.

These SCTV shows were far better remembered than relived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Some Episodes Weren't Included","review":"My guess why earlier episodes weren't included is because the creators of the show freely lifted copyrighted materials. This was admitted in the commentaries on the earlier DVDs. In fact, on some of the DVD sets they had to remaster sound tracks or edit out certain skits because they couldn't obtain permission retroactively.Remember, SCTV started as a modest syndicated TV show in a Canadian market. They figured no one would notice or care. Times are different now.Personally, I'd love to see the episode which was a lift of a \\"Cisco Kid\\" episode redubbed. No doubt they didn't get permission from the copyright holders to do that, so there's no way we'll see that on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCTV; Best Of The Early Years","review":"These DVDs's exceeded my expectations.

The 90 minute shows which came out later though very good were quite commercialized and lacking the \\"edge\\" of the early 30 minute shows.

I wanted a taste of meteorology on that level, and this book does it. Mostly it involves no more than high school physics with algebra, but the concepts are what really matter in understanding this subject. The book does go further into calculus if one so chooses. I am please to fill one of the few gaps left in my pursuit of knowledge, but I warn my fellow Americans who still wallow in the archaic system that this book assumes metric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roland B.

I specifically had in mind photographing wedding day activities, including working without an assistant and in more spread-out spaces when I decided to try this item. This belt strapped on comfortably over my dress pants (and belt) and allowed me to attach a couple of pouches for holding lenses, a flash and miscellaneous gear. Everything I needed that wasn't in hand was available on my person and easily accessible. A significant improvement over trying to use a \\"fanny\\" pack for holding lenses and such, or having to run over to a bag in a corner every time I needed to swap something out.The belt distributed the weight and did not bind, feeling comfortable even over my hip bones and dress belt.

It works its way chronologically across the \\"classic seven\\" albums, and skips Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, which some might consider the Moody Blues' best work. Then we have a few \\"critics,\\" who are not exactly intellectuals themselves, telling us what's wrong with the MBs. (Remember boys, it's only rock-and-roll. The music is never Mozart and the lyrics are never Dante.) And so we must listen to them tell us why, for example, the poetry is so bad, in banal and simplistic prose. No one bothers to explain where it might have come from, such as the \\"spoken word\\" in Zodiac's Cosmic Sounds, which was an influential record in the psychedelic movement at the time. To top it off, every four minutes we see a clip of the Moodies performing Nights in White Satin. Can I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This DVD is quite frustrating: we get short clips from various songs and usually after some ten seconds of (mostly lip-sync) music, we see a talking head commenting about the music, the context, the era. The members of the band do not comment anywhere here. Most of the musical clips gathered here come from the DVD titled LOST PERFORMANCE, which was recorded in Paris in 1970. This one hour DVD is not worth the price, even though we get a few vintage seconds from the song \\"Blue Guitar\\" (1975) performed (lip-sync) by Justin Hayward and John Lodge on TV. But again, this rare song is not complete. We also see three early performances of the Moody Blues with Denny Laine (without Hayward and Lodge). One has to admit there are very few visual archives related to the Moody Blues' \\"golden age\\" (1967-1974). However, there are other DVDs that do justice to the Moody Blues' immense talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake to buy?","review":"Probably yes.I agree with all the above reviews.

Booklet never arrived.Please leave comments below for questions or input, which we are open to receiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Live Wire","review":"This is an extraordinary book. A very personal mish-mash of methods, many not to be found elsewhere in the public domain. The author adopts the pose of a would-be tutor of the future \\"antichrist\\" with convincing brio. At times the spelling and grammar are atrocious, giving the impression that English is the author's second language; future editions could benefit from the attention of an editor. There are some very practical and extremely dangerous exercises in unorthodox (or highly esoteric) Nei Kung, innumerable random -and fascinating- historical notes, formulae, spells, antijewish diatribes, and practical applications of Bardon's system. This is where the rubber meets the road: not neat or pretty, but there is significant traction here. Interesting for the would-be antichrist, and for the rest of us as a window into the mind of hardworking real-life magician who has taken his quest for power to the limit."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time?","review":"You need the tapes, to be able to work with this book.

He couldn't even find the tapes himself. So don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blend of conversational and literary styles.","review":"This rare volume presents conversational usage via Arabic orthography. It is very useful; in fact, it is the only book I've seen which uses primarily Arabic medium (rather than English) to give the reader easy, accessible, engaging subject material.

It really works well. No configuration necessary with Skype (haven't tried other uses). The plug and play is real! The best part is the full duplex capability (each side can talk at the same time and hear each other).Could shrink the form factor. It's very light so it seems like they could slim it down even further if they tried. One other improvement could be to put a simple volume control for the speaker and a mute button.

If I had realized this up front, I would not have ordered this speakerphone. The other lacking feature which I was aware of, is that there is NO external volume control. Mute and volume controls are both accessible thru Windows, but I find that method to be quite annoying after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious muting problems","review":"I've had good luck using a variety of headsets with Skype, but wanted to see if I could free myself of having to put one on whenever someone calls. Unfortunately, I had little luck getting the MiniVox to work in an actual conversation. When I tried to record audio with, say, Audacity, the MiniVox sounded just fine, but as soon as I tried using it in a two-way conversation, my outgoing audio would be badly muted whenever I was receiving audio from the person I was talking to.So I tried a little experiment, and played music through the MiniVox while I tried to record some audio with Audacity. Sure enough, the record audio was chopped to pieces. I tried various settings, and even downloaded and used the MiniVox volume-setting software. No luck.Perhaps I've made some sort of cockpit error, and need to change my setup.

And, I dreaded the thought of having to transfer all my equipment back and forth between the bags. So, I tried different ways of carrying my camera bag more comfortably than around my neck but nothing worked until I discovered this harness.The description says it is designed for specific Tamrac bags, but it will work with any camera bag that has large enough rings to accommodate two snaps each (you can see in the picture there are four ends to the harness).It was simple to attach the harness with the quick-release snaps and easy to adjust the straps to the length that works for me.

Chapters include Adapting to an ITSM Culture, ITSM Visioning Work Stage, ITSM Assessment Work Stage, ITSM Planning Work Stage, ITSM Process Overviews, ITSM Organization Roles, etc. This book is more about project management instead of specific how-to hints for creating real world ITIL compliant policies and procedures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stating the Obvious","review":"This book basically takes a standard project implementation methodology and applies it to ITIL in an attempt to claim that the book will enable organization's to implement ITIL processes.

From the importance of goal setting to exercises that develop correct position to riding the intricacies of and equitation course, you'll find some valuable information pertaining to it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book is inspirational for anyone desiring to improve his/her riding experience. There is a motivational aspect to this book, setting it apart from others I've read. Encouragement for riders of all abilities, who possess dedication, desire and a true love of horses is evident throughout.The basic foundations required for developing as a successful rider are covered clearly and concisely with appropriate exercises included. Great attention is paid to the importance of setting personal goals and developing a realistic plan for achieving them. This is definitely a book to be shared with your trainer. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallville...Please step your game up!!!","review":"I know everyone's jumping on the bandwagon with how great this show is. Not alot of critique. Hmmm...maybe because of pretty boy Tom and princess Lana. This show could be so much better. It has its good episodes but in only half of all 4 seasons!! This is more like me pleading than me scorning. Come on, quit the 'I luv Lana,' 'I need Lana in my life' crap and get to some action, drama, thriller type Pre-Superman brawling. Even at the end of the sixth season he doesn't learn to fly. Why is it that the only time Clarke flies is when he is taken over by Jor-El, when he wears that retarded red ring or when he is cloned by that stupid phantom (season six)??? Enough with Lana. I wanted her to stay dead instead of Clark's dad. She's annoying and holding Clarke back from really moving on. Cloey's my choice. Clark never has a good fight.They should stage him in some good fist throwing action with some alien brawlers. It's simple...I WANNA SEE SOME ACTION!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":".....check the price!","review":"I love Smallville; I knew very little about Superman from comics or movies, so I don't have much of a base of comparison, but I love this show! I've seen maybe half of season 5 and none of season 6, but everything up to that point was riveting and clever, in my opinion. Michael Rosenbaum is fabulous as Lex, Kristen Kreuk is hot and vulnerable and sweet as Lana, and Erica Durance brought in some great new \\"blood\\" and personality as Lois.Why then, do you ask, did I give it only 2 stars? Because this set of the first four seasons is grossly overpriced when compared to buying the seasons individually. At the time of this writing, the first 5 seasons are all available for less than $25 each, and this set is $165!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smallville-A Great Stupid Superman Story","review":"This ridiculous TV show series is only interesting if you are 13 and 11. My two oldest kids are-and they have had hours of fun with this series this summer. Second only to \\"Gilmore Girls\\", this TV series in a box is a must-have for summer sleepovers for the late tweenager and early teenager. Avoid watching too much if you are over this age group. As a mother-watch out...there are a few adult situations. Mild compared to most on TV, somewhere between PG and PG13."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good show","review":"The first season remains my favorite. The fourth season is the least strong in terms of writing and story telling but still quite enjoyable. I find the plot on Lana being possessed by a witch distracting and annoying. Nontheless the show in a whole is very entertaining and this four season DVD set offers excellent value."},{"rating":"1","title":"TINY!!!","review":"This is a very small set that would be used as a toy for a child if you are looking for a big tea set this is not for you. Was very disappointed when it came in the mail in a tiny box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding primer for the Photoshop user","review":"Most books go over all the essentials. Even Deke McClelland's find ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS2 ONE-ON-ONE is great at introducing the NEW features and changes. But Ben's book is a quickie, one-day overview of what's new and improved and changed. For the price, there is no better book for someone buying PSCS2 to upgrade from any older version (like I did, from quaint old Photoshop 5.5). Full color pictures and clear typography -- making it easy to go back and review -- just make this book a steal at Amazon's discounted price. Get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, but doesn't work","review":"I was really excited when I saw this and couldn't wait to get home and try it out. I thought it'd be really helpful now to put toys on for my 5 month old and when he gets older, for finger foods, but the tray doesn't snap on. It falls off immediately, doesn't really fit onto the seat at all, and seems quite useless. I bought it this morning and will be returning it this afternoon. For $2.50 (at Target) I'd try it again, if they redesigned it to somehow snap onto the seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watching Newman work with the class could be the finest moment ever in TV","review":"I can't add much more than the others above, they're right on target. There couldn't have been a more appropriate premier guest than Newman. Watching him and listening to him relate his career is revealing and humbling. One of the most selfless, honest, and generous people we'll ever know. And the workshop segment (something I'd like to see more of), working, acting, coaching the students - total grace. He worked with the class as if he knew them for years, - as if he was just another student himself. The students in that class, in that short time, probably learned more about the craft AND more about themselves, than they'll ever get in the rest of their lives.A seminal moment in television.Thank-you, Mr. Newman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful interviews with some legends.","review":"I'm a huge Actors Studio fan. As easy as it is to make fun of Dean Lipton, I think he does a great job of stepping out of the way and letting the actors shine with their answers. Really loved the men on this collection. The Newman interview is one of my favs. Redford and Eastwood also have interesting stories to share of their rise to stardom.I'm gonna give it 4 stars instead of 5 just because of Barbara. Listen, the woman has talent, a great story, etc. But it's hard not to laugh at those nails and some of her mannerisms. But I admire her talent and career.I just PRAY all the Actor Studio episodes are released at some point. For now, this will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSIDE THE ACTORS STUDIO","review":"Perhaps it's because mi english it's no so good, but I think the audio it's not quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is SIMPLE?","review":"In this book he never really puts together what SIMPLE really means . The story about how he became a trader are a little hard to believe. He couldn't recognize that he was being scammed twice,turning his life upside down then all of a sudden he understands the futures market in a few months . He had such a brief trading history and then writes a book about a technique that is not exclusive . Much too pricey for the content!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"This is really helpful for someone who hates doing situps. I felt my muscles tighten the first few times I used it. Would probably work if I used it more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product even though the price was very reasonable","review":"Disappointed. Wanted to use as a rowing exerciser...resistance was slight, there should be a way of increasing the resistance; also, within several days of receiving...the foam bit near the pedals came off. I wear 7.5 sneakers and they did not fit properly in the stirrups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I just got this rowing action exerciser and I'm not too impressed. It's made out of foam and doesn't feel strong enough to actually do sit ups. And the resistance is very light. Barely feels like a work out. This would probably be perfect for a 10 yr old?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Ministry, you will cream in your jeans.","review":"It is difficult to see Ministry live; Tours are usually painfully short. Especially today! Where are they?? Not to mention they don't always make it anywhere near where you live. If you like Ministry as I do and have not had an oppertunity to see them live this will definately give you a feel for some of the excitement. Got to love the two drummer intro in the begining with Breath. This video covers songs from The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste and The Land of Rape and Honey, a CD is also available. In my opinion you can't miss this live concert event. Ministry videos are practically impossible to find. Overall got to give this two thumbs up (don't have three)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like the live show","review":"There's nothing like the sound of live music, and Ministry gets the crowd jumpin' with their own brand of sonic fury. The cage climbers are awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Dated","review":"This Video is Boring. I'm a big Ministryfan, especially of the years '89-'92, butthis video just bored me.The visuals sucked. AND the biggest thingthat bugged me was the fact that when theywould cloe-up on Al Jourgensen's Mouth atthe words weren't matching, as if he was LipSyncing or something.

No, wait... that's an insult to people who had at least the brains to go to college in the first place. What high-school fan-boy made this ...? The cheesy \\"special-effects,\\" the mixing of old Ministry video footage, and not enough of the band and Jourgenson himself. And who the Hell wants to watch more footage of a side guitarist who does a bad imitation of Jourgenson than of the Man himself? Iron Maiden did a \\"live concert video\\" a couple years before, and it turned out a lot better than this dreck.

It makes you want to go to a good hockey game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Rachel Gibson more every book!","review":"See Jane Score was a great ride, I mean read. I think that Rachel Gibson gets me inside the character's heads, thoughts and hearts more than many of my favorite authors. Yeah, Luc is a jock goalie, Jane is plain (not), but there the cliches end. Luc has a Canadian background which is intriguing, while Jane is a secret nympho (in print, anyway). As a journalist, she writes a kind of 'Sex in the City' column, the nympho series for a men's magazine no less, and to my bafflement, was offered the hockey sports column in a major newspaper. It was only interim while the columnist was out sick, but what a gas! Locker rooms (hoo-yah) and jocks!The humour and the 'I'm gonna die of love' that is really true to life were wonderfully written. And just imagine being the only female with a group of professional sportsmen. The heat can get pretty intense - and so did the envy ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Icy HOT","review":"I LOVED this book. I'm not a big hockey fan, but there was just enough info about the sport to keep the story going. Luc was HOT. I'm not a big tattoo person but... yowzer. Jane was REAL.

Always cute & great light reading. Loved the story. Funny & quirky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!!","review":"This was my first Rachel Gibson book, and I will definitely read more! \\"See Jane Score\\" is the best contemporary romance that I have read in quite awhile. Gibson has a gift for drawing you into the character's minds; I found myself really rooting for them to get together. And who knew hockey players could be so sexy?! Well, hockey fans, I guess... I loved the fact that Jane refused to change who she was to win over the man (save for one daring red dress, but every girl's got to have one hot dress). All in all, it was a great fast-paced story that drew me in from the first page. I had a hard time putting this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Hard to Put Down","review":"Even though Jane is not a sports reporter, she's assigned to cover the Seattle Chinooks hockey team. She and the goalie, Luc Martineau, start off as antagonists, then friends, then lovers. This is a light, fun novel, better than your standard romance. The only thing I found lacking concerned the supporting characters-- in general, I think Rachel Gibson could do a better job of fleshing them out and adding more of them to her plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCORE BIG...

Rachel Gibson is a very talented contemporary writer! See Jane Score!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the others","review":"I dearly love Rachel Gibson novels. Her heroines are always charming and her heroes great. And they are funny.But not in this book. In the first place, I cannot admire a woman who supports herself by writing porn.More of a problem is that Jane cannot believe Luc could love her because she's not tall, blond and gorgeous. She is more shallow than the hero. She cares for him because he's a star athlete who's gorgeous and sexy and has a great tatoo.I think it needed another edit. Parts are rough and the motivation fluctuates. I still can't see why the hero changed his mind in the end except he had to or the book would not have ended happily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"This was the third Rachel Gibson book I've read and (so far) my favorite.The writing is adorable/very sexy/and fast paced.What I liked best about this book...It was written so well, I didn't find a single boring sentence that made me feel like \\"skimming\\".I also found myself smiling through the entire book.A common thread with almost all \\"romantic/comedy\\" or \\"romance\\" books.... is the inevitable ending with a heart ache/break-up.For me, the break-ups/heart aches are the most boring parts.They are always completely predictable, and the reunion is also completely predictable. (snore)!Luckily, the break-up in \\"See Jane Score\\" is very short .... nor was it some \\"stupid\\" misunderstanding that caused the break-up.(thank-you Rachel).If you like to weep and find pleasure reading about broken hearts, don't buy this book.If you like to giggle, smile and enjoy reading sizzling sexy stories - that are fun & fast paced .... buy \\"See Jane Score\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"See Jane Score","review":"Rachel Gibson tells a compelling story about how a plain \\"Jane\\" gets the guy. This story isn't just about love it's also about finding yourself and becoming comfortable in your own skin. That aspect of the book makes it even more enjoyable because the heroin is not just some drop-dead-gorgous bombshell and it is more relatable to everyone who reads it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the first in the series...","review":"This book was better than the first in the series - the relationship between the hero and heroine was much better developed, with a gradual and more realistic progression to their happily ever after. The reader believed it when they overcame their obstacles and fell in love with each other. The plot was good and the pacing was faster - more of a page-turner, and themes weren't repeated over and over as they were in the first book. A good read by this author and vast improvement over the first in the series (and several of her other books in different series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Gibson needs a new editor","review":"\\"Nancy boy?\\" Seriously, who speaks like this? The dialogue was not just unbelievable, but just terribly awkward and goofy. I can deal with an unbelievable plot line -- this is a romantic fantasy, afterall. But graphic sex scenes do not make up for cringeworthy writing.Plus, there's one thing I really couldn't forgive: When Jane is in Detroit and looking out her window ... at Lake Michigan?!? Look at a map Ms. Gibson! Lake Michigan is hundreds of miles away, on the other side of the state! How does this $@%# get by an editor?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!","review":"What an enjoyable book! When I picked this book up I couldn't put it down!

This is probably the best account of a battle that I've read, along with A Bridge Too Far. The descriptions of the horrors of the Caen battlefield - particularly the Battle of the Falaise Gap - are excellently done. One gets a good feel for small unit tactics in the British Army, especially tank actions. They ought to make a movie out of this!!!McKee also does not hold back on stories of Allied war crimes, with the English, Canadians and Scottish mistreating and executing prisoners, especially SS-troops. It certainly gives a dark side to the story, especially the Canadians, who seemed to have been especially venegful (many were descended from Frenchmen).

The low budget, cheesy physical special effects give a certain sense of other worldliness that today's CGI cannot obtain. The various sci-fi ideas that appear in different episodes seem to be written with the expectation that the children who would be watching the show on Saturday morning are capable of thinking, which is so much better than the dumbed down garbage that is being aimed at children today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy but still a little dissapointed","review":"I just bought this item because I really love this show. i think it is amazing. the reason i gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 is there are no special features. i would still recommend this to any fan of sid & marty kroft.

But our kids LOVE IT!!! AS soon as we finished the first season, our kids were begging us to get the second season. They could not wait to find out what happened to Marshal, Will, and Holly.

Regardless of whether a parent intends to raise a child in a religious household, I believe it is important that children understand their cultural heritage, which includes knowing the stories that make up their (and their ancestors') religious heritage. When we read the stories in this book, we also talk about what they mean or the lesson being taught. The lovely illustrations help hold my grandson's interest. When we come across the few words with which he may not be familiar, I tell him what they mean. It is amazing how much a child retains. I will leave it up to my grandchildren to decide what they want to believe when they are older. I agree with reviewers who note that this book is as appropriate for Christians as for Jews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely book of Bible Stories","review":"I looked for a long time to find a book of Bible stories that were not part of a Christian collection, but were aimed at younger children. I was very glad to come across this one! I am unclear why previous reviews consider this to be Christian? The table of contents does not say anything about the \\"Old Testament\\", so perhaps this was only in a previous addition? The pictures are vibrant and compelling, and the language is simple and clear. The pictures alone are enough to bring my children back to this book over and over and over, but my five year old requests certain stories over and over, and my older children (10 and 12) are easily able to read these stories to their younger sibling without stumbling over words. Personally, I do use these as bedtime stories. The pictures are beautiful, and the stories short enough to be easily finished in less than 15 minutes. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functions as promised, but....","review":"I received mine from Amazon w/o any chips, etc. It works as promised, but browning a whole chicken is a challenge.

However, after only three months's usage (and I use it at least once a week), it was such a disappointment when one of the handles broke off.I immediately began searching for a replacement for the pot and it seems there is none anywhere.Take care with those handles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"After slightly over a year, the liner developed a couple of chips and, upon closer examination, two cracks along the height of the liner. These developed the last time I used it--in one use and for no apparent reason. Though I love the way the cooker looks, I've never used it for anything other than slow cooking so its versatility is useless to me. Even if a replacement liner was available, I would worry this would happen again (with food inside?) so I'm going back to the stoneware style--which lasts many, many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-Functional","review":"I didnt have any heating problems with this unit, other then the fact that the crock handles were insanely hot, and the unit was rather hot in general.The major problem I have is with the weird shape and how fragile the crock is. The shape means that things dont fit in naturally. A pot roast has to be cut before it fits, a lamb roast needs to be shoved in. A bag of meatballs doesnt fit fully, but in a normal pot it does.Bottom line, I wouldnt buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a great buy","review":"This is a great crockpot and it is really great for sauting ingrediants prior to slow cooking. The one thing I don't like about it is that it claims you can sear with it. My idea of searing is browning on all sides over high heat. This crockpot can not be put over a high flame just low to medium-low on the stove top so I still have to use a seperate pan to sear things. Besides that one flaw I think it a great buy and slow cooks wonderfully. The cookbook that it comes with has easy and for the most part healthy recipes that are not overloaded with salt as alot of slow cooker recipes are. I also love the rustic look that it has. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"versaware - strange shape, too hot","review":"I have the 6 quart oval Versaware Crockpot. I was so excited that I 'd be able to brown food before slow-cooking it! I am very dissapointed with the results of my 1st recipe - Beef Stroganoff. While browning the meat, one spot on the bottom of the crock began burning and smoking! None of my regular pots have problems with uneven cooking, so its not my stove. Then, even on low temp, with sauce, the meat stuck to the sides of the crock. I will try another recipe, but am afraid this new model cooks too hot to be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle breaks easily","review":"I bought this crock pot because it didn't look like a traditional country style crock pot.

Both handles on the crock pot broke off within the first three times using it (not due to excessive force).

Be warned that it only plays one song, and once your child learns how to turn it on by themself, they will not stop doing it for long periods of time. So try to get used to the constant annoying music, or maybe this toy will have to be hidden every few days.

It is very loud even without the blocks and extremely loud when used with the blocks. Since I got the toy from my mother-in-law and didn't feel I could return it, I made the best of things. I put rolled up baby socks on the rotating discs so that my son could still watch stuff \\"twirl\\" around without being deafened.My son is not attracted to this toy.

It looked so cool from the box. It is very loud and annoying and impossible to keep together. The mat that goes with the toy is worthless and kept coming apart from the toy mechanism. The only thing that proved to be entertaining for my child was the stackable \\"blocks\\" that came with it. The spinning part of the toy just frustrated the heck out of my daughter. She wanted to stack the blocks and it was too hard for her to do on the rotating parts. Watching the blocks fall and fly off is probably fun for some kids, but my daughter preferred to just use the blocks alone one the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twirlin Whirlin piece of junk...","review":"That's why my husband calls the toy.

She cried and scrambled to get away from it. And to this day all I have to do is pick it up and she will fuss and sometimes cry. This is a baby who when at a scottish festival laughed and clapped when they set off the cerimonial cannons and bagpipers began to play. So needless to say this was not money well spent for us.

I would stack the blocks up and they would knock them down to watch them spin around across the four spinners. It didn't take them long to learn to stack and start/stop it by themselves. Their Physical Therapist likes this toy because it teaches hand eye coordination to stack and knock over the \`flowers', especially while spinning. And the stop/start button teaches cause and effect.The music is loud, the toy could be improved with a volume control. But it is not that bad. If I need a break from the music I just simply put the toy away for a while. For us the toy has held up very well. I have now 11 month old triplets that lay across to stop the spinners, smack at the \`flowers' and basicly crawl all over this toy and its still working fine. We have gotten more than grandma's moneys worth out of this toy. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twirlin' Whirlin' Garden Breaks Down","review":"We bought the Twirlin' Whirlin' Garden as a gift for our 6 month twin daughters and they immediately loved it. They were especially amused by the spinning disks and loved to knock the plastic blocks off the stations so they would swirl around. It can get quite noisy so it is not a \\"quiet time\\" toy. Unfortunately, my girls liked to use their hands (or body) to hold down the spinning disks (so they would stop moving), and after 2 months of this, the disks stopped spinning (I think they wore down the motor somehow). I think this toy is suggested for 6 months and older, but I would suggest older children (perhaps 8 - 10 months and up) who can sit easily on their own and wouldn't necessarily lie across the spinning disks)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware: SERIOUS Quality Control Issues!!","review":"We hated, hated, HATED this thing...'cause despite purchasing THREE of them, we never really got to play with one! Even though it IS cute, plays fun music, and appears to have the potential to be a lot of fun, we actually purchased THREE seperate Twirlin' Whirlin' Gardens three seperate times, and EVERY SINGLE time we got one home and took it out of the box, it was broken!! One time we had one of the little belts inside break (this is similar to a vaccuum cleaner), another time the little plastic gears inside were broken, etc. Makes me wonder if there's any quality control at Fisher-Price at ALL, since many other people seem to have had a lot of fun and success with this thing. We had no such luck! So, my caution to the world is this: be careful buying this thing. I find it hard to believe that we would have gotten THREE bad eggs just by chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but easily broken","review":"My 1 year old loved this but it didn't hold up very well.

He played with it every day for a week straight. Until, one day I found him disassembling the pully system.

I assumed that it must have been improperly assembled to begin with or bounced too much during shipping. I returned it to the store (K-Mart) and they gave us a new toy. Two weeks later, the same thing happened to the next toy. I carefully examined it and found out how even a 6 month old baby could lift up one of the wheels and pull out a black gasket. I have sent written and e-mail notice to Fisher Price with no reponse. I have called many toy stores, urging them to take this toy off of the shelf before someone gets hurt.

At this point I started to really look at the toy. It has no educational value, the same song is played and it simply spins. They enjoy toys that do more than \\"one\\" thing!

She loves to stare at it right now, and once she sits up on her own I know she's going to love it nonstop. The music is really fun too! It is rather loud, but someone suggested putting clear tape over the speaker to dampen it and that really did help tremendously, so I suggest that.

They didn't stack it as the toy designers planned.

I put it away for a couple weeks and tried it again, but he still cries when he accidently turns it on. The blocks are fun colors, but don't hook together well.

I thought at first that this would be a good way to teach her cause and effect; push the button and make the toys swirl around. However, when she grasped this concept and pushed the button, it scared her to death! The music is VERY loud and if the little toys that stack up fall over, they swirl around and just bump into each and other and cause a ruckus. She didn't play with the toy again until she 18mos. and by then she liked to stack up the toys, push the button, and knock them over on purpose! Needless to say this got to be just a little annoying after a while. The toy now sits at the top of my closet, and my daughter never even really noticed it was gone. Out of sight, out of mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped Teach My Daughter To Sit","review":"My favorite feature about this toy is the small bumper around the seating area, because it helped my 6 month old daughter learn to sit by herself. She loves to hold the blocks and chew on the ones with faces. Her new \\"trick\\" is to knock the blocks off so that they get caught up in the spinning disks and make a lot of noise as they bang into one another. She has put her hand on the spinner and stopped it, which could cause a problem later on, but for now I try to keep her a little out of reach from the disks themselves. This toy is easy to assemble, clean, fold & store. I do wish that it played another song, but otherwise it's a great toy & I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure fun!","review":"My son received this toy for Christmas from his grandparents. I had wanted to buy it, but couldn't justify the cost for what I saw as pure fun with little educational value. My son loves the lively music and the racket it makes when all the pieces are knocked over and whirling around. I originally neglected to think of the learning benefit of the spinning and stacking aspects of the toy. He is learning more fine motor skills trying to stack the pieces, especially when the flowers are spinning! He is also learning cause and effect as to when a piece comes off, where the spinning flowers will take it. This toy is not a definite must have, but a lot of fun if you have some discretionary income or some spoiling grandparents, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lifesaver","review":"My daughter has played with this since she was 6 months old. She's now 1. She especially loves the music. It holds her interest longer than any of her other toys which can give me time to do something else! She also enjoys stacking the discs and knocking them over to see them whirl crazily around the circles. She also likes to put other things on to watch them go 'round and 'round. It allows for some creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"babys first christmas a fisher price let down","review":"I bought this for my son after playing with it for a few minutes the discs quit spinning the only thing that did work was the music and lights.

This one is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but not durable","review":"We bought this toy for the son we were expecting...when he was old enough to play with it it only lasted about a month before the discs stopped spinning. Terribly disappointing because he loved the lights & music. I don't believe it was used incorrectly or excesively. The only silver lining was that Fisher Price stood behind its toy and sent us a new one. A very good reason to buy from who you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I bought this toy for my son last Christmas when he was 6 months old. I thought it looked like a lot of fun. He could not really use it until he could sit on his own. He seemed to like it, but it would always stop twirling and just play the music. If I took the batteries out and then put them back in it would work again for a little while. Eventually the rubber band type things that make it twirl came out and now it just plays music and sometimes shows lights. I am just going to throw it away. I would not recomend this toy, it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps This is a Boy Toy","review":"We bought this for my daughter when she was about 6 months. She was interested the first time she hit the button and the music started, but found it too noisy after the second time. I've brought it out several times since then (she's 1 year old now)and she still finds it too noisy. She likes the blocks, but doesn't like it when it starts to move. She does like trying to make it stop by holding the spinning disks, but gets frustrated because she can't pick them up. A friend with a girl also found it too noisy. A friend with a boy and his boy cousin both loved it. I think this could be a great toy for some children, but keep the box just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 'sitting up' encouragement","review":"We bought this as a christmas gift for our son who is not quite sitting up on his own yet. He adored the toy and through wanting to play with it has actually gotten better with sitting (we still sit right next to him to avoid toppling into the blocks).The movement is just right (spinning disks, dancing flowers). The music is the typical 'tinny' sounds of childrens toys, but plays long enough to capture his attention. His absolute favorite is to watch the dancing lights at the front of the garden. He also loves the turtle and bee characters that come with the garden.He has discovered that he can knock over a few blocks and make a tremendous amount of noise as the blocks roll through the spinning disks. He loves this, but if you're a parent who dislikes noisy toys, this one is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun stuff!","review":"This toy looks great - it's colorful and has great flowers and bees and bugs. But if you look at the close-up photo, what's really neat is those four plates spin - right, left, right, left. When the blocks (like Duplo blocks) fall off or get knocked down, they loop around on those plates, traveling all across and back - which is great to watch. They also make a racket as they bounce, which gets everyone's attention. (Yes, this is a pretty noisy toy. There's no way to shut off the music once it starts the cycle - about a minute long - but it's a pretty decent, jazzy bee-bop tune.) My son is 1, and although this is supposedly ages 6 months and up, older might be a bit better because of the noise and dexterity factors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like fun, but music is TOO LOUD","review":"We thought the toy looked like a great thing for our daughter. We still think the concept of the toy is great, but the music is too loud. This toy does not have a volume control and the speaker is right beside the start button. You have to bend over the speaker to reach the stacking area also. When the music starts, our daughter begins shaking and starts to scream. We made sure it was the music by taking all the pieces away and starting the toy again. The same thing happened again. It concerns me that the music on a child's toy is so loud and has no volume control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sora...wow!","review":"Sora is so young looking and yet sexy and innocent that one has to be touched by this movie in several ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsense","review":"If you never seen Japanese movies dont start with this one.

My son is a power crawler and they slip right off. You'd have to make them so tight that it would stop the blood flow in order to keep it in place. It drove me crazy adjusting them all the time. The other thing is the bulkiness. It really bothered my son and as much as he could he'd try to pull them off. I guess not very comfortable from his point of view.

I used them when I first got them and they worked well. My son is 8 months old and we have Mexican tile floors in our house and my dad has brick floors in his house, and his poor little knees get so red. I used them and he didn't seem to mind them, but he doesn't crawl on his knees anymore. He has figured out that he can get where he wants to go faster by crawling on his hands and feet. He does this even without the knee pads on. So they don't come out of the diaper bag much. He has chubby little legs and they aren't too tight. They don't slide down, and I am hoping to use them more when he learns to ride a bike, maybe. For crawling, I just haven't used them much but they are a good product.

As soon as he figured out he could crawl, all he wanted to do was crawl. We have hardwood floors throughout the house and his pants were always making him slip.

At his age he did not want to sit for a single second. If I was able to actually get them on him, as soon as he was on the go they would ALWAYS slip right off.

The main character challenges believability more than a talking gorilla. This 12 year old girl puts James Bond to shame. The purpose seems to be creating excitment rather than communicating thought provocing questions as in \\"Ishmael\\". The two books are so different that I question whether Daniel Quinn actually wrote this book.The one redeeming point is his perspective on our educational system.To summarize: The book was so lacking in content that I would never have finished it had I not read Ishmael first.

It provides a glimpse of what life would be like outside of the box we are in that prompts us to destroy the world.My Ishmael has the potential of changing lives for the better. It is depressing in places, though, so don't read it if you want light humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Quinn continues to open my eyes","review":"I'd devoured Quinn's other books, and I finished My Ishmael as quickly as the others. Daniel Quinn has honestly changed my outlook on the world and on life, and he continues to open my eyes and forces me to actually look at my perceptions. His vision of a future in which humans can live sustainably on the planet is wonderful, not only in its astuteness but also in its ability to inspire hope that we can reach that future. I recommend Ishmael and The Story of B to everyone I meet, and My Ishmael is no excpetion. It changed my life, and if given the opportunity of an open mind, can do so for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of his other brilliant work","review":"I loved Ishmael, and picked this sequel up immediately after. Disappointingly, I didn't find any new concepts here. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a shameless attempt to make money by publishing the same content again, but it's close to that. Read Ishmael. That's a wonderful wonderful book. Then stop there. I wish Quinn had."},{"rating":"2","title":"best. book. ever.","review":"this is one of those books that can change a person's entire worldview. i encourage everyone to read it, whether you are \\"lost and searching\\", or just curious about a lot of things in the world. a must read for anyone with an international mindset."},{"rating":"2","title":"it does what it says on the cover!","review":"I have had many grappling books in my time(Lebell,Gracies,etc) but i must say that this is among one of the best. The book is purely no-gi submission techniques and it can't be faulted for not being a complete book on fighting techniques. It does what it says on the cover. The book covers submissions from all the grappling positions-north/south, guard, mount, knee on stomach, standing etc, etc. at the start of each chapter it covers how to maintain that position. Then the rest of the chapter covers numerous effective moves to submit your opponent. This book is all meat and no fluff. The total number of pages without fighting techniques on them is about 5! If your like me you have been burned by buying crap books that are not what they claim to be. This book is not one of them. It is a good sized book and very reasonably priced. Even more advanced fighters could learn alot from this book. Having trained around the world i wish i would have had this book a while ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down.","review":"I was let down by this book. everyone on this site thought it was great. however i found that it lacked alot of detail needed for a submission, and there was nothing about seting up submissions in this book. this book does have alot of submissions but many of them would be shut down by somone with less then a year in the sport. for the price of this book you can get something better that will give you more insight into the game of submission fighting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for what it presents","review":"This book is specificaly on no-gi submission moves. In that area, it is one of the better books out there, and a \\"must have\\" for anyone involved in submission grappling. The photos are pretty clear, and numbered in sequense so the reader can better understand what he's looking at. The author describes the moves from the possitions they are performed from (i.e., \\"Submissions from the Guard\\"). The moves shown have less variety than LeBell's \\"Grappling Encyclopedia\\", but as such is less overwhelming. Only problem, like LeBell's book, is that the reader isn't shown how to get into these possitions. And I'd prefere to see some reversals. Still, overall, an excellent book, and I'd recomend it to anyone who wants to learn non-gi submission holds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Grip.","review":"Seems to work well. If you have small hands try something else. This grip is chunky. Note that you will have to pretty much take the whole gun apart to install it.

She destroys attractive, and often costly, antiques to make artsy-craftsy pieces which will look dated within ten years. It's hard to believe she purchased the original pieces at bargain prices. I fear readers may destroy even more valuable items now sitting in their attics. If someone owns the necessary power tools, is willing to buy expensive materials and replacement hardware, and has unlimited time to do these projects, they should head to the local unfinished furniture store and use their own ideas and creativity rather than purchase this ill-considered book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Material!","review":"This book is used for my drawing class and is a great source for us to use in our course.

I would recommend it for anyone wanting to learn from the recognized best anatomical artist in the US. , Mr Hale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to accompany a life drawing class","review":"I bought this book quite a while ago and had difficulty getting much from it because I had never had an anatomy class or a life drawing class. Now that I am taking an intensive anatomy/life drawing class I find it excellent and a valuable resource. I have a very good class book called Classic Human Anatomy by Valerie Winslow to show me literal anatomy. This muscle is here and is called this. You need this. But the greatness of Robert Beverly Hale's books are to also show you how these muscles appear in classical drawings. This is a different matter all together. It is the difference between an academic diagram and a great drawing. You need BOTH books and a live drawing class model to get the whole picture (no pun intended!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good introduction but not great","review":"I found this book to be a mixed bag. First of all the book is too quick, it's not as in depth as I hoped it would be. There is too much words and not enough diagrams for my taste. Another issue I take is the type of models (body types) the book uses as examples. They all look like pudgy out of shape Roman era sketches which is rather dated for any contemporary art field. There are ZERO actual photos of people but rather charcoal sketches (some good, others decent and most useless). I would use the analogy that you wouldnt hire a home builder who ONLY studied how to make log cabin homes, so why would you buy a book that ONLY focuses on old world body archetypes that no one wants to see these days?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps but not completely leakproof","review":"These are great and do continue to be absorbent even after many, many washings. We have a 45 lb dog with a bladder leakage problem and these pooch pants help us keep our rugs and furniture dry. Our dog's problem is that after she pees outside, there is continuing leakage in the couple of hours after she has gone. So what these pooch pants catch is the leakage.Previously (before she was on her current medication for this problem), her output was significantly heavier (i.e., a full on pee pee in her pants). The pooch pants couldn't quite handle that amount of volume and we did experience a lot of leaks through the sides of the pants. But for minor leakage, these do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"hair conditioner","review":"awful, doesn't seem to do any good for the hair; my hair does better with conditioner out of the dollar store.

In English, I am fond of a translation by Ahmed Ali (Princeton University Press); there are many other fine translations of the meaning in English available today. If you still want a more detailed interpretation, try a tafsir written by a Muslim. There are many fine ones available, and they have the advantage of not being written through the lens of a different (albeit related) religious tradition.When you've read the Qur'an itself, and perhaps a tafsir, then decide if you really think a book with this title and content is really necessary reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A false impression given by title","review":"When I ordered this book I thought that it would give someone like me, who knows the Bible, objective insights into the Koran. Instead it was a crude and disrespectful guide to proselytizing. I returned the book as being sold under false advertizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"sermon","review":"This book is not a translation of the Koran. It is about the origin of the Koran and the past and current influence on the natives of the near east, with a similar discourse on, and in comparison with, the Christian Bible in comparison. Though biblical pertinent, it is really a long sermon by a Christian minister, with the application an urging to persist in trying to convert these people to Christianity. It is a good sermon, appropriate for a seminary, but neither dispassionate nor apologetic of the Koran."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Christians Only","review":"I am a Muslim from Somalia and so I wanted to see what Christians say about our Holy Book. This book pretends to be an examination of the Koran but the author tries to show that Christianity is better. In many ways the author's discussion of the Koran is fair to make Westerners more sympathetic to our people and in that his heart is in the right place. But ultimately this is a book by an infidel for infidels. It is not for Muslims."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible was enough for me","review":"I left Christianity as soon as I read the Bible. I was raised Catholic and as you know, we were discouraged from reading the Bible. I started reading it 3 years ago and when I finished it I had to admit to myself that's the Bible is very wrong and very unscientific. I felt emabrassed to have my faith based on a book of lies.I am not sure why Mr. Mateen Elass ( usually a christian Arab name) feel that by distorting the quran he would gain converts to christianity?...If salvation is your goal, please read the Bible with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"great hook","review":"I had my windows professionally cleaned then hung the hook and hummingbird feeder.Lovely to watch these spectacular birds close up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mi Shabba","review":"I will make this short and sweet...every cut is hot!

The part of his work that is probably the most accesible, are his private houses. It was great to see all these houses together in one beautiful volume. The photographs are stunning, and it is great to see so much attention paid to the interior of these houses, as Wright was responsible for most interior design too.As a professional or just a fan, when you love Wrights' work and want to visually enjoy it to the fullest, this book is a must have. The only thing better is to buy one of his houses..."},{"rating":"2","title":"In awe at first sight","review":"This book amazed me from the moment I held the box it came in.Truely a mastermind at archetecture from the late 1800's, this man must've amazed his clientel with his fantastic abilities to take his imagination to paper, drawing what to the average mind seems impossible to achieve. Viewing the photos in this book will take your senses on a joy ride. From the beauty of the woodwork, to the mathametical puzzles of his angular structures, you'll feel as though you have been living in a simple world until you share a short part of Mr. Wright's. By far, the very best book I have ever bought, and will recomment to anyone who can appreciate a man that has passed on. His works all over the country will continue to show us what an amazing icon he was.Everyone should page through this book at least once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite Wright","review":"This book will send Wright fans into a tizzy, it's that wonderful. The authors have assembled a collection of the complete Frank Lloyd Wright houses that remain (a sadly dwindling number), and the Weintraub photographs are simply amazing. There are some good essays but the photographs are really the heart of the book.The images are immense (the book feels like 300 lbs on your lap) and stunning. It is after all the experience of the physical visit to see the spatial and visual detail of Wright's houses that is so exciting, and these photographs are a great substitute for a visit. They are very palpable. They have a keen sense in demonstrating the interplay of natural light within the Wright interiors and a good sense for the dynamic qualities of his spaces.For someone familiar with Wright's more obscure houses by looking at little grainy black and white images, these photos are simply a revelation.An essential book for any fan of Wright's architecture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well photographed and well organized","review":"Wonderful pictures of his houses that I fully enjoyed. I also appreciated the chronological presentation of the photos so I could see the growth and development of his style myself, rather than just read about it. The text seems unimportant by comparison. I was somewhat disappointed that there were not more interior photos, but overall, well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty book","review":"This is a lovely coffee table book with mostly spectacular color photos of most of Wrights houses, including many interior shots.

A New Yorker, MFA grad of Iowa's Writers Workshop, a jazz scholar and critic, a student of Frank Conner, and a writer with a keen sense of socio-anthrpology, Piazza has written a sensitive and substantive piece of fiction that reveals a sense of intimacy with all the above. He weaves strips of his own experience into a sad patchwork tale of a man seeking his place in the present and his relationship to the past. As a troubled professor of history, John Delano begins an odessy to find his own place only to discover that history and our perceptions of it are not static, but rather fluid like a blues riff that can set the band on an entire new course. Piazza challenges us to read slowly and contemplate while his descriptions permeate and lift the soul like the muted sound of Gordon Brown's trumpet. Read this book on a rainy afternoon when time has no meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm surprised there aren't more 5-star reviews","review":"I read this book when it first came out in paperback on the strength of a good review. I liked it so much, I set it on the top shelf of my bookcase for a re-read. I decided to do just that a few days ago and am enjoying it tremendously.

Through her practical analysis of the mechanisms of both the piano and the human body, she establishes scientific principles of good coordination and shows the optimal functioning of these two mechanisms as they work together to produce great music. Piano myths are completely debunked, and a demonstration of her methods for teaching pianists the joy of a healthy working relationship between the body and the piano is given. This valuable presentation of piano technique at its best and most useful has the potential to give hope and guidance to frustrated pianists of all ages and levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This whatch turned out to be more wonderful in person than on the computer.

This book is a great starting point for sibs who want to/need to understand how having a \\"special sibling\\" has affected their life.

For a month now, it has been giving the exact same weight for my growing baby. When a peach is put on top of the baby, suddenly his weight jumps by a 1.5 lb (we're talking a regular peach here). I reset the battery and for a while that fixed the problem, but it invariably breaks again. Terribly sorry to have thrown out the box - make sure you thoroughly test yours before you realize you may have to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great features!","review":"My baby was diagnosed Failure to Thrive, which is every parents nightmare! The doctors will look at you the parent as the possible cause. We were worried sick when my son wasn't gaining weight as he should. We later found out he was tongue tied so he had horrible eating problems. We needed to keep a close eye on how much he was gaining, and this is much easier (and cheaper) than paying for weight checks at the doctor's office! I like that the baby portion comes off so you can also weigh your older tots. I wish I had bought this scale with my first child. It's also a great breast feeding aid. Because when breast feeding you never know how much milk the baby is taking, by weighing them before/after feedings and everyday, you can be assured they are getting enough milk from the breast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very reliable method to accurately track weight.","review":"I bought this to track my senior cat's weight, and it has been very reliable. It is a much more accurate way to monitor weight on cats and small dogs than using human scales, as it is accurate to a fraction of an ounce.This scale is also great for weighing packages to be mailed! I hadn't intended to use it for that, but it was a nice bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scale.","review":"I bought this scale for my daughter so she alcould weigh her 5 month old baby.

I use it to weigh my 5.5 month old son for fun and out of curiosity. My friends and neighbors often use it to track their infants' weights as well, which is especially important when weight gain or breastfeeding problems develop. I think this is great for new moms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies and pets!","review":"This scale is very sturdy, and very accurate. If I weigh my son right before I take him to the doctor, it is always within an ounce or two of their scales. This helps me monitor his weight much more closely than if I was only able to check it at the pediatrician. It has a cold, hard tray, so I keep a blanket over it for baby's comfort, and with the \\"zero out\\" function, this does not affect measurements at all.I also have 2 cats and a small dog that I can weigh on the scale, and it works great! the \\"hold\\" feature is especially useful for squirmy pets or children and it helps to get a much more accurate reading by taking an average over a few seconds.Overall this is a great scale and a great comfort for mothers like me who like to watch their baby's (or pets!) weight closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"This scale is very nice. Was looking for an inexpensive but good quality scale to monitor my baby's weight since she is in the 2nd percentile for her height. I weighed her a variety of ways and got the same number each time. The hold button is good for babies since she is squirmy. The zero button is nice if you want to weigh with a diaper on, or a blanket. The scale was actually smaller than I expected, so it fit perfect on her changing table/dresser, with room for the other stuff I already had up there. Comes with a 10 year limited warranty which I thought was a long time, considering it only goes up to 60 lbs, and a little book that has growth chart and baby shoe sizing, along with a place to record stuff like weight, height, and other milestones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for the purpose I need it for","review":"My daughter who is now 3 weeks old was born almost 4 weeks early. She had problems feeding and lost a lot of weight before leaving the hospital. It's usual for a baby to lose weight then gain it back but with her problems I needed to keep track of her weight gain. The scale is not as accurate as the ones at the doctor's office, it's usually about 1-2 ounces off but since I've been using it, it has been constant in recording her weight. It's one of my best baby purchase to date and I use on a daily basis between doctor visits. The zero out feature is the best feature since it allows me to weigh my baby with clothing on and still get an accurate reading.The scale is very well made and is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"We have been immensely happy with this scale since the moment it arrived. Our newborn daughter consistently weighs within 1/2 ounce of the recorded weights at her doctors appointments. To sum it up quickly, this scale is fast, accurate, flexible, and well constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scale for the price","review":"This is a great scale for the price.

I didn't want to have to keep bringing her to the dr and pay all of those co-pays just to have her weighed. I went online and searched for baby scales and I really liked this one. But it costs so much more on other sites. Some sites have this priced for over $100. So when I came across it on this website for a lot less I bought it right away. It's even better than I was hoping. It's so easy to use, the cradle will hold the babies weight, it's very sturdy, and it's really cute too. I'm so glad I got this. I recomend this to anyone who is thinking of getting it. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Scale","review":"This product works very well.

It reads in 1/2 oz increments. The weights seem to correspond to the doctor's scale. It has been a real help to us as our baby is dealing with slow weight gain. The scale is even precise enough to measure the amount of breastmilk she takes in (weigh her before and after feedings) -- great knowledge for a mom with low supply issues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"POWDER.

I still can't believe this was performed in 1961. I don't listen a great deal to 1950s/early 1960s jazz because it seems to me that while there was musical genius at work during that era in terms of creation of many of the great jazz songs and instrumentation, there is generally somewhat of a rough and primitive quality to the music compared to what it has evolved into in more recent decades.But this music comes across to me as something that might have been created in the 70s or 80s. Gil Evans was way ahead of his time.To enjoy this music you do need to have some affinity for big band jazz. However, Gil Evans' approach toward big band is very colorful, has lots of dynamic range, and tremendous solo performances, so don't be concerned that it is going to be just a bunch of loud choruses from the brass section."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"for the money this is great quality. the only problem i had was installing it. it says it fits my truck, dodge ram 1500 94 5.2L but i had to put it in diagonal which required me to mangle the pipes around a little but no big deal still sounds awesome! i would definitely recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed within 8 months","review":"I bought this in December 07, its now July and the battery wont take a charge and wont power the camera.

It is a depressing, soul-stifling, pleasure pounding negative piece of over analytic journalism aimed at purloining any happiness a vacationer might take at the feet of the mouse.Wannabe academics describing Disney characters as \\"patently grotesque,\\" and a so-so photographer obsessed with other people's camera's does not make for an interesting read. But the real problem lies in the authors' over analyzing just about every aspect of pleasure a vacationer can experience (including the simple act of people-watching). They've even gone so far as to name a chapter \\"The Problem with Pleasure.\\"If you aren't interested in the problems of pleasure, avoid this tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased piece of trash","review":"It is obvious that the authors are biased against the Disney corporation and wish to force their perspective on everyone else. The money I spent to purchase this book could have been better used elsewhere. I wish i could shred the book and send the pieces back to each author.

The research appears to be nothing more than anecdotal and Jane Kuenz is obsessed with anything that she views as supporting heterosexuality. The authors take the things that we love about Disney and try to convince you that thoses things are bad. The \\"conclusions\\" are not supported by legitimate research and the agenda quickly becomes an annoyance Do yourself a favor and skip this book.

This book is called \\"entertaining\\" and \\"playful\\" however, I didn't see it that way. I was really annoyed while reading this trash! The authors negative personal opinion is evident through-out the entire book, and it seems the pictures were taken by a child. I wonder why all the stories by past/present cast members are so negative. I had a great experience while interning at WDW. Sure we were cheap summer labor, but what college internship isn't?? I wish I could speak to the authors, and get an explanation as to why they feel WDW is such a terrible place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely lacking in substance","review":"Like many academics, the writers of this book like to say really obvious things, but using really big words.

There are a handful valid points made about Disney and their impact on modern culture"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jargon-laden","review":"The researchers mar their efforts in two ways. First of all, they started with an obvious anti-Disney bias and throughout the book, the reader is forced to endure their efforts to validate their prejudices.Secondly, as another reviewer has noted, the language is more than slightly problemmatical. Of course, there is nothing wrong with academic writing, but these people never eschewed the chance to use 100 words when 15 would have sufficed. The style is clearly meant to impress; it only clouds the issue. Writing clearly is an art; these reseachers don't have a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Missed the Point","review":"The authors started their project with the agenda of being critical of Disney. They refused to participate in the experience of \\"The Mouse\\" before rejecting it. One author was absolutely horrified when she found herself shopping in the park, and immediately returned to her distanced observer position. The authors treat Disney and those who enjoy it, snobbishly. Yet they frequently fall prey to their own criticisms (the most amusing parts of the book). This book was not \\"entertaining,\\" nor was it \\"playful\\". It seeks to ask why Disney is \\"the quintessential embodiment of American Leisure\\" yet it spends more time discussing the parks hiring practices than it does asking or answering this question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academics with a grudge go looking for anecdotes","review":"If you prefer the Marxist view of the world and think Disney is the symbol of capitalistic evil, this book is for you!On the other hand, if you're looking for solid research and thoughtful reflection, find another book. The authors gather together anecdotal evidence in a biased fashion and then draw grand conclusions. The approach is roughly: Think Disney exploits its workers? Look for a few disgruntled workers to back up your claim. Find one who doesn't complain? Call 'em naive and move on...When they started reciting known urban legends as truths, I knew the book was a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Pompous, boring, convoluted, biased are the words that come to mind about this book.

All I can say is, if these people hate Disney so much, why have they gone there umpteen-hundred times?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neurotic Academics Visit Disney","review":"This book is neither a \\"light read\\" or an informative travelogue. It is full of the type of jargon you would expect from academics presenting a paper at a conference (no offense meant, as I am married to an academic and am a journalist myself). The authors, although well meaning, get too involved in obscure references and their own personal baggage.

This 'bean bag' should mean you can simply point your camera where you want.But it just doesn't work.The casing, while durable, is far too stiif, so it springs back when you move your camera. All the advantage of the 'beans' is lost because of this.The range of angles, even if you can get it to stay in one place, is very limited.For an SLR, even with a small zoom lens, it just tips forwards. There's a version with the mount nearer the edge that might be better in this respect.Plus, it's so fiddly to get your camera onto the screw because it's big and squashy and you can't get your fingers near the screw mount.And it's so big, you'll never carry it around. A mini tripod is much more convenient.All in all, a total failure. The Gorrillapod wipes it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for DSLRs","review":"Having waited so long for the arrival of this item from Amazon, I was truly disappointed to discover that the item simply doesn't perform as promised.

I shoot weddings and parties and this beanbag is perfect for mounting my slave flash when I do a group shot. I also use a small gorilla pod for the same purpose.

If Amazon allowed no stars, that's how it would have been rated. This book was a waste of my time. The writer needs an editor, a believable plot, and characters whose lives the reader might believe matter. There are so many ridiculous situations (as mentioned in other reviews) but the one that really annoyed me was the Women's Festival where there is no crime, hostility,or other negative aspects simply because it was women only. PLEASE, get a reality check! Another thing, what's with the point made several times about the mother and daughter kissing on the lips?

There are so many facts that are in the beginning of the book and I continued to wait for the good stuff to start. The story line is not very good. Maybe the book eventually gets going, but I'm not going to waste any more time reading it to find out. I've moved on to another book. The writing, while good, just doesn't seem to get to the point, which is why I give it only 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book I have ever read","review":"I unfortunately bought this book to read with my book group...and it is, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read in my 41 years of life. Horrid style. Ridiculous vocabulary. \\"Characters\\" who are cookie-cutter clichés. A plot line that goes nowhere. I literally shook my head in despair as I struggled to make it through. At times, my significant other told me to put the book down and walk away from the book (I kept reading the painfully awkward phrases outloud to demonstrate that no human being could be sober/sane/literate and possibly think it made sense).I think I've written enough. Wow. Just awful. Zero stars possible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept great, writing redondent","review":"I thought the concept was great--a woman who has denied her dreams and desires her whole life and finally going after them, reconnecting with her estanged daughter, and finding herself. But somewhere along the way I stopped enjoying this book. I don't know if it was because the book just went on and on about sex toys or all of the crying for joy. Every single paragraph was just overflowing with too much flowerly language for my taste. Example:\\"In the back of her mind, in a place that never really grows totally weary, a place that is filled with flying daggers to protect the weak, rows of flesh flowers, and arms as wide as the word--a place cultivated...etc (pg 128-129).\\"The paragraph by itself is written well but when paragraph after paragraph describes the same things over and over again it gets redondent and as a reader I quickly lost interest in the character's list of dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"While I could relate to some of the topics she mentioned, I felt that so much of the language was over the top and it was overly dramatic on so many levels.

The writing is SO convoluted. Not only is it difficult to follow, but the story dumps so much information at the very beginning that it's difficult for me to care about these characters. Nay, impossible. I will not be finishing this book. One sentence rolls on for half a page. Where is Ms. Radish's editor? Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Gee, I seemed to have been reading a different book from the ones who \\"hated\\" it. Maybe because I'm 65 it really resonated with me. I laughed out loud at some of it, cried at some of it, and wondered why I didn't have a list of dreams or the nerve to write one. I listened to it on CD, so can't say if I would have liked it less reading it. I just went along for the ride. As for whether or not Louisiana has parishes instead of counties, who cares? I actually felt inspired to visit New Orleans and I really don't care about the geographic location of Lake Ponchatrain. If you're an older woman who was a card-carrying feminist back in the day, ever spent time at festivals, or spent years wondering if there shouldn't be something more to your sex life or lack of one, this book might be a good fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even 'Meh'","review":"I am that great rarity: a man who has read this book. Well, most of this book. I have kept going in the thus far futile hope that something will happen. Anything. Anything at all. Any sign of depth beyond \\"Women good. Men bad in bed. Sex key to everything!\\" A character who isn't straight out of central casting. (\\"Send us a twenty-something, Birkenstock-wearing, sexually-liberated hippie. NOW!\\") A conversation that ISN'T \\"one they will remember for the rest of their lives\\". A paragraph where somebody says something or does something.It honestly feels like the author had enough material and original thought for about 30-40 pages, but needed a novel. So she stretched.

Its a book that will be read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrorism and its history","review":"This book is a terrific intro to terrorism and its history, but more than that it really depends on what you hope to achieve by reading this book. If this book has been assigned by a professor, you are on your way to a fundamental understanding of terrorism and its consequences, root causes, etc. If you are reading this book for leisure, with no lecture/seminar accompanying it, then it is a good read but not as worthwhile.

I enjoy strong female characters and male characters that are not intimidated by them, so this book fits my bill. It had a blend of street savy and corporate uptightness that blends well with each character. Following Marlene up and down the streets, trying to imagaine what's around the next turn and how she'll handle it keeps it exciting. Seeing the district attorney's office from the inside, from Butch's point of view, is a whole other aspect and totally opposite of Marlene's working world. The book is multifaceted. It varies from trying to protect the underdog, dodge bullets and bad guys all the while, make a living and raising a family. It has suspense, triumph, emotion and success, Marlene making things safer her way, Butch dong it his way. Very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldnotgetintoit","review":"This is one of the least enjoyable of the legal thriller genre that I have read.

It's comprehensive in what it addresses yet simple in how it addresses it. It lays an excellent groundwork to understand Crowley's Book of Thoth, which references references that reference....This book was my way out of the referencing labyrinth."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST !","review":"If you have ever tried understanding the Book OF Thoth and like me became frustrated, this book is for you. This book explains in plain language the meaning behind the sometimes veiled unintelligible writings of Aleister Crowley. Unless you are well versed in the language of the Kabbalah, Geometra. Egyptian magick to the extream this book is a God send. You won't be disappointed. Some Knowledge of Crowleyanity I would say is necessary for full enjoyment. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book NOW!","review":"If you have any interest at all in the Thoth Tarot, this is the book to buy. Duquette actually makes Crowley understandable to those of us who like the deck but don't want to invest huge amounts of time in learning his magickal system to understand the deck. Other books have offered workable systems to use with this deck but this is the only book to offer Crowley's own interpretation. You may find DuQuette's Chicken Qaballah a useful adjunct to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This Tarot book is a real book of reference. It includes deep information about the hermetic rosicrucian cross and helpful hints about the Qaballa; information which I missed in many so called standart tarot books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for all Thoth deck owners","review":"This book is essential to understand Crowley's deck. It is the best on the market today. When I first purchased the Thoth deck, I was overwhelmed by all of the rich symbolism and meaning. The \\"little white book\\" wasn't helpful in understanding Thoth, nor were a few other books I purchased. Lon Milo Duquette's book gives a wonderful overview of each card and much, much more in this book. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read worse","review":"There is a lot to like about this book: Background on Crowley and Harris, explanations of much of the arcane symbolism, etc. Some readers might be turned off by DuQuette's liberal use of Thelemic scripture to illustrate or explain points (including thelemites). Be forewarned - DuQuette is a True Believer - and a devoted apologist for Crowley and Thelema.He is knowledgeable about much of the cards' meaning, and illuminated things which for me had long been obscure. Unfortunatley, he sometimes falls back on such nonsense as \\"Fire is hot and dry, Water is cool and moist,\\" etc. I mean, what the hell does that actually mean? Nothing - at least no deeper explanation is given. Still, despite such occasional obscure vagueness, for those interested in Tarot, this book is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable!","review":"If you spend any time at all with the Thoth deck--or if you'd like to--this book needs to be on your list of must-reads.With this book in one hand and Crowely's Book of Thoth in the other, you can navigate the sometimes rough waters and enjoy yourself while you're doing it. Both DuQuette and Crowley have fabulous senses of humor. Let Lon guide your steps and you can have fun while learning to mine this fantastic deck for some real gems.True, DuQuette's book is challenging at times due to its subject matter, but the journey is very worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"> I just want to say, you must be one very good teacher!

Too, the card descriptions are very informative and educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful","review":"I love the way this man writes! The book is more about understanding the meanings of Aleister Crowley in \\"The Book of Thoth\\" than it is about divination.

The book has become a classic. Duquette has become one of the reigning Crowley scholars on the planet and his sense of humor is par none.

As one who is very much interested in Gettysburg, and the Overland Campaign of 1864, I am glad I found this jewel of a book. The author writes the story very well, and the research that he has done is exceptional in this tale of the boys from the Tarheel state.This regiment is not as well known as the the 26th NC, but their trevails at Gettysburg was just as horrible. It also illustrates how they were used in the Overland Campaign...and the perils and suffering that they went through in 1864.I heartily recommend the book, and can confidently say if you read it, it will be tough to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough Accounting of the Bethel Regiment in the Civil War","review":"A must-have book for anyone with ancestors who fought in this unit, the reporting is both academically complete and personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"black metal? what are you smoking?","review":"I don't know why people are comparing these guys to black metal.

I was taken with the fact that the movie had a comforting feeling to it despite the subject matter. I think it works well, the cast is fantastic and the end result is a great movie. It is very funny. All it takes is a look at the bonus materials to find out that Ted Danson actually was TRYING to use \\"fey mannerisms\\" with his character. Once again, ignore the \\"professional\\" critic and watch the movie yourself. There is a LOT of sexually oriented language (it is about the making of a porn film, after all) but little nudity, a fact that Sam seems to belabor to the point that you have to think he was looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It won't change your life, but it may make it easier to bear.","review":"\\"The Amateurs\\" won't change your life, but it may make it a little easier to bear.Yes, it's heartwarming.

Despite all those drawbacks, this movie is funny. Great casting, great writing, great acting (as much as is demanded by the material).The Jeff Bridges overstory and narration is the glue that brings all the individual characters and their lines into one whole; his gentle persona creates the film, not only in the story sense but in reality.

The characters are prefabricated and flat, with no appeal; the actual clues to the killer are nonexistent; and the book ends with a fizzle that somehow manages to be almost as tedious and unbelievable as it is out of nowhere... like maybe a quota of words had been met to fulfill a publisher's contract so an end was tacked on.

I was only hooked because I needed to end this book. The book had a wonderful premise and some really good characters, but it seemed even the author didn't know exactly why someone would murder the members of this band, so he picked some obscure reason. The ending was rushed and out of the blue. And the reason the murderer gives as to why he killed people was really lame. No one, no matter who whacked they were, would use this as an excuse or better yet no real good detective or policeman would except the reason as truth.If you think he might like the book, you are probably right if someone else wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"only dead egotistical morons will finish this book","review":"This book goes downhill from the title.

I think I most enjoyed the accounts of Pakistani and Indian wrestlers like Gama. These seem to be forgotten martial artists. There was also some interesting information about the martial arts of Indochina.I give it one less star than perfect, as these same authors have been known to at least tell some tall tales under a psuedonym (\\"John F. Gilbey\\" is one of the two). Since I am no scholar of the martial arts, but rather a sort of consumer of them, I can't really tell if they're pulling our legs anywhere in this book. Some of the Okinawan stuff (which I am actually familiar with the history and practise of) was a bit sketchy, or at least poorly explained.

There are dance tunes, ballads, and stories performed in a style reminiscent of the really good stuff from old Motown. The artists took a chance by utilizing real music and real musicians, not programmable synthesized noise mistakenly called music.

The author, a professor who is a published expert in this field, describes the likely origin of the Minoans, their evolution, their religion, their lifestyle, their likely interactions with other societies, their writing, etc. The book contains a great many descriptions of various archaeological finds, e.g., pottery, tools, tombs, palaces, structures, buildings, art, etc.Since I did not find any publication date nor dated references in this book, it is not clear how much of the information/theories presented have been superseded by more recent scholarship. The only year that appears in the text that could be used to partially bracket its publication date is 1952; thus the book was published sometime after that year.Nevertheless, the prose is clear and authoritative. The book would most likely appeal to those who, like me, have a fascination for ancient Cretan history."},{"rating":"2","title":"**A MUST READ ~ INSPIRATIONAL***","review":"After reading the first Volume of God Allows U-Turns I was hooked.

It is mostly plastic, but it feels very solid--not flimsy. I agree the blade is a little hard to clean, but I usually just rinse it with the sink sprayer or insert a brush from the bottom. (The blade is sharp--I don't recommend trying to wash it using your hands.) We usually buy bagels at the bakery or donut shop and all of the ones we usually get fit in alright. (An oversized bagel might be a problem, but most normal bagels fit.) We also use it for slicing English muffins: you can hold the English muffin from the sides until the tip of the blade catches and then just slice down through.

Occasionally, strings or other wind instruments were introduced, but they ended up equalizing and soothing the raw and unpolished piano sound.

He was the first one on the scene and his work has been revised by succesive generations of analysts (Winnicott, Klein, Bion etc). Perhaps the author might next try and do what Freud did; produce a model of the mind that explained psychopathology, many aspects of existential phenomena and creat a language of the mind that entered the every day lexicon.

And although adding and removing plates might not be as fast as with other sets, the quick-lock set is extremely safe to use.52.5 pounds per dumbbell would be just about enough for some of us to do chest warm-ups.

The adjustable system in 2.5lb increments is easy and straight forward and takes less than a minute which is the time between sets anyway. They are a little pricey but you really get what you pay for and the price is well worth it when you think about this system replacing 10-75lbs of dumbbells in 2.5lb increments which would cost you well above $2,000 to say the least not to mention the large amount of space.I am 100% satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Shopper","review":"I consider myself a very careful shopper.

The look and feel of the equipment is second to none as far as consumer adjustable dumbbells and FID benches go.I no longer dread my fitness routine. No more getting ready to go to the gym, just pull the bench out and go to town. With the combination I purchased, I'm able to perform a full body workout all week and feel like I went to the gym.

I mean how do you send 220lbs of tiny plates back through the mail? How much would that cost me? All the weights slip and do not lock properly or easily, eventually. There is no way to figure out if its the plate thats bad or the screw handle. They are time consuming to adjust and I wouldn't dare sell them to someone because I would feel guilty if they get hurt. I rarely drop them and if I do the floor is heavy rubber. Still they loosen up and are scary. Having stacks of little plates all around is just annoying too.Like I said, I've used these for maybe 7 years. I wouldn't buy them a again. There manufacturing is just not of the highest quality. I wish I would have just spent the money on something else.Don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swiveling Back Scrubber","review":"I rarely write bad reviews as I generally like the things I buy. This Back Scrubber was a huge mistake. The swiveling head (which I thought would be a good thing) was just aggravating. It would not lie flat while I was trying to wash my back. Instead,it kept turning. The curved handle also made it difficult to get the sponge head to lay flat on my back. It wasn't just me, either. My husband had the same problems with it. Finally, after less than a week of use the head just broke off. Mayby it would work for someone else, but for us it just didn't. I replaced it with a regular long handled back brush and am much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"chucky cheese teeth","review":"Who does this chucky cheese tooth boy think he is? The album is nothing but cookie-cutting pretty boy stuff you might here on Sesame Street. Not to insult that program of course, but this album is for kids.

Easy to use, easy clean-up. Non-stick for sure! I used them instead of a big bundt pan to make individual cakes. Perfect for the holidays! If your cake normally takes about an hour, plan to bake in these small pans for 15 or so mins. I was able to get ~36 individual cakes from one recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This pan makes great pumpkins for a fall cake. Make sure you spray it well with bakers joy or any other non stick product. Wash it by hand. It made beautiful little pumpkins for my son's first birthday party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrades over time-used about twice a year","review":"I am so sorry to say that I fell in love with this pan. I am a veteran baker, and have baked in regular bundt pans for decades with xlnt results. Trust that I know my way around a bundt! For some reason this pan worked early on. After that, everything would stick; from simple mini cinnamon bundt cakes to angel food. I always washed it by hand (which took forever after soaking) and there were no scratches. Whether I would grease it or grease & flour it or pam it to death, things would stick to the tiny ridges and the whole cake was impossible to exricate. It was a nightmare & I am extremely patient. I \\"stuck\\" with it for about 5 years. I am writing now bec I lost it with this last batch that left as much stuck to the pan as out. I didn't even bother cleaning it this time; it's in the trash. So sad too, it is just so adorable. Sorry to say something bad about Nordic Ware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great!","review":"I needed this for a new recipe, to make \\"pumpkins\\" for Halloween.

I had originally purchased one from Target that was cheaper and the cake would stick to the pan and the coating started to come off after the first use. So I decided to spend more money to purchase this one and it is Wonderful!! The cake did not stick and every came out perfect. I used it this weekend for my son's birthday party and put Star Wars figures in the middle instead of making cupcakes. The kids and parents all loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!","review":"I absolutely loved this bakeware. It's heavy and cooks evenly.

Really heavy, durable, and excellent quality. I've bought 4 of them and they each hold up to anything. Great product. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much promise . . . ah, well.","review":"When I first came across this book, I was very excited, because I am interested in all aspects of how the various entertainment media manipulate the world and present only a selected vision of what it's really like. I looked forward to reading a detailed account of life in Hollywood and how hard it was to deal with oppression and prejudice and have to live a secret life. Instead of an inspiring, enlightening read, I got a scatter-brained, typo-laden gossip column. I can't believe, as was stated in another review, that the typos were the fault of the printer. The amount of effort put into researching and writing this book is reflected in the quality of the copy editing.It could have been worth my money. Oh well. I'm glad I bought it from the Quality Paperback Book Club and not at retail price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, rife with typos.","review":"I was actually amazed that this book got published! Aside from the massive number of typographical errors, it was meandering, constantly bringing up new names of stars with absolutely no context, dropping them, then mentioning them again 100 pages later. A poor book that manages to make an interesting subject boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sewing Circle: Hollywood's Greatest Gibberish","review":"In \\"The Sewing Circle: Female Stars Who Loved Other Women,\\" Axel Madsen offers little proof that any of the actresses he \\"outs\\" were actually gay. His scholarship is sloppy; he relies heavily on hearsay and ancient gossip, and his primary source is Mercedes De Acosta's \\"Here Lies The Heart,\\" which reads like a Harlequin romance. As a literary work, \\"The Sewing Circle\\" doesn't fare much better; it falls neatly into the ranks of every tell-all book ever written. Whether or not the great Garbo, Dietrich, Crawford, or Stanwyck were lesbian is moot in any case: they are dead and cannot defend themselves against this insipid volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfortunate Telling","review":"The subject is one of great interest, but the book is so poorly written it's annoying. The author cannot keep to the theme - often within a paragraph. The book is little more (if more!) than an \\"outing\\" of a lot of dead people who are no longer around to defend themselves. What might (and should) be a fascinating story will (hopefully!) one day be told by someone with more ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books Ever Published!!","review":"This is one of the most ridiculous and certainly dishonest books you will ever come across. The author offers no real solid proof to any of his claims that most of these women were lesbians, just a \\"rumor\\" seems to satisfy him as evidence. A truthful book on this subject is much needed, but this ain't it!! One that is heavily researched, I might add, and tries to confirm the information (amazingly, the author does not suggest any rumors on any particular stars are false!) I suspect about half of the women mentioned here were (this includes those who were really bisexual although the writer suggests that virtually all of them are hardcore dykes) and half of them weren't which is very bad odds for a nonfiction book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"This is one of those gossipy hollywood books claiming everyone is a homosexual. This book doesn't stay on topic long enough to tell a story!! Every other word is \\"Mercedes De Acosta\\"-- I think that the author of the book should have wrote a bio on her life, rather then a bio claiming to be about a bunch of people, when in reality the main part of the book is about Mercedes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"Please, please, please, please, people...ignore the naysayers! This album is amazing, start to finish. Hands down, the BEST album, by ANY group, of the 90's. Beautiful, ugly, emotional, demented, heavy, soft...all at the same time. Nathan Larson and Craig Wedren are the most interesting songwriting team of the last 15 years. This album was slagged unbelievably when it came out, and it's slagged to this day, but a small cult following knows better...now it's your turn. If you only buy one album for the rest of your life, this is it. Craig, Nathan, Stuart, and Adam...thank you so much for this record. It changed my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album...","review":"I bought this album a month or two ago, not really sure what to expect beyond previewing the songs on Amazon. I really dig the vocals, and it's just a great '90s album. I don't know a lot about them as a band, but I hope they have some other albums on par with this one. X-French Tee Shirt is a fantastic song, and the rest is great, as well. Don't pass up the chance to hear this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"When I first heard this, Captian Beefheart immediately came to mind. This is a group that is as comfortable playing parts that work against one another as they are at conventional musicianship.Of course, this is a modern record-produced by Ted Nicely and mixed by Andy Wallace, who worked on Fugzi's best records-so the production is clean and not as intracite as a Beefheart album. But the writting and lyrics are very good throughout, and this is an uncompromising, uncommercial album. If you have listened to Shudder To Think's other work, this is by far their most experimental.And their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I say without doubt, this is one of the greatest albums ever","review":"Exceptionally odd, and seriously wacky, Shudder to thinks album 'poney express record' is one of the weirdest albums I have ever heard, and its awesome! Every listen holds another memeroble hook, every track has another feel. There really is no boundries to put this album in. If you like this, I suggest you also listen to the guitarist from Shudder to Think's side project's band 'Mind Science of the Mind'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it more than one listen","review":"It's very hard to describe this album, the best I ever got was emo punk successfully fused with prog rock, and to jaw-dropping results.The vocal acrobatics are amazing, very much the low-to-high-to-low of emo's use of falsetto, reminescent of Jeremy Enigk and Thom Yorke. The guitars and drums do so many time changes and groove changes you wonder how they ever pulled it off live. And yet, even with all that, it's catchy, extremely catchy. You'll find yourself singing along (or trying to). Lyrically I think it's brilliant, almost all of the lyrics are written in a vibrant, image-filled stream of consciousness that are snugly fit to the music. That's not to say the lyrics don't make sense, a scary feeling hits you when realise they actually do.They went for the catchiest, most artsy music they could create, and I would argue they succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelled to Chime In","review":"I can only agree with the other enthusiastic reviewers and call this recording an absolute high-point in modern popular music. A fortunate, forward-looking piece of art that is sure to be very rewarding for those who need something a little off-kilter. It has that kind of urgency and energy to it where you feel like the people involved truly needed to make this music, yet it somehow doesn't \\"attack\\" you. It's also worth pointing out that the Shudder to Think track from the Victoria Williams \\"Sweet Relief\\" record is in a similar vein to this material, and worth the price of that album by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Avant, meet Mr. Garde","review":"This is a difficult record, but holds many rewards. The first cut, Hit Liquor, will definitely either beckon you in or make you scream for the door.

On the High fan setting my iPhone says it's 105dB! I don't know how they can even sell something that loud. That said, we have had heat indexes of 115 all this week, and although I'm grateful to have something, it doesn't keep up with the heat very well. Last year, it decided that the filters needed to be cleaned, (which I had already done), so it stopped working. It'd be nice to have it warn you instead of just stopping. What made matters worse, it gives you a cryptic E1 code, but the manual does not tell you what this means or how to fix it. It took half a day to learn how to reset it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diluted!","review":"I have been wearing Alien for more than a year now. I absolutely love this fragrance on me, and it is so potent that i only need to spray once in the morning and it last all day. When I close to running out of my last bottle, I decided to purchase a new bottle off Amazon. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING! From the first time I applied from this new bottle I knew something was wrong. The key notes were faint, there was a heavy alcoholic air to it, and it didn't last. I knew right away it had been diluted with alcohol. I have reported this to Amazon, as they were the seller, and fortunately they were, because I was offered a replacement or a refund. I'm not sure the process would have been as smooth with other suppliers. Please note, fluids are considered hazardous materials and are not returnable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful jasmine, plenty of amber","review":"Alien is such an interesting and unique perfume - I'm glad to add it to my collection but probably won't wear it often. It is indeed odd and almost pistachio/herbal at first, but that's very brief, and then comes lots of nice jasmine and a faint grape, like frozen Concord grapes. THere is always that looming sweet amber base which after an hour was just too strong for me, and most likely would be very noticeable to those around you. Maybe it will be a good perfume to wear for my own pleasure and to up my tolerance for amber. Definitely strong, long lasting and best used in moderation. Cool bottle too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Alien was a great change for the summer because I'm a devoted Angel wearer.

Plants provide a balance in nature that would otherwise not be possible. Without plants, there would be no agriculture and our economic systems would cease to function. So human civilization owes its existence to plants. Animals rely on plants also for their growth and nourishment.

This is a dud. I just couldn't finish it.It's just too fantastic.More of a bad romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting fiction","review":"The title could be 'Swept Away' as the writer sweeps you into a another place and time. His use of real people in history is fasinating, and by inserting his fictional 'hero' Nathan Heller, a cynical former Chicago cop, into these people's live's a sign of real writing ability. Nathan gets involved ( in more ways then one) with Amelia Earhart. He's hired by Amelia's husband to watch over her and to try to figure out who is sending her threatening notes. Sounds simple enough, but as the tale unfolds, and things begin to unravel for Nate, nothing is as simple as it first appears. The writing is crisp and biting, the historical character's alive and human. Highly recomended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max Collins/Nathan Heller/Flying Blind","review":"Collins is a creative author able to masterfully craft the historical novel. His detective hero, Nathan Heller,is very believable, and the story is well plotted.Who hasn't wondered about the fate of Amelia Earhart? The story develops a very likley scenario set in an accurate historical background complete with well known names and places. The interaction of the characters is well thought out, realistic, and evolves into a most entertaining and informative novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"mind-blowing, dogma-shattering","review":"A very fine collection...with plenty of glimpses at Jung's trans-analytic speculations and personal reactions.

It's so cheap, almost like the real audio here on amazon. And every song has a 1-2 seconds fade in. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly sappy doo-wop...","review":"I was looking for Twitty's early rockabilly sides, because I heard he had a rockabilly past before coming a \\"big haired\\" country ballad singer, who taled his way thru songs. Well these sides aren't horrible, but only several of the tracls qualify as rockabilly, but most of it is throwaway doo-wop stuff which is really dated sounding. The highlight is a swingin' rockabilly version of \\"Mona Lisa\\", and several others that sound like they could have made him a rockabilly star. I regret purchasing this cd, and do not recomend it. By the way Twitty is unrecognizable on this cd, if you are used to his hits, he's actually a decent singer here, it's just too much sappy dated doo-wop and not enough rockabilly, if this were all rockabilly I'd give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very happy","review":"I was not happy at all.

Countless amateur anime fans worldwide time and subtitle anime for free as a hobby, yet S'more Entertainment couldn't be bothered with the minimal investment necessary to add subtitles to its commercial DVD, even when they already had English translated scripts (provided as PDF files on disc 4). The minimal effort just smacks of laziness and disregard for the primary consumer audience this release is targeted at.The show itself is enjoyable and deserves more than a one-star rating. The English dub may be passable; I don't know as I only watch movies in original langague.

I just wanted to lose a few inches and all the reviews I read said this works fast. I have done the exercises from the book as well as I can, but nothing happened. I must not be doing it right. No results at all. It is hard to follow the book because you have to remember every step. I would get into position and then get out of it to read the next thing. I spent a lot of time reading over the exercises to hopefully remember everything next time I did them. Also, I can't get through the whole thing in 15 minutes.

For me, it is way too cumbersome and confusing to have to try reading the instructions and executing the moves at the same time. In addition, since I bought the Kindle version, I didn't get the DVD that's incuded with the print version, so I feel like I'm missing a valuable resource that would have given me some more insight into the moves.
