It's a great book that stresses the important truth that people are emotional and not always logical. It shows that disagreements really can be resolved for the better by looking at things from another's perspective. Further, I loved how the author takes you right into the world of '20 and 30s and the unique characteristics of the time period like referring to experiences, in the first person, right after the 'Great War' and getting a friendly greeting from President Teddy Roosevelt. These intriguing tid-bits do not push away the relevance of the material but amazingly re-enforce it with the notion that you will begin to reveal to yourself how similarly people act, think, emotionally connect in that time period and ours. Then, you will begin to see why these teachings work naturally with our everyday social experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!","review":"I LOVED this book.

Have you barked orders at an employee or a loved-one and found they wouldn't comply?

The book was born out of a need : to have a textbook on people - how to deal with them on a social level and how to make friends. That was in 1936.

The basic needs to be apprecaited, to feel important, to be listened to and be loved have remained constants throughout human history. It is the ability to tap into these timeless principles that makes this book equally timeless.

His boss was a strong believer in the theories presented in this book and found it useful to read and re-read this book. In fact, I am probably the target market for this book as a person who needs to develop his social interaction skills and leadership style.While I find the study of influence and leadership fascinating, I am not interested in this book. I found this book to be extremely annoying. The book is essentially a string of anecdotes that the author uses to illustrate his points - techniques for managing people, getting people to like you, influencing people, and being a leader. There really aren't any facts behind the material. You either take to it or you don't.In this field of study, I personally enjoyed Cialdini's Influence: Science and Practice much more. It offers a better balance between the academic/scientific evidence and anecdotes which illustrates the principle."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be a good salesman","review":"I did not like this book. I acknowledge it is a smart book, full of practical advice to go up the ladder and get what you want. And, most of all, people still find it useful for their careers. But the title is misleading: it doesn't teach how to make friends (no book could be useful at that), but how to make good business deals. The anecdotes are fine, but the overall feeling I was left with is that the book tries to teach how to manipulate people without the others ever noticing. The message is cynical and extremely cheap: \\"Cheat and deceive, and you'll get a better position in an American corporation\\". There are better, deeper and funnier books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sender has not won friends and influenced people","review":"I ordered the above book the first of September,\\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" and as of this date have not received book.

I believed in everything it said and applied it in my daily life. The principles appeared to work for a short time, however in the long run they DO NOT WORK, and lead to years of misery and suffering! This book has ruined my life for the past 15 years, I wish I never read it, and I wish I could unlearn it.I was not critical of books when I was 14, and I believed the principles in this book would work.

It's not meant to be, but the ideas it tries to put across are machiavelian, childish and short sighted. The underlying theme is that one should do favours for others in order to receive the same from them: hardly a theme to build friendships on.If you are currently paying people cash to be your \\"friend\\", you might find significant financial savings from the ideas in this book: you could be paying them in plenty of other ways.It makes a great gag gift: you will find yourself passing this around to read out loud at parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still have not received the book!","review":"I am totally frustrated and have not received the book yet!

THere are numerous examples which make the reader strive to implement Carnegie's advice into your life, but he is not repetitive.

However, I was wrong. This book is like reading 1000 articles from a medical journal. It is definitely not for casual crime readers such as myself. The vignettes are a paragraph long at best then dissolve into various author opinions on what is wrong with the state of our social service departments, society in general, fathers today, poverty, and on and on. I was really surprised by the Susan Smith case review as the author seemed to completely miss or purposely disregard the fact that the real motive for killing her children was prompted by her dream of a new life with a rich man at work. I do no think her vague unnamed personality disorder was the main factor there.

I Think Lauren Child is trying to say that sometimes you have to look hard for something that's right in front of you. The main characters in the book are Clarice, Betty and her teacher {I don't remember her name}.My favorite part in the book is when they write a letter to Patricia F Maplin Stacey the auther of Ruby Redford.

We were concerned about some reviews on Amazon.com and some other sites that complained about low volume but that is not the case. We have watched DVD and VHS movies, listened to music CD's as well as the FM tuner and volume was never a problem. The system goes together very easily, and the quality of sound is very good. I feel you would have to spend $$$'s more to get an appreciable better sound. Also, I feel that the Panasonic models with the powered sub-woofer sound better than the comparably priced Sony systems that have passive subs for the most part. A real bargain can be found in the '690' version of this system which has slightly less power but is priced less and can be had at various wholesale clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY pleasant surprise...","review":"For weeks now, I was convinced that the TV sized box under our tree was a HDTV.

Simple set-up, (the only difficulty was figuring out where to place it in a system which already contained 2 VCR's, a satellite receiver, a DVD recorder and a TV), and I was on my way. Even though it was 10:30 at night, I then put in T3 and shook the walls. I was quite impressed.The design is sleek, and the sound top notch. The sub-woofer is the only part of the unit that's powered from the wall, and the DVD player does not have a video input - so that was tough for me to wrap my old-guy mind around - but it wasn't difficult to install.For anyone considering a home theater system, this one should definitely be looked at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...AT FIRST!","review":"Like some of the other reviews I also have had the problem of the loud POP sounds and loss of audio after 2 years of ownership.

I am currently trying to get it fixed. The system sounded great for 2 years and I was very happy with it, but in the long run you get what you pay for. Cheap system, short lifespan."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound quality","review":"I just got this system a week ago and i'm very happy with the sound quality.

RE-PLUGGING THE ELECTRIC CORD BRINGS IT BACK TO LIFE FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN IT DOWN AGAIN.THE EXTREMELY HIGH NUMBER OF UNITS THAT I SEE FORSALE ARE ADVERTIED AS RE-FURBISHED THEREFORE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE CALLING THIS PRODUCT AN EXTREME FAILURE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Panasonic!","review":"Customer Service - the Panasonic website claims this is very important to them. I had my home theater only 3-4 months when a VCR tape got stuck. I has now been at the service center for almost 4 months! When I am lucky enough to get a response from Panasonic (which is rare), they make promises of completion and/or replacement. But promises won't play the DVD's my family would have liked to watch together over the holidays. When we finally got through to the customer service center on the phone, they had the nerve to hand up on us twice. IF YOU WANT A COMPANY TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS - STAY AWAY FROM PANASONIC!!! I have truly given up hope of even getting my home theater back from the Panasonic service center."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP","review":"I was really happy with this unit for the first year. Then it started making strange noises, once in a while. Now, 6 months later, once in a while is every 10 minutes. It lets out very loud POPS, an ear splitting squeal, and then the audio goes off completely. Shutting and restarting resets the audio, then it does it all over again. An internet search has shown me that many people have had this problem and it's not only this model, it's other Panasonics as well. Panasonic has done nothing to fix them. Don't waste your money. It may sound great out of the box, but right after the warranty wears off, it's disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after six months","review":"The unit has an unusual design with power and speaker connectors plugging into the subwoofer. This means that if you have a problem with the system, you cannot reuse the subwoofer.My problems began with the right speaker connection emitting a constant, loud stream of static, even when the volume of the system was set to zero. It didn't matter if I switched speakers - the right speaker port would continue to buzz.Then, the unit began turning itself off - we would start watching a movie, and ninety seconds into the movie, the unit would turn itself off. I am disappointed and would not recommend this unit to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the point!","review":"Poor sound quality. After five months, tray has started sticking.

NEVER HAPPENED!!!! STILL WAITING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"After reading so many positive reviews, I thought for this price, this is too good to be true. I was right. After an easy set up, I put in some of my favorite DVDs to see what this thing could do. Even with component cables hooked up to my HDTV, the \\"progressive scan\\" picture was disappointing. Not to mention the pixelization of the picture that would happen periodically, even with brand new DVDs. Despite the horrendous video quality, the sound was pretty good minus the barely audible sub-woofer. I really wanted this to work so rather than return it, I sent it to be serviced by Panasonic's so-called authorized technicians. They kept it for 2 weeks and were unable to \\"pinpoint the problem.\\" On top of their inability to do their job, they were also extremely rude and unprofessional. I have since returned it and bought a higher quality product from another company (rhymes with BONY).

A few of the themes of fast pace tracks have a familiar effect as in Enemy of the State and Spy Game, but not too noticeable. The jungle theme was successfully introduced into the style of the movie.The score is doesn't have as much power driven in his previous works with Trevor Rabin and Hans Zimmer. But the flow and melody is necessary for the feel with the film.It is a very mellow soundtrack, most of the tracks are very easy on the ears.Dwyane Johnson followed his father, Rocky Johnson, in his footsteps into wrestling entertainment. Rocky was an mid 2nd generation wrestler in the business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mix of music....","review":"I was very pleased with the score to The Rundown. I bought it on a whim, and I was sure glad I did. The great thing about this album, is that you can leave it on at a party, its great background music. Gregson-Williams seems to take a bit from differnet music styles, electronica, kumbia, and traditional strings to make it a solid album. My one complaint is the lack of more of track one. Let me explain, track one, Coming Down, starts off fierce with a hypnotic electonica beat, unfortunately this beat only lasts a minute at the most. I would have liked to hear more of this beat as the theme for The Rundown.Great score, its good driving music and great to listen to at the end of a stressful day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the musical score...","review":"After watching The Rundown I immediately went to buy the soundtrack. I wish that I would have looked at the songs on the soundtrack first, because I got it home and felt ripped off. It was just the instrumental score, none of the actual songs were on it. Yes the score was okay, but I wanted the songs like: Run that, The boogie that be, Get your freak on, etc. But no not a one of them on it. So read the song list before you buy this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL FUNKY GROOVY WORLD!","review":"I love Cate's music world. It's new, sexy and sophisticated sound.

I am tried of repairing these things. I was smart this time and bought the extended warranty on the dvd player, but the previous two I did not. I wonder why they want us to buy that extended warranty? because they know that these things are crap.

The stones are a lovely smoky quartz color, not a faded out version. The necklace looks very pretty. The problem, however, is that the loop that the necklace threads through on the pendant is like an oversized 'D'......with the flat part against the pendant, and the rounded part against your skin. It's so oversized that it means the pendant cannot lay flat, but instead will only stay on it's side. This renders the pendant useless, since no one buys their jewelry for the profile!

A shame, since I got the matching earrings, and they are adorable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Reference to Add to an Existing Fashion Library","review":"Even though I wish that these were photos, I recognize just how much work went into compiling this book and others that John Peacock has produced.

A lot of times, when artists do tribute albums, they sound awkward and cannot even capture the emotional depth that is conveyed in their own recordings. Not Joyce.Joyce managed to brilliantly cover these songs, while retaning her smooth style. I really like that. This shows artistic intelligence.In short, this CD is great (an understatement). Joyce captures Elis so well that it seems like the two women intertwine. Can you say channeling??? The control in Joyce's voice is remarkable because it shows that she is taking her time to make a point. It is almost like talking to someone face to face. And when she lets it out, you hear a sort of silent celebration bursting forth. You look at her and know she is always celebrating, without having to shout. Her sense of artistry is very refined and it really comes out in this CD because it is a \\"cover\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"I have seen Joyce live and heard her mention this CD. She was of course very good friends with Elis Regina. A number of the tracks on this disc have some very interesting arrangements which at first forced me to step back but then on the second listen made me appreciate her artistry. This album is sensual and captures so much of Joyce's essence as well. I loaned this to a friend at work and it has been two weeks since I haven't listened to it. I had better get it back before I have to rush off and buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure","review":"Joyce's voice is ageless. She is emotionally subtler than Elis Regina but she had me engaged in every song and I do not understand Portuguese. Joe Lovano's tenor sax elevates an already fine CD. Joyce has only two originals here but one of them (Essa Mulher) may be the most beautiful song on the CD. My only complaint is the lyrics on the insert for Joyce's first North American release do not include English translations.Barry Rosenberg [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse Artist","review":"Joyce is a very engaging musician. I first heard of her on the BET Jazz Channel(Bet On Jazz) about 9 yrs ago. Arrangements as a soloist and part of a trio were my first exposure to her music.Amazon has provided necessary information that points out the extensive background that she has developed covering more than 25 yrs.

However, the mask for this costume not only sits on top of the head, like the picture shows, but it made of flimsy fabric. My son didn't feel as though he looked like Pikachu, and didn't wear the mask part - he wished the mask had been the plastic kind.

This is music that is bold, adventurous, dexterous, sassy, sharp and sometimes so downright brilliant that you just have to laugh. It jumps, pokes, scrapes, swings, sways and blows. I have always loved the original album and now with this complete set my appreciation and enjoyment has increased immeasurably. Don't worry about the nay-sayers who decry the multiple versions of numbers in a row.

I have read most other popular books on space suits, but this one packs the most information by far. This book is logically segmented and can be used as an excellent reference. For a true appreciation for the challenges of space suit engineering, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately a no go!","review":"This was rather a huge disappointment. There is virtually no color in the tapes, this is not a compelling series keeping you glued to the plot. It was rather painful to try and finish watching the entire set of videos with such poor quality. I dont think I could recommend it to anyone because it was so boring and implausible. The only saving grace was the superb acting ability of Sir Anthony Hopkins who benefits any movie with his flawless performances"},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED - DEFINITE NO","review":"I am a fan of Masterpiece Theatre productions as well as British drama and that's why this was especially a HUGE disappointment. Poor color quality and poor sound throughout. Fairly boring story. Possibly could of salvaged it if the actors didn't put you to sleep. Tedious to watch. Marketing this as starring Sir Anthony Hopkins (as I see Amazon has done) borders on fraud. He doesn't make an appearance until Part 11 - halfway through tape 5. The set is a total of 6 tapes. Hopkins was the only performance worth your time. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no enough evidence!","review":"This book is kind of boring. There are no evidence that she was really aborted. Her story seems like has been passing on to her by whoever the person that raised her.Until her biological mother would show up and tell her real own story that abortion really takes place in that time, probably I would believe it.Was this things had been documented? Who was the name of the doctor? Because I want to find out although I wasn't born in those year yet, but I am sure there are place that would give enough evidence for me.But if it just one way conversation, without biological mother side of stories. This story has no appeal to me all.I am almost 13 years old. This story is like a fantasy to me. The person who wrote it, doesn't have enough evidence. Sorry for you people that like the story.

It is a winner in my opinion! I too watched 'The Men Who Killed Kennedy\\", and I must admit this book was right on target! Somebody did their homework! The daughter may not have proof she is who she says, but if she isn't she will sure have fooled a great many people! I know it is hard to accept something different from what you grew up with, but celebs are often not what we think or want them to be. Who cares that Curly wasn't really Moe's brother? He was Curly and he was funny, and now we know he also had a not so funny side. I think the heirs to the Stooge fortune are running scared, and with good reason!

I'm also a mental health professional and can comfortably say that the person(s) who wrote this tawdry attempt at sensationalism are severly personality disordered. None of this stands up to even the most elementary evaluation. I suppose the \\"revealing of proof\\" promised \\"when the time is right\\" will also discuss the \\"lost\\" stooges movie made at Roswel, New Mexico where the Stooges are the doctors who botch the ailien autopsy. Shame on the the perpetrators and supporters of this garbage for not having the consience to make an honest living but rather trying to cash in on a fabrication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally a fabrication","review":"This book has to be a total fabrication. First of all, note the lack of saying it is Curly Howard she is talking about. There is no mention of that. It is all about \\"he was a stooge\\". Sorry but that reeks of somebody not wanting a lawsuit.Secondly, it is common knowledge that Curly was sickly, and left the short movie business being replaced by Shemp and died shortly after that.I am mad I bought the book thinking I would find out what Curly did after he couldn't to the shorts anymore, only to find out somebody wrote some book that alledges all this stuff.For those of you that wonder why this is not on TV, you should figure like I did that this is the best book of fiction written about a person you could ever read.It is a good yarn, but remember the facts. None of this could have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Curly Falsehoods","review":"The Author of this book should be ashamed of herself for trying to make money off the great name that was Curly Howard. I hope she is sued by the families of Curly Howard and Moe Howard for writting this c**p fantasy. I having read the book, \\"Moe Howard and The Three Stooges\\" written by Moe Howard before his death in 1975 was more than a little upset to read the obvious lies and discrepancies in her book about Curly. I would of prefered a boring truth about Curly's post Three Stooges days than this garbage. If you had ever read any other book by one of the Howards or Fineburgs (actual relatives to the Stooges) you would know that this is someone just trying to make a buck off a well loved comic genius who cannot defend himself against these lies. Shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke!!!!!","review":"Curly is portrayed as a wife beater, a mafia kingpin and even tied into the White House and Vince Foster. Please give me a break!!

It is similar to Forest Gump, where a fictional character is placed into historical events. In this case, the author is trying to rewrite an actual person's life and thread it into a story. The story is unbelievable, but, as I stated, if considered a fictional work, then it is somewhat interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus but amusing","review":"After reading a couple of chapters, I was mystified. Fictionalized biographies can be interesting, but anyone who knows anything about the Stooges would realize this book was totally nuts. Curly's from a wealthy Italian Catholic family from Georgia? He doesn't have any brothers, just sisters? So I came to read the reviews, and they are hilarious! That's why I give 2 stars, not for the book (-3 stars, poorly written & edited. Marriage vows are \\"scared\\"?), but the reviews (5 stars).Many of the reviews do an excellent job pointing out the nonsense, but it also amusing to see that some people actually think Curly's real name was Larry Fine. (So who was Larry? Shemp?) Or that Curly wrote the Godfather, or knew about the JFK and RFK assassinations.The page [...] says that the book is actually a fictionalized account of Frank Sinatra, and that they changed to a story about Curly to avoid getting sued. (Apparently, it's better to get the Stooge people mad at you than the Sinatra people.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Book","review":"This book is represented as a tell all book by Curly's daughter. It is not accurate in any way. For starters the book suggests Curly was involved with the Italian mafia and was somehow connected to J. Edgar Hoover and John Kennedy. Curly Howard died in 1952! Based on what I have since read, every part of this book is a fabrication. It's not funny or clever. The book is poorly written and a real disappointment. Amazon should consider pulling this book or rewriting the description so it is not represented as a non fiction book. According to the book, Curly was involved with Jack Ruby and the Kennedy assassination 11 years after his death. Maybe Elvis was his accomplice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmm","review":"If you are a Three Stooges fan, you won't like this book. If you are into fiction, maybe you will. It tells a story of a woman's relationship with Curly. They never tell you her name or give any verification that this information is true. What a farce. I actually ordered it a long time ago and only got through a portion of the book, never finished it and forgot most of the story...thank goodness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact or Fiction??? Where there's smoke, there's fire!","review":"After reading the comments by other readers I just had to write. Where there's smoke, there's fire! I feel the daughter had a great deal of facts to remember. Her father tried to take into account her anger, but the girl didn't realize the importance of what she was being told. She was more interested in why her father had abandoned her,which was normal. I don't think she is capable of making all of this up, especially in view of the fact that she is uneducated. As for the writing of the book, spelling errors are the fault of the publisher, not the author. Many times grammatical errors occur when dialogue is present or ethnic speech is being used. I thought the book was well scripted. I have yet to read a book that did not have some errors. This book is worth the read. It could and should be made into a movie. I believe it would be a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Stooge Book EVER!","review":"I LOVE this book! I have all the stooge books, and this one is NUMBER ONE! It's great - I just LOVE it - sooooo fascinating.

Everything about this piece of trash is so bad, I am embarrased as a knowledgable consumer that I was sucked in to buying it. I wish I had read the other reviews, before buying, but Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for not running a disclaimer at the top of the page in BIG BOLD TYPE, that this puported biography is a work of fiction, and a horrible one at that. I forced my self to read the whole thing, even though after the first chapter I really felt that I need to take abath to remove the stink. Once finished, this was thrown in the recycling bin with old newspapers. At least I was able to reduce the environmental footprint of this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a Step Back, and Look Again.....","review":"Several reviewers have described this book as \\"believeable\\". This is problematic, as the author states clearly that the only tangible documentation that can support the myriad of claims made in the book have been either lost, sold, or usurped by the government. What we are left with is completely unverifiable.Any one of us can write a book solving all of the unsolved mysteries from the last century, and then end it with:\\"I can't prove anything I've said, because the government stole all the documents, and I can't tell you or prove who I am because it's too dangerous, but it's all true, really, take my word for it, I wouldn't tell a lie.\\"I'd be just as excited as anyone to learn that the book was factual, but I just don't see it. If Jackie's identity, as well as the book's many claims, can be verified, I will gladly take back every single word. The book is pure fiction, until proven otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THIS IS MORE STUPID THAN ANY STOOGE","review":"This novel is a complete fabrication, an imaginary tale. I think the heirs of the real Curly Howard should sue. The only Curly biography out there is the one written by Joan Huward Maurer - Moe's daughter, and although not great, it is factual.Believe me, if any of this nonsense were true a bigger publisher would have grabbed this up. Not only are the events in the book implausible, the writing is not very good. There is so much unnecessary repetition. Did anyone even proof this thing? Not even the tabloids would touch this garbage.If you want to waste 13 bucks and have this in your collection as a curio, go ahead. Otherwise it is a complete lie, a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable on all Levels !","review":"I can't believe someone would publish this as a fact based story.

A Daughter's Story","review":"I threw this book in the trash after a few chapters because it is not as it would appear. It is a complete fabrication, representing itself as a story about Curly Howard. To begin, Curly's name was Jerome Lester Horwitz, not Glissen. He did not go by Curly, but by Jerry or \\"Babe\\". Since he was Jewish, why would he need the Pope to annul his marraige to a non-catholic? The author tries to tie him to events in the late 1950's that lead up to the death of President Kennedy. Curly died January 18, 1952 of complications of a stroke that he suffered in 1946.I suggest that anyone looking for a story based in truth stay away from this book. I wish I had known before buying it that it was a falsehood. I feel mislead and cheated and that I had never wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"After about 10 pages I thought I was reading about somebody else. This woman is basically insane. The only thing I can assume is that this lady has had a fantasy relationship with Curly. It is an outrage to the 3 stooges and their families. Where are the time zones? Curly walking around Tampa and Los Angeles supposedly after his death and nobody notices?The author should apologize to the Howard family and everyone else involved with this hideous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"Not only is this piece of trash full of lies and nonsense, it's poorly written to boot. I should have read through some of the online reviews, but I ordered without doing so and wasted [...] bucks.Some of the foolishness this book claims: Curly was an Italian from the Deep South (he and brothers Moe and Shemp were born and raised in Brooklyn, hence the accent 'soitanly' and were sons of Jewish-Lithuanian immigrants); Curly was involved with the Mafia and knew beforehand about the JFK assassination (though Curly had died in 1952); and Curly lived until 1975.And while you're reading these ridiculous claims, all the while you're wading through bad punctuation, bad grammar, and an overall sloppy and clumsy writing style.Read the books by Moe Howard and Jane Maurer instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perjury on a Stooge","review":"The frightening thing is that a publisher actually let this book get past the editors. It is pure fabrication from start to finish, but does make for some interesting reading, to be sure. Why Curly's Howard true daughters (Janie Howard Hanky and Marilyn Howard Ellman) did not sue for over this is nothing short of a miracle. What is sad is that the author did not even attempt to get some basic facts right.For an actual biography on the most beloved Stooge, see Joan Howard Maurer's (Moe's daughter) book entitledCurly: An Illustrated Biography of the Superstooge.Shameful."},{"rating":"2","title":"?Donde estan los osidos?","review":"Shakira is so great.

This cd (Donde estan los ladrones?) and the other one (Pies Descalzos) are very good. Shakira is very talented. She writes all of her songs and she is original to her music. It's not just rock, it's a mixture of pop fusion, reggae, and romantic songs. This colombian born singer has SOLD over 7 million cds of her 2 albums. She will even become more popular to the \\"english speaking audience when she does her crossover in the year 2000. With the help of Gloria and Emilio Estefan she will be bigger than Ricky Martin.

Blame music award shows. Actually, don't blame them, worship them. From the first time I heard her distinctive raspy voice Shakira stole my soul. I admit I am not sure exactly what it is that I am saying as I sing along, but that does not diminish the enjoyment one bit. I am ADDICTED to Ojos Asi and its Arabic tinge.

Shakira is not an artificial lab created star,she really comes from the heart. She deserves America's recognition. Hope she'll sing in english very soon. She could be pop-rock Estefan's version. But unique and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique style, reveals Colombians' talents","review":"Shakira is a wonderful singer, she is full of youth and great ideas for lyrics. I was informed that she would be entering the American Music Industry and as a Colombian who believes in Shakira's talent I say she is going to blow most American's away, as she blew all of Latin America and some European Nations. Her style and diction is overwhelming. I haven't heard music of this form in a long time that has caught my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sophomore Triumph","review":"While most artists struggle through their sophomre outing never to be heard again, Shakira grabs you with the first track, \\"Ciega, sormdomuda\\". It is bright and jumps right out at you. Shakira's trademark verbal gymnastics are in full flow here again and for those non-spanish speaking listeners, there is just a pure pleasure in such a crystal clear and strong voice as Shakira's. Regardless of the reviewer of this cd, give it a listen. If you do not know Shakira you at least deserve to hear the pleasure in her voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakira's Best CD Ever!!!!","review":"A great blend of rock and pop, Shakira has a fabulous CD! Her voice can sing softly to soft songs yet sing to fast upbeat songs also. She has many good songs on the CD including \\"Ciega Sordomuda,\\" \\"No Creo,\\" \\"Que Vuelvas,\\" \\"Si Te Vas,\\" and \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones.\\" She reminds me of a Hispanic Alanis Morisette with her voice and guitar going with her rock/pop songs.

Although they may not understand the lyrics, they will love the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"catchy","review":"I'm not a real fan of latin music in fact, but this cd is catchy and sexy! this record could please, although someone wouldn't have a direct line to latin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakira is da bomb!!!!","review":"I barely bought shakira's new cd and i loved it all of her songs are so nice she expresses herself diffirient comparing things to whats going on in the songs life and it opens your mind to the lyrics and situation a little bit more i highly recommend this cd :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"CESAR AUGUSTO DELGADO ALVARADO.

He can sing and dance, Shakira actually has talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excepcional...","review":"In this CD Shakira fullfilles all the expectations. She manages to combine romantic and social criticism lyrics with exotic rhythms in an astonishing way that simply provoques what every CD may acomplish, the desire for hearing it over and over again.\\"Ojos así\\" is a sample of the combination of rhythms that Shakira successfully uses while \\"Moscas en la Casa\\" misses love and \\"Ciega, sordomuda\\" confesses it (this is just the beginning of the variety of themes that she explores).This CD is another prove of all the talent that this young voice can offer. Furthermore, it accomplishes an improvement in lyrics and music in comparison to her last CD, althoiugh that one was good too.The direction of Emilio Estefan leaves its print on this work, what guarantees a good product and assures success in the market.For all these reasons, I strongly recommed this CD to anyone and think of it as an EXCEPTIONAL one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely unbelieveable!","review":"I did not think that after \\"Pies Descalzos\\", Shakira could top her wonderful collection of songs, but she did. She became my favorite singer from the instant that I heard her magical voice. \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\" is by far the best CD I have ever heard. Every single song is is profound and at times painfully poignant. \\"Moscas en la casa\\" has become one of my favorites but I believe that the best song on this CD is \\"Octavo Dia\\".

There's so much detail, you can feel her words, and just go with it! She has a very unique style of music! That's what makes her so awesome! Just look at the number of reviews she's had on this CD.

A wonderful mix of sound, beat and feeling.","review":"I am so glad that I discovered Shakira. The first time I listened to the CD I was dancing and singing along with the written words. I hear the songs in my mind eventhough I speak no Spanish. This is my first CD with Spanish lyrics. I do not understand any of the words and yet I feel as if I know the meaning of the songs.

I love SHAKIRA. This is one of the best and very inspiring CDs to come around in a very long time. Can't wait for her next CD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you do anything today, buy this album!","review":"Shakira is probably the most underrated of all the recent Spanish language rock singers. Just because you can't understand the words doesn't imply that the meaning of them isn't obviously stated by her tone of voice. When she comes out with an album in English, i hope the whole world will finally recognize her musical genius... Shakira es mi idola. La rezo en vez de dios. Esta es broma, pero en serio, una cancion no puede SER tan buena como las suyas. Es una talentosa, sincera diosa. Perdonenme las errores que soy norteamericana y no sé escribir bien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing songwriting!","review":"Shakira is an amazing songwriter and performer! Sort of a mixture between Jewel, Tracy Chapman, and Alanis Morrisette, she is very uniqe and all her own! Her songs consist of incredibly beautiful melodies reminicent of ABBA and the Beach Boys, but with the \\"deep feeling and honest/from the heart\\" songwriting of Jewel and Tracy Chapman. Her lyrics are as unique as Nacho Cano's from Mecano---as great as Bob Dylan's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont know how to speak spanish","review":"I saw Shakira sing her english verision of inevitable on the Rosie Odonell show and she rocked! I loved her singing voice and her style. I am the first to admit I dont understand a thing she sings about but her vocals are great and foremost its not bubblegum... besides world music. (latin) and Shakira the rest of the latin craze is just spice girls speaking spanish ie Jennifer Lopez.... I am a harsh musical critic and do not listen to mainstream... I thinks she's a spanish Ani Difranco... the last song on this album is the best! i would learn spanish for only the ablitity to know what she is singing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakira is the Real Thing!","review":"I scoff at those who say Shakira is the Latin Alanis Morrisette! I think she is the Latin combo of Ani DiFranco and Tori Amos. Her beautiful big voice and incredible rythyms explain why Latin music is making it big in the US. She makes sell-outs like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias look like wanna-bes, while she is the real thing! This is the one CD that both my friend and I brought back from living simultaneously in Latin America, I in Mexico and her in Chile, it hasn't left our CD players since! Discover Latin America's sensational secret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakira ROCKS!!!","review":"Shakira's \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\\" was the first album of hers that I bought. After the first listen, I was totally hooked. Even if you don't know spanish, the music alone is worth it. And when you get the feel for it...it's so much more better. but from what i can tell, shakira is NOTHING like alanis morrisette. i mean, shakira's music has a wit and a daring that i have not heard in a long time. once you listen to this, you will never want to take it out of your cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, danceable, 100% latin!!!!","review":"It is a great album!!!!

Yeah, this is the kind of music that'll make you sick to your stomach. I had to go knocking on my neighbor's door and asking them to turn down their stereo, which THANK GOD they did, or I probably wouldn't still be alive today! Yeah, Shakira's voice literally almost killed me! it was just that awful! I kid you not! How can people even call this stuff music? There should be some other type of category for this.

Great cd worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Sordomuda!","review":"Shakira's second studio album is much better than many even can think. It has great Spanish lyrics.

Those all are classic songs. The only song in this album that doesn't make me happy is \\"Sombra de Ti\\" which is so boring.

It is a warning to all who allow themselves to be brainwashed by the PC crowd into accepting encroachments by foreigners who intend to subjugate the entire world and enslave all cultures for a false god. This book may appeal to people who have no religion of their own. She freely admits she is not a believer in any religion. That is sad, but the way she sees Islam is from a secular view which cannot leave the reader thinking she is just a member of one religion who disagrees with another religion. In fact, Islam is more than a religion; it is a political-religious system that is brutal and uncompromising; intent upon destruction of all ways of life other than its own.

The book concentrates on things like monsters and gosts ect.. The book shows some background techniques (very important) and as another reveiwer said there are a lot of RPG character ideas. The bad side: None of the how to draw manga series shows how to draw manga step by step if the book showed step by step it would definetly earn its 5th star.

But if you're in the mood for a good action movie with a once-in-a-lifetime cast, then this one's for you. A classic by any standard.

If you are a fan of the western genre, this is a movie for you. Great story, scenery and action with great roles from William Holden (always liked him in Stalag 17), Borgnine and Warren Oates along with secondary roles from Strother Martin, Bo Hopkins and Robert Ryan make this a movie worth owning. I used to own the DVD but recently upgraded to the BluRay and wow is it worth it...better than the 1994 restored version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best western ever","review":"This is with out a doubt the best western ever to grace the silver screen. The acting in this film is some of the best to be seen William Holden gives an outstanding performance. The slow motion special effects are the best and the first western to use them as far as I know. It's a shame they don't make westerns like this anymore. The only complaint I have is with the dvd It's a (flipper disk) and it is not anamorphic but I am sure that they will fix this in the future. This film is highly recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 40 years, I *still* hate this film!","review":"I guess it's so beloved for the very reason I've loathed it: the gratuitous cruelty and violence. Sam Peckinpah must have been inspired by the early work of Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali, on the ennui of existence. But Bunuel and Dali were surrealists. In this mishmash of mindless mayhem, Peckinpah indulges in \\"brutal realism,\\" if I must coin a phrase. From the opening shot of the children giggling over a tortured insect (it's a scorpion, a symbolic \\"bad guy\\", so it's \\"OK\\") to breaking a baby bird's wing, to Bo Hopkins gloating and giggling over helpless people he's slaughtered, I find this film seriously disturbed and must wonder at the moral sanity of those who rave over it. Presumably they were 1960s adolescents in love with effing things up for its own sake. Time to grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE western.","review":"This is the BIG ONE!! The grand daddy of them all. This movie was a jaw dropper in 1969 and still is today. From the opening thru the end, it has it all. The acting, actors chosen for the parts, hellacious gun fights, dynamite and the theft of a train carrying army ordinance. If you haven't seen it, you've missed the best one of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie 5 stars, DVD - ZERO STARS!","review":"A couple of years ago I bought a Director's Cut version (145 minutes). This one is 134 minutes with more extras. Buy it or not? The practice of reissuing DVD over a relatively short period of time is nothing but a scam. Suckers will buy into this highly immoral business of reprinting \\"ultimate\\", \\"remastered\\" versions of old CD's and DVD's. When will the consumers learn their lesson? If you already purchased this DVD in the past, I suggest you go and rent this one. You already paid for the right to see the movie, why not get the \\"new\\" version for just a fraction of the cost of a new DVD? Now, that would be corporate honesty, an oxymoron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"Don't understand the hype for this movie...thought it was a so-so western.

There are contrasting issus the about loyalty, values, commitment, friendship & going down in a blaze of glory. Sad to say it depicts the US military as inept. Some sections are found offensive. The stars are of course in a class all their own without a doubt. It seems a bit long & could have been improved if shorter in time & written better. Not recommended for immature audiances."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC FROM PECKINPAH!!","review":"I can't wait to see this movie in HD. I purchased the standard version last year but ended up selling it. The bloody shootout at the end is one of the all time great and influential gun fights ever filmed. Yes it's violent, gruesome and over the top but what else would expect from the late great Peckinpah! The cast led by aging Hollywood's golden boy William Holden is also first rate!! Straw Dogs is still me favourite film of his but I rank this a very close second. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It","review":"Out of place characters, too many multi-angled shots leading the viewer into oblivion, original score not jiving with the scene, and on and on.

As large a disappointment as Once Upon A Time In The West."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wild Bunch-30th Anniv. Ed.","review":"This has to be the most overrated film I've seen in a long time. The directing is atrocious! The acting is far below what these actors are capable of, and this is certainly the result of the poor directing. The story is choppy and the whole thing lifeless. Don't waste your money--it's not even worth the shipping charge even if you can get it for less than a dollar. To call this thing a classic is beyond belief!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hysterically Overrated","review":"I have to agree with a few other reviewers that 'The Wild Bunch' is a hysterically overrated film. The movie clearly has a devoted following who can't handle the knowledge that maybe they have been devoted to the wrong movie. I watched all of the extras on my Blu-ray and was taken aback by how passionate the devotees of this film are. Their gushing praise was so over the top that it smacked of groupies who have had such a great time hanging out together over the years and talking about their favorite band that at some point the band itself becomes almost irrelevant. When the truth is revealed that the band is not that great the groupies reject any and all negative criticism because it threatens their reason for existing. Yes, this film is vastly overrated. It plays like a bad TV episode in spots. Seriously. I'm not saying I hated it. It was okay. But that's about it. It was just 'okay'."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wild Bunch","review":"I RETURNED THIS ITEM ON NOVEMBER 19TH AND I'M STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE THEIR RECEIPT CONFIRMATION!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild Bunch","review":"One of the best movies--western or otherwise--ever made.

After viewing many Western films though, I realized the genre is much like the science fiction genre in that there are popular, schlocky movies, and there are classic, well made films. First viewing of this film was such a visceral experience, I stopped watching before it was over. The story is truly of desperadoes. The film is filled with despair. One must suspend disbelief while watching the film, because some of the scenes are surreal. But it is a wonderful film to learn from. Cinematography, casting, location, editing, dialogue, and of course action, are all accessible to mainstream viewers. This is what I like about this film. An interesting comparison is with Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean's film which is stunningly beautiful even in its violence and despair, while this film has little visual beauty. Both are compelling films."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Western by which all others are judged","review":"This is a masterpiece. The slow motion gun battle at the end, where the gang kills the whole Mexican army, set the standard for all future shoot outs. The blurring of good and evil, the gang and the railroad bounty hunters, the Mexican army and the rebel army, pre-dates Clint's \\"Unforgiven\\" storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Macho Bore-fest with ZERO sense of humor and wit","review":"Technical qualities aside and leaving out the excellent final shootout scene which slow-motion blood-ballets its way onto a higher artistic plane, the ENTIRE rest of this film is MEDIOCRE AT BEST. Not only is it NOT the greatest Western of all time, and not even close to being one of the top 20 Westerns ever made, it's not even Peckinpah's best Western (that honor belongs to \\"Ride the High Country,\\" a much less bloody and far superior film).And even in the action scenes most of what Peckinpah did was to take the already hugely popular Sergio Leone level of violence, magnify it, and squirt some blood in the air in super-slow motion, while leaving out all the humor, lunacy, and imagination that makes Leone's films so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by the quality of the DVD","review":"I am very disappointed by the quality of this DVD. I bought it with my eyes closed because I actually loved the film. I fully agree with those who consider it a masterpiece, but... I wish I could have my money back.

I only read the section which interviewed the lady from South Texas on Mexican American cooking. But I came across enough errors, to indicate that the journalism was pretty sloppy, at least in this section. Errors which should not have been made and which could have been avoided by checking a couple of sources and coincidentally would have made for a more interesting story.Example 1: \\"Taco\\" is defined as a snack. The word taco comes from \\"wedge\\" or \\"wad\\", the wadding such as was used to stuff a cannon or rifle. Because tortilla tacos were originally soft and round, well, you can see how you'd get to the image of stuffing a wad of food into your mouth.Example 2: A little research would have turned up that enchilada is a shortened form of tortilla enchilada, \\"chili'ed tortilla\\" in other words. They shouldn't have missed this one.Example 3: The dicho for \\"como el agua para chocolate\\" is completely wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downright offensive","review":"I agree with the other reviewer.

I first read it when I was a teenager and have read it probably 20 times since then. About 3 years ago I obtained a new copy, as my old one was totally worn out and I wanted to be able to read this again and again. It is an entertaining story, but more than that it is inspirational. Their faith is tremendous and each time I read it my own faith is strengthened. I love the humor in the book- it leaps out at you in unexpected ways. I related the story of the turtle to my children on the way to church the other day and my family howled with laughter! I am so glad that the book has been reprinted, as it was out of print for several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Treasures Inside","review":"Aside from so many more details than a movie could ever give, this book has other small treasures hidden in it. My favorite part of this book is Maria's humorous relaying of her difficulties with learning a new language- English. Her misuses and others people's misunderstandings had me laughing out loud.Maria also gives details about their family traditions (how they celebrated birthdays and religious holidays, for example), many of which I hope to adopt for my family. Her faith and simple lifestyle inspire me. She has her priorities straight and knows what's really important in this life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not completely true, but still throughly readable","review":"I, too, saw the A&E Biography of the Von Trapp family, which revealed the \\"real\\" story. So, while reading Maria's book, I had to be somewhat skeptical when she characterized herself as a decent, noble, loving mother, always ready to do the will of God, (Well, she probably was, at least in part.) Despite this skepticism, I still enjoyed the book. Parts of it are quite humorous, and others are filled with richly detailed descriptions of Austrian folk life and thier celebrations of holidays. Some parts were even a little moving, too. It was nice to hear what really went on, even if Maria left certain things out conveiently. There's no reason why anyone shouldn't read this, especially if they're interested in the story behind The Sound of Music. Even if it isn't the complete true story, it's still throughly engaging. And it's got to be at least half-true, so, oh, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL Sound of Music story","review":"The real Maria writes about the Von Trapp family story! Very interesting, full of great history, and a story full of love even through hard times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trapp Family","review":"I have never actually seen or heard the Trapp Family Singers, but like most Americans, know their story from \\"The Sound of Music\\". This is the third copy of the book that I have bought. I lost the first, have the second and this copy is for a gift.The real story is much more fascinating than the movie. María was a remarkable woman, but she was nothing like Julie Andrews in the movie. Their escape was made by train to Italy and then by ship to travel to the USA where they were going to go on a concert tour. Hiking through the Alps to escape certainly would not make much sense for a woman who was at that time pregnant, with two very small children as well! The number, names and ages of the children were all changed in the movie.But I don't want to ruin the story. It is a good read if you are interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration Throughout","review":"Maria comes alive as a very sincere godly woman. Devoted to her Lord, Family, Friends, and Country. To read this book was to understand a deep trust in your God, a faith beyond imagination.

Its intriguing to see it through Maria's eyes.

This hugely disappointing ''documentary\\" is certainly the worst thing I have seen on the subject. Documentary is really the wrong word - while there is some original footage (with a rather tedious narrative giving a standard account of events) there is a significant amount of irrelevant \\"filler\\" made up of an odd collection of people simply recollecting what they were doing during the crisis.The video is also in stark, and rather sad contrast to an execellent recent BBC documentary that draws on archive material from the former Soviet Union to present the Russian and Cuban perspective on the crisis.My advice: save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great running shoe","review":"Two New Balance models seem to fit my feet and running style better than any others, the 85x series and the 106x series. The 1060 is out of production now, but you can still buy them on line. They have been superceded by the 1061 and now the 1062. They are a little heavier than the 85x series and a tad warmer for winter running. They provide excellent support and I typically get about 3 months of use before they wear out. This is a good thing, some brands only give me 2 months of wear on a shoe. The mesh breathes well, so my feet stay comfortable in hot weather. The laces that NB now uses virtually guarantee your laces will stay tied. If you can find your size and either run neutral or mild over pronation, check out the fit.

It sounds different than a lot of other things out right now and that is a plus. As far as comparing it to past works by this artist, I would describe it as a cross between Gentleman and one of those early 90's Jesus and Mary Chain albums. It's got dark and clever lyrics and a driving groove to it. It's heavily produced, a lot of vocal effects, and all the songs are worth listening to. Not a lot of filler. I particularly enjoy the Pink Floyd phone reference on the second track. I would give it a 5 star but..

However, upon listening you immediately hear it's originality. Nothing quite like this is being done by anyone. The music is unpredictable, yet expertly maneuvered by Greg Dulli, and it feels like he sweeps it straight through your soul on every track. His lyrics are as haunting as ever, and the album's production is outstanding.Dulli has made brilliant albums before, but this classic album is sure to be his best yet.

Not so. What you get with this book is basically a Celtic rosary. Tells you what kind of beads to acquire to assemble your own rosary-type thing, and gives short Celtic poems to recite. Kinda interesting. I am actually inspired to make my own take-off from this idea and write little \\"prayers\\" that are meaningful to me. The little poems are presented in Gaelic and English, though there are no pronunciations next to the Gaelic, which was a little disappointing. There is a little pronunciation guide in the back, though, but I find it lacking many sounds I couldn't figure out. It is by no means a large tome. You could nearly call it a booklet. Based on looks, I probably wouldn't have bought it, or certainly wouldn't have paid as much as I did sight-unseen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Journey","review":"I watched part of the process of the research for this book, and have used the system for some years.

Despite claims to the contrary, many of these tales are bogged down by the exact literary trends and pretension that inspired this collection (and the previous) as a reaction against. There are some outstanding stories--Ayelet Waldman's \\"Minnow\\", China Mieville's \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\", and Jason Robert's \\"7C\\"--that accomplish that thrilling edge-of-your-seat anticipation that inspired so many young folks to become lifelong readers. Many of the other stories are mostly good but seem to not exactly fit into this anthology. I will say that I loved the stories by the inimitable David Mitchell and Jonathan Lethem and would suggest picking up this volume for those alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great anthology","review":"The reason I nought this book is Stephen King's \\"Lisey and the Madman,\\" a novella that is (so the buzz insists, at least) actually an excerpt from a novel King has recently finished but has not decided yet to publish in full. Well, I for one hope that the entire novel is available at some point. This excerpt demonstrates again that King's writing style is simply getting better, without sacrificing a jot of the storytelling skill.The best of the rest of the stories are Jonathan Lethem's \\"Vivian Relf,\\" Peter Straub's \\"Mr. Aickman's Air Rifle,\\" and Poppy Z.

If you plan to visit only northern Botswana or the Central Kgalagadi (as most tourists so) then better to purchase the Bradt guide, which even after 2 years in Botswana, I still find interesting. The sight seeing and accomodation information in Lonely PLanet guide is meager at best, offering few choices. In Botswana, the best and most interesting places are off the beaten path, and Lonely Planet did not bother to find many of them for their readers. If you plan on visting southern or eastern Botswana (near Gaborone or Selebi-Phikwe) then buy a guide that includes South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia as well.

In between are Chamberlain's insightful views on gun control, mathematics and death and divorce.Reading \\"Don't Look at Girls Who Drive Volvo Station Wagons\\" is akin to listening to an intelligent friend, with brandy in hand by a cozy fireplace after dinner, ruminating, dispensing thoughts and wisdom and humor and even poetry.

The album features some of the best songs I've heard in recent times.An extremely well prepared mixture of tropical sounds, it features upbeat songs such as Procura (¿can you say great???) as well as much more slow, romantic ones (Sol de Verano). Great album for listening to, great album for dancing to... it'll always get you going. Even if you haven't heard about this type of music in your life, give it a chance. I can assure you, you will immediately fall in love with it.Definitely worth the buy. I believe it will eventually become a classic for latin music, in the same line as Carlos Vives' El Amor de mi Tierra. 5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistible latin dance","review":"The 1997 debut album by Dominican singer Chichi Peralta is an irresistible collection of latin dance hits.

Whether you speak Spanish or not, you will enjoy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite in all of the Wasa line","review":"This is excellent. The flavor, the crunch, the thickness - it can't be beat for a delicious crispbread. I eat low-carb and the crispbreads fit into a healthy plan (if you allow yourself whole-grains, unlike the Paleo diet). I am limiting my carbs to 50 or less per day so this is an occasional treat crispbread. I rely on the Wasa Fiber for everyday eating although this one is still my favorite, bar-none!Ideas:- Spread cream cheese and top with salmon or tuna and cucumber slices. (I do just cream cheese and cukes also)- Top with tuna, chicken, egg, or salmon salad for an open faced sandwich.- Peanut or any nut butters and jam makes a delicious PBJ open faced sandwich.- Spread brie, goat cheese, or cream cheese and top with lunch meat.- Leftover roasted chicken, beef or lamb and cheese makes a delish open faced sandwich.- Hummus, Tzatziki, Eggplant spread or Ratatouille is tasty on top of your crispbread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sudo-bark","review":"My word these are terrible.

It's obvious that the music here is classically influenced.Two cuts here I thought were so-so are \\"Transitional\\" and \\"City Of Temptation\\". Seven tracks,duration is 57:27.

After about 1 week the TV would not turn on with the remote, you had to push the on/off button on the unit several times before it would sometinmes work. The Tv turns off and on randomly without notice. It was quit working all together and we have no warranty and no means to return. We have had the tv a total of 3 months.

I thought the sound, picture quality, options etc. on the Phillips were great...when it was working. In June it started shutting itself off and then after getting really moody it just quit functioning entirely (in my opinion)except for daintily lighting a little green light on the front panel making me think that something might be stirring within. So in light of the fact that, through years of product development and research, Phillips can make a grown man sit staring at a green light hoping that his television will turn on in time to see the World Superbike Championships or even Gunsmoke, I give it 2 stars rather than a 0. At just over 14 months of faithful service, longevity was not one of it's virtues.

Everybody has the same problem. Even Consumer Reports shows that this one has the number 2 worst repair rating. You do the math.

Yes the high pitch whine was tolerable, but after 2 years it has died with the same symptoms that everyone else has had - the random shut off with increasing frequency, the clicking relay sound, and now permanent death.

That doesn't mean you can't express your opinion; you just have to be subtle about it. Vonnegut is better at this in some of his other writing.One of the characters is a one-dimensional brute (possibly based on Ernest Hemingway) who treats his wife and son as things and has filled his house with taxedermised animals he has killed.

Oh, sure, the play DOES right itself a bit in the second act. But by then, who cares? The laughs a bound as the plot sweeps out of boundaries.

I bought the book because I was misled by the title - \\"Complete Reference\\". It is anything but a complete reference. Just one example of why I say this: The section on Word does not even mention anything about field codes. Those topics that it does cover, the coverage is shallow, glossing over many key aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but Uplifting","review":"I also read this book over 20 years ago for the first time. I still have my own copy and every couple of years I re-read it. It deals with the friendship between 2 boys and also about how the surviving boy deals with the \\"too early\\" death of a friend due to an allergic reaction to a bee sting. It is a fantastic book and one of the few that I have kept from my child hood. I highly recommend it for readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution when reading to students","review":"My 3rd grade teacher read this book to the class back in 1974. I'll never forget it.

To this day I can remember the anger I felt towards the book. I was not angry to have to read it but at the way it was written, I believe it to be something that should not be read until children are much older than 10, possilbly older that even 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you , Couz!","review":"It had to be around 1974-75, I was 8 or 9 yrs old. My cousin Cookie, who was 2 yrs older, gave me this book and said it was really good. This was my first chapter book, as I called it. Up to this point I read Dr. Suess, Maurice Sendak, Curious George, Madeline, The Fire Cat and other similiar books. Liking, but not loving them. One of the hundreds of reasons I love Cookie so much is that she gave me the book that made me fall in love with books. Once I read A Taste of Blackberries it was on to Paul Zindel & Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys Mysteries in no time. I was moved by the story but I have been afraid of bees every since I read it!I am now 45 years old and have been an avid reader of all genres of books throughout my life. I have since instilled in my daughters the love of books by suggesting good reads, as was suggested to me by Cookie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traumatizing","review":"It's rather stunning that so many people cite this as a fantastic children's book.

If he hated it, he'll hate this one, too.As a child, I knew that death and dying were a part of life and that children died, too. But that doesn't mean I wanted to read about it.Think of My Girl, but with two boys. It is the type of book an adult thinks a child would like rather than one a child actually does like.Note the reviews of the class of children who had it read aloud to them in class. Almost none even understood what it was about. Most mention disliking the part about the death, but there are few mentions (beyond a vague teacher-pleasing \\"it was a good book\\") of things they actually LIKED in it.Read it when you're a teen or older, and you'll love it. Read it as a young child, and you'll probably hate it, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Boring(Yawn)","review":"Maybe it was just that this book was too simple but I found it very boring and the story line is basically what people go through in their lives. Someone close to you dies and you move on I would not recommend this book to you basically because it is a played out storyline and I do not think the author spent too much time on this book which I think was probably thought of in ten minutes and written in twenty minutes and published.

I consider myself a knife junkie and enjoy all of my blades. But this knife is often the one I carry when camping and hiking the backcountry! Not to big to carry in the pocket and releases only when you want! I have recommended this knife to many of my friends and have given them as gifts. It holds a edge and has a great corkscrew. Never know when you have to open a bottle of wine.

I'm nervous about touching it for fear it will break. I sure wouldn't want this in a survival kit or have to depend on it in the woods. The rest of the plastic on the knife looks like it would crack easily. I'm sure in years past these were a good quality knife. But alas, no more..... Which is too bad, because I really like the design and size of the knife. I will be returning this to Amazon.After I received the knife I went to a local sporting goods store and saw a VICTORINOX SPARTAN and a TINKER. They didn't have the cheap plastic release mechanism like the HUNTER. The red plastic case seemed better as well. I've decided to reorder a different Victorinx knife, either a Spartan, Tinker or the Army Huntsman. I look forward to giving that knife a positive review when I receive it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large blade swings closed very quickly - had to get stitches","review":"While it might some idiotic, I actually cut myself very badly while using this Swiss Army Hunter. The large blade is great when it is in the open position but when you close the blade it is quite forceful. If you are not careful it will swing back and put a nice deep gash in your left index finger. Basically you have to ensure that you have a good grip on the large blade while closing it. I much prefer Leatherman or Gerber multi tools that have the feature of just \\"push\\" closing. Other than the large blade swing back, the rest of the tools are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"CENSORED = Zero Stars","review":"At first this looks like a fly collection of tunes from Clinton's solo career, which it would be if it weren't CENSORED. When the record labels don't release multiple versions, \\"clean\\", \\"explicit\\", etc., it seems reasonable to assume that you will be getting the artists original work, unadultered. Not so in this case, there is the one edition only, and it is censored. Not only that, but unlike a lot of the newer censored discs, its not just a word that's omitted while the music continues: this is just a BEEP that overrides all tracks -- talk about interrupted groove! Of course, that's a minor detail, if record companies feel compelled to put \\"Explicit Lyrics\\" labels on those albums with naughty words, then they should feel equally compelled to put a \\"CENSORED\\" label for ANY censorship (whether done as lamely as this or more subtley)."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PRESIDENT","review":"IT's ABout TIme this Came Back Out.George Clinton THe PResident On The Funk Has This Tight Greatest Hits Album.No Wack Re-Makes with Rappers But The Straight Up Grooves.Atomic Dog Still Hits Hard.BROTHER CLINTON IS ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED PRODUCERS&GREAT MINDS THAT MUSIC Has Ever Known or Heard Period.He Is a Genius.His Work Is TImeless.He is Always ahead of The Curve.THis is Very Essential.His Music Crosses Many Styles.What A Mind George Clinton Has?"},{"rating":"1","title":"EMPTY DVD BOX!

But i gave it a second chance and i have grown to love Tim burton's little creatures. It is so amazing to watch all the special effects and intricicies of the little insects, each one with his own unique personality and look. My favorite character was the spider. she was so ultra-hip!The only thing I didn't like about this film was the incorporation of the humans. The little boy and the two meanie aunts were cool. But at the end of the film where he ends up in NY and all the real life humans come scampering out of nowhere like roaches, it's all too much \\"culture shock\\" for the eyes.

Now he must escape his harridan aunts and journey to New York City in a giant magical peach to fulfill his and his parents' dream. Yowza.This is the sort of film where you realize that you are supposed to be entertained, but something isn't working. The whole thing is surreal and creepy, but there is far too much figurative language and imagery here - the thing screams \\"the world as seen through the eyes of an idealistic child\\". James' companions - Centipede, Ladybug, Grasshopper, Earthworm, Spider, and Glow Worm - are nicely characterized but completely flat parodies of the various social groups, but since most of the film is a passive journey, they have little to do but squabble. James faces a number of sophisticated dilemmas, including how to harness a flock of seagulls, and what there is to eat on a giant peach.A bit less metaphor, and it would've been so much better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you mean fun?!","review":"I saw this movie on the theater to see this Tim Burtons produced film, and surprise! the movie sucked, the music is based from the book and the book is based from Roal Dahl, but it was a tragic disaster, even the good music and songs from Randy Newman(Toy Story, A Bug's Life) doesn't save the damn movie, at least it's better than Tim Burton's previous film The NigthMare Before Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is one of the worst movies for kids there is. Some guy really must have been smoking something to make this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies made since \\"Nightmare.\\"","review":"I personally like \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" because it's a movie that has something in it for everyone. The animation is great and I like the songs. My siblings enjoy it too. One of my brothers can't even hear the title without going berserk, because he really likes the Centipede. I like it becuase Jack Skellington (The hero from \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\") makes a cool cameo appearance in it. It doesn't surprise me. Tim Burton was one of the producers. Anyway, it is a cute story and has something evryone in the family can enjoy. \\"James\\" is also very detailed. Inside the peach, you can recognize everday items that are literally larger than life, like a spool of thread and a seed packet. The only reason I give four stars is because it isn't as detailed as it should be, and the animation could use a little bit of improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than A Bug's Life","review":"That's right, better than A Bug's Life. Certainly a heck of a lot better than Antz. It's been a while since I've seen this so I can't really give more of a critique than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burton-esque fun","review":"James and the Giant Peach is a fun musical in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Corpse Bride. Director Henry Selick has worked with Burton in the past and the influence goes both ways, so we can't say who influenced whom.Dark in places and frivolous in others, it's a nice film for the pre-teen set (although I must admit to watching it more than my kid)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the HD?","review":"Amazon, please stop marking movies as HD that are no where near HD quality only to get more money out of us. I know that this is becoming common practice with old movies that are sold on Blu-ray, but because there is so little information about the movie when you rent or buy it through the Amazon Instant Video player on the Playstation3, it is hard to make an informed decision without taking the time to do some research online first.For the movie itself, my son did not like it and told me to turn it off 30 minutes into it.

Each character is unique, like none I've seen before in other animated flicks. Not only the characters, but how they are dressed. (i.e. long gloves and stockings on a spider). The aunts in here are a real hoot to look at, particularly the one with the pronounced teeth.The storyline is simple and there is absolutely nothing offensive. The only warning I would give is there is a bit too much violence for very small kids and the ending is a bit silly for adults.This is a musical, and the songs are nothing special. There are not a lot of them: five to be exact. In all, good entertainment and a good visual and audio film for a nice DVD system.

It made my son cry to think any 'aunts' would treat a child so terribly - let alone killing off the parents in the first scene. Not a movie for small kids.

Godzilla vs. the Alien Invasion is about Godzilla coming out of Lake Michigan and fighting some aliens and these type of \\"slimy\\" monsters. I liked these stories very much.

Some were ridiculous, many required using a workbook. Then I stumbled on the Pimsleur program, which is totally audio, allowing me to learn Italian while I drove to and from work. Due to the pedagogically- sound method Pimsleur developed for language learning, I actually did learn some basic Italian. As a result I bought \\"Conversational Italian.\\" Though I've never considered myself adept at language-learning, I actually felt confident in my ablility to learn Italian as a result of these CDs.

It took me a while to figure this out. Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great System","review":"This language learning system is excellent. New words are introduced gradually, with clarity and with much repetition. Most of what you'd expect to use commonly is covered, like \\"where, what, and when\\". I was left feeling as though I learned all the material presented, although I did replay all the CDs at least twice. On the downside, after completing the program, I was left feeling as though there was a lot left to learn...but that is to be expected from only 16 hours of instruction.Something that I found helpful was to stop the tape when I could not visualize the spelling of a word after hearing it a few times. I'd look the word up by Googling (eg: \\"Italian word for drink\\"). It's much easier for me to say a word if I know how it \\"looks\\".

The only reason I play is to take pictures of the teenagers and make the neighborhood story title be \\"Not Another Teen Model\\" where there are pics of all the teenagers in the story.So if you bought this item, I have something to ask: HOW COULD YOU?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with current sim2 installs","review":"I saw this at walmart last night and picked it up thinking it was a new special addon package but it turns not its not at all compatible with current sims2 installs and keeps asking to \\"insert sims2 disk #1\\" over and over.While the package does mention Sims2 is part of the package, no where does it say that its not compatible with current Sims2 installs and it does not have any options to just install the holiday stuff without loading in the whole game again.You can get just the holiday addons on the Sims2 website for $14.95. Don't waste your money if you already own the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you ALREADY have the Sims 2!!!!","review":"We got this thinking it was an expansion with new items and abilities to celebrate holidays. Nope, it's the FULL Sims 2 game (at full game price, too) and some items. If you already have the Sims 2, DO NOT BUY THIS. You will screw up your current install and just be buying the game twice.

Even though it looks different, all it is intended to be is the same, basic Sims 2 game (the first one that came out). It has a few items in it that sims can purchase that aren't in the regular Sims 2 program, like some holiday decorations, but it is still only the original Sims 2 game, repackaged. If you already have the Sims 2 game, the number of items involved probably won't be enough to make it worth buying a second copy of the game.On the other hand, if you don't have the Sims 2 original game, then this is a good buy. Sims 2 has great graphics and is fun even for adults (I'm a 39 year old female and I enjoy it). It can, however, run sort of slowly at times - and causes my system to crash occasionally. But it's worth it. Just make sure you have the minimum system requirements and then some before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUTE!","review":"So many cute holiday stuff on this!!

First, I hadda uninstall all 12 of the expansion packs to put in this game (which I understand why). So I installed the game (came with four discs that I hadda add while it was downloading). So, I go to play the game all excited after reinstalling the other games, and nothing. There were no Holiday items at all. I looked everywhere. It came with no other discs. I am very upset and have no idea what to do or what happened.

For those of you who think that it's a big holiday rip-off, you're not that smart. I've gone to the store and seen the Holiday Edition sold side by side with the original Sims 2. They both sell for the same price. If you want the version with holiday items, then get the holiday edition. If for some reason you want the version without holiday items, get the original Sims 2. In the end you're only ripping yourself off if you get the regular Sims 2 when the holiday edition with some extra items is the same exact price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun in One Small Package!","review":"The Sims 2 Holiday Edition is a fantastic game. As long as you read the front, you'll notice that it is not an expansion pack. I have the Sims (1) and really liked it, but the Sims 2 is even better! There is much more to do. The holiday items help to make the game even more lively. If you have already bought the Sims 2 and would like to receive the holiday items, just go to TheSims.Com and you can get free downloads or buy all of the holiday items for around $15. This game is awesome and keeps me entertained for hours at a time. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much complaing - look at it for what it is.","review":"Let's start this review with this - This is the full edition of the Sims 2 game with some added bonus material thrown in. If you do not yet have the base game this is a great way to go!The game itself is a blast!! A great interaction between the characters and a huge leap beyond the original game but still has a bit of a nostalgic feel to it.I had been watching this game for some time - I wanted to buy the Sims 2 game, but just didn't want to spend that much for it. After watching things for a while I saw the Holiday set go on sale to a very reasonable price. I feel it was definitely worth it!So before you are thrown off by all the negative comments think about the game itself!-- This is a FULL version of the game-- You don't have to bother with downloading the extras from the internet-- It is typically priced LESS than the \\"full\\" version-- The game itself is a LOT of fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly to complain....","review":"Really, if you don't have the Sims 2 already this is a fantastic deal! But if you DO already have Sims 2 - then you can get just the holiday items from the EA website. But to slam the company just because you didn't read the fine print, no wait, LARGE print on the package, seems silly. It is not uncommon in this day and age for a company to re-release and/or bundle things together.

Embracing religion and finding meaning in his life was the greatest thing to ever happen to his craft. A smooth transition from song to song, the diversity found in each track make the listneing experience enjoyable on each turn.

AMAZING spirituallity transfused with rock AND roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too Christian for me","review":"I was--and still am--a huge Superdrag fan. John's solo album does have a hint of the flavor of Superdrag, but don't buy it because you think it picks up where Vitriol left off.

It delivered on time and was well packaged. The easel was in excellent condition. Assembly instructions have something to be desired, and I would certaining suggest that the company spend a little more time in this department. Once assembled, (took about 20 minutes), I was pleased that the easel was a solid piece of studio furniture. Mine is sitting on a heavy canvas tarp on carpet, and it is very stable on this rather springy surface. The easel design is nice allowing the canvas space to move in just about whatever angle you need to have a comfortable painting experience. I especially like that it lays flat so if I wanted to, I could use it as a table when sketching my work onto canvas. This is the perfect easel for the space I have it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't connect to the computer","review":"I have started using the 201 to track both my bike riding and walking. However, I can't get it to be recognized by the computer to use the tracking software. Garmin so far has not been able to help, another phone call to customer service is in the future. I really am satisfied with products that operate as they are advertised - I do not like to drag satisfaction out of a company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runners best friend - Forerunner 201","review":"This is the second Forerunner 201 I have purchased and have been delighted with them both. As a keen but amateur runner the precision measuring of the distance of my running routes off road and in inaccessible places is superb. I use it in the British Virgin Islands in the hills and island pathways and the GPS never fails me. It's a terrific running partner and motivation tool. My only annoyance is it not having a USB link to my computer. The serial port connection cable is not user friendly to many new laptops and so I cannot use it to it's fullest extent. I think it's great value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for training","review":"It is true that it does not work great near skyscrapers. Other then that, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot cheaper than a treadmill ...","review":"If you are one of those people that gets bored running on a treadmill all of the time, the Forerunner is for you. I used to run on a treadmill simply because it tells you how fast, how far you have gone, and how many calories you have burned. Not only does this Forerunner give you this information--on a large, easy to read while running display--but it tracks your progress and provides a training partner for you (something a treadmill doesn't offer). In addition, the Forerunner doesn't regulate your pace like a treadmill. This forces the runner to watch their own pace, allowing them to learn what a particular pace feels like -- an essential skill for anybody who runs in races. A must have for anyone - whether you're just tyring to get in shape or are a serious runner gearing up for a race. The one drawback, however, is that this version of the forerunner doesn't monitor your heart rate. If this is an option that you require, check out the Forerunner 300 series."},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS Signal","review":"Don't normally post reviews, but would like to save anyone who purchases this the time/money that I lost out on. If you live in Chicago area and run along the lake...have fun trying to connect to the GPS satellite. I purchased the 201 and it NEVER calibrated,finally gave me the message \\"weak satellite signal\\". A friend purchased the 301 and while it did calibrate when in the suburbs, it could not pick up a signal running on the lake as well. After reading others reviews, I don't doubt people have postitive experinces. However we both returned ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Watch for Reasonable Price","review":"This is a great watch for stepping up your training regimen. It can sometimes be a little off in calculating pace and distance - but not that much. It has a bad rap for not holding a GPS signal, but I haven't lost a signal yet (having run over 60 miles last month with it).If your'e looking for something with uncanny accuracy, this might not be the best watch for you. (I run a set course, and the watch will record the distance in a range of 5.5 - 5.95 miles - even though I'm running the exact same route). Also, the auto pause feature can be a bit tricky as it will keep timing after you have stopped or not start right away after you start running again.Overall, though, I'm glad I've got it, and it's helping me get faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brittle and not waterproof","review":"I went through three of these units--one was replaced after about 3 hours on the phone with technical assistance. That one broke shortly after warantee. On a Sunday day condensation appeared beneath the screen and hours later the screen went dead. The new one suffered the the same fate after a rainy day. They're supposed to be waterproof to 10m. A third was gifted to me and now that I'm two months past warantee it won't charge. In all don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only useful in Nebraska","review":"I was very excited when I first heard of this product. But after several workouts, I am only frustrated. The unit loses GPS signal too often, even in moderately open areas. If you live in the Northwest or workout in an urban area, forget this GPS. Your distances will never match, your pace is not accurate so why would you use this? I am very upset that such a product could ever be advertised this way. I have never been more unsatisified buying a product than I have with the Forerunner. If you live in a midwest rural area you will probably have no problems, but other than that, just stick with your stopwatch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The item does not work","review":"I am very dissatisfied with the Forerunner 201 from Garmin. Since I turned it on the device never worked the way it supposed to. I am returning the unit to a representative in Miami to check it, meanwhile, I am very unhappy with the unit especially because I live outside the US and it is very difficult sending back the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"For old computers only","review":"I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer. Since most new computers use USB for serial interface, the usefulness of this unit is limited. My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product.I would not have bought it had I known this. I have not used the GPS since I bought it. It will probably be tossed out.The serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package. So you don't see it prior to opening the package. Once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned.Lastly, this is one of the worst packaging jobs I have seen. The plastic clamshell is so hard to open that I think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors. The cut plastic is also dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful\`","review":"I bought as a birthday present for my husband, product did not hold a charge, you finally sent me a return label, but I have yet to rec a refund, which I was told I would get.I am very unhappy about how amazon has treated this situation.Please refund me as soon as possible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This watch never seemed to locate its location.

I have used it about a dozen times with worthless results. It only registered accurately on one run and that was when I altered my course to run in the open (in the hot sun). It is very easily tripped up by any shade which is where people should be running. Hopefully, this will improve when the leaves fall.Also, I was disappointed by the computer interface which only works with a COM port. These have been obsolete for years and an adapter to a USB port is quite pricey. Garmin shouldn't be selling obsolete technology. Even my older computer bought four years ago doesn't have a COM port.If you are interested in buying one of these, I would suggest you find somebody in your area who uses one to see if ir works with your local topography. If you like running in the woods, forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The thing quit after 3 months and customer service stinks","review":"Worked fine, as advertised, for 3 months. Then it quit cold, dead, no screen response despite thorough charging. Everything was fine up to the time I tried to get through to Garmin Customer Service. First I tried their website, left a message asking for a Return Authorization number. Got no response from that. Then I called their customer service number (800-800-1020) on a Monday morning and got a message, \\"Unfortunately due to the high volume of calls the wait time is over 30 minutes and blah blah blah and we're going to hang up on you now call back some other time.\\" They even had the gall to say, \\"The best time to call is in the morning.\\" IT WAS MORNING.The thing says it comes with a 1 year warranty. Don't believe it. As far as I'm concerned it has zero warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the extended warranty","review":"However much this device has to recommend it, it has a fatal flaw. Sweat corrodes the tiny connections through which the device recharges and downloads its data. This rot advances over some 6 months after which it becomes a paperweight.Otherwise, this is a fine runners tool, except:- it does not work under trees, period.- the free software is minimalist with no analysis whatsoever.Garmin, PLEASE fit decent connections, and put your software on sourceforge.net, where hordes of programmers will quickly add killer analysis features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate in the flatlands in N. Ohio","review":"I have had the Garmin 201 for nearly 2 months and have found it to be an excellent training aid. Most of my training takes place in the flat farmlands of Northern Ohio and I have found the distance measurements accurate in comparison to other methods of measurement (e.g. car and bike odometers). Over the course of a workout the \\"average\\" pace and distance seem to be spot on in the open farmland. I have observed erratic behavior of the \\"current\\" pace during the course of a run sometimes showing that I am running much quicker or slower than I believe is correct even though I have not perceived a change in pace. I have experienced lost signals in the county parks that line the nearby river valleys. My first 5k race on flat ground registered 3.11 miles whereas a trail half marathon (13.1 miles) in a river valley registerd about 12.5 miles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Review of Forerunner 201","review":"Had this thing now since January. I love it! But had a problem with it last month when all of a sudden it started to turn itself on and off, the buttons wouldn't work. I emailed garmin, they emailed back fast and said to send it with an RMA number. I sent it (cost ten bucks) and they quickly replaced it with another. I was impressed that garmin acted really fast with a product, I hope, I won't have any problems with.Anyway, I live in San Francisco California and the product works great as long as you aren't in the downtown area where the tall skyscrapers are but works anywhere else as long as you aren't too close to buildings 3 stories or higher.The product does it all. I like to wear it driving. I can see how far I've gone. Works great in the car even with windows up on my left wrist.Anyway, I think this is a smart product and I highly recommend it to anyone who jogs, runs, or hikes. Kudos to Garmin for quick action on a defective product and replacing it so quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't run without my Garmin!!!","review":"I purchased the 201 for a friend who is a big time marathon runner and she can't run without it now. I purchased the 301 for myself and love it. The only difference is the heart rate monitor which I never use anyways. There are only 2 draw backs... if you are running in an area with a lot of trees the monitor will loose its satalite signal or if you run by huge grain elevators!!! The other draw back is when you are running with a group sometimes you pick up other peoples heart rates or at times it will even go back or skip ahead a 10th of a mile or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Garmin is SERIOUS!!!","review":"As a distance runner, it is very helpful while training. It tells me the distance I've ran as well as the time by minutes and seconds. It's got the backlight for hours of darkness and is very easy to read while running. I really have nothing bad to say about this product. I would recommend this for anyone who is serious about fitness.

This only happens every once in a awhile though, usually its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I was really excited about the features that this product has. I was training for a half-marathon, and was really looking forward to the training buddy feature. But when I tried to use it, it never found the satelite signal. We live in an area where there are lots of trees. I went down to the beach where it was a little more open, but it still wouldn't pick up a signal. No matter where I tried, there was no signal. So I wasn't even able to test it to see if it worked, or if it was what I really needed for training. I still like the idea, and maybe when we move to some place with less trees, I might try buying it again. So for anyone who lives in a wooded area, it's probably not for you. If you don't, then it's probably great."},{"rating":"2","title":"garmin forerunner 201","review":"I definitely recommmend this as great training device for anyone who wants to track distance, time and calories expended.

I use it for walking and hiking. It has consistently worked well although it took a little time to get use to the settings. I think the calorie estimate is high but that only makes you feel better about your work out. While the mapping feature is primitive, it is fun and it will get you back home. I don't think you can go wrong with this gps. My understanding is that the higher priced model offers no real benefit unless you fell the need for the heart rate monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for traveling runners","review":"For a runner who travels thru the Americas, this is paradise found.

No issue getting satellite signals in New York, Buenos Aires or Rio, great!Cheers for Garmin, what a nice way of helping runners on-the-go."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Measurement Device","review":"After decades of trying to measure exact running distances with pedometers and my car's odometer,Garmin has solved my problems and doubts with their amazing instrument.I have been an owner for only a few week and have barely used its vast array of features but I am already totally sold on its performance and the opportunities it provides.For basic information it is very easy to operate.After initial battery charging, turn it on outside and let it find the satellites.Push start at the beginning of your run and stop(the same button) at the end.I plan to buy two more for our daughters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"garmin forerunner 201","review":"The Garmin Forerunner 201 has already improved running for me, not only do I know how far I have ran, I know how fast I have been running, and even have reference points for where I have been. The unit itself is lightweight, easy to use, waterproof, and has a rechargeable battery. The charger itself is all too easy to use and has an adapter for 110-240v outlets, the plug can also be changed on the charger to fit a variety of outlet types. The screen is farely large and the numbers are easy to read, the button layout is simple and if you just want it to time your run its a two button affair. All in all a very good buy it will improve your runs especially if you like to try new places."},{"rating":"2","title":"run","review":"I like it as a running buddy, but they tend to only last about a year or two! The buttons will stop working there for needing replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running","review":"I bought this watch to help train for a marathon, and it has proven indispensable. I was afraid it was too bulky or akward to wear while running but in fact it is lightweight and hardly noticeable. The variety of training assistant features help spice up an otherwise boring training run and the distance readings are reasonably accurate. Once the watch picks up the GPS signal it rarely loses it unless you are in a shaded area, so if you run under treecover I wouldn't recommend this product. My only complaint is that the instantaneous pace calculation is not very accurate at all (it can vary by 1 to 2 min./mi. in a few seconds!) even when I set the averaging to the smoothest possible. All in all however this is a great product and well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"When I first heard about this product I was thrilled. The Forerunner promises the ability to help navigate through trails, maintaining accurate distance and speed, but it seems that if I run under 2 trees in a row I lose reception inmediately. I am in the military and I own various GPS systems so I can definetely appreciate the value of these devices. Unfortunally the Forerunner did not live up to its promises, and now Ive wasted valuable money on a bad piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 18 months","review":"I've had one for some 18 months. It has great functions, although I didn't try the Virtual Partner - I don't believe that will work well because it loses GPS signal too often. And I jog in a park! Someone jogging around tall buildings will probably have more trouble. BUT, after some 18 months of not very intensive use (I usually jog outdoors only twice a week, since it rains a lot where I live), the unit went hayware. It started turning itself on and off repeatedly. It started in the middle of a night, waking me up with its beeps and only stopped when it ran its battery out. I emailed Garmin about this - no answer. Then I tried calling then up, but \\"all our representatives are busy, expect to wait for 15 to 20 minutes\\" and the international call would fall before that. Disgusted, I threw it away and plan to try some other brand. If you think that something that costs around 150 bucks should last only 18 months, go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Garmin Forerunner GPS receiver","review":"I have owned one of these units for several weeks, and have used it about 10 times for determining distances while running. I am very disappointed.It does have a good clock, but the distance measuring function (GPS) and the derived pace information is just not accurate. The accuracy is far worse than the spec.The problem seems to be one of inadequate receiver sensitivity. It gets lost quite easily, and as a consequence tends to read high, indicating that you have travelled farther than you actually have. For example, a run over a 6 mile course measured with a wheel came out to be 6.4 miles on the Forerunner. Not what I should expect. On a clear day on the beach it works sometimes, but under clouds, in the woods, in the city, or in weather, it is quite useless.It also does not work in a crowd of sweaty bodies, as at the starting line of a road race.Save your money.J R Rudert"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work - don't believe the hype","review":"It just doesn't work. Simple as that. It loses satellite signal more than 50% of the time. I tried it in a residential area with a few trees in Los Angeles, and it couldn't keep the signal. I even tried running down the middle of the street - no overhead trees - and still didn't work.Interestingly, I read all the positive reviews before I bought it here. Today after I shipped it back to Amazon, I found another page with the same product that has 7 reviews compared to the over 100 here. Guess what? The 7 reviews over there are all very negative. That's my 2 cents - I really wanted it to work, but it just doesn't. In my web research it seems like the only alternative is the Timex GPS unit, but that seems to have the same problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"the purchase was a mistake","review":"I bought the Garmin Forerunner 201 thinking that I could use it in the UK .

It's supposed to find the satellites in 15-30 minutes; after 2 hourss, nothing. The unit had completely locked up; it would not respond to any of the buttons. It would not turn off, or reset, or do anything.I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for walking and hiking, too!","review":"Wow! I think I said that word probably 20 times during my first hike with my new Forerunner 201. For those of you that do not run, this nifty unit works absolutely fine for walking or blazing down the trail at your local park. It is lightweight and the wrist strap is easy to fasten to your arm. The host of features and the customization available will ensure that you're seeing the data that interests you most. This device will make you want to exercise and improve your health because it records details of each walk and enables you to track your progress. Initial signal capture takes awhile so be patient. On our recent hike, the unit never lost a signal and did an impressive job of charting our progress along the trail. There's also a safety aspect to having the ability to \\"go back\\" to the start of your walk/hike or to any designated waypoint you've created. I highly recommend this innovative product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied with Garmin","review":"I'm a novice racewalker training for my first marathon in September. The Garmin Forerunner has been a great help with my short/long distances training.POSTIVES: Adjustable strap (have small wrist); easy to navigate through menu modes; backlight; LCD display easy to read for quick glance; training assistant-virtual partner, pace/speed alert,time/distance alert, history, custom page. Applied for Amazon credit card and received $30 off the price.NEGATIVE: My device charges only up to 14 hours instead of the 15 hours as stated in the manual. But 14 hours is still alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inaccurate when running on a track","review":"Overall, I like the Forerunner 201. The display is large enough and it monitors/calculates all the data I would want to keep track of in my training. I have yet to try the computer download of the data.I noticed that the accuracy is not very good when running on a track (400 m per lap). When mapping the run, the route is all over the place (while the laps should be plotted on top of each other). Upon looking it up in the manual, I found that the position error of the GPS signal is less than 15 m (contrary to less than 1 m as the sales rep who sold the unit to me at the 2004 NYC Marathon Exposition had told me). That of course explains why it is not really suitable for monitoring the training on a track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chad","review":"I purchased this product over a year ago, and have found it to be very good. I use the \\"real time\\" pace quite often while I run and have found it to be quite accurate and reliable most of the time. I also like the way that you can download directly to the software and manage your run data, as I am a data junkie. This maintains your running log without the hassle having to manually write things down. The only complaint I have, and it is relatively minor, but it does take a significant amount of time to initially lock on to satellites some days. Once locked on, however, I have found it to maintain that lock fairly well, although I typically run in areas where I have a pretty clear view of the sky. I would recommend this product to anybody who does not want to make the jump to the more expensive Forerunner 205."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Forerunner 201 Review","review":"Compared to a pedometer the Garmin 201 is my preference. However, I question the accuracy of my running distances compared to the GPS results. I run the same quarter mile course everyday, 5 days a week and after 1 mile (4 laps) my GPS makes me suspect its accuracy is inconsistent because mile 2 is shorter than mile 1 and by the time I've covered 4 miles I've run 15 laps instead of 16. Being a cross country coach for 20 years, I've measured and remeasured courses using a measuring wheel. I have measured & remeasured my laps with the wheel over the years and I stand by the wheel results--16 laps equals 4 miles.I also use the GPS for determining the miles we walk in a walking class I teach at San Diego City Community College. I question the accuracy of the miles we cover since we do walk downtown (tall buildings)and through Balboa Park (lots of trees)which causes an occasional weak signal.Overall, the GPS does do better than a pedometer which grossly underestimates mileage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small problems","review":"Two complaints about the unit I own:First, battery life is very short. When the unit says 10-11 hours of charge left, it needs to be recharged. I can onlt get three runs in on a charge. Second, the unit sometimes freezes up when acquiring the GPS signal. There is no way to turn it off or re-set it when this happens, so you just have to let the battery drain down all the way (which doesn't take long), and recharge it. Accuracy is good, probably +/- 5%. Other products (eg. FitSense) seem more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power in a Small Package","review":"The only drawback I found with the Forerunner is that it is a little bulky to wear on the wrist. It comes packed with so many great features that one will quickly overlook the inconvenience of the size. I attach it to my inline skates and I can tell how far, how long, how fast and where I have been.I found it great to calibrate the speedometer of my car as well as determining the average MPH and the distance to and from a location. It has a memory (5000 laps)and history log that far exceeds any needs you will ever have.I promise you will never get lost using the navigation system.I saw the same device on sale at Target Stores for $149. A bargain here when I bought it for $99 and well worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent functionality, but can't download","review":"I love this thing. I've been using it for several months have no complaints about the unit.I am having a problem transferring data to/from my toshiba laptop (garmin released a firmware update in Jan04).Garmin tech help shrugged their shoulders and said it is a toshiba problem.

This GPS is just not ready for primetime; at least not within urban environments ( though one would have thought that nyc's Central Park might have provided sufficient open sitelines it apparently does not.) Wish the product specs did not overhype the product so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After updating the software to the most current version I am still not getting accurate information. My Forerunner is losing signal when others that I run with are not. When the signal does come back the distance is way off, I mean WAY OFF, say 42 miles one time and 5 or six most times. I have talked to the tech support and will end up sending this unit back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless device","review":"This device is not accurate. If you want inaccurate times and distances, go ahead and buy this. If you want to try to keep up with how fast you are running a distance, you can not depend on this device. The first day I used the device I was running on a track so I know exactly how far I went. I ran 3.5 miles. The device indicated I ran 3.83 miles. I contacted Garmin and received some suggestions, but it did not get much better. The device works better running on the road as compared to the track, but on a three to four mile run on the road, it can still be off .1 to .2, maybe more. This may be the best a GPS can do, but to me, this is not very accurate and does not give one an accurate record of time and distance. Just my viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after one day","review":"My Garmin Forerunner lasted one day before it stopped working. Now I have to go to the post office and pay to have it shipped back to Garmin, and wait to have them either repair or replace it. Next time I need to purchase an electronics item I'll go to a regular store where I can easily and immediately exchange a defective unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work very well","review":"Trust me, do not waste your money on this technology. I've been running for over 20 years, all distance, so I have a fair idea of pace.The Gramin would bounce all over the place with pace speed. I want to be able to look down, see my pace and keep going. Whether in open areas or slight tree coverage, data wasn't reliable. We'd be running at about a 8 minute pace, I'd look down and see 8:45, minute later, it was 8:15, then 8.Did not get to the track to play with as we running early AM and it's dark. I got the unit for $99.00 which is a great price, but sent it back three weeks later.I'll wait another year or so until they refine the technology. I do have a standard GPS which works OK, but arm mount units just aren't reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot go without","review":"Since I purchased the Foresunner 201 I cannot run or bike without. It works perfectly, it is very simple to use and it makes my training much more enjoyable. It would have been nice if both the pace (run) and the speed (bike) could be monitored at the same time. But unless you run duathlons like me, it is a minor problem. The battery life is amazingly long. I highly recommend this product and the bike mount accessory. You do not need to buy any (extra) charger as it obviously comes with it.The connection with the computer is a bit outdated and probably you can use it with a laptop, for example. But it works with any PC desktops."},{"rating":"2","title":"grrreat","review":"Great for tracking times and distances...great training tool...not completley accurate, but I would still recommend this over a pedomiter or even stopwatch unless you have a marked track or course to run on every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tool for running/biking/hiking","review":"I bought this piece a month ago and I am very happy happy with the performance.

Unfortunately, it really is unusable due to is poor satellite tracking. I run the same routes I've run with the Timex system, and the Forerunner consistently loses satellites, and that throws the whole pace and distance thing off. I'm not running in the forest either, just some parks with light to medium tree cover. I sent Garmin an e-mail about this, hoping they were planning on releasing some patch to fix it, and I got the form letter back about how GPS works (and I did already know what ephemeral data is). I do like the form factor (but I think its placement on the wrist contributes to the poor tracking), and the interface is far superior to the Timex's. But unless you run in a desert, I think this fails in its primary purpose: to give you accurate speed and distance feedback. Stick with the Timex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't trust Amazon anymore","review":"I am very disappointed Amazon's product service.

For all of them I got pretty inaccurate results (at least 10% off for long runs, and wildly off for short ones). Now why have I used it only 12 times in six months? Well, rather than giving up, I sent it back to repair now twice. Garmin certainly takes its time sending it back to me. I sent it last about two months ago, and I haven't got the unit back yet. If you want to talk at anyone at Garmin, good luck! Whenever I tried to call technical service, they announced that I would have to wait for at least twenty minutes on the line.Just as a comparison, my $25 pedometer has been more accurate in every single run."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it a lot!","review":"I have enjoy using this item. It has help me to train better and to determine how hard I should push myself for race day. I am still learning about the 'Navigation' feature since you learn as you use it.

I'm not sure why they don't ship it with a USB adapter already.=================UPDATE: 7-2006Had this for almost a year. Holding up OK. The gold connectors are corroding, so I have to jiggle it around the cradle to get the connection. It has only froze once on me, and basically you have to let the battery go dead, then recharge it.

Mad Season pop-trash music you made. Instead of growing as an artist, you fell backwards, way backwards.

Their debut album is much better. This cd contains slow songs that has no catchy rhythms or beats. Usually, it takes a couple of times to listen to a cd in order to like it, but I still don't like it very much. However, this cd is not a total disappointment. It has some decent songs like, \\"Angry\\", \\"Black And White People\\", and \\"Bent\\". Also on this cd, the kinds of instruments they use sound different.

Rob Thomas sounded quite seasoned as a songwriter and vocalist without sounding too commercialized. It seemed I grew to love every song on that debut overnight and it kept me wanting more. The Santana/Rob Thomas cut, \\"Smooth,\\" became a huge hit and I carefully questioned whether if it would have been as big if it didn't feature Rob on vocals (even though he wrote it withoout knowing he would be asked to sing it as well). This latest release from Rob and company has confirmed that they are much more than a \\"one hit wonder\\" that is soon forgotten. The songs are strongly written and soulfully performed; I especially like the title cut, \\"Mad Season,\\" \\"Stop,\\" and \\"Crutch,\\" all singles, I'm sure. I highly recommend this album as a necessary addition to any respectable music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matchbox Madness","review":"I really enjoyed the latest CD from Matchbox 20. I bought it for \\"If Your Gone\\", and was quite pleased with the entire album. \\"Angry\\" is a good start, and then of course there is \\"Mad Season\\" and \\"Bent\\", both of which are worth your time. I really like \\"Bed of Lies\\" and my personal favorite (aside from maybe \\"If your gone\\", which I liked enough to buy the album) is \\"Rest Stop\\". Great song. I liked \\"Yourself of Someone Like You\\", but in my opinion this is the better CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"I had put this CD on my Wish List after I heard \\"Bent\\" and really liked it. Well, I probably would have bought this CD for just that song if I hadn't gotten it as a present, but as it turns out the whole CD is made up of 13 songs of the same good quality. My favourites are \\"Bent\\" and \\"Crutch\\". The reason that I like it so much is that no two songs are extremely alike. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a good hour of music that you can listen to over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a while, but","review":"Upon first listen I didn't really care for this CD a great deal. If you're expecting a CD like their debut, you may be a little disappointed. However, I believe by the 5th listen through you'll enjoy this CD greatly. Anymore it seems to be Rob Thomas and Matchbox 20, but they do sound more mature in their approach to their music on this effort. My faves include: If You're Gone, The Burn, Bent, Bed of Lies, and Leave among others. All the songs seem to come from the heart. It's worth you're $12-$15!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"I want to begin by saying that I hated Matchbox Twenty's first album. It just didn't strike any chords with me so to speak. That said, I was leary of buying the new album based solely on the one song that I had heard (ie \\"Bent\\"). I loved this particular song, but wasn't sure how I would feel about the rest of the album. I bought the cd anyway, and I am NOT disappointed. I have completely fallen for this album, and it will be permanently placed among my most listened to cd's. The album starts a bit slow, but by track number 5 things really pick up and the album is one hit after another at that point. My favorites are, If You're Gone, Mad Season, The Burn, Bent, Leave and Stop. You can not go wrong with buying this cd, I guarantee there will be at least two songs that will touch you and catch your mind as well as your ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying hour of rock 'n roll","review":"I could name many other twenty-first century bands who deliver straight-forward rock songs and ballads with a lot of harmonies and some catchy lyrics. But none of those other bands have the amazing Rob Thomas as their lead singer and main songwriter. Thomas is a major talent, and he surrounded himself with band-mates that fit his style perfectly. This album provides an hour of satisfying rock 'n roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Music","review":"I have to say that I just LOVED this CD. I just happen to come across my sons YOSLY. I started listening and instantly became one of Matchbox twentys newest fan. I could not wait for Mad Season to come out and again I just LOVED it. The music is great and Rob's voice is outstanding. It is the only two CD's I have listened to in my car driving the kids around and the kids don't mind. I hope that they put another one out real soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matchbox Twenty gets it right the second time around","review":"After hearing much of Matchbox 20's first album on the radio and never buying it because it was too poppy, I was not anticipating the bands sophomore release. Though after hearing \\"Bent,\\" the first release off Mad Season, on the radio, I decided to give it a chance. For most good musicians, one album never sounds too much like another. I was hoping that would hold true for the band with the newly motified name, matchbox twenty. Though still sounding a little like a pop album, Rob Thomas, the bands main song writer, took some advanced leaps by blending the bands original sound with its new complex styles. Orchestrations by Matt Serletic also lended to the albums pleasing sound. For all Matchbox Twenty fans, as well as all music lover, I suggest this album become part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"MB20 Rules Dudes","review":"Hey, I like Matchbox 20 and I just wanted to tell you that. Uh, there new album, mad season, is so cool, I can't wait to hear it. You know, that the actually cd cover is neat too. It isn't a regualar hard plastic box, it is a type of soft cardboard covering, that is kinda shaped like a book, kinda neat, huh? I wish that they would have released more songs from the CD so, that I could know how good it is. I'm going to buy it this weekend, which will rock! Uh, then I guess I'll tell you guys stuff, mmm, k."},{"rating":"1","title":"snorrrrreee....not worth the plastic","review":"I am a pretty big fan of thier first album so I pre ordered this one. I am terribly diasappointed. This albums lacks any shred of the truth and intensity as thier first. The songs are now cluttered with studio work and backround noise. Ive heard more heartfelt songs from the backstreet boys. There is no real harmony to any of the songs.I gave it two stars because of the work the marketing team put in to book/cd case. Off to the used CD store it goes....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I bought \\"Mad Season\\" the morning that it was released and have listened to it ever since then. I have really enjoyed this CD. Every song is memorable and well done. If you like their first CD or you are a new fan, you won't be disappointed with \\"Mad Season\\". There is a good mix of ballads and rock songs. I think \\"If Your Gone\\" will be a big hit and also \\"Angry\\". If your not sure, buy the CD, listen a few times, and you too will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"truely a Mad Season- an angry, personal expression","review":"Both rocking drives and easy ballads are here, but the overall tone is a bitter, angry, hurtful and confused breakup. Hearing Rob's happier, more hopeful songs a few years later makes it all okay... we all get over it, time makes it better, and we move on. We just don't all have the eloquence to express it the way Mad Season does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matchbox 20 at their best","review":"This is simply the bands top point of success as well as quality recalls. Buy this record, it's something you wont regret, very powerful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"If you like matchbox 20's other stuff or Rob Thomas, you'll love this! Its a really great CD. It has a little of everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mix of good and okay.","review":"The first time I heard this album, I was disappointed. I loved the songs \\"Angry\\", \\"If You're Gone\\", and \\"Bent\\" beforehand, but the others just didn't appeal to me right away.Eventually, though, I grew fond of \\"Black and White People\\" (which has since been upped to my second favorite song of the album), \\"Crutch\\", and \\"Mad Season\\".The lyrics are usually pretty amazing. I love \\"Angry\\", because it's so... me! =D But that's beside the point. \\"Black and White People\\" also has some pretty good lyrics.The music sometimes is less that appealing, so this album is about fifty fifty. But listen to it more than once, for some of the tracks take a bit of time to warm up to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is the best CD I have bought in quite some time. I keep listening to this one over and over. There is only one bad song on here and it is the filler, Stop. The other songs are awesome and they are really catchy, I don't skip over any of them. Although I like all of them, my favorites are Angry, Black and White People, Crutch, Last Beautiful Girl, If You're Gone, Mad Season(in my opinion, this is the best song on the cd, VERY catchy), Rest Stop, Bent, and Leave. As good as their last CD was, this one is even better. This one very well may end up being a classic, and it is well worth the money. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mature and beautiful","review":"This is by far the best album of 2000.This band has so much talent! This is alot darker and more complex then \\"yourself\\".Every track is great!Bed of lies,Last Beautiful girl,and Mad season are some of the highlight moments of this cd.But like I said its all good!Every f!cking song!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You've Got to be Mad to Miss this Gem","review":"Matchbox Twenty's Mad Season is one of the best of the year. The talent and range they exhibit on this album makes me think that this group will be with us for a while - thank goodness. Great piano, horns and lyrics carry Mad Season effortlessly between tracks. The first weekend I had the cd I was driving on an out of town trip and it didn't leave my cd player. The opening horn sequence in If You're Gone is absolutely beautiful. Rest Stop and Beautiful Girl are the next best two with Bent falling closely behind. Matchbox Twenty is a major talent and I can't wait to see what they come up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"They did it again!","review":"What an album! I was at the mall with a friend of mine waiting on him to finish listening to the new Kid Rock album (horrible he says) and i saw the new Matchbox Twenty album at the listening booth opposite of him. I listened to it and immediately decided to buy it. My favorite is \\"Angry\\" but the entire album is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from their first album, but better","review":"Matchbox 20 (oops, I mean Twenty) seems to have created another great album! But if you are expecting to hear the same thing that you heard in Yourself or Someone.., you are in for a surprise. The band decided to use horns throughout this CD, which grows on you after awhile and adds to the richness of the songs. You can also tell alot of production went into the album, but it isn't over-produced. All of the melodies are REALLY catchy and the guitar arrangements are awesome. I would have to say the three best songs are Angry, Last Beautiful Girl, and If You're Gone. I whole-heartedly recommend buying this album, but be prepared for a very pleasant surprise if you own their first CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"MAD\\" CD FOR MATCHBOX TWENTY","review":"I never went out and bought the first matchbox twenty CD, and now I'm starting to think that was a mistake. I actually started getting into matchbox twenty when I heard the song, \\"Bent\\". The guitar solo is just sooo awesome. Then my friend bought the mad season CD and we listened to bits and pieces of it. The last track on the album caught my attention. \\"You Won't Be Mine\\" is such a great song. I also like the instrumental version after the last track (it's a hidden track, so you may have to wait a little bit to hear it). Overall, the CD is great to listen to if you're just chillin' with friends or relaxing at home. I'm glad I bought it, and you will be too, especially if you are a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Matchbox 20's last CD \\"Yourself or Someone Like You\\" was awesome! I loved all of the songs on the CD, so I was incredibly disappointed when I got the new Mb20 CD \\"Mad Season\\". I had high expectations and the only song I really enjoyed was \\"Bent\\". All of the other tracks were hick-ish and didn't have the familiar Mb20 flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album, best of the season","review":"Perhaps my opinion is different because I never listened to the first matchbox twenty album, but \\"Mad Season\\" is incredible. Whether it's the deeply moving \\"Last Beautiful Girl\\" or the symphonic sweep of \\"You Won't Be Mine,\\" the album speaks with an emotion and a maturity unique among all the rock/pop that's out there. The lyrics are not offensive and have a poetic quality that sets them above the shallow lines which plague a lot of other music in this genre. In short, this will be an album that you will not think twice about putting on a continuous loop, if you have the time. The band deserves praise for this amazing effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's gonna be a long day for mad season","review":"This is a fantastic CD. Believe me...I'm probably the biggest matchbox twenty fan on earth, and while it varies from YOSLY it is still fabulous. The high points of this album are \\"Black and White People\\" and \\"Mad Season\\" in my opinion, because they vary from normal mb20 tunes. \\"If You're Gone\\", \\"Last Beautiful Girl\\" and \\"Stop\\" are reminiscent of YOSLY, I think. They remind me of \\"back to good\\", \\"kody\\" and \\"busted\\", respectively.All in all I think this CD is different, a blend of the band-that-was and the band-in-transition, and a good mixture it is. ~Ashleigh"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I like matchbox twenty a lot, so I was in a big hurry to buy this CD. It was good, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. Songs like \\"Bent\\" and \\"Angry\\" are among the best, but it's hard to detect any hits like on their previous CD Yourself or Someone Like You, which I think is the better of the two. This CD is still good, but having their old CD as an example of how good they are is somewhat disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh well their first album was good","review":"Just typical. A nothing band makes it big and then their follow-up album is a hyped-up commercially-dominated one made to sell more records. They have clearly lost the style that brought them out of obscurity. They are no REAL rock tracks on this record, just manufactured songs that strive to emulate their previous success. Matchbox 20 has discovered that the pop market is bigger than rock and have acted accordingly. Oh well, they had their 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up","review":"I liked Matchbox Twenty's last album (when they were called Matchbox 20 instead) because it was filled with catchy pop tunes and Rob Thomas' interesting vocal sound. While Mr. Thomas' voice remains, the catchy pop tunes are gone. It's a bland, rather lifeless collection of pop songs that try too hard to be more serious and weighty than the songs from the previous album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HyperCD format does NOT work","review":"This CD is in HyperCD format. I ordered one, returned it...ordered again and same thing! This is a decade old format and it won't run without an internet connection! defeats the purpose of getting a CD.....just trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor follow-thru after their 1st CD","review":"If you're expecting more of the riviting innovative alternative rock that you got with \\"Yourself Or Someone Like You\\", forget it. This collection of songs sounds like it was recorded in one afternoon and then mixed for 12 months. The result is a compilation of songs that sounds like the Partridge Family's second album. Some chalk this up to the band's \\"evolution\\" but it's pretty clear that little to no effort was make to produce an inspired follow-up to their debut CD. A real dissappointment from a band with so much talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's forget the whole decade quick","review":"God I hate 90's music and these guys represent everything that kept me from buying new band music in the past 10 yrs...zero technical ability, horrible vocals, pretentious lyrics... bring back the 80's quick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless","review":"If you want mindless, prefab drivel. Then by all means, buy a Matchbox 20 CD. But if you want better music than Matchbox 20, buy anything else, no matter what it is, as long as it is original. This CD is not original, not groundbreaking, not talented, not awe-inspiring, nothing more than easy to write, prefebricated, mass produced, pop music with a buffed up shine and an attractive singer. Backstreet Boys with guitars. If thats what you want, you could even do better than Matchbox 20, trust me, just keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Argh!!! What happened to them?!? 'Yourself Or Someone Like You' is,in my opinion,one of the best albums ever conceived but this one falls flat on it's face. While their debut album was full of classics this one only has two songs that warrent repeated playing - 'Bent' and 'Mad Season'. Normally when a band attempts to change it's sound they fail spectacularily and this album is no exception. The only band that has ever managed to pull this off is The Suicide Machines and possibly Green Day. I've gone off the point though....Basically you should only buy this album if you can afford to spend your money on [worthless material]."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN insult to rock music","review":"How can people like thsi band? Besides being talentless, they have the audacity to think that they are deep, intense and artistic. All the songs sound exactly the same - desperately seeking some deep meaning that they will never find. Sickening. Some people put them on level with such bands as Everclear, Bush (who, although i dislike, are talented), Hole, Smashing Pumpkins, etc. WRONG!! where these bands have talent, substance, and something to say, MB20 has nothing. Buy a good record. Buy ANYTHING. but don't support the death of rock and roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rob Thomas needs an axe buried in his face","review":"I hate this band. They were the flagship band representing what has been referred to as the \\"medio-core\\" movement... rock with no balls or brains (also see third eye blind, eve 6, marcy playground, etc.) It doesn't provoke you to think, feel, or do anything. plus, the lead singer is probably the one of the most annoying humans to watch or listen to on the face of this planet.by the way, that's a nice original album title, chumps. layne (a REAL musician from a REAL band) should come back from the grave and kick your asses."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN YOU HELP ME I'M BENT","review":"I'm so scared that i'll never be anything more than an awful singer with an even worse band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Different","review":"If you're a person who enjoyed \\"Yourself or Someone Like You\\", I wouldn't necessarly reccommend this album. Their first album was filled with many lyrical based songs that touched your emotions. The music was simple but it was lead by Thomas. In this new album, they've changed a lot. It's just not the same stuff. It's not necessarily bad, just not the Matchbox 20 that I wanted to hear based on their first album. Bottom line is this: If you liked the first album a lot, if you were really drawn to it, and you're looking for something similar, this new one isn't for you. The band style has definately changed. If you're a hard core Matchbox 20 fan, buy the cd. I'm just hoping in time that it will grow on me before I sell it, I hate to sell back a cd of a band who had such an incredible first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste and Disapointment","review":"I guess the band had nothing left after the first album, or maybe they're trying to change their style to compete with all the pop groups. Their songs are pathetic at best. It's does seem to be the perfect album for the middle-aged, though. When I was visiting my parents yesterday, they got a chance to hear it and they loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new direction, high praise","review":"The first MB20 cd was very unique, and stood out from the other bands of the time. And despite the heavy air play, \\"Smooth\\" cemented them as here to stay. With \\"mad season BY matchbox TWENTY\\" they shed the regular alt rock and take a new approach. I will keep this CD in my player for awhile, until the radios kill it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much for the \\"Sophomore Slump\\"...this album is awesome!","review":"If anyone thought Matchbox 20 (er..TWENTY...) were on the way out, think again. This album of true rock tracks, moody yet resplendently brilliant, are sure to please. After hearing this, who isn't humming \\"Last Beautiful Girl\\"? Though weaker than the first album by lack of a common theme, you'll soon disregard the obvious shortcoming of filling an album with songs that were written 8 years apart( people do age, and writing styles are different as people evolve). Still, you'll enjoy it! Rob Thomas and Co. do it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK","review":"I believe that matchbox Twenty should be grateful I give this 2 stars. I would give it one but I find their first album to be a classic, so I give them another star for having potential. Beware of this album still. Every song from the first song to the last song sounds the same. I liked about 2 songs on this album and that's it. I expected so much from this album but was disappointed to find out I bought a CD that belongs to be broken into many little pieces, and then into smaller pieces. Next time, matchbox Twenty, make a good album. This album will be collecting dust while I wait for your next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...dont waste your time...","review":"I am a pretty big fan of thier first album so I pre ordered this one.

I first heard Bent on the radio and it sounded good, so I tried to find out more about them. Soon after, I heard \\"If You're Gone\\" and it was a great song, so I decided to Buy the cd.This cd is wonderful. The instruments are awesome and the messages are inspiring and are true to life. Heartbreak, anger, fear and joy are emotions that we deal with every single day and Rob Thomas sings about this in a unique and catchy style.Some of the best songs on this cd are: Bent, If You're Gone, Bed Of Lies, Rest Stop, Angry and Black And White People. The hidden song \\"You And I And I\\" was not very good. I cannot understand why everyone else hates this cd. It is very good. Sure I listen to Staind and Korn, but I also like some lighter stuff.If you like MB 20, then you will love this cd, so go and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 x better than the last one!","review":"I liked the last matchbox twenty album (back when they were matchbox 20) pretty well. The best songs on \\"Yourself or Someone Like You\\" were the few that actually got radio play. That is the exact opposite of what happened with this album. I love every song on it and have yet to tire of playing it (usually on repeat). I do have a few favorite songs, but I have yet to skip over any of the tracks. If you were a little disappointed with the last album, give the group another try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first listen","review":"I fell in the love with this album the first time I listened to it! Their music has a comfortable familiarity to it with a mature yet modern style which makes this album desirable to any age group. The lyrics are like poetry and the music is just amazing. The music is versatile and will suit any situation as it has enough of a beat to sound lively, but it also has a mellow and relaxing tone to it. It is impossible to tire of this addictive music and you WON'T regret adding this masterpiece to your CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first one","review":"Frankly, I hadn't heard of Matchbox Twenty until I saw Santana's video featuring Rob Thomas. I then saw the video of Bent and thought, well, maybe these guys aren't too bad. Then came the clincher-If You're gone. That was it. Bought the album and a damn good buy it is too. OTher great tracks include Angry, Rest Stop, Black and White People and Crutch. Very satisfying indeed. I did buy their earlier album as a result, but I think they've progressed to a whole new dimension with this one. The first album was well, ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative and charming","review":"matchbox twenty continues to evoke the pure essence of heart. In much the same lyrical style as Ben Sullivan \\"Pardon My Mess\\", the images and feelings are laid raw with simple words. The emotions are the universal truths felt by all and too often unspoken."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great musicians and great cd","review":"I bought this cd two weeks ago, and i listen with attention, i think is a compilation of beautiful sad songs. The lead singer Rob Thomas put his heart in all songs, my favourite songs are: \\"the last beautiful girl\\", \\"if you're gone\\", \\"mad season\\", and \\"bent\\" (the video is excellent too). i hope find in the next album many strong songs like the previus album (like 3 a.m, push, etc). The strings section are clean and brillant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Question about Track 13","review":"This is an awsome CD but I have a question about \\"You Won't be Mine\\". The track is supposed to be 5:20 long, but when I play it the song ends, there's a long pause, then random music starts playing. In total my track 13 it over 9 minutes long. Does anyone know why this is? Please e-mail me at BLoveless@mediaone.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Damn good band!","review":"Their first album is absolutely awesome! \\"Mad Season\\" is a whole new listening experience but is very exciting to the ears. Have seen Matchbox 20 twice in concert and it is definitely worth the outrageous ticket price by TicketMaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album Of The Year Candidate","review":"This album is superb. I was not familiar with this group until I heard that Rob Thomas was the vocal of Santana's super hit Smooth. Although some tracks show the typical modern rock darkness, the album overall is great and full of excellent tracks. And I would recommend this album with confidence the Album Of The Year for the Grammy Award.My #1 favorite is If You Are Gone which debuted #52 in October 21 issue of Billboard Magazine. One of the reasons may be strong Japanese reaction, since Japanese radio start playing this song, the album started to sell in Japan!!Other recommendations include Bed Of Lies which will be sure to become another Top 10 hit, Last Beautiful Girl, Black And White People, Burn, Leave and a lot more. Oops, am I forgetting Bent?"},{"rating":"2","title":"exxxxcellent album","review":"not often when you get a cd when all songs are of great quality,blows me away. robs lyrics and song writing are in a caliber of its own, mb20 will be around awhile.if you dont have it get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic sophomore effort...","review":"being a huge fan of matchbox twenty, i counted down the days until i could grab this cd off the shelves. when i popped it into the cd player i have to admit that i was surprised. \\"mad season\\" is a lot more slower than their previous effort, and i liked what i heard. however, the cd needs to be put on a couple more spins before its full effect on the listener can be seen...kudos to rob thomas, a gifted songwriter and the voice is just seductive and one of a kind. adam, brian, paul and kyle, brilliant accompaniment...bent IS a great first single off the album...here's three cheers to matchbox twenty for their album...hopes they will come down to australia to tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Ever","review":"This album was a sweet surprise. Although the sound of the cd is definately matchbox twenty, the songwriting of Rob Thomas has definately matured. He is more willing to break standard pop rock formats and does surprisingly well. This album is so enjoyable that it is hard to pick out a favorite track. Best of all, there are no fillers on the album! If you enjoyed the first album, you will fall in love with this one! Rob Thomas has proven once again that he is the great lyricist of our time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awesome Package but a Madly Disenchanting Album","review":"I had the Yourself or Someone Like You Album for about 2 years before Matchbox 20 became popular. I drove my friends crazy talking about how they were so wonderful. I loved the distinct sound of Rob Thomas's lead vocals. I was thrilled to hear that Matchbox 20 was coming out with a new album and pre-ordered it a month and a half ahead of time. When I got the album I was extremely diappointed! Aside from the song \\"Bent\\", it seemed like I was listening to a different group. They have added new instruments and are much more subdued. I wish I would have waited to listen to someone else's copy of this c.d. before I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS CD!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely love this CD. Matchbox Twenty is one of my fave bands and this CD is the best. I really liked Yourself or Someone Like You, but I really love Mad Season. I love all the songs, but my faves are: Angry, Black & White People,Crutch, Last Beautiful Girl and You Won't Be Mine. Rob's voice just gets better and better and so does him and the bands songwriting. Buy it. Buy it NOW. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let-down","review":"After the unqualified success of their debut CD, this one is a huge disappointment. This collection of songs is heavily dependent on studio musicians to provide orchestra style embellishment to hollow un-original songs that the band was obviously pushed into writing and recording way before they were ready. The hidden track sounds like a high school band playing the star-wars theme in slow motion...and that's one of the better tracks. This band has obviously sold out to commercialism and doesn't care about giving their fans innovative hard-hitting alternative music that the audience can feast on....instead they revert to elevator musack with lyrics. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much happening here","review":"After a tremendous first effort \\"yourself or someone like you\\", Mad Season was quite a disappoinment! I would have thought, given the amount of time between releases, the band would have put together a decent effort. With the exception of \\"Bent\\" and \\"Rest Stop\\" the CD is musically weak! For a band that is very talented and sounds great live, Mad Season must have been a rush job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lumpy gravy?","review":"Please, please, dont'believe 'em! Believe your own ears and try it before you buy! Sorry to say after their (good, not excellent) debut album, but M20 totally lost their touch. If this is one of the best CD's of the year, as somebody says, maybe I'm Beethoven and I don't know. It's dull, repetitive, flat, borious, not one song that you can remember five minutes after playing it. You obviously can't believe me, but please at least listen to it before buying. My point of view is that it's time to end with glorifying all these second-or-third-choice groups that try to imitate the leaders."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Album That Killed This Band!!!!","review":"When the debut was out,I actually liked Matchbox 20 for a while,thought they were a decent group.The debut had good songs like 3:00 a.m. and Long Day.A friend of mine had this cd and he let me borrow it.I thank the Lord that I didn't buy it.This album is about as horrible as it gets.Every song from Matchbox 20 is nothing more than recycled garbage.Every song is either about a girl that Rob Thomas loves,or a girl that left Rob Thomas.It's so pathetic.Thanks to this cd,I found out what MB20 was all along,no good generic alternative rock music.But my best friend is a MB20 freak and buys every cd from then.He knows nothing about good music.Avoid this and please don't buy their new one either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again---PERFECTION","review":"I was not surprised when I picked up this cd and listened to it. I feel like I did 20 years ago when you knew a new album came out from a band, you bought it, no questions asked because you KNEW it was going to be good. That is how Matchbox-20 is. The band has grown in depth since their debut Cd with the songs being more mature and thought provoking. Rob Thomas has a voice that crawls into your brain and stays there. The lyric that really caught my attention was from Rest Stop... \\"Last night while you were sleeping I was listening to the radio and wondering what you're dreaming when it came to me, I didn't care...\\" I could see the guy's face as he was told this by this girl and was kicked outof her car.Once again I look forward to their next CD and will not hesitate to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT group","review":"All the songs you love just about.. Great CD . GREAT GIFT. I LOVE IT.. : ) If you getting this for someone that loves Matchbox twenty, They will thank you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"it definately does grow on you","review":"When I first got this album I wasn't particularly impressed as I found the use of horns rather offputting and reminiscent of that 80's band Chicago. I also felt that track 1 \\"Angry\\" was straying into Bon Jovi territory are derided its sound from Hey God and was rather uninspired.If you start listening to the album from track 3 onward - it feels a lot more consistent and flows a lot better. Best track on the album is \\"Last Beautiful Girl\\" - simple in arrangement but has an amazing mid-tempo swirl. Really - the finest track they ever have recorded....so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"i bought this cd because i love yourself or someone like you...after hearing bent on the radio i knew i had to get the cd...like the first one, it has taken a while to grow on me...but this cd has some amazing new things that i didn't know matchbox20 could do before...there is orchestra in a few songs and rob plays the piano in a few too...i love this cd...bent and bed of lies are my favorite so far...alot of the same great mb20 from their last cd..but also some new amazing stuff...it's worth the money...keep rockin rob!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best CD","review":"Matchbox 20 should be commended for this magnificent effort. Mad Season is the best CD I have ever listened to. Matchbox 20 truly surpasses the quality of work of their first album, Yourself or Someone Like You. These guys proved that the Sophomore jinx doesn't exist. If you don't have this CD, make sure it is one your next gift list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"matchbox 20 conquers sophomore jinx","review":"as only a moderate matchbox fan, i was somewhat skeptical upon buying this album. outside of the 4 radio hits off their first cd, i didnt find much i liked. this cd, however, is satisfying straight through. rob thomas wears his heart on his sleeve, as do most good songwriters, and this is most evident on the slower cuts such as \\"bed of lies\\", \\"you wont be mine\\", and the album's standout, the pensive \\"if you're gone\\". the album does not stray too far from the signature matchbox 20 folk/pop/rock style, and there are enough hooks on this album to firmly embed these songs into your subconscious. if youre looking for tuneful, melodic rock, mad season is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"As an absolute lover of the first album - four years later I STILL listen to it 3-4 times per week...It was filled with anticipation when I popped Mad Season into my CD player. My first reaction, to the first song Angry - was that sounds just like Dave Matthews (which is also what I thought when I first heard Smooth). But as the album progresses I discovered a great, well put-together album. The songs, as we expect from Rob Thomas, have great lyrics...profoundly deep and they make you think about your current relationship. This is just an album I highly recommend. You may not like it your first listen through, but subsequent listens will get you hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Season by Matchbox Twenty","review":"It has been a long time since I bought a cd that was worth listening all the way through, every time. This one is a real treat. There is alot of variety in the songs, slow, fast, and everything else. Just a good, straight up collection of rock. It is hard to pick a favourite song, but \\"Last Beautiful Girl\\" is very good, as is \\"Mad Season\\", \\"Bent\\" and \\"If Your Gone\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"what in the world is this?","review":"ok...im listening to this album EXPECTING to hear something like push...the great alternative sound that i heard on thier last album...and what do i hear? HOOTIE AND THE FREAKIN BLOWFISH! i mean come on! they went soft on us. the whole album is slow and soft. i was hoping for a more mature and hard rock sound from these guys..they had some promise..but if that is the way they wanna go...all power too them i guess.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Rock.","review":"This album is horribly dry, uninventive rock. I can't even pretend to like them on basis of aesthetic appeal. If you go for that sort of thing, pick it up. Otherwise, I recommend some thought provolking rock music, like Cursive's \\"Domestica.\\" Hey, they're whining, too, but at least they package it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for soccer moms","review":"Faceless, boring, nauseating, ridiculously commercial. All aptly describe this band's 2nd offering. And as if Matchbox 20 wasn't a bland enough name for a group, \\"Matchbox Twenty\\" is even worse.This is the kind of music that drivers of sport utility vehicles might listen to on the way to their corporate, suit-and-tie jobs because they find it \\"rocking\\" and \\"alternative\\". The song \\"Bent\\" serves as a perfect example of what this album is about. Its about as middle-of-the-road as you can get. Rob Thomas isn't \\"broken\\" or \\"depressed\\", he's just a little \\"bent\\" and he needs some nice caring lady to show him a little love. In the land of Matchbox 20, feeling \\"bent\\" is probably as bad as things ever get.By the way, they also released a limited edition paper-sleeve version of this album in a stap for a little credibility, so you could also look for that if this is the kind of music you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment for this Matchbox 20 fan","review":"Mad Season sounds like a rushed effort to me and a mediocre album at best. Some of the songs are good, but not great and some sound like they belong on an \\"easy listening\\" station. Even the best songs on this album aren't even close to the quality of those on their last album. It almost sounds like you are listening to songs that didn't make the cut for their first album, \\"B side\\" songs. Even their radio hit \\"Bent\\" pails in comparison to \\"3 AM\\" off their first. The entire album lacks energy and catchy tunes which their first album was so noted for. In fact, this album gets down right boring after a few listens. Rob Thomas is an excellent singer, but could not make up for this albums below-average song writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Ad Fontes (back to the sources)","review":"Matchbox Twenty's Yourself or Someone Like You was quite possibly one of the best albums ever. Many great hits such as \\"Push\\", \\"3a.m.\\", and \\"Real World\\" were greatly accepted by the radio. Other songs on the album, while not so popular, also caught the appeal of Matchbox Twenty lovers. The imagery and creative thought provoking lyrics were incredible as well as the new sound that they were played in. Things were going great for Matchbox Twenty untill they decided to change their style and go with more of a pop sound. This is where they released their sell-out album Mad Season. A few of the songs on this album were similar to the previous sound but the overall effect of the CD was not nearly as capturing as Yourself or Someone like You. I would not reccomend this to anyone who enjoyed the sound of the preceeding album. I would hope that Matchbox Twenty realizes their mistake in this new sound and goes ad fontes or back to the sources with their next album"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Buy the New Forced Sound of Matchbox20","review":"Yourself.. or someone like you was a wonderful album. So effortless, so glorious. The sound was pure. Matchbox 20 in thier new attempt, Mad Season, tried a little too hard to make this album a winner, and it shows in the music.Possibly afraid of falling victim to the sophomore jinx, you can tell Matchbox 20 tried their damndest on this album. Unfortunately it didn't work. This album is dull, boring, and lacks the luster of their previous work. The sound is forced, and very unnatural sounding.If you can bare listening to this album all the way through in its entirety without drifting off to greet Mr. Sandman, you are the clear winner in all of this.Message to Matchbox.. don't force it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Former matchbox 20 fan","review":"After a tremendous first effort \\"yourself or someone like you\\", Mad Season was quite a disappoinment! I would have thought, given the amount of time between releases, the band would have put together a decent effort. With the exception of a couple of songs such as \\"Bent\\" and \\"Rest Stop\\", the CD is musically weak and has little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"If you are expecting this CD to be anything like the first, then don't buy it, because its not even close. I too, had been waiting (and waiting) for their next CD to come out, and I am so disappointed, I wish the music style was like the last. But this one is bluesy, with all these instruments and background vocals that ruin the songs. Don't get me wrong, some songs are good, but the bottom line is that after 4 years (? ) you would think this CD would be way better! Come on Matchbox 20 you can do so much better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If Hallmark Cards Could Talk","review":"If Hallmark cards had an accompanying soundtrack to them, this is what it would sound like........ This is bland, by the numbers rock that I thought we left behind with Foriegner. But, since the record industry seems \\"Bent\\" on resurrecting NKOTB with the Backstreet Boys and such, they must have decided to continue the 80's nostalgia with the 2000 model of Survivor (the band, not the show)......Rob Thomas has a great rock voice, but until the lyrics drop the wounded soldier of love act, they will just make me want to \\"Leave\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a few songs","review":"Basically got this CD because of one song but found several others worthwihle. Besides several of these guys are from my hometown area."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is This?","review":"I was a huge Matchbox 20 fan even though I am not a fan of genre. But this CD is just too much of a change. Only one song sounds like the old. There is one good song in \\"rest stop\\" But they hardly even rock on here. This is a boring cd. I hope they do better next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"1st Impression","review":"After the first listening of matchbox twenty's new album, I must say that I'm disappointed. I was aware of the fact that the band had gone a different direction from their debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You, but Mad Season sounds like a completely different band. The horns and twangy riffs give the album a jazzy feel. The only similarities between Yourself or Someone Like You and Mad Season are Rob Thomas' voice and the song \\"Bent\\". If you are looking for an extension of matchbox twenty's debut album, save your money. If you're up for something different and have an open mind about matchbox twenty's music, grab it today. Note: will review again after several listening's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"The album is a very good album and still in Matchbox twenty's original style and sound. The limited edition version is the one to get. It has a different looking cover than the one that is not the limited edition. This one comes not in a cd case but in a book with a circle at the end to hold the cd. It has a limited edition sticker on the outside plastic wrapping and then it looks like a white little book about the size of a childrens book. It contains several color pics of the guys and the cd is at the end. It does not have any extra songs, but is the better buy since a limited edition, you get a book and lots of pics. Each song is good and some are similar to \\"push\\" and others on the original in sound and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you listen to this CD the more you will love it!","review":"I loved matchbox 20's first CD, and I went out and bought Mad Season the day it was available to the public, when I first listened to it I thought it was pretty good, a little diffrent then the first one but not in a bad way. There was songs on there that I liked right off the bat, probably because they sounded more like the stuff on the first CD (Yourself or someone like you) But the more I listened to the CD the more and more I liked the other songs and now it is one of my favorite CD's. Give it a chance, listen to it, get to know the songs and you will find that they are all really well written and sung. Its a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it is okay but,","review":"it is okay and cool but there 1st cd (yourself or someone like u )was better.if u r a mb 20 fan buy this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"My God...","review":"With out a doubt the best musical work ever made.

Richly rewarding for those willing to go the distance.If you're looking for songs to haunt you, consider yourself spooked, and rejoice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not fun at first...","review":"This album, most likely, will disappoint you. The music doesn't strike me as weird by The Residents' standards. It's almost kind of lame. It's a concept album with probably the most clear concept but the purpose is unclear. Does this album stink? NO WAY! It's a triumph! With developed songs, a great insert, and 61 minutes of music, this might be the best Residents album out there. I know it doesn't compare to older Residents albums but definately deserves as much credit as Freak Show - which is one of Their finest. VERY ESSENTIAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks the vitality of their early work","review":"Interesting idea for an album, i.e to show that the Bible isn't all love and sweetness, but that there is a huge amount of cruelty and evil and darkness in it too. The songs aren't particularly memorable though, and the silly voice thing doesn't really work with such 'serious' subject matter. The music sounds like it was written for a computer game. There are some nice instrumental tunes but they don't redeem the album. Check out their early stuff for some real wacky music, especially commercial album. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT CAN I SAY?","review":"One on their most powerfull works. What can I say? It's damn near perfect. Humouous and disturbing. Thought provoking to say the least.

This...unusual album, which, I'll admit, has decent rock and roll music and some clever refrences (the reason for my two star gift) does not even fall into the same category as the masterpiece: Andrew Lloyd Webber's/Tim Rice's JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR. The music is better in JCS, the religious messages are more accurate (the lyrics are much better), and the performance is a heck of a lot more wonderful. So for everyone who says that this album is \\"everything Superstar wanted to be\\", I gotta say, that isn't right. It really doesn't compare.Honestly, I didn't agree when certain people thought Jesus Christ Superstar was a mocking of the Holy Bible, but I can certaintly understand the arguement that this album isis. \\"Judas saves\\"????? I could hardly write that.Stick with Superstar."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album really sucks","review":"i have never ever heard so much crap pressed into one cd.

I figured for 20 bucks I would recieve a sub-par knife but boy was I wrong. The knife really is nice. The steel is Aus-8 and seems to take an edge well. I'm left handed so the reversible thumbstud was a big plus for me. The pocketclip works perfectly. Overall for the money this is a great edc knife.

Therefore I need a preamp that will boost the signal to match the loudness of my other instruments. This preamp didn't make much difference even when the input pot (on the back of the unit) was all the way to the max. If the job of this device is to merely match impedance, then maybe it's doing its job. I don't know. But if the job of this device is to boost the signal of the transducer, then it should offer a max volume setting that is too loud and we could choose a setting in between that suits us best. But at best it gives a slightly noticeable increase in volume.This is not a strong amplifier. It is merely a 2-band EQ with a slight loudness increase.

Sure enough the G-II is simple to use, little to break, and the right tool for the job. I gave it four stars out of five because it is a little bit bigger than I expected it to be. Also, the nine volt battery compartment makes it difficult to install a remove and install a battery, yet too easy to install with the poles connecting the wrong terminals.

Hester conveniently forgets a conversation which throws a different light on the investigation and pursues a line which she must know is untrue but this discrepancy is never explained. Perhaps Perry herself forgot she'd written that section or hoped the reader wouldn't notice.I felt slightly insulted by this book.

What's more, this translation truly does justice to the beauty of the original Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty and Sadness","review":"A work of utter splendor, Spring Snow is the first installment of Yukio Mishima's magnificent tetralogy.I read the 4 books as in a trance in the fleeting light of a long gone summer. And like Mishima, finishing the Sea of Fertility made me feel as if it were the end of the world.Shatteringly beautiful, lined with infinite grace, agonizingly moving, , Mishima's last work is perhaps the crowning achievement of 20th century world literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romeo and Juliet, Japanese version","review":"I really enjoyed this book, the story is the classical tragic love story, but set up in Japan, and written through a Japanese point of view. So the surroundings or the landscapes became part of the story, the description of the moods of the characters are beautifully portrayed in the nature that surrounds them.... I thought it was lovely.A lot of people wrote on these reviews that the translated version misses out a lot of things, but this always happens when translating, and as I can't read Japanese, I was happy with being able to read it in English!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and maudlin","review":"Maybe it was a bad transalation. Maybe I could not relate as a westerner to an old Japanese story, but I really did not enjoy this book. It was maudlin and unbelievable. Story was boring. Character development was terrible and it was poorly written/transalated. I recommend Murakami's Norwegian Wood for those who want to read books by Japanese authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I purchased this as 'used, hard cover' A real nice copy of this excellent Mishima book. Well packed, quick shipment, more than fair price.This is a love story with epic proportion, a story of tragic love. Spring Snow deals with romantic ideals. Kiyoaki, the main character, is proud, haughty and often childish - his life is one of privileged which is rapidly becoming more and more in question as pre WW II Japan emerges to a modern nation. The love which he works so hard to deny eventually consumes him. Along the way Kioaku tests friendships, his family, and the traditions which, in part, form him."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"I just finished this first novel in the series. This is so much more than a tragic story of star-crossed lovers. Mishima evokes an astonishingly vivid Japan of the early 20th century. I simply don't know enough about Japan's history and culture to know if the general setting is historically accurate, but if it isn't he has created a rich, complex world of great beauty tinged with sadness. This is one of those rare books where I will catch myself thinking about the characters as if they were people I know. His descriptions at times border on poetry even in translation. I think that Mishima was facinated by the idea of karma, how actions plant seeds which eventually blossum into effect. I think this accounts for having his characters almost stop the action in places to discuss Buddhist philosophy (which also lets the reader in on how the story will unfold). I am starting Runaway Horses and looking forward to meeting Kiyoaki in his next incarnation. Will he see Satoko again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"CD not as described","review":"Product described as new. It was used and the case was cracked and the front was not attached.

That notice should have been highlighted in flashing red lights. The quality of this publication is exceedingly poor.

If only one -- just one -- person had bothered to read this book after it had been produced using OCR, the copy could easily have been cleaned up. As it is, the book is practically unreadable. The transcription problems are so numerous that they completely distract from the pleasures of the actual text.

It's so hideously bad, it's perhaps the greatest movie ever made! Don't just watch it once, though. This is the kind of movie that stands up to and improves with repeated watchings. You will be consistently confounded by the narration, direction, and the non-action of this supremely bad 'film'. There is so much badness, that you miss a lot the first few times.

He begins to attack people badly as two police officers Jim Archer (Bing Safford) and Joe Dobson (Larry Aten) go after him.A really bad and senseless Sci-fi horror movie that ranks as one of the worst movies of all time even among the critics. There's no score here and this is one of those movies that doesn't need a soundtrack. But this is one of the first movies about a mutant killer as it has a similar premise to the Hulk comics only they did it better by making a mutant into a hero monster instead of a killer.

A side benefit is that we get a chance to see what 1961 cars, cloths, haircuts, and sleazy women (Lanell Cado ... Woman Strangled in Opening Scene) look like.The opening scene was tacked on at a later date. If you are lucking you can get a copy of a topless Lanell Cado.

Actually, the trailer is far superior to this dreary attempt at Z-grade science-fiction, with no synchronized dialogue but more voiceover narration than any movie in history. \\"The Beast of Yucca Flats\\" does not belong in the \\"so bad it's funny\\" category - it's just plain bad.

The entire soundtrack was either lost or never recorded so the whole thing is either narrated or voices are dubbed onto characters when their backs are to the camera (most shots of characters speaking appear to have been excised to hide the lost soundtrack so the editing is often choppy). Tor Johnson gives his most incompetent ever performance as \\"the beast\\" (an atomic blast has turned him into a lumbering killer). Several of his takes are obviously messed up - he has great difficulty getting out of an aeroplane for example - but the filmmmakers couldn't afford any re-takes. He lumbers through the desert at about 1mph waving a stick at everyone. A wrestling match he has with the police must be seen to be disbelieved. Amazing.

I have to say I was disappointed in the novel itself. I could'nt find a story to get into and there was a deal of contrivance in linking the rather disjointed episodes that make up the whole.

Each of their unique and yet interconnected stories will remind you of why you believe in good people and leave you with a sense of hope. On the contrary, it will, at times, also remind you of the ugliness that lurks in the world as well.

Either performance would have improved over the cliched yawnfest we're treated to instead.If this review seems resentful, it is.

But is has some serious problems, the most serious of which is that the character's actions do not really make sense. ... The reasons behind the character's decisions are not believable, especially when dealing with the bachelors. These characters are creating their own chaos, and to be plausible, the reader needs to buy into their reasoning. But there is too little conflict, too little soul-searching.

This book was horrible. In Haruf's attempt to emulate great novelists, he fails with intermediate and weightless prose, reminding me of many 'authors' in my middle school. The characters had no feeling. They were as vague as the setting and I had no impression of the novel except that it was a waste of time.

It always kept me wondering how everyone would finally meet and how the stories all came together. I grew up in Colorado, so I can picture the whole setting, yet there was still much left to my imagination. In addition, all of the stories seemed very realistic. I especially liked the story of Victoria. Her life seems almost unimaginable. She is a very strong girl. Waking up to two old men that you just met; walking around school knowing that everyone is gossiping about you; and living in a completely unstimulating life; now that is amazing. The stories of Guthrie, Ike, and Bobby are equally incredible, though being a seventeen year old girl myself; I understand the character of Victoria best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plainsong Rewiew","review":"When I was assigned the book Plainsong by my English teacher, I groaned inwardly, thinking to myself that this was another Lord of the Flies. I procrastinated horribly, and the day before our first quiz I finally picked the book up and began to read. I was instantly pulled into the story and into the characters lives by Kent Haruf's spectacular writing style. That night I read over three-quarters of the book, loathing to set it down. The characters became so real and familiar that I was wishing that the story would never end. Victoria, especially, jumped out at me; drawing me almost against my will into her life and reminding me of my own. This is an amazingly well-written book, brimming with emotions that depict the reality of small-town life. Plainsong is definitely a book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking read","review":"Mr. Haruff tells a beautiful story about compassion, friendship and caring with a sparse tenderness that frankly took my breath away. A simply wonderful read, pure pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully simple tale about the complexities of life.","review":"Kent Haruf has a beautifully spare way of writing about which draws me in completely. His tale is that of ordinary folk going about the business of living with all of the pain and joy that this encompasses. Not many books make me sob and laugh out loud, but this one did.In some respects I enjoyed Eventide even more than Plainsong."},{"rating":"1","title":"sparse, evocative and... overrated","review":"like 'snow falling on cedars' plainsong has received great reviews... too great. the sparse prose and sparser punctuation is similar to cormac mccarthy, giving us two modern western authors who apparently believe the silence of big empty spaces is best rendered without quotation marks. at the end of the day plainsongs foreboding juxtaposition of stories is ultimately only Plainly interesting, neither cathartic, nor uplifting, nor artful enough to qualify for greatness sans plot. but now we know: what would 'my antonia' be like set in 1996? for the angst of the modern small town west mcmurtry's 'duane's depressed' goes a lot deeper, and is a lot more fun, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book annoying to read. The style has potential, and appears to be letting the characters speak for themselves. However, the author's prejudices come through way too strongly. It is very clear that some characters are \\"good\\" and the others are \\"bad\\"; some of the characters are very close to being caricatures. There is no character development to speak of."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what our President is reading? sigh","review":"I am reading this as Kindle said our President is reading it this week. I was curious...and so far disappointed. The lack of quotation marks is annoying and the sex scenes sort of cheap...and gross picturing our President reading it at the same time. lol Definately not the deep writing I expected. It is ok...but more like $3 ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"choppy","review":"The story was choppy and hard to follow. I had to put the book down after 10 pages. The writing style reminded me of the camera work on NYPDBlue, too keen to show the reader everything at once rather than what is pertinent."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD ENOUGH","review":"II am not very fond of reading and I had to read this book as a class room assignment. Other books that we have read I have likedbut this one I did not like because it seemed too boring and confusing. I also don't see how the characters connect. I think that this book might have been more appealing if it had a better title. In this book i thought that the characters were going through alot of turmoil and mental anguish. I also didn't see the climax in this novel it gave me a headache while reading. I suggest you take some ibuprofen before reading this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"Haruf's composition is make of unadorned prose and characters whose lives reflect and move through each other and yet are each vivid and singular. Unmediated even to the absence of quotation marks, tales of family, ritual, life cycles happen on the page as shapely and exhilarating art."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I was duped by all the wonderful reviews I read of this book. I found it boring, contrived and meandering. The characters just seemed to wander around bumping into eachother occasionally, with no real sense of purpose. Like the title says, it is \\"plain,\\" but not in a good way. I guess I just expect more from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not intersesting at all","review":"The author tries to pull you into the lives of too many people at once. I really wanted to find out more about some of the characters but it got to a point where I just didn't care and I couldn't finish the book. It's got sex, love and trouble but never at any point does Kent answer any questions. How this book won an award is beyond me.Skip this book unless you like being confused and cheated out of a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I listen to a lot of books on tape in my car and this was one of the worst. A vulgar, angry waste of time. There is no interesting dialog or plot and we are left hanging at the end. Don't bother - there is nothing of value here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complainsong","review":"I beg to differ from almost everyone else--from the title I anticipated something more serene until my reading was jarred by gratuitous sexual scenes and white-trash swearing, which did not contribute anything to the story. It seemed that some of these paragraphs were just \\"stuck in there\\" to satisfy todays taste for the gross and crass, making sure the book would be bought. To repeat, it disturbed me that some of the language and sexual encounters were very gratuitous. For the remainder, the book wasn't all that well written, no jewel of the English language. Sorry, but this is my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Thanksgiving reading","review":"Beautiful, beautiful book. The authentic voices allow the reader to co-create the characters, making for a rewarding reading experience. The style is a tribute to Strunk & White: less is more, nouns and verbs win out over adjectives and adverbs. I stayed up til 2:30 a.m. reading this one, and never felt as though I'd missed the sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALL YEAR","review":"I read on average two books per week and I have to say that, without question, this was my favorite book of 1999. It was touching and thought-provoking and much deeper than so much of the \\"bubble-gum writing\\" currently available. The fact that the book has not been one of Oprah's picks is further testament to the book's worth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming","review":"I skipped over this book while perusing the library shelves many times. But finally I noticed the audio version and decided to give it a go. I often find myself really enjoying the audio versions of books I would not normally read.The reader did a great job at bringing the characters to life for me. He did an especially good job at representing the McPheron brothers. I am glad I took the risk because this book is now counted among my favorites. I am going to search out other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"plain wonderful","review":"In his novel Plainsong, Kent Haruf manages to gently enter the lives of several people in a small Colorado town. Kent Haruf writes in a wonderful unembellished style that paints a picture in your heart. The story involves the falling apart ,salvaging and rebuilding of families. It defines what really does make a family a family. The story involves a high school teacher , his two young sons and the emotionally unavailable wife and mother. There are the Macpheron brothers (two older bachelor farmers) and an abandoned 17 year old pregnant high school student. The weaver of the fabric of this story is an unmarried teacher named Maggie. She shows true compassion and understanding and reweaves these \\"families\\". The story moves gently and beautifully and pulls you right in. Plainsong is a true joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good","review":"I agree with all the other one star reviews. I forced myself to finish as the cover indicated it got good reviews. But it is cloying and dull. Reading it is like trying to have a meaningful conversation with someone who keeps going off into pointless, boring tangents in an attempt to be interesting. The language tries to be colloquial but comes off as just too precious. The cover review actually compared this book to Chekov, which is like comparing Brittny Spears to Renee Fleming. Just not very good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you get past page 2?","review":"I was so out of breath reading \\"and then, and then, and then....\\" I couldn't read the rest of it. I stopped after: \\"He went out into the hall again past the closed door AND on into the bathroom AND shaved AND rinsed his face AND went back to the bedroom at the front of the house whose high windows overlooked Railroad Street AND brought out shirt AND pants from the closet AND laid them out on the bed AND took off his robe AND got dressed.\\" (page 4, 4th paragraph) FINALLY!!! A PERIOD! WHEW! It was nothing but one continuous sentence to me! My sister enjoyed this book and wanted me to read it. I really don't think I can! I can't seem to get over the long sentences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainsong was disappointing","review":"After all the hype and reviews, I was disappointed.The author seemed to lose focus, and the book was a bit slow, though the underlying theme was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"How has this gotten such high ratings???","review":"I am not impressed with this author for the following reasons:1. Blatant disregard for proper punctuation - this makes the text difficult to follow and the story without emotion. The character's dialogue isn't in quotation marks. IE: Look out there is a car coming, said Mark. VS. \\"Look out! There is a car coming,\\" exclaimed Mark.2. Author was completely ineffective in developing characters and finishing storylines. Too many unanswered questions and things left unsaid.3. Author was completely ineffective at creating a timeless story. At first it seemed like the 50's, then he talked about stick pregnancy tests and VCR's so that brought it to 80's then the tone seemed 50's again.4. Having been born and raised in the plains of Colorado, I was eager to read this story but it didn't come close to adequately representing life there. Written from a city slicker transplant perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding???????","review":"This is one of the most bleak and depressing books I've ever had the misfortune to read. Although I can see why people applaud the style of the writing, how can they get past the horrible story? I will not be looking forward to reading any more selections by the National Book Award committee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a wonderful book. I wanted to read it all in one sitting and yet I wanted to read it slowly and savor it. What a dilemma! It's so nice to know that there are still some really good writers out there. I plan to read more of Mr. Haruf's books so tell him to keep writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read with a slow start","review":"Plainsong, was truly one of the better books I have read.When I first bought the book I tried to read it but found the start long and drawn out. Later, when I started reading it again, I found it to be very good, I couldn't put it down. It is a very slow starting book, but if you give it time, Plainsong is an excellent read.Mr. Haruf is amazing! This book has so much emotion and feeling it actually made me cry. The way that everything is described in this book is unsurpassed by most authors. I think most people are able to identify with at least one of the characters.If you are looking for a good book to read on those cold winter days curled up in a blanket, or in bed, then this book is for you, but if you're looking for a book to read on the train, subway or bus, you will probably have some trouble following this book.~Happy Reading!~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Song","review":"I was unable to finish this novel, after giving it one hundred fifty pages worth of a chance. There are too many unread books on my life's list to continue wasting my time with this one. I rarely give up on a book. Starting one is a comittment I take seriously. But there is just nothing in Haruf's \\"Plainsong\\" to hold onto. The spare, simple writing that is praised on the book's jacket is almost childish at times. The lack of quotation marks and long, rushed sentences are truly bothersome. But to me, a book's foundation is character. The characters here are like sketches of people, stick-figure drawings, none of which brought out any feelings whatsoever in me. I can't believe this book was a finalist for the Book Award and a bestseller. I take starting a new book very seriously, and I wanted to do my part in helping other people who might be considering this one. Buy a classic instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is nothing Plain to this Song","review":"This is the last book I read for the year 2000 and I was delighted that it was a memorable one. Plainsong is the story of a community and the sublte, yet intricate ways in which people are connected to one another. It was an optimistic book--without being sentimental. Showing that human nature has the ability to forgive, give, and learn. Each of the characters has voice and teaches something about humilty and grace. Perhaps you'll discover a song of your own in one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haruf fan # ?","review":"Kent Haruf's books Plainsong and Evensong are compelling, beautifully written book whose characters are vividly and concisely developed. It is a book about small town life and the very real people who live in those towns (at least a few of them). I hope he keeps on writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABOUT THE BRACELET AND COINS","review":"wILL SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY THE BOYS PUT THEIR MOTHER'S BRACELET AND THE COINS ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS? tHIS IS A WONDERFUL NOVEL...JUST A QUESTION ABOUT THAT EPISODE.

The characters are not anyone important or special. They are small people from a small town but their humanity is captured beautifully. The people are 'real' and you are pulled in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plainsong","review":"Easy, very nice trip down memory lane with this book. No dates were given so the reader has no an idea of the time this story depicts. Deals with the simplicity of small towns. Some pointless cruelty, but lots of simple decency.

I especially like the chapters concerning the young boys and the older brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I kept thinking this book would get better as i read but it just didn't. There was nothing spectacular to it. Yes, it's a \\"nice little story\\" but not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainsong on the bubble","review":"At first this book seemed very boring. But as time progressed I felt like I was part of the story. It seemed very sexually graphic at the begginning. The boys were exicted to hear about people having sex, but they felt very sorry for the girl in the story. The author was not afraid to say what he felt. It would be very hard to be the girl that got pregnant. After all the bad things that happened the boys turned out alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainsong Review","review":"I am a senior in a highschool, and I'm reading this book for a class. Personally I wouldn't recommend this book, for it's pointless and dull. The book drudges on page after page in a small town setting where ordinary life is the key. There is nothing in this book that is remotely interesting, no humor, no plot, and if there is a plot it is extremely sketchy, or just so ordinary it's hardly noticeable. To me this book is not even well written, which makes it dull and not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too plain","review":"Kent Haruf's third novel Plainsong wants to be a modest book, judging by the title. And it is. It depicts the disintegration of several dysfunctional families in the little town of Holt, Colorado, and then the seemingly random formation of new and better units. The prose is laconic yet it creates rather beautiful, subdued portrayal of everyday life in the smalltown. Problem is that it is also rather pretentious in its solemnity, and cannot really hide the fact that this story is painfully plain as analysis of the domestic problems in today's society. There are several nicely done scenes, but Haruf likes his world black and white, resulting in good guys that are so very good and bad guys that are so very bad. Ending is also too saccharine, almost reactionary in its firm appraisal of traditional family values. Disney will not need to change a word if they ever make a movie out of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have read","review":"This book was horrible. The characters were not developed, there was absolutely no plot, and no point. I didn't care abouth the characters because they were so underdeveloped. I felt this book was a ramling book with no tie up at the end. The McPheron boys sounded stupid instead of like humble farm people. Pointless parts: Mrs. Stearns, Guthrie's fling with the school secretary, and Bobby and Ike going to the McPherons house after they find out about Mrs. Stearsn.Horrible book. I can't see how anyone liked it? I like how a previous review said a case of the \\"Emperors New Clothes\\". That is exactly how I felt."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, too, missed something","review":"Just to say I totally agree with Kent. This book was a large disappointment after all the good reviews I had read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"artsy\\" for this reader!","review":"(And no, I've never read Finnegans Wake either.)e.e. cummings abhored capital letters. Evidently, Kent Haruf thinks it high literary style to eschew quotation marks - or, as Tom Robbins calls them: \\"earrings.\\" Yes, Mr. Robbins, they are \\"earrings\\" when the author wishes to note that something is being called something which it may not be - for example \\"a good book\\"- but quotation marks also perform the very useful function of letting the reader know when a character is speaking. This midwestern reader found this book to be too disconcerting - the lack of punctuation impedes the flow - makes one constantly have to \\"translate\\" as one is trying to read.Life is too short - and there are too many readable books out there to waste time on this one. I gave up on page 62. It's interesting that, on the jacket where they are trying to sell the book, the publishers know quite well how to use quotation marks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainsong","review":"I did not care for this book at all. i thought that it was boaring and it took to much of my time. i do not recomend this book to anyone, unlsess you like really boaring books."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE do not buy this book","review":"I had to quit reading this book shortly after I started. This is the worst book I have every had the misfortune of getting. It is the most depressing, worthless book I have ever come across. I will not make the mistake of reading anything by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty cover, filthy prose","review":"The cover on this book is beautiful, but I was sorely disappointed with the content. The plotline is weak (never did figure out how all the characters come together), the language is filthy and negative in a lot of sections, including an immoral, disgusting, and irrelvant sex scene. On the positive side, it did show some of the characters helping each other and enforcing proper moral values. However, with all of the wonderful literature out there, don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainsong = Bad Book...........Plainsong + Vodka= Good Book!","review":"I had to read plainsong for school and it was a horrible book. It's boring and has no depth. As others have said, this book is littered with nothing but useless information and too much sex. Some sex is relevant to a book- however too much sex is just like an erotic story. I warn anyone who has to read this book- drink massive amounts of alcohol before reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"Mr. Haruf writes in a clean and simple prose that is beautiful and easy to read. His characters are very well-developed and draw the reader in from the start. His treatment of the landsape reminds me of Wallace Stegner and Ivan Doig. The story line is believable and moves along briskly. Most of all, his dialogue is as real as the breakfast banter in a small town cafe.One of the jacket quotes calls \\"Plainsong\\" \\"the best new novel ... since 'Cold Mountain'\\". Amen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endearing without being sentimental.","review":"Plainsong is the kind of book in which there are moving connections between 2 old bachelor brothers and a pregnant teenager; 2 young brothers and a lonely old woman; and in which even a one night stand is full of tenderness. The young brothers have a good father, but surprisingly this is the one relationship without much warmth. Plainsong is endearing without being sentimental, and all the characters are worth spending time with, especially the boys. Plainsong does not totally lack a hard edge, but the few mean personalities are movers only: the novel is never told from their perspective"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant book","review":"This is certainly the best contemporary book of fiction I've read in a long time. The spare writing is incredibly effective -- and almost cinematic in its absence of internal reflection. Somehow, by the end of the novel, you are absolutely engaged with the characters, crying at their pain and smiling at their simple joys. A wonderful example of contemporary fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most honest books I've read","review":"This story is a great book about ordinary people who live ordinary lives and is written in an extraordinary way. Kent Haruf is a wonderful author who really brings his characters to life. Not everyone in the book is perfect but reading this story you can feel the warmth in their hearts. The characters all learn from eachother and come together to make a wonderful small town America. I loved the McPheron brothers and how you see their lives changed through loving a young pregnant girl who happens to come upon their doorstep. Maggie Jones is the one who binds everyone together through her strong, helpful character. The boys Ike and Bobby go through some tough times but hold eachother together with their brotherly love. I have not read such a plain, simple story of wonderful characters in a long time. This is a book that anyone can read and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical.","review":"His prose was perfect. I felt like I was there on the prairie of Colorado. The people touched my heart. Would I recommend it..yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"cozy read","review":"There are so many novels out there that seem to shock the reader by the way they describe events that shape the characters lives. In this book I found the cirsumstances real, but not hard to read and not totally depressing. The writing style is plain and very easy to read. A good read on a long plane ride or a de-stress weekend away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plaindisappointing","review":"This is a typical \\"best seller\\" that I fell into where the characters are simple, predictable in their illogical behaviors, sappy, and boring. The plot is of little relevence to any real life situation and the book was neither educative nor entertaining. I have a hard time knowing why there has been such a favorable response to this work other than it doesn't tax one's thoughts too much. It isn't even on a par with Oprah's books. The cover is well-designed and promising, which goes to confirm that you can't judge a book on its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Tedious","review":"I hated the fact that there were no quotation marks and I found most of the characters to be incredibly boring. Also, we never really learn much about what makes the characters tick. When teenage Victoria's mother finds out Victoria is pregnant she kicks her out of the house. Why is she so bitter? Guthrie's wife first stays in bed all day at home and later abandons her two small boys. Why does she behave this way? We never really have any answers in this book. The ending was particularly disappointing and vague. We know that Russ does something (I won't spoil the story for those who haven't read it), but we never find out if he is prosecuted for it. We know that Victoria has her baby, but we never even find out what the baby's name is. For a more entertaining book on small town life with equally unlikely relationships (strangers taking in teenage mothers, etc.)I would recommend Where The Heart Is by Billie Letz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Spare","review":"This is a sweet and sparely written novel -- Haruf doesn't waste words stating the obvious or on extraneous detail. What is is what is important, not what happened because of it or what caused it. Victoria's flat affect and lack of depth is important because of the effect it has on others and the story it brings together. She herself is neither here nor there. The dialogue between the McPheron brothers is worth the price of admission alone.This is not a book for folks who need to know exactly WHY everything is happening and how the characters are going to fare after the book ends. It is, simply, what it is and what it is is a poignant story about some hapless folks who come together as their lives come together."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful, warm, satisfying book.","review":"The characters in \\"Plainsong\\" are all very believable and real. Kent Haruf does an exceptional job telling us a story through vignettes of small town life. I listened to the book on CD in my car, and I have done what I never had done before; I brought the book inside so I could listen to it more in my home. The only downside about it is that it ended too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick read, believable, mildly gratifying","review":"This book reads quickly. It would be good for reading on an airplane. The story is extremely believable but there were few surprises and little character depth. Several scenes do stick in my mind: the girl and the two guys, the kidnapping of the two boys, and the autopsy of the horse. However, these were insufficient to make this book a great read. I compare this book to Barbara Kingsolver's or T. Coraghessan Boyle's or Comac McCathy's and it falls short. Those writers are better (at least based upon this one book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, very disappointing","review":"The only thing greater than my anticipation for reading this book was the disappointment I had after I finished. I had a few people tell me how much they liked the book. I had a hard time finding why they liked it. The characters had very little development. Only one of the characters got my attention - the pregnant teenager. I thought the characters and plots they were in were bland. Call me prude, but the book had way too many references to sex. And many of those references didn't seem important to the characters and flow of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny farmers sing a \\"Plainsong\\"","review":"Author Haruf works wonders in \\"Plainsong,\\" describing little people's lives in a very big way. My favorite characters were the McPheron brothers, two eroding farmers who allow a homeless, pregnant teenager to live with them on their country farm. The girl, Victoria, brings a warmth and happiness to their home they haven't experienced in years. Victoria's treks to civilization with the McPheron's on her heels lead to unruly, utterly compassionate and very funny responses by the brothers to the modern world. The other characters' stories are enticing as well, sparse yet filled with emotion. \\"Plainsong\\" is an intriguing, often comedic novel that's a fairly quick read and time well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abandenment","review":"This was a very easy read book. Kent Haruf was able to capture the readers attention with his very descriptive writing. All though it was not exactly a book that you could not put down and stop reading, you felt like you knew each one of the characters personally.It is about the troubled lives of each family, or do you really consider it family since they seem to be falling apart. Each family is missing a family member. Ike and Bobby are abanded by their mother who won't even get out of bed. Victoria is a 17 year old high school student who is pregnant and her mom pretty much disowns her. Maggie Jones is a lonesome lady looking for a man. Guthrie has his boy, but lost his wife to depression. The Mcpheron brothers are bachelors who know everything about the ranch, but not too much about girls.This novel takes place in a small town where everybody knows everything about everybody's business. After reading the book you will feel like you can relate to all of these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laudable...","review":"Complex novel of quirky, mostly-believable characters, the central trio being 2 quirky old bachelor brothers who take in a 17yo town girl who's been kicked out my her mother when her pregnancy is discovered. Deceptively plain language masks a complex view of the inter-relationships of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Boring","review":"What was that? The lack of quotation marks alone are enough to get on anyone's last nerve. I thought everyone learned how to use quotation marks back in the fourth grade, but Mr. Haruf obviously did not. The countless number of run-on sentences didn't help much either. I don't understand how it got the excellent reviews that it did. The plot was dull and it left me feeling as though it didn't end. Why did Guthrie's wife act the way she did and leave her little boys? Victoria's mother is introduced only to kick her daughter out of the house. I wanted to like Victoria's character, but she too proved to be just as boring as the rest. This book proved to me that just about anyone can get a book deal these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put Plainsong High Up On Your Reading List!","review":"It's no wonder that Plainsong was a National Book Award finalist! Haruf has written a very heartwarming story set in a small town in the High Prairies east of Denver in which seven members of the community -- spanning four generations -- come together in the face of great difficulties to form an extended family that we all wish we could have if necessary. While the story is a very simple one, Haruf tells it with great humanity, intensity and emotion. Further, his dialogue and narrative skills are so real you think you are right there experiencing first hand life in Holt, Colorado as the story unfolds. Do yourself a favor and put Plainsong at or near the top of your \\"To Be Read\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic and Powerful","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. It captured me. The writing is poetic and the characters are realistic. The story is one you can picture and feel part of. I enjoyed how Haruf made parallels between unlikely characters in this small town. There is a sequel to this book, called Eventide. Also, there is a movie of this book that you can rent and watch after reading it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This could be nonfiction, it is so authentic.","review":"Like the pace of small towns themselves, this book slowly draws the reader in until one cares so deeply about the characters that you do not want to let them go.The authenticity of the action and the townspeople was such that I , living in a similar community, felt like I was evesdropping on neighbors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle and Wonderful","review":"The lack of quotation marks rather threw me when I began reading this book, but since I have a tendency to read too fast, I slowed down and now feel I got more out of this book by concentrating. I too wish the author had delved a little more deeply into the characters' motivations, but nevertheless I loved this book and jumped right into \\"Eventide\\" which I had purchased at the same time. I now have Mr. Haruf's other two books and will quite now and start reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise and humane","review":"An enjoyable read, \\"Plainsong\\" compassionately looks at the verities of life - the good and the bad. Haruf writes with a directness that is also graceful, displaying a kind understanding of \\"everyday\\" life's sometimes harsh realities.This book has been adapted into a movie. I just saw a commercial: \\"Plainsong\\" airs Sunday, April 25th on CBS. This book isn't treacly/sentimental and I hope that will be true of the \\"Hallmark Hall of Fame\\" special on CBS.

It seemed very slow to get into anything (I guess kind of like the characters themselves). I had to fight to continue to read this novel until more than half way through. At that point the characters began to peak my interest and I guess there was a certain curiousity as to how things would turn out. Perhaps because I don't have any experience of a small town in the west I couldn't quite deal with the pace of the storyline. Most times when I finish a book I hate to leave the characters, I want to remain in their lives and continue to see where life takes them. I didn't really care about these folks and I'm not quite sure why. The story just didn't grab me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see this is on Obama's vacation reading list...","review":"I wonder if he'll do as I did (and as several other reviewers did also) and stop reading after about 100 pages?The missing quotation marks didn't bother me, neither did the run-on sentences. And -- in the beginning -- I was entranced by the prose.I began to sour on the book when it seemed that another author had taken over the writing of the second half: the prose became cloying, the plot twists were predictable, and I imagined it becoming a template for a schmaltzy made-for-TV movie.Soon after, I put it down, half-finished, and eventually put it into the stack of books headed for the library's sale.A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious!","review":"I keep thinking I a missing something, because so many people loved this book, but to me, the story just fell flat. The ending just didn't make sense. For every plot point that was wrapped up, there was a plot point left unresolved.Heartwarming?? Cozy?? No, this book was more about the cruelty of life, but the characters seem to run and hide from their problems instead of confront and conquer them.I know, I know I \\"get\\" the \\"plainsong\\" idea. Simple, unadorned, but this book just got to be flat out boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid!","review":"I LOVED this book.

It is one of the better books I've read in years. This was the first of Haruf's that I read, I immediately went out and bought the previous two. I am now reading The Tie That Binds.He reminds me of a simpler Faulkner...creating a whole community of interesting and normal, yet odd, folk. I love his dialogue and his short, concise prose. His voice comes through and it fits his story(ies).I have recommended this book to everyone. I think even non-readers will enjoy a Haruf book... and think about it after they've read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joy to read","review":"Plainsong is a magnificant achievement. This book more integrity than anything I have read this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Award winning? Really?","review":"Haruf is obviously a talented writer. Unfortunately unlike truly great writers, he is unable to convey the depths of character without subjecting readers to the forms of writing usually reserved for cheap romance novels. The graphic sex scenes are gratuitous and one must wonder about Mr. Haruf's voyeuristic tendancies. I read this because it is required reading for my sophomore son. It is certainly not appropriate reading material for a 15 year old, or for anyone really. If it had been a great story I could have tried to overlook the tawdry nature of the writing, but no such luck. Do yourself a favor. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainsong","review":"Hmmpphhh... How are there so many five-star reviews?? I just don't get it.

What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexual Epiphanies","review":"PLAINSONG by Kent Haruf is a plaintive yet hard-hitting novel of sexual awakening and bittersweet longing.The mixed-up lives of small town America could not be more compelling. We have a dad separated from his mentally-ill wife. We have high school tuffs experimenting with sex in abandoned houses. We have young boys witnessing the sex act while peeking in a broken window.Moreover, Haruf's writing style is straight-forward and rivetting. Using no quotation marks, he blends thoughts with conversations, describes scenes with exactness and builds emotional drama and trauma until the very end.While not a thriller, this novel propels readers forward through a morass of sticky social situations while capturing our hearts.Definitely a \\"can't put it down\\" story.Larry Rochelle, author of GULF GHOST, BLUE ICE, GHOSTLY EMBERS and SIREN SORCERY"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book skims the top, without going to the depths I need.","review":"This book, while good for the basics and overviews of general material, lacks in the specifics that I really needed to get going. The examples on disk are not very good. I try running a number of the scripts and I get run-time errors. It would have been nice to see scripts that would help me get started right off the bat.

The author not only describes both Win32 and OLE Automation Windows NT applications but supplies several good examples for each. Furthermore he dissects each piece of example code and highlights each method and function within the example. The examples, fortunately, are not code \\"fragments\\" but examples you can run immediately. The CD-Rom saves typing.

I was hoping to use one of the cuts on it for a short slide show I was making. Unfortunately (for me) there was no way to hear samples so I ordered the cd based on all of the reviews. I played it, I heard it, I was bored and disappointed because it didn't come close to the excellence and originality of past recordings. Quite frankly there is no reason to ever play it again. I offered it to my husband to keep in the car. Once he heard it, he declined my offer. In the future if there isn't an opportunity of hearing samples before ordering, I will not take the chance again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, great singing","review":"What more could you ask for? Kate and Anna alone are worth the price of admission. But add Loudon, Rufus and Martha Wainwright as well as Rondstadt and Emmylou and you've got a folk/pop summit that succeeds on every level. Its low-key without being tedious or repetitious. Old songs, new songs: they all sound absolutely perfect. As far as having issues behind the music, Fleetwood Mac has nothing on this clan. Not only is Loudon Kate's ex, but Rufus and Martha have issues with Loudon for being not only absent but(in their young eyes) abusive as well.I most enjoy the new songs by Rufus and Martha but the performance that most transports one to folk singing nirvana is the traditional 'Johnny Has Gone to Hilo' a gorgeous song sung here in a fantastic arrangement. A recording to be cherished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Tracks!!!","review":"I love Peggy Scott-Adams \\"Live & More\\" cd! The first 3 songs that are proformed live gives you a sense of what Peggy is like at her concerts. The next two songs are new singles that a hit songs. \\"Sweaty Men\\" is my favourite, in which she talks about the issue of men that don't have personal hygeine at the top of their lists. \\"When I'm With You\\" is a beautiful ballad. The remainder of the Cd are remixes of most of her pervious hits. They are great dance remixes that would do well at clubs or parties. Those tracks are not fast dance tracks, they are mid- tempo dance tracks with a lot oif soul! This is recommended if you like soul and dance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent discussion of the realities of Vietnam","review":"This book eloquently captures the struggles and realities of Brewer's Vietnam War experience and his return after being wounded. This is hardly a \\"poor me\\" study but instead a thought provoking narrative about a time in US history that far too many of us don't understand.Written in a very readable style it should be recommended reading for every high school/college student studying the Vietnam War and a must read for any teacher attempting to cover the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first hand history lesson","review":"I am giving this book to all my friends who were in Vietnam as a thank you. My high school and college years were spent debating the pros and cons of our involvement in this war that wasn't a war. Contemporaries were dying while we questioned and protested. Tom Brewer tells his story with such ease yet it is packed with poignancy. We didn't appreciate then how lucky we were to have such heroes. Worse yet we didn't recognize them for all their sacrifices on their return. There is no changing the past but I'll make a point of thanking all those that I know and making sure that my children read this book so they never forget a generation of men who are often forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"A foolish movie","review":"This movie misrepresents the Chinese history with odd plots and foolish effects. What it is trying to say is the value of individual, it is like a stupid political propaganda trying to brain washing the audience.

Someone had given it to him and he gave it to me. Now I know why. This is probably one of the worst films of all time. It was so bad, I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes of it, and that was really pushing it. The script is horrendous and the acting is pathetic. I don't know who Ling Bai is and neither do any of my Chinese friends or my Chinese wife, but she is a terrible actress. I'm quite sure she is an unknown in China. The rest of the actors aren't any better. If anyone gives you a copy of this DVD, do yourself a favor and immediately throw it in the trash where it belongs.

It didn't. The only one that can act is the damn monkey and even then the character development is slim. I always buy Halmark movies, they've been great (10th Kingdom etc) but this one is the worst movie they've ever endorsed. I read all the reviews and decided to give it a chance-save yourself the dissapointment. The movie could have been so good. The plot is quite good but the screenplay, acting, effects, are not. A goddess having a drink at the bar...come on, even I won't watch something that lame. Mythology is something I love but the way these people portray it becomes laughable, and disrespects the story it's trying to tell. Most of all you can't even like the hero because he is so annoying!

With the huge success of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" I belive, people are exploring other movies, similar in nature. Well, if you're an adult and you're getting reacquainted with the fantasy genre, this is one to MISS. Ignore it. Keep on walking. Its really just for kids, at best.

Buddhists don't have romantic affairs, eat meat, or drink alcohol. It's like showing a Jewish Rabbi eating pork on Friday night. It's disrespectful and sickening. I can't believe people make this kind of crap and take what is a masterpiece and trample all over it. Isn't anything sacred anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist travesty of an epic story","review":"\\"Journey to the West\\" is a literary masterpiece which has been loved in China for nearly half a millennium. In contrast, \\"The Lost Empire\\" is a piece of meretricious rubbish which will hopefully soon be consigned to oblivion. Its makers seem to assume, rightly or wrongly, that its audience will be unable to relate to a \\"foreign\\" story unless a white guy is inserted, however incongruously, into the action. As if this were not bad enough, the idea of the \\"hero\\" comducting a romantic affair with Kuan Yin must be deeply offensive to many people of Chinese extraction. Since Kuan Yin is someimes compared, in her role as compassionate mediator, to the Virgin Mary, one can only imagine the response had the situation been reversed. This is an example of film-making at its very worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for all ages","review":"This is not real mythology, but it does mention several legit Chinese myths. Of course, it's not meant for a mythology or history lesson, it's meant for entertainment. This is not a great movie by any stretch. Having read the reviews already on here, it's not even a good movie to some people. It is, however, entertaining and fun to watch. Yeah, the story does wander off of the plot a few times, but it always meanders back. The acting is hardly Oscar caliber, but the actors are good enough to get the point across. Ling Bai is very good as the Goddess of Mercy. She is able to be sweet, sexy and heroic at the same time. The main selling point for me, though, is that my 9 year old granddaughter and I can watch this movie and enjoy it together. She likes the character of the goddess and that gives her a good female role model in the movies and that's not something a lot of movies offer these days (ie Mean Girls). A good, fun way to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Kingdom","review":"Well done modern telling of a classic Chinese tale.

I think the doll is well made and easy for child to carry around etc. On the flip side it is annoying as all get out and VERY VERY loud. Too loud I think for childrens ears. Since my daughter insists on sleeping with it I take the batteries out at nap/nite time. That is when Greg is in \\"sleeping mode\\" I really wish there was an on/off switch in the back under his clothes. I really wish they would lower the volume and maybe add a few more phrases.

This is a problem because when I flipped over my angel food cake to cool, the weight of the insert smushed my cake down a bit because the tube didn't have anything to rest on. I ended up putting it over the neck of a bottle which makes the feet pointless, but it did the job.Overall, I would buy it again because it performed well (besides the feet) and was the best product I found for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Gentle","review":"Have cooked two non-angelfood cakes since it arrived.

It was just shoddy workmanship and certainly showed little to no quality control. I also was surprised at how thin the metal was. It just looked and felt cheap. I hoped that wouldn't matter when baking a cake in it. After all, I told myself, Wilton is a well-known brand.After removing the cake from the pan, I saw that my concern about the warped insert was justified. The whole cake was tilted or crooked -- not something you'd want to serve to guests. After frosting it, it looked even more crooked.And when cleaning up the pan, I found that it was very scratched up after only one use. That was enough to convince me that I would be returning this pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilton Angel Food Pan","review":"Flimsy thin construction. Insert was warped and doesn't seal properly.

I used it, and I am happy with the result. The only complaint is that the paper cover and labels were so sticky and left the glue residue on the surface.

An added bonus is are helpful suggestions on packaging blends for gifts. There are recipes for appetizers, butters, dressings, no-salt blends, meat, seafood,traditional blends such as Italian, Pumpkin pie spice, bread and dessert blends; and some \\"not so traditional\\" such as \\"Wassail Spice Mix\\", for a punch. I especially like this book because after each formula there are suggested uses and a recipe using the blend. Each page also has a little history about where the blend comes from. Good Book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any cook or cook wanna-be","review":"Most people are a bit timid about trying new spices or blends in their cooking. The great thing about this book is that it gives you not only the directions to make your own blend (thus saving you lots of money!) but suggestions on how and when to use them. This is a must have for the timid cook to those that experiment with their own blends! It gives great suggestions and has a wonderful variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought...","review":"Recipes call for too many ingredients, and make a lot.

I havent had it long so I cant tell u many things but I can tell you that it is SO realistic!! Its head doesnt just move up and down but it moves almost in a circular movement.

The sounds on it are very realistic but its not really JUST like a newborn puppy.....its about as close as your going to get from the real thing though!!I got the tan and white one( I think that in real life he looks more real, although the other ones are VERY cute)!! K well I can type so many wonderfull things about this pup but theres not much room so I would highly recomend this puppy for anyone on the look for even a real puppy!!

By no means.","review":"I'm another SA traditionalist who loves their classic sound, which was always very distinctive. In addition, I'm a huge fan of the typical European power metal sound. While this is a bit of a departure from both, I think it's still definitely worth the listen.My first listen of this album was a bit shaky, especially with all of the relatively depressing lyrics and seeming lack of upbeat numbers. However, I've now listened to a it a few more times and have decided that it's definitely a welcome addition to my collection of metal albums.I can see why other SA fans might not enjoy it, so anyone who's unsure if they'll enjoy it should sample it first to see what they think. The best number on this album is by far \\"My Dream's but a Drop of Fuel for a Nightmare\\"; very catchy, as well as \\"Out in the Fields.\\"Winterheart's Guild is still my favorite SA album, but Unia will get plenty of time in my player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorelota","review":"Only in dedicated layering can this symphprog extend past so many of the cliches brazenly worn, rarely sustaining interesting structure before trailing off into carnival theatrics of the mediocre variety. I'm sure if you are a fan of this type of melodic metal grandstanding there is much fun to be found but so many of these types of projects are inherently gutted from the start, where flatly plastic production underscores persistently average ambition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Power Metal fan's dream come true","review":"This album is awsome! Don't listen to other reviewers about there not being a lot of \\"headbanging rock\\" in this album. This is just power metal with a more progressive foundation. If you want a bit more kick in power metal go with Primal Fear. But if you want more artistry and style, this album is for you. Perfect for listening on the go or for relaxing at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best....","review":"I just finishing listening to the album and seeing as how not a single melody is stuck in my head, this is not their best material. This album is a natural progression from Reckoning Night. It's complex, well written and the production is flawless. However, there is not a single fast song on the album. People like me who love \\"8th Commandment\\" \\"The Cage\\" and \\"Wildfire\\" will be disappointed, this is not a power metal album. It is a beautiful piece of work, but will put power metal fans to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Following the trends, Sonata Arctica has bailed out on the hooks that made them popular, and opted for hookless parts of songs strung together in a pattern that I have yet to figure out. This is Power Metal's equivalent to a jazz exploration. I would have to say that I don't really recommend this album to people who like straightforward power metal, however if you like more progressive metal, you would be fairly at home with the random changes, odd time signatures, structureless feeling of the songs, and would likely enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of 2007!","review":"HOLY CRAP! This album is my album of 2007 for now....Its completely different then there last 4 albums and thats a good thing, that sound is getting tired, i dont know how to describe the ALBUM, you just have to hear it yourself....Its very progressive and on first listen i really hated it, grew to be one of my favorite albums ever, Seriously.....SA does it AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Second most disappointing music purchase I've made.

It is always a bands' right to change direction radically, my wife does it all the time. But, at least (now) she warns me before she downshifts from 4th to 1st skipping the gears in between. If I wanted slow, moody, drippy vocals music I'd buy Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin (I know that dates me, but who cares, you get the idea). I have given 5 stars to every SA album they've made, and I have them all. I like the style they were and hope they return to it. Having said that I will wait next time to hear the samples and read the reviews before I order the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work.","review":"I have been a fan of Sonata Arctica for a long time, but I was really disappointed in this CD. It is really not their best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnum Opus","review":"It's hard to pin a label on this band other than fantastic musicianship and an ability to write some unbelievably unique and otherworldy lyrics. Unia doesn't have the speed of it's predecessors and yet gives one the impression that they have mastered their art. Another reviewer compared them to Queen, and the influence isn't hard to find in this album. Only a speed metal purist could miss the double bass drum with such beautiful and powerful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma Thompson Brings the book to Life","review":"Howards End is one of my favourite novels. I find myself applying it's quiet little lessons to my life rather often and have gotten to know it's wonderfully winding structure of a story quite intimately. What amazes me is that I am even more fond of the novel since having heard it read by Emma Thompson on a rather long road trip.There were several others sharing a car, some of whom freely admit that they might never have picked up the book or seen the film had it not been for the book-to-tape adaption of this novel. We actually listened to it twice and all agreed the the wonderful story was made even more wonderful and lively by Emma Thompson's wonderful way of reading and her witty of portrayal each character.If you've grown tired of this story, Forster or literature in general, I highly recommend a road trip with these tapes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"If you are a fan of British classics, this is worth your time to read. My only complaint with this Kindle version is that there were some words missing (articles and prepositions), But this did not take away from the gist of the sentence. But the missing words were my only reason for not giving this book five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"Book dwells on the divide between men and women and between classes as seen in early 20th century. The perspectives were interesting but the plot draws yawns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced","review":"If you read this novel on your own (as in, it is not assigned to you as a form of assigned reading in school) then you will enjoy it because you obviously know what you're getting yourself into: whimsical dialogue between gossiping British ladies. I do realize how ridiculous and inaccurate this description is but I'm mad because I have been forced to read this book for school and I really hate it so therefore my opinion of it is very negative. Teachers should not force these types of books upon their students. The rate of enjoyment for this book is very limited to those who either teach English or have a keen interest in it. Very few students will be able to appreciate and enjoy this novel for its merits, of which I'm sure there are many.I do not expect this review to be helpful to anyone who is looking at this book as a means of pleasure reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A character driven novel where the characters don't deliver","review":"I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie. I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good. Not so with Howard's End. The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige. You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable. None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world. I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance. The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later. Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry. There definately is an audience for this book. I'm just not a part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Passage to India instead","review":"The epigraph to the novel states \\"Only connect...\\" and the story is about how folks from different strata of society seem unable to connect & seem especially unable to make the connection between the morality of their class & that of other classes.That said, it is an excrutiating read. The characters are universally unlikeable, the story drags along and the lesson--about folks not obeying the morality they insist on for others--is obvious & not terribly important.GRADE: D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat as a pancake.","review":"EM Forester was a gay, upper middle class Oxbridge graduate that lived in the Edwardian era. That is blatantly obvious in every word of his writing. This book, its story, and the characters make no emotional connection to the reader. I was thoroughly bored the entire time I was reading this. Also the redeemable characters are destroyed in the story and the \\"heroes\\" are horrible people. I could barely stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in dullness","review":"I had to both read the novel and watch the movie for a college course. This book (and by extension, movie) is (are) incredibly dull.I was absolute torture to read this book, and watch the two and a half hour movie. The only interesting part was when Charles Wilcox killed Leonard Bast, but there wasn't even a cool fight scene, and no blood.Even after reading and watching, none of the characters are in any way exciting, and the plot is not memorable.Sorry if you're a fan, but I feel I have wasted far too much of my life with this book. If there were a button I could press to obliterate every memory I have of it, I would press it.If you'd like to be excruciatingly bored, then I'd highly recommend this book, and the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition","review":"My review is only for this free Kindle version. There are many little errors and I do not recommend downloading it. There are missing words, misspelled words, missing sentences, wrong words, etc. A couple of examples: \\"Aunt Juicy\\" instead of Aunt Juley, the bit of song that Jacky says when the character is introduced is missing, \\"her began to mingle with his retreating thunder\\" instead of \\"her chirrupings began to mingle.\\" There's really no excuse for this and I'm tired of checking it against google books when I think something sounds weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 4-star book but a 2-star paperback edition","review":"As fond as I am of this novel I cannot recommend this particular paperback Vintage edition. In a work so meticulous and richly crafted as _Howards End_, it's more than a little jarring to stumble across typos and spelling errors in the text. A handsome and attractive volume, such as we've all come to expect from Vintage, but those typos are really unforgivable. By all means read the book, but opt for a different edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Difficult to Follow and Less Satisfying","review":"I greatly enjoyed A Passage to India and A Room With a View. Howard's End shares many of their assets - character development, period description, adventure, surprises, cultural and political awareness. However, many of the events seemed disconnected or irrelevant. None of the characters were especially lovable or heroic. The author highlights the difficulties of finding meaning (or a place) in life for a wide variety of individuals. Perhaps the disruption of the historical comforts of a settled social structure is the main message of this 1910 work. Like the other two novels, this work focuses on the frustrations of making meaningful connections with others during a time of change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book of all time!","review":"For me the wonder of this novel was not in the story or plot as much as in the nuggets of wisdom our author left throughout the piece. Margret shares her views and thoughts on the world and herself with such intuitiveness and insight that it often made me stop to contemplate my own life. Even more, this is a beautifully written novel; I absolutely love the language used by Forster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written","review":"I chose this book because it was on the Best 100 Books List, and it was very enjoyable. Forster's characters are so interesting and alive. They are the kind of people I would love to meet in real life, but unfortunately are too rare. Forster has a beautiful writing style, and I love the way he writes about the fine arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-perspective analysis.","review":"Forster's splendid novel of middle-class EdwardianEngland is presented here specifically for collegestudents, with supplementary material and criticalessays from the psychoanalytical, cultural, Marxist,feminist, and deconstructionist perspectives.The general reader will likely find the essays ofvarying interest, with some surprises: Judith Weissman's Marxistcriticism is refreshingly free of the tired dogmatismone might expect, and J. Hillis Miller's deconstructionistapproach is not only readable, but interesting.Well worthwhile book for anyone wishing to penetratefurther into the mysteries of Forster's work.(The numerical rating above is a default settingwithin Amazon's format.

So please excuse the generalization. Although I found the prose to be beautiful, the story line was slow moving. I understand this was written during a different era, so perhaps this would have been considered a page turner nearly a century ago. However, it was interesting to compare society's perceptions of infidelity and having a baby out of wedlock during Forster's time to those of today. Really, things are really not that different!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Forster Classic","review":"I love Forster. This was the second book I read by him, and although it wasn't my favorite, with Forster it's difficult to pick a favorite. This critical edition contains supplementary information, including diary entries from Forster, reviews of Forster etc. Get more book for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of human being!!","review":"I read \\"Howard End\\" about a month ago. I chose this book because of its attactive and classic cover which is out standing. I quite like it because the author had shown the real representation of British society that classified to upper, middle and lower class society. It has specific manner and life style which is absolutely different in each of the classes. The viewpoint of this book is to sympathize the poor, keep a promise, good deed procreate good returns and bad deed also procreate bad returns, which I have learnt so much from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent piece of work","review":"This is the book I was looking for. This book has given enough inputs for writing application. Full credits to Mr. Charls McAuley. Excellent example on drawing Windows coupled with DCL and then MFC support.

Many thanks to Mr. McAuley for wonderful piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for people who want to make presents","review":"I just received my copy of this book, and I'm very disappointed. The text describing this book said it was filled with gourmet meals that can be home prepared and canned. This would be true if your idea of a meal is salsa, or jelly, or pickles. There are only a few soup recipes, and those contain no meat (and rarely beans). The book is pretty, and contains excellent hints on how to pack jars to win prizes (or, I guess, make fancy gift jars), but I'll have to look elsewhere for good chilis, stews, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as Enjoyable the Second Time Around","review":"I first read this book when it came out in the early 70's. I just reread it. Both times were very enjoyable.The book is widely acclaimed as one of the best baseball books ever. I agree. Kahn combines a lot of info probably of interest just to baseball jukies, but he combines it with a lot of other stuff that would appeal to most anyone. He builds a lot of the book around Jackie Robinson and all that Robinson's coming into the National League involved. I think the book is especially ejoyable to \\"readers of a certain\\" age who remember when the Dodgers played in Brooklyn. Very recommemded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hall of Fame Book","review":"The genius of Roger Kahn's THE BOYS OF SUMMER is that it ultimately isn't about baseball. It is about the character of a group of men who magically matched the character of a place. The greatness of these Dodgers, the greatness of Brooklin was their perseverance in the face of defeat. And that, according to Kahn, is what makes them enduringly great.A must read. Deserves its reputation as a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boys of Boredom","review":"I wanted to love Rogers Kahn's \\"The Boys of Summer\\". I wanted to get lost in the nostalgia of baseball, like rolling with the rhythm of a major league ball game on a hot summer's day. I wanted to revel in the writing, the insight, the exploration of the human condition through the tried and true sports metaphor vehicle of America's favourite pastime.Despite moments of insight and interest, I found Kahn's book to be plodding, self indulgent and mostly, lacking in soul. I have read many great books which use sports as the vehicle to ponder the universal truths, but, unfortunately, this was not one of them.To sum up in two words: boring and disappointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys of Summer, Yes -Kahn,no","review":"Although I enjoyed the book, I'm sorry now that I spent the money on Mr. Kahn. Given Mr. Kahn's anti-American spew to the people in Cooperstown (a holy place!) on 4/9/03, I will refrain from buying his books for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic baseball book","review":"As a young reporter, Roger Kahn got to cover the Brooklyn Dodgers for two seasons. In this book, he tells us about those two years, then goes back to visit the players several years later, describing their lives and hardships after baseball. The sad part of the book is that the players seemed to have more than their share of bad luck after leaving the game.It's an interesting look at the Dodgers in the early 1950's and an even more interesting look at the indiviual players as people after they retired from the game. It also tells us a great deal about how the team was dealing with integration a few years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"A great read, a great story about a game that is America itself. It is a book for those who love the game. In additon, it gives one insight into what those ball players went through while playing the game and after their playing the game was over. Truly, a book for the casual and for the devoted fan.Andrew"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best yet from FC","review":"I've been a fan of FC since 2001 when that guy that sings the \\"screamin' infidels song\\" was the singer.

I have several older pairs that I think of as white. The color is more like a light-khaki instead. And finally, there is a piece of elastic in the left and right sides so that the waist can expand. I've never seen such a feature on Dockers and don't like it. It makes the pants too loose and they don't hold my shirt tail in. I can cinch up the belt but then it looks all pleated at the waist.

Berglund has clarified the textures of the symphonies so details previously hidden come out. Horn and woodwind parts that in other hands have been somewhat lost in the mix sing out. The structure of these symphonies is revealed in new ways and new interconnections have been laid out. I LOVE THESE! My only objection is that the first two discs are skimpy, about 44 minutes each.

They are very good quality and very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad...","review":"Bad Religion is my favorite band. Ever. That being said...I bought this CD because I had money and this was the only BR CD in the store. When I listened to it, my CD player's batteries were low, so I could only listen to eight or nine songs before it turned off.THANK GOD! It was hard to listen to nearly all of them. I know I have to listen to the rest, but it'll be a struggle getting me near that CD ever again. The lyrics weren't too bad, but the melodies were too slow and so NOT Bad Religion. (I read the lyrics to A Street Kid Named Desire, and I thought I'd like it, but it was slow and... awful.) The only song that didn't make me want to press \\"Skip\\" is I Love My Computer, and even then I was tempted, namely because of the melody.Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this. Get something else. Anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"With the 2000 release of The New America, Bad Religion show that they are still one of the best and most time-proven bands in punk-rock. Bad Religion always strive to be up-to-date, and they succeed, they do not end up like other bands, old men trying to act young and angry. Bad Religion matured, and as they did, so did their music. Off course The New America is very much different from what they did in the 80's and it SHOULD be, Bad Religion is evolving, both intelectualy and musicaly.They never sell out of their artistic or ethical values, but rather strive to reach new and higher levels, and they succeed with The New America.The album is filled with meaningful songs right from the optimistic You've Got a Chance and to the silent Whisper in Time and to the closing statement Don't Sell Me Short. I think that Bad Religion still show us the creativity and the drive that was present on their earlier releases, so I really don't understand what the commotion is about from disgruntled fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since Stranger Than Fiction","review":"After the post-Mr. Brett disappointments of The Gray Race and No Substance, Bad Religion comes back with a vengeance to prove that they can still come up with hard-driving, catchy, well-written songs and are more than just the elder statesmen of punk rock. You've Got a Chance may very well be one of the best BR songs ever and starts the album out on an aggressive note. The Hopeless Housewife and the title track New America are other high points, and the Mr. Brett collaboration Believe It reminds listeners just what the band lost when he left. But on the whole Graffin wrote a great album that inspires hope that BR has a lot of good music left in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Religion at their worst","review":"Now let me just say I'm not one of these people who hate Bad Religion, and I don't think they are sell outs or anything like that, but this album is really really bad! I listened to it like twice and just couldn't make myself listen to it again. Now if you are looking for a really good, new, Bad Religion CD get Process of Belief (the following album to this one), for me that was the return of the TRUE Bad Religion. This CD is a waste of your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad","review":"this is by far the worst bad religion cd ever, if your a big bad religion fan i know you wont be able to resist giving it a listen, but believe me it sucks and may damage your conception of what a great band this really is...i know it did me.try no control and the gray race"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time to go against the grain","review":"I've been listening to Bad Religion since my sophomore year in high school (about 4 years ago) and I've heard most of what they've put out by now. With time their music has evolved, more mature maybe. I've really liked all their albums but I've noticed a progression to a softer style as the years rolled on. Some of the sounds I've heard so far from this release take me back to the songs of Against the Grain, even Stranger Than Fiction, but it also reminds me of Pennywise's 1995 release, About Time. A killer combination that should be pleasing to all devoted fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good follow-up to some classic albums","review":"I'm disappointed man, I really am. I am a HUGE Bad Religion fan... have been for years... This album marks the decline of a once fantastic band... If their next album is a return to the stuff they used to do, I will forget about this record. It's a departure from their usualy sound, and that's ok with me, but the messages are convoluted and become lost. They try to attack everything at once, instead of just making a few good arguments. Your money is better spent on older BR albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"When I got this album I was excited beacause just 2 days b4 I bought stranger than fiction (which by the way is a great BR album) and I own the process of belief and the empire strikes first which are great albums, but when put the new america into my cd player I couldnt stand it it was horrible it sounded nothing like BR's other albums it slower and less uhh rocking it is just a bad album there is not one good song on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm seeing bad reviews and not understanding...","review":"This album is very different from the albums that preceded it. \\"The New America\\" is one of the first \\"poppy\\" and less punkish Bad Religion albums but the fact of the matter is that this album still contains amazing song structure, great lyrics and the catchiest hooks that Bad Religion has ever written.In my opinion, this is Bad Religion for the open-minded fan. The drummer does not do the standard punk drum beat and the rockin' solos we have all come to love are almost none-existant, but the energy and soul are still there and therefore, this is still a great Bad Religion Album...five stars from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid, but different album","review":"Having been a fan of Bad Religion for quite a while I have always enjoyed the changes in their music from album to album. Personally if there wasn't change in a bands sound through the years I would get tired of hearing them. In this album there is definitly a new sound coming out, and its pretty good, not something that you find on BR albums of the past. If you prefer the more recent BR releases as opposed to the early ones then you should check this album out. The reason that I gave it 4 as opposed to 5 stars was that some of the songs were just average but there were plenty of good punk anthems to make up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is BR's best work...","review":"I have liked Bad Religon's stuff for a while now but have never bought anything from them. When i heard \\"new america\\" on the radio, I thought it was pretty good so I bought it. This album is GREAT! All of the songs kick a** and I strongly recommend this cd to everyone who is a BR fan. Its an awesome cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"BR are gonna have quite an Epitaph","review":"I've had the New America since it was released and I am beginning to wonder when this cd is gonna stop growing on me. Yes, I'm a big fan, but I'll try not to let that influence this review. I would rate this in their top 3. Production on the CD is excellent, possibly the best ever. If your expecting a 3-chord suffer, you may be dissapointed, BR's music has advanced from 3-chord punk and has been that way since generator. When this cd falls short on speed, there's more than enough emotion and lyricism their to make it up. I was not dissapointed. I reckon these songs will sound especially good live."},{"rating":"2","title":"it grows on you","review":"I have been a fan of BR since the early days of \\"How can hell be any worse\\", so at first I didnt think I would like this album. After a few listens I started to enjoy it. It is different than the early stuff so if you are really living in the past and only like old stuff, you probably will have a hard time with this one. I found \\"No Substance\\" to be a lot better than \\"Grey Race\\". The best are \\"Against the Grain\\" and \\"stranger than fiction\\", but \\"New America\\" is better than the majority of music out there, so if it sounds too mellow, than maybe youre too young, and you better stick to your limp biscuit or corn.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bad Religion Album in years","review":"I had heard that this album was pretty good so I went out and bought it. WOW! After a very disappointing No Substance album, BR is back with an album that stands up to the best of their early material with no trouble. There are so many great songs on the cd... some of my faves are: \\"Don't Sell Me Short\\" (FANTASTIC SONG!), \\"The New America\\", \\"You've Got A Chance\\", \\"A Streetkid Named Desire\\", and \\"Believe It.\\" I have to add, Brett Gurewitz co-wrote the latter and it totally rocks. Basically if you are willing to accept a band changing a little bit for the better than go buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on who you are...","review":"I jumped on the BR bandwagon with \\"Infected\\" and haven't left since. This disk starts off a little \\"pop-like\\", but from track 9 on is quite strong. Fans who appreciate BR's post-\\"Infected\\" work will like the disc and want to add it to the collection. Older fans that are looking for a return to BR's punk rock \\"daze\\" may just want to hang on to the memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"really uninspired...","review":"I hate to say bad things about one of my favorite bands...but this album by BAD RELIGION is really uninspired and kinda POP...this one and the lame NO SUBSTANCE are the worst stuff BAD RELIGION done...The band really missed Mr. Brett...."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Bad Religion","review":"The new cd that bad religion has just released, The New America is in my mind a stling mix of old and new. You've Got A Chance and 1000 Memories are defienlty strong with going back to the No Control Days. Let it Burn and the title track The New America could defiently fit into the Gray Race. Believe me this cd is worth picking up. And if you are someone who is skeptical because you were not really thrilled by No Substance the band's last cd have no fear and get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... Yea the Label Says Bad Religion","review":"I went out this sunday and bought The New America at a store and quickly threw it into the player in hopes to hear tunes like modern nam and no control but instead I was disapointed by the toned down selection of music that played out of the earphones. I've been listening to BR for a few years now and this is by far their least impressive album. If you want some sweet punk sounds then buy \\"All Ages\\" and wait till their next release comes out, hopefully with more upbeat music that will remind us of when we all bought our first Bad Religion cd and used it so much that our cd player died."},{"rating":"2","title":"They finally have some inspiration","review":"Basically, I agree with 'punkvipers' review. Ever since Stranger than fiction they've been changing trying to find a new niche. This is pretty much the result of the last two albums working out the bugs in the system. Great album, '1000 memories' breaks the usual scientific BR lyrical mode and is wonderful. Greg's voice is very organic and full in this and the production is perfect. The track listing also is important as it builds up throughout so even if you dont like a particular song it flows well into the next so that it never drags. The band as reflected in interviews seem to have been newly inspired with what their doing and are really happy about this album and the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as people say it is!","review":"I have been a BR fan for over 15 years now and this is by FAR their worst album next to 'Recipe for Hate'. The lyrics to the songs are in fact great but the melodies are just not up to par. It seems like the songs on the album start off well but the rest of the way seems like there's just no substance. There really is only two or three good songs on this CD (Hopeless Housewife & 1000 Memories) and those songs are not the best BR has to offer. I'm very dissapointed and I hope the next album will be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh god....","review":"Please tell me this isn't a Bad Religion album.I cannot believe they slapped their names on this. What you get here is an ultra-slick, poppy album in the vein of, oh, say, Blink 182 mixed with the Offspring. It's almost bubble gummy, the vocal harmonies are cheesy and almost boy bandish at times, and overall, the songwriting is ultra cheesy.Yeesh.

The book does not cover the history of civilization, western civilization or even history of western art. Many of these random observations are downright silly and mass-pleasing in my opinion. It is quite gossipy as it gets into private lives of artists and tries to make conclusions about their art based on assumptions about their inner lives. The truth is that we cannot fairly judge people and their art based on simple biographical facts known from their lives. Freud's incorrect views of the human mind influenced many people's ways of thinking including Kenneth Clark's.

Really it's everything beautifully concocted in a tonic so delicious you won't care what to call it.This is such a marvelous CD I will simply say, if you're here reading this review and poking about wondering \\"what to buy\\" this is a guaranteed winner. It's probably better than the derivatives (bands) that created it. It includes a few different vocal styles (each wonderful) and a few song style approaches that vary (modestly) and are exquisite in execution.Wow that's a wordy little explanation but it moves me and I hope you'll give it a try too.

But the tracks written by Wilco lead Jeff Tweedy and Jayhawks frontman Gary Louris shine much brighter than mere B-sides.

A traditional yet fresh sound, with simple but solid songwriting. Sounds like Mick Taylor-era Stones crossed with the Smithereenes, infused with perhaps a small dose of Cracker.

It doesn't matter how good a deal this seems to be when the damn discs are not playable.* All 35 discs were scratched.* 17 are not playable at all.* 17 freeze at various points.* 1 actually plays all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all; an amazing collection but plan on buying alittle more","review":"Have had the set for 9 months now. I believe that I have watched 80% so far. Very little bonus materials on each disk. The bonus documentary disk was alittle disappointing, only 20 minutes or so. I thought is was going to be a preview for the entire set or something other than what it was. After reading reviews before purchasing, I did buy clear memorex cases for the set immediately to protect disks, original packaging is strange. Basically every disk slides in/out of heavyweight paper pages.If you really want a complete Clint collection, plan on purchasing some of the 3packs here on Amazon as well. It will really tie things together because there are alot of holes throughout the decades.Movies and disks physically are very clean pictures and sound great. Alot of hidden gems that you ordinarly wouldnt watch otherwise if were not included. I even enjoyed Space Cowboys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"packaging mistake","review":"i am gonna keep this simple and to the point1) awesome box set very nice movies2)here is the reason i only gave it a 1 the package sucks every time you take a dvd out it gets damaged because of the poor design"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging/selection of films","review":"Please read the feedbacks before purchasing this package. Several of his films are not included and some six year old probably designed the packaging. One film on each side and each side has smudges when retrieving for play.

Amazon should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, damaged disks.","review":"Bought this set for Fathers day and now it is to late to return it. Dad just let me know that tonight he found 2 disks that would barely play and froze up on him. We cleaned the DVD player just in case and played some movies not in the set and they worked fine.

I've been working my way through the films and each is a gem. The range of work this man has done is astounding. I've felt that his work was hit or miss in the past, but seeing the films indicates to me that there is the through line of his values -- the good guy wins, the good guy isn't always good in all ways. He plays flawed characters that struggle to be better and make the world a better place.

Like other cut price deals they aren't always quite the bargains you think they are. Double sided discs I'll accept for low cost budget movies like you'll see on cable TV and the like but for a star of this magnitude it doesn't do him justice. I already have the Dirty Harry box set which has no playing issues on any of my DVD's and has one disc per film. All the others were bought individually over the years at discounted prices and they all play fine. As someone else spotted, where on earth is Play Misty For Me as that was an excellent early movie of his with a serious vein. Sorry Amazon, you'll have to do better than this as I'll accept a cheap package both in price and quality for old TV series like I Love Lucy or the Man From Uncle BUT not for Clint Eastwood, you're taking the p*** !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I got this on a deal of the day deal last year for my dad for Christmas.

I figured it was a fluke on the first one, but not for both. I would currently rate the towels a 1 star. They are sitting in my closet waiting to be mended. Ironically, considering my original review below, my other, discount-retailer towels have lasted 10 years with no damage at all.Perhaps it's only because I have never purchased high quality towels before, but these towels have a different feel to the other towels I own. They feel great -very soft- and the Lichen color is very nice. One of the towel's side seams, however, is coming undone after 4 months use, which is why I can only give 4 stars to what are otherwise the nicest towels I have ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks over function","review":"Purchased this bath towel last year from a brick and mortar store. It looks great; definately soft and luxurious to the touch. I did not purchase these towels for looks but because of the advertised \\"Hydro Cotton\\" which claims to suck up water quickly and efficiently. After repeated washing without using fabric softner on them, they just do NOT dry off the body thoroughly! I can use the towel during the summer when drying off after a shower is not a problem but used it several times during the winter after a shower and burrrr...! I also noticed that when towel drying the body, the water tends to stay at the tips of the cotton loops so as the drying process is continued, the water seems to transport slightly onto different parts of the body which makes it a very cold process during the colder months. I would not recommend this towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lint Galore! Returned these towels.","review":"I ordered 4 of these towels and had high hopes based on the limited amount of reviews I found. I had actually checked them out at my local bed, bath store before purchasing them from Amazon to ensure they felt good. And they did. The only problem was the incredible amount of lint they gave off during each washing. I put them through the wash 3 times before contacting Amazon for a refund. Did I get a bad batch? Guess I won't really know. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Develop Big Holes When Washed","review":"These Towels develop big holes when washed. Avoid like the plague.

I didn't know much about different quality of cottons for bath towels but remembered Nautica being a well-known brand for water sports and went with them. They seemed quality and plush in the store but since I've gotten them home they shed constantly. I've now washed them three times and a good amount of lint comes out of the drier so I think i'm getting most of it...but NOOO . Everytime I dry off more lint comes off onto me and I have to use another one of my old towels to effectively get dry...and clean. [...].

Washes without shrinkage. I am very happy with this product. And the price is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good as a towel","review":"The Nautica bath sheet makes many claims. Softer and fluffier after every washing...maybe; but as a towel, it is a failure. Its absorbency claims are overstated, in fact, they are pure fantasy. Toweling off with one of these bath sheets is akin to trying to dry oneself with a wet towel. The experience is most uncomfortable, damp and chilly. My 10 year old Castle bath sheets are FAR superior to these bad boys.Our cat enjoys Nautica bath sheets as warm and fluffy bed liners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought about 6, and 1/2 of my order are filled with strings hanging out and it's only been about 2 months. The strings are broken from the towel nap. With the brand name like Nautica, I was optomistic.Save yourself the trouble, is my little viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Towel","review":"It feels amazing when it rubs against your body. The only downside might be that it's too big for some people (some people like small towels), but I prefer this towel since it will keep the rug from getting wet.

There aren't a lot of products I go out of my way to promote, but quite honestly, these are the only towels I've ever gone out of my way to buy over and over again!

I bought four because they were part of the four-for-three promotion. After washing and drying them, they came out of the dryer with pilling and stray threads. If I had bought them for other than use in a kid's bathroom, I would be pretty irked. I did read the reviews(mixed) before I bought them, so I can't claim to be totally ignorant. I'm hoping they improve with age like one reviewer mentioned. The bottom line: If you're buying these towels for a guest bathroom, or it's important that they look really nice, you should pass on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plush and soft but doesn't absorb","review":"These are beautiful towels and very soft but they just don't absorb moisture after a shower.

So I downloaded this update to make my Mio have better battery but I found out that that update was only for the European versions after I downloaded it. When installed it screws up the PDA and it has to be shipped in for repair.

I imagine some versions may come but mine didn't. After that, Mio gives you no support to buy a software.Battery life is just about negligible. Every time I wanted to use it, it was dead, even without having it on with the GPS function.When I finally got a navigation software, it is so slow, it tells you to turn after the corners. It constantly is looking for its position and never catches up with your driving. Only good for walking.As a Grand Finalle, it froze completely and never goes beyond the splash-screen. Hundreds of discussion groups on the Internet tell you what to do but seems that nobody can get theirs to go again.In summary: never used it for anything good!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Very poor Battery life. But worst of all is the tech support there are no vista drivers for this. emailed tech support they me to change my OS to XP. then I called tech support and was told they aren't going to put a driver out, because the unit was built before vista came out. Also, it's very hard to use the gps in progams other than Miomap.

It's a time saver because the planning is done for you and a money saver because you take advantage of seasonal produce and have less wasted food. Leanne makes it so simple with the whole week planned and the shopping lists made. I've also learned how to plan and make my own shopping lists just from using it.

I had gotten bored with cooking, and was always too tired to think too much about what to make. I had heard good things about this book so decided to give it a shot. I have been trying the recipes in this book ever since I got it a month ago and have been very excited that everything is fairly quick to make, easy to prepare, and best of all - tastes wonderful!

I like the convience of the shopping lists and the side suggestions even if they are a little bit repetitive. I also like the seasonal part of the book. I just don't like the recipes they are a bit bland. I started using Rachael Rays books and watching her show.

It saves time as there's no more searching for what to have an hour before dinner.The recipes are basic enough for any cook and those with extra culinary skills will find it easy to add their own style to the dinners.For me it's one less thing I have to think about during the school week.

Some seem a bit too strange to me, like sweet bean burritos (using sweet potatoes and black beans). Most recipes have lots of onion as well, so you have to chop onion every night. Not fun for me. I agree that they seem a bit bland. It's fun to see new ideas, but when the ingredients are some that I have never even heard of...I was just a little disappointed. It's a good thought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinner really can be saved!","review":"I love this book. I actually enjoy cooking, but I don't always enjoy planning what's for dinner. It is so refreshing to have a grocery list already prepared. I know that when I get home from the store I have everything I need to make healthy meals for myself and my family all week long. The best part is that I never have those 'cupboard full of food and nothing to make for dinner' moments.The food tastes wonderful and my family has already picked up a few new favorites. None of the recipes would be difficult for a beginner, and the author is careful to note potential pitfalls (for example pointing out to cook, not boil, a cream soup and why). Separating the menus by season is another nice feature, as is the nutrional information with each recipe.There are no pictures, though, so if you need a picture of dinner to be inspired to cook, this is not the book for you. Otherwise I would recommend giving Saving Dinner a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"My family is picky, so they don't like it. . .","review":"I got this book, and I was so excited by the idea of a weekly plan and shopping list, but I guess my family is too picky.

We never ate dinner out before either, so we didn't notice a cost-saving there.3. The recipes call for a lot of fresh produce in the winter, which doesn't always make sense. I rarely use fresh tomoatoes except when they are in season."},{"rating":"2","title":"De-Lish!!!","review":"All of the recipes that I have tried from this book have be fabulous!

For Christmas I got Saving Dinner ( by the inspired Leanne Ely).We have gone through almost 16 weeks of menus. I LOVE IT. My neighbour was so impressed by my raves that she bought The Low Carb version. A nutritionist at work ( hospital) told me the average person uses 3 recipes from any new cookbook they purchase. I've used 90 so far. I love feeding my family again. Thank you. I feel like I have my self-respect back in the kitchen. I wish I could email a bit of the joy I feel.

This book has made shopping a breeze and cooking is so easy that we always have a homecooked meal. My husband and kids have loved each meal I have made from this book. The author really knows her stuff and has helped me to create nutritious meals that everyone loves. Thank you Leanne for your hard work in putting this book together. You will never know what a great service you have done for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes, omissions.","review":"I love the concept, the recipes are generally good, but I wish someone had proofed the lists and recipes better. There are ingredients missing from the shopping lists that you later need for the recipe and quantities are misprinted.

That has NEVER happened before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Menu Mailer, instead","review":"Okay, so I checked out the sample menu mailer on Leanne's site and thought it was a pretty good idea. I figured the book would be even better. Wrong. The sampler had both vegetarian options with shopping lists and menus for two people. The book has neither. I need both. I am very disappointed as this book is useless to me. Of course I can divide the recipes by 3 to get portions for 2, but that defeates the purpose of the book (to save time) and the shopping lists would be wrong as well. There are errors in almost every recipe I've tried (an ingredient mysteriously appears in the preparation instructions but isn't in the list of ingredients or an ingredient is overlooked during preparation), the food is somewhat bland, in my opinion, and could use more spices. All in all, a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly disappointing canned ingredient entrees","review":"Where are all the 5 stars coming from and what have those folks been eating!!!! I bought this to have help planning GOOD, HEALTHY meals, but this is so centered on canned ingredients and ground beef, etc --without really any vegetables or vegetable dishes to speak of (the average \\"menu\\" suggests you just \\"add a salad\\"), that I'm not sure it's healthier than average fast food. And the recipes so far haven't even tasted very good. Why not just buy frozen dinners if one is that desperate to sit around a table at home. At least you'd get green beans in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why buy the book when you can find the recipes free on-line?","review":"I bought the book (mistake!). Flipping through, I thought I recognized some of the recipes. I use the Internet very frequently to find recipes that fit the \\"theme\\" of what I want to serve the family, so that was the natural place for me to look. Well, I was rather surprised to find every recipe in this book (I didn't check them all, just a few) already posted on-line! My advice -- don't waste your money on the book. Just print the index from the Amazon site and do a Google search."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, helpful book for the uninspired chef","review":"After being a member of Flylady for several months, I finally purchased this book after reading dozens and dozens of positive comments regarding it. The recipes in it are fabulous, the layout is very easy to follow, and overall it is a WONDERFUL cookbook.However - I already love to cook... I already loved planning menus, creating shopping lists, and so on. There was nothing in here that created as much of an \\"Ah-hah!\\" moment as Flylady has for me.Looking back, I would have probably tried to locate this book in the library. As I said, the menus and recipes are wonderful - but nothing that I wasn't already doing.

However, after putting it into practice, I was not impressed. I didn't care for many of the recipes, and had to alter the shopping list as there are only three in my family. In the end I gave up and made my own menus (which I've been doing for quite a while) and my own shopping lists. I will use a recipe from the book, but will no longer use the menu plan & shopping lists. Looking back, I wish I would have borrowed the book from the libary and copied down the recipes I thought I would like and incorporated them into my own menu plans.Just my two cents..."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive meals","review":"i took this out of the library and saw that the ingredients were expensive and some i did not recognize. what is cilantro and tarragon? lobster for a whole family must be expensive. i am glad i did not waste money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use.","review":"This cook book is easy to use, and requires little to no research on your next meal.

If you're reading this, you have to try it, it is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I really love this book. I took 2 weeks worth of recipes in this book, because I had 3/4 of the ingredients from 2 weeks worth already in my kitchen, and I created 1 weeks worth of dinners and the grocery lists. My husband and I were really amazed at the different types of foods we can cook for LESS than the monotonous food we were eating before. We now have variety for a lot less."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed.

For a while we tried using the weekly list but had a few problems. Many of the ingredients can be expensive, including quite a bit of meat, etc. and also several dinners per week did not appeal to my family, so I couldn't use the weekly list because I had to weed out the ingredients that were needed for the recipes I wasn't going to be making. So it ended up being easier for me to go through each recipe and make my own list which defeated part of the purpose of the book. There are lots of recipes in here that I have made more than once, but there are also many recipes that I have never tried again, or would never try in the first place. So if you are looking for a good recipe book, you'll find one here... but if you are looking for the weekly meal plan/grocery list deal... you probably will not be happy with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"saved by \\"saving dinner\\"","review":"Bought the book, and LOVE it. I love to cook as it is, but this book really helps a lot. The time I have saved alone in making grocery lists is unbelievable, and the saved money is quite a bonus as well.

I'll never again buy a shredder from these people. If you do, I hope you know how to fabricate your own gears...because you definitely can't get new ones from the company.

It seems like the punchline of every single story has to do with Euelenspiegel defecating on or in something or someone. That's it. That's the book's running joke. I suppose if you were an illiterate German peasant sitting around a hearth fire in the 1500s, you'd find these tales of feces and bad puns hilarious, but I didn't. Dumb humor doesn't become entertaining just because it's old. Of course, since a good majority of modern Americans are probably less sophisticated than an illiterate German peasant from 400 years ago, perhaps Till Eulenspiegel is due for a comeback. Hollywood could cast Johnny Knoxville as this retarded crapped crusader, and he could crap all over American audiences, who will double over with laughter at every fart noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"FYI on Size","review":"25.4mm (1-inch) is the quill size (insertion part of the stem) for a fork that has an outer diameter of 1+1/8 inch.

Healy takes you into the world of his main character, Tom, a not-so-lovable, but very real individual at odds with his world. As Tom struggles to become a fully realized man you come to understand what makes him do and say the things he does. You come to understand what role family and our own mistakes play in forming the adults we become.

Hartov is the genuine article and then some.Having some intelligence experience of my own, the Heat of Ramadan is without question the most neatly assembled, accurately derived, and beautifully written spy novel I've read in years. For anyone who thinks they know about intelligence work from Hollywood, I recommend reading this book to see the haunting dangers of reality as told through the pen of a master.Hartov's work is a masterpiece. The type of classic other books in the genre will be measured against."},{"rating":"1","title":"The heat of ramadan made me cold with boredom!","review":"First of all, I couldn't tell you how it ended, cause I never got that far. Except for the execution in the beginning of the book, and the ensuing chase, this book had litterally nothing to keep the reader interested enough to bother with finishing the story.The author spent way to much time dealing with the main, and secondary character's background lives to the point where it become down right boring!I read it to the halfway point, where I could no longer stand it, tore it up, and threw it in the trash can, like I do with all the books that thoroughly disgust, or bore me!Note: there was a movie based on this book, with Christopher Lambert playing the lead role.

The #12PS2 is a little less useful. They missed the bullseye mark here slightly by having the cord come off the plug at 90 degrees, but opposite the ground prong side of the plug. This means that if you plug into a wall outlet the cord will have to fold back on itself under it's own weight and may block the other outlet. Also on power strips with two rows of outlets, the ground prong usually faces away from the center of the strip. This means the 12PS2 cord blocks the other row of outlets, defeating the intended use of giving you an extra outlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't mean to spoil the ending, but...","review":"I'll tell you who cares about elderly people: Nobody.

In other words, this album sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"blondie hasn't made a good record since 1981","review":"The single \\"Good Boys\\" is great, sounds like classic Blondie. The rest suffers from mediocre material and uninspired production. From 1976 to 1981 Blondie recorded 5 great records, \\"Blondie\\", \\"Plastic Letters\\", \\"Parallel Lines\\", \\"Eat to the Beat\\",and \\"Autoamerican\\". All great, especially Parallel Lines and Eat to the Beat. Avoid anything after 1982, \\"The Hunter\\", \\"No Exit\\" and this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"I really enjoyed No Exit and the recent live album, so was looking forward to another new Blondie album. They really changed direction here and I'm sad to say this is an awful album. I've been unable to listen to it all the way through; I just find it to be annoying. Whereas No Exit had a variety of styles, this one seems to be more of a disco album. I was never a big disco fan, but I felt that Blondie was able to pull it off successfully in the past. They were a tight and talented bad. I hope they continue to record, but more away from this style of music. Unless you are a big disco fan, I recommend you stay away from the Curse of Blondie."},{"rating":"1","title":"All good things eventually get stale!","review":"This is another poor effort from Blondie. As with their last album \\"No Exit\\" there is only one good song on the cd. This one's \\"Maria\\" is \\"Good Boys.\\" Once you hear that song the rest of the album sounds boring and lacks hooks. If only Blondie could make an album with 10 songs like \\"Good Boys\\" they could make a big comeback!I can only look back and remember their glory days of \\"Parallel Lines\\" and \\"Eat to the Beat.\\" If you don't have those two albums, go get them now...Even \\"AutoAmerican\\" would be a better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I thought, with 'No Exit' Blondie really kicked off their second career part. Forgotten were the terrible 'The Hunter' and 'Autoamerican' albums... but 'The Curse of Blondie' is just terrible. It's neither fish nor flesh... it doesn't rock, but it is not a good pop album either. I am not sure, what the band tried to do. If you don't believe me, listen to 'Desire Brings Me Back' and tell me, what this song should be. Terrible ! Too bad, here I thought Blondie had a couple of additional 'Eat to the Beat' or 'Parallel lines' CDs in them... but I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Curse of Blondie Works Like A Charm","review":"Blondie sounds strong and vital on their latest release, incorporating a myriad of styles as always, showing versatility and creating a pleasurable listening experience. As a rock fan first and foremost, I absolutely love the song \\"Golden Rod\\". Deborah Harry's vocal is superb on this driving rock song that never lets up from start to finish. Even as the song fades, Debbie's vocal is still going strong. \\"Last One in the World\\" is classic Blondie and could have been on Parallel Lines. \\"Good Boys\\" is right in the groove and is the obvious choice for a single, it should be all over the radio. Other excellent tracks include \\"Undone\\", \\"End to End\\" \\"Magic\\" and \\"The Tingler\\". I thoroughly enjoy listening to this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This LP proves that Blondie is a major pop band! Their best LP since Parallel Lines, 25 years ago.

The band was tight and rocked. The live versions of the songs on this album had more spunk, soul & heart than the versions on this album, and I hope a live album was taped. However, until a live album is released, I will be happy to listen to this album, as Blondie still has it, and is obviously not afraid to show it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blondie cooking up a new curse of music","review":"The Curse of Blondie isn't anything like any previous Blondie albums. It's as experimental as AutoAmerican and The Hunter albums, but in a much different way. The Curse of Blondie is geared towards guitars and odd background musical arrangements. The standout tracks are \\"Magic and Good Boys\\". Good Boys is absolutely the best DANCE-ROCK song of 2003, hands down. There is not a song out this year as catchy and creative as \\"Good Boys\\". Classic Blondie, it's as if Blondie took their #1 Hits 'Heart of Glass and Rapture\\" put them in a blender and hit mix. Truly a brilliant song. The other standout is \\"Magic\\", which is really beautiful. The song \\"Shakedown\\" is a bit raunchy, sort of a Modern day \\"One way or Another\\" meets Madonna's \\"EROTICA\\".The Curse of Blondie is a job well done, but it's not a \\"Parallel Lines or Eat to the Beat\\", none the less it's a very solid album, and musically up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than 'last exit' but ultimately flawed","review":"The CD starts out with an excrutiatingly awful \\"Shakedown\\"--equally as bad as Debbie's rap w/ the no-talent/has been Coolio. \\"Good Boys\\" however, is such a cool, slick Vice City-sounding dance track---the video's cool too. I wish there was more of that new-wavey, early 80's sound, that Garbage had perfected in the 90's, that was evident in \\"Undone\\". \\"Golden Rod\\" rocks!!! \\"Background Melody\\" shows a maturity in lyrics, and in Debbie's vocal range. Lastly, I agree with one of the earlier postings about \\"Last One In the World\\". The first time I heard it, I winced in embarrassment for Debbie. An awful, awful song. Verdict? A mixed bag of well-crafted songs that highlights the dreck of a few truly bad songs.P.S. Debbie, you look fantastic, but how about hiring a new stylist and ditching the headband & micro-mini's?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance.","review":"Okay, I'll admit it. The first time through this CD was disappointing to say the least. This is partly because I keep expecting them to return to their 1970's style and I thought \\"It's not here, dammit!\\" What's strange is that with repeated listenings it becomes very clear that their roots are indeed present here, along with a pleasant evolution of the band. You get the best of both worlds here. So if you listened to it once and are prepared to immediately shelve it after that initial listen, all I can say is be patient. Wait a couple of days and play it again. It only took me twice to appreciate this. Your mileage may vary. It's still not my favorite Blondie album, but my opinion of it has completely turned around since my first listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blondie's Back","review":"This album is one that takes some adjustment for those used to Blondie's older material. At first, I admit I was greatly dissappointed, but it grew on me, fast.

Debbie's voice is great, but very different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative-Pop-Rock Bands Take Note!","review":"BLONDIE is the Alpha & The Omega of all pop-rock-punk-new wave-dance oriented bands. From top to bottom, razor sharp guitars, exquisitely layered musical tracks, their excellently composed original songs, to Deborah Harry's dreamy and captivating vocals, this band easily embodies the ultimate visuals and the sound all pop-rock bands strive to attain. Deborah Harry & Company return triumphantly with their highly rated and exhilerating new album, \\"Curse Of Blondie\\"! They just can't run and hide from being, well, BLONDIE. This is the sequel to PARALLEL LINES & EAT TO THE BEAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay?, So now what?","review":"The new album is so-so, from a fan's point of view, there are some great vocal stylings especially on \\"Good Boy\\" but the album reminds me of some of the Jazz Passengers material. Blondie is trying to come up with some new ideas for a new audience and the material may work well for hard core fans but I don't think that the North American market will appreciate the album. Overall the production is sleek and the North American release is slated for 2004, which should bring down the cost of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad!","review":"Sad to rate it only 1 star, but I can't help it: this is by far the worse Blondie album ever.

Nothing to do with Blondie. Wish they would never get so old...Carái véi, fala sério, a! Curto tudo do Blondie, mas isso aqui é a epítome da chatice. Nadas a ver com o trabalho do grupo!

My personal favourites are: Goodboys, Undone, Diamond Bridge, Golden Rod, Rules for Living, and End to End.So why a 4 star rating?For tme, there are 4 really weak trax, that literaly go know-where, and dont seem to have any purpose other than to fill the album out.Background melody - trying to recapture Tide is High? - badly.Magic - Trying to recapture Debbis 'calamarie' - badly.Hello Joe - simply - nothing, the song doesnt develop into anything.The Tingler - Another nothing song, lyrically thinks its more clever than it is.Overal, an excellent album, and a truly welcome return.

Their last album had a few good singles but was not so good as a full listener. The Curse of Blondie seems more diverse and more planned out. It's starts out with the semi-rap of \\"Shakedown.\\" They return to their electro sounds in \\"Good Boys.\\" The sound of Parallel Lines returns in \\"Undone.\\" They work with a lot of different songwriters. Romy Ashby has been writing lyrics for a few albums. She is a hidden talent. Jimmy Destri's songs tend to be more modern, and have a bunch of contemporary pop influences. Blondie has created a successful album and is the best in a few decades. They should be touring on the strength of this album for a while.

It's just one of those books that. you read to get to the next one.They're just where they left off in the last book, the Mortmain Mountains, and I think they'll be there for a bit in the next book.

My favorite part was when the children were running from the snow knats. This was exsiting because the knats were a little bit poisonous, but the children got away just in time. What was different about this book was all of the Baudelaires weren't with eachother most of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to read","review":"The thing you will remember the most about this book, The Slippery Slope, is that throughout everything there is only snow and that means that the whole mountain is slippery and really cold. Violet, and Klaus, suffer alot because it's so cold and their sad about how they lost their baby sister Sunny. Also when part of the tip of the mountain falls, and down the Bouldalaires go to the frezzing cold waters along with Quigley Quagmire, Duken and Isorada's lost brother.The central problem in the story is that Sunny was taken by Count Olaf. He kidnaps her and uses her as her chef and asistant. Sunny even has to sleep in Count Olaf car. Violet and Klaus attempt to walk up the Slippery Slope Mountain to rescue her.

This is a book you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A way of describing","review":"What makes a book interesting is an author's own unique way of writing, and Lemony Snicket could definitely show it! His similes and metaphors crack me up, and it also increases my way of thinking when when you wonder how Violet could invent a way to slow down a caravan, to climb up a slippery slope, or to drag a whole tobaggan up! It makes you wonder how to decode a refrigerator with very fresh dill, mustard, boysenberry jam, and etc. Also, how could a sugar bowl be so important to risk a whole Baudelaire fortune?

With the help of this person they figure out some of their questions about VFD. But, will it be enough to rescue Sunny and stop Count Olaf. Is there any hope the children?

It was about Klaus and Violet Baudelaire along with their friend Quigley who try to rescue Sunny from the clutches of the mean Count Olaf. It was very fortunate for them that they had bumped in to Quigley because he provided a lot of useful information. The book was a great mystery with many twists that kept me reading. The author gave me a very good mental image of what was happening. It was also kind of funny. The author would stray from the story and tell explain something barely relevant to what was happening. The Slippery slope is an awesome book for young readers. I reccomend it to everyone who likes a good adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant Snicket installment!","review":"This book is amazing! Not only does it have the usual dose of the incomprable Snicket's wit, but quite possibly the best-crafted and most exciting plot so far in A Series of Unfortunate Events. Its infinate twists and turns are sure to give immense delight to anyone, as they did to me, and leave the reader anxious to find out what happens next. There's a shock near the middle of the book that is absolutely mind-blowing--unexpected yet logical. And it shines further light into VFD, and FINALLY, we're getting a clearer picture of what the thing is, what it does, and what has happened to it. Also, where I felt the other books were short and over far too quickly, this one (though it still has the same ridiculously large font) actually seems novel length and gives justice to the story.

Ego reasonably in check (at least by studio chief standards) Medavoy (and writer Young) go into substantial detail on how movies get made, why they usually don't, and why when they do they're often dreadful.Medavoy's perspective is particularly interesting because he's played an active role in the industry since the late 1960's, and so can offer a ringside account of how the business has changed from the counter-culture, director-driven 70's Hollywood to the 6,000 screen opening, watch-the-foreign-grosses film biz of today.No, you won't get the juicy gossip of Robert Evans' and Peter Biskind's Hollywood histories here, but you will find an enjoyable account of how movies are put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"The flip side","review":"...the flip side of the movie business, that is, this memoir of a former agent and producer. The 300 films he mentioned are scattered throughout in italics. Mr. Medavoy writes extensively of the process of producing movies. He makes sures we know he is responsible for the success of many motion pictures. He also admits no one knows why one film which shows every indication of becoming a smash will fail, while another will come out of nowhere and become a hit. OK, but there is no gossip. There are no entertaining anecdotes. There is nothing interesting, in fact nothing to interest the average reader who is interested in Hollywood. I said the average reader. These pages and pages of numbers and formulas and musings about box-office openings are no doubt fascinating to accountants and marketing people. I picture them swooning over this book. If books could be compared on a scale with movies, one might say \\"You're Only As Good..\\" is the \\"Citizen Kane\\" of number crunchers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"I didn't like this book.

For me, the album is really all about Lonnie Smith. On this particular session he was at his grooviest, peeling off one tasty riff after another. His cool yet smokin' touch on the B3 keeps everyone on track and in like-minded fashion. The underrated Blue Mitchell plays it from the soul this time around, all slippery funk/blues. It's also nice to have George Benson on board whipping up some classy licks of his own. Along with Idris Muhammad's understated beat, the entire crew is just so very locked into the mode that this short(36:10) but killer album is the very definition of \\"Blue Note Rare Groove\\".

I was impressed initially of Garland's grasp of Filipino language and his descriptions of Manila life. The narrative was not the greatest, at times slow, mundane, and lacking in texture. Part II of the book was, I think, most unbelievable. The book left me wondering whether Western writers actually see places like Manila the way it is written in The Tesseract. If so, then it gives reason not to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"If you pick up this book expecting another \\"The Beach\\" you'll be disappointed.

That he succeeds is a bonus to all readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't no beach","review":"Alex Garland's first novel the Beach was fascinating, one of the best books I've ever opened. That was enough for me to give The Tesseract a try. While, I couldn't put The Beach down, The Tesseract was easy to forget. Until the hypercube finally unwinds, it is only a mass of boring characters writrten in the monotonous style of Genesis. My suggestion: read The Beach if you haven't and wait for Alex Garland's third novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic.","review":"An exciting read. The Tesseract had more likable, interesting characters than any novel I have recently read. The tale, despite a complex structure, was in the end relatively simple using the most basic human themes. Surpisingly (given the write-up on the Jacket) I found the story and the plights of its characters touching. The author demonstrated a remarkable sensitivity creating and getting into the minds of a diverse spectrum of people. At the same time the story unfolds at a blistering pace with constant changes of perspective. It was really interesting, the kind of story one thinks about for weeks after reading. Garland has been added to the list of authors whose books I'll rush out to buy in hardback the first day they are printed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you grew up in the 80's, think you have no time to read.","review":"Amazingly enough my generation is succeptable to information bits. We have short attention spans and even less time to read or so we think. Tesseract is a brilliant example of getting our attention quickly and making us want to turn the page. Alex Garland is truly a voice for this generation and his ablity to speak to us is not an easy task. The story was balanced and left me with many anxiously awaited page turns. I think even if you had never been in a foreign country let alone the Philippines he captures a very real perspective of the culture. READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and strangely overrated","review":"I read a few good reviews of this book before reading it and can't understand how it's managed to even get reviewed in major publications. The dialogue in this book is atrocious and the attempts to describe the underbelly of Manila come off as amateurish writing. I was very disappointed and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I honestly gave the book a chance and finished it all but it just wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and insipid","review":"I was drawn to this book based on both the hype and the Graham Greene comparisons. Boy, does Garland have a PR firm or what? The dialogue in this book is silly. Read aloud, one can only cringe. As for the structure, it may be cool and of-the-moment and postmodern, but it isn't handled well enough to engage a serious reader or to even entertain a serious thought. The most sagacious, smartest moment of this book is the epigraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maeve Binchy with guns","review":"After the beach, which I quite enjoyed, this book was disapointingly pedestrian and predictable. It was like a mills and boon set in the tropics - nearly 'her heaving bosom' sort of fiction. The title was mysterious enough to have me running to the dictionary during the book but, like the Beach it did'nt deliver. You feel the book was published on the strenght of the Beach's success as opposed to the literary merits of either book.I don't think I'll be reading any more Alex Garland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a doubt, the worst book I've read in years","review":"Having read and enjoyed the Beach, I decided to try The Tesseract - Big Mistake!

The Beach is one of my favorite novels (if not my absolute favorite), so I fought through The Tesseract, waiting and hoping it would get interesting, but I made it to the last page and just thought, \\"what a waist of my time this read was.\\" Again, I really did want to like it, and I understand what Mr. Garland was trying to accomplish with the whole \\"Tesseract\\" thing, but a decent storyline was lost in the process. Basically, I felt it didn't flow well, the characters as well as the stories were not interesting enough, and the ending was not worth the journey. Unfortunately, though Mr. Garland has written one of my favorite novels, he has also written one of my least favorite novels. I gave The Tesseract 2 stars because I have faith in Alex Garland as a writer and still look forward to reading his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the synopsis was entertaining.","review":"After reading the synopsis, I was sold on the idea of reading this book, which I then did over the painstaking period of a month. This book was easy to close and quite uninvolving, mainly due to the large amounts of unnecessary padding, and the simple fact that the story doesn't really go anywhere of interest. After finishing the book I was cross I had wasted my time reading it, and equally cross at the fact Mr Garland had bothered to induce such an awful attempt of literary art upon us, when he could have just sent it to the film companys, and kept us out of the equation."},{"rating":"1","title":"alex finds out he is not as good an author as he thought","review":"Perhaps I was expecting the Tesseract to be 'The Beach' set in the Phillipines. Perhaps I was expecting too much. The Tesseract is a really depressing, disjointed, infuriating and pointless novel. It really felt like Garland wanted to show everyone how smart he is. It felt like Grisham trying to write Camus. Stick to what you are good at Alex, the gulf between a great writer and a good one is huge, and you're on the wrong side i'm afraid. Buy this book if you want something different, but I think you'll be more likely to get a headache than be captivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool micro-world","review":"I love the way the characters are so exotic, yet humdrum.

It appears that the author has spent some time in the Philippines --- as he peppers the narrative with lots of Philippine words but somehow he misses the nuances and sometimes inappropriately uses words in context and thus falls flat when read by Filipinos. Of course I am sure that this book garnered or is garnering critical reviews especially of the depiction of scary and exotic Manila. But that's what it is really - it is an exotified Manila, close yet far from the truth. I didn't even finish the book - as soon as I was in the section where the the protagonist was instructed to go to Patay (Death) hotel, I put the book down. Who the hell in the Philippines would name a hotel that way? It's just makes a mockery of Manila which, given, is a very tired, dirty city."},{"rating":"2","title":"a hip, literate thriller adobo","review":"Garland serves up a literary treat as tasty and Filipino in flavor as chicken adobo. A hip, literate, crime thriller both gripping and thoughtful. Nicely spare--a lot is conveyed (about plot and character) in few words. Only weakness is when Garland waxes overly metaphysical (e.g., forcing the tesseract analogy, or serving up post-modern existentialist cliches). Still very cool.

After reading and enjoying The Beach, I bought The Tesseract without even opening the cover. Sean's run-in with Don Pepe and his boys, and Rosa's life story, could have made two good short stories. I guess there's not much money in that, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garland's talent is present but often wasted this go-round.","review":"A bit of a bummer coming after The Beach, this one really feels like what could have been a terse, tense short-story padded with filler into a slow-moving (despite its brevity) novel. The connections at time seem strained, and the constant flash-backs and attempts at scope really just slow things down. You certainly get drawn in with the first part, but find yourself wandering considerably until a very well done payoff. If anything, though, the end of the book only shows the considerable talent Garland possess but never fully realizes this time out. But I'll still be waiting for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a disappointment","review":"I liked the movie \\"The Beach,\\" but reading \\"The Tesseract\\" made me not want to finish the book (\\"The Beach\\"). I agree with a lot of the reviewers who did not like \\"The Tesseract\\". I thought this book was unfocused, discursive and not very compelling.The only reason why I persisted with this book was because I am Filipino-American and you don't get very much about us in art nowadays. His description of the climate and Tagalog social intercourse are insightful. But author's atheism and the nauseating violence annoy the most patient reader. Persistence does not pay for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper","review":"It starts interesting enough. Manila in the eyes of a Westerner. Garland manages to capture the grit and darkness of the city I live in. Thrilling, to say the least. But when it reaches part II (Rosa's story), it sucked big time. I don't know about readers outside the Philippines, but Rosa's part reads like something out of a high school textbook. It's cliche (at least on this part of the world); the bucolic setting, the pretty lass not marrying her provincial boyfriend, making it big in the city, and so on. This setting has been written so many times by other authors and probably students as well. The third part, also leaves much to be desired and seems irrelevant (I think).On second thought, contrary to press releases, Manila isn't even integral to the story. Sure Garland (being a frequent visitor) captured the mood, the language, the mannerisms, but his novel can take place anywhere in the world. After The Beach, I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously.","review":"An amazing novel. Garland is a master story teller who speaks to this generation. He shows us the seedy underbelly of the world and then brings us into the hope of those above it. He brings the characters to life with vivid imagery until you actually feel for their sorrow and happiness. I read this book in one and a half days and it has remained one of my favorites ever since. I seriously could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely Cool","review":"This book is one of the best I've read in a long time. I can't compare to The Beach because I haven't read it. But The Tesseract is enthralling, the images perfectly laid out and the description beautifully articulate. You are INSIDE the lives of the characters, and the whole story has an air of sinister mystery about it. It starts out a little slow but becomes gripping, even if the logic is a tiny bit hard to follow. You have to piece things together, Alex Garland did not write a single straightforward sentence in the whole book, but this just adds to it's mystery. The story ends a bit abruptly, but it doesn't give you that unsatisfied feeling at the end. It is a unique work and I thoroughly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could I please get my money back?","review":"I was extremely disappointed with Mr. Garland\`s second novel. Apparently he is a victim all the premature praise heaped upon him for his first novel \\"The Beach\\", which although I found interesting, was essentially merely a retelling of \\"Lord of the Flies\\". In \\"The Tesseract\\" Mr. Garland attempts to write in a style far beyond that which he is capable of. The unfortunate result is a \\"novel\\" which is is not only poorly written but actually painful to read. One gets the feeling they are reading a 12-year old\`s first meandering attempt at writing fiction. If Mr. Garland decides to continue writing, I hope that he realizes that his talent is not great, and that he would be best served to write in a simpler style. All in all, I very much regret having wasted my time reading \\"The Tesseract\\" and would warn all others to stay away from this worthless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOO!!","review":"IF YOU LIKE \\"THE BEACH\\", DON'T BUY THIS BOOK.

I have never put down a book after 18 pages, until now. I will give Alex Garland credit for at least moving The Beach along, but The Tesseract's opening scene just sits there for 18 pages. I guess if I want to read a great adventure/suspense novel, I should just dust off my old Alistair MacLean novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"After reading The Beach, I ran to my bookshop to buy the second novel of Alex Garland. I had no doubts that Alex Garland was such a good writer that he'd written another chef d'oeuvre. But I just couldn't believe how awful and sad was Tesseract. It was empty and tasteless. Absolutely rubbish. I still don't understand how Garland managed to write such a piece of crap after writing such an amazing first novel. Was he so desperate for publishing ?? If you liked the Beach, don't bother with tesseract. At least, wait for the third novel, it can't be worse anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely rubbish!","review":"I do not understand how this type of book can be published. Its a painful reading, an empty story and a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A winning formula, wrong book","review":"The Beach was a good book. Why? Because it combined travelling with adventure in a way that many guide books do not. I snapped up a copy of The Tesseract hoping to travel through the Philippines without actually going there and be persuaded that I should. I read this book three months ago and cannot remember anything about it, other than it was set in the Philippines. If you want a suspense thriller with travel, buy Le Carre. If you want travel pure and simple, buy that guide book. If you want to waste your money, try Las Vegas. Don't buy this. Mr Garland should takle several leaves from Mr Grisham: develop the winning formula first, then repeat it. And then repeat it. My advice for a third novel: Call it \\"The Boat\\" set it in Indonesia, have a lead character that keeps Leonardo Dicapprio in work and give the twenty-something something to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely disappointing","review":"ALEX GARLAND SHOULD HAVE WAITED AT LEAST TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE PUBLISHING ANOTHER BOOK.

Of course not..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life's no Beach in Manila","review":"What a disappointment! Less plot than the average allotment and a worrying slide towards the vogue of pretention over story.The idea is interesting and Garland writes well enough to almost get away with that alone; but not quite well enough.Read The Beach, which is a joy, and leave this on the shelf unless you're a committed Garland fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"EASY to put down, NOT spellingbinding like The Beach","review":"I loved The Beach, Alex Garland's first book. The movie was ok ,however it is the writer's voice in this book that is so unique. In The Tesseract, the writers voice is totally different,and I did not find it unique or compelling as it is in The Beach. I bought the hardback of The Tesseract because I could not wait for another book by this author and was totally disappointed. I do not like short stories and this reminded me of stories not a book. I have read books I like that were written in parts with different points of view and different stories that intertwine but this book I did not enjoy at all! If you haven't read The Beach it is a must read even if you saw the movie. The plot is enjoyable but it is the writing that makes this book special. If you have read The Beach The Tesseract is totally different in tone and writers voice.Do not read The Tesseract just because you liked his previous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ride Worth Repeating","review":"I had thought I wouldn't like this book for the simple reason that is it set in Manila (where I am from). I thought the characters would be shallow and lack any substance, given the fact that Alex Garland is an outsider to the goings on in Manila and couldn't possibly get inside the head of a Filipino, in any part of society.I was wrong.The people I met in the course of reading this book were so real. Alex Garland had a pulse on what runs through the mind of a Filipino...the haciendero/gangster who longs to be a true Spaniard, the street urchin who survives the perils of the urban jungle, the mother with a lost love in the past. Once the book reached its climax, I held my breath, afraid for the ride to be over. But when it did end, like most rides enjoyed, it was worth doing it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"...the character development in The Tesseract was much deeper, causing me to relate to almost every character in the book (and there are a lot). I thought the different points of view Garland wrote from gave this book added dimensions that set it apart from most other books. I was very impressed with Alex Garland's second novel and can hardly wait for him to write another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired idea, worse execution","review":"A disappointing book, despite the snazzy screen advertising. The author seems caught awkwardly between a desire to write a thriller, with its potential for movie deals and big sales, and Literature (capital L). The result is a self-conscious, ponderous tale, that never becomes exciting, and fails to be interesting at the intellectual level. Garland may want to be the next Grahame Greene, but for my money the comparison is a joke. In short, the book just doesn't justify its billing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point","review":"I'm sorry but after reading 'The Beach' I had high expectations of Garland's second novel, but after finishing it I was left with the question. What's the point?The book builds slowly, very slowly and when you finally get to what you think the point of the book is, it ends.I'm not going to write in this review aboutthe story line because as far as i could tell there's no story.Don't buy it, just re-read the beach and wait for the third book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, post-modernist snore","review":"This is a very short book, which the publisher has struggled to pad with lots of white space and big type (at least in my edition); but it still manages to be dull. Yes, the opening is quite good. Some of the writing is quite good, but clearly Garland has no idea how to develop his story and shies away from anything with too much plot, as if afraid of losing his literary street cred. So he opts for a meaningless and unengaging structure with lots of jumping around between characters, and ends up with a mess. That some reviewers think this is all a sign of his being a 'serious' novelist only shows how pitifully timid and easily led most of them are. Next time, I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of a clash than a flow","review":"Ok so as almost every one else has mentioned the Beach ,I am not . I could see exactly where he wanted this book to go and in what format to do it , but this ,unfortunately did not happen . He tries to give a compasionate edge to the characters by explaining phases of there life. For example Jojo - where was that all going ? and again Alfredo , what was the over all reason in him apart from a tool to give us a greater insight into the street kids life and thoughts . When Alfredo's tool like job is done he is quickly dropped . He was trying to make the reader empathise with the characters and wasted a rather lot of time trying to do so. The nice touches where when the different story lines clashed and characters interacted .However this did not happen very often and when it did it was rather brief . Ending on a more positive note I still believe that Garland has the skill to do much better than this and eventually do so ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked 28 Days Later? You'll like this too.","review":"Alien landscapes that seem all too familiar, person devastation, and random violent acts. Those are the stock-in-trade ingredients of Alex Garland in this novel and in his accomplished screenplay for 28 Days Later. His characters roam through these stark scenes, just able to survive amid the most inhuman acts of destruction. Whether it's science fiction or the grimy back streets of poverty stricken cities, the pull of his stories is magnetic and inevitable. Garland hanles his innocents of the world and his hardened villains with equal aplomb. The reader is taken, the viewer is fascinated, and all in a deft, sophisticated style. Garland is grim, but beneath the gritty survival story lies a potent and hopeful humanity. Better that The Beach, a complex and intertwined story awaits you in The Tesseract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter drivel","review":"This book firmly places Alex Garland as a one hit wonder.

Hamlet was a great play, filled with exciment of Hamlet's next move,mystery of the ghost,treason and finally death. Hamlet's procrastination is his tragic flaw; Laertes is a nice contrasting character to Hamlet and is a great example of Hamlet's tragic flaw directly effecting others in the play.Hamlet is filled with sorrow and grief, it is easy for the reader to sympathize with the characters of the play. I would recommend this play to every Shakespeare fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare's worst","review":"I am hardly a fan of any Shakespeare: I find that his characters overact, talk too much about nothing, and spend most of their plays inserting extra words in to sentences that could be said in four words or less.Hamlet, however, reaches a new level of Shakespearean lackluster: This one is simply boring, with lifelessly dull characters that can never seem to figure out what they want. It follows the standard Shakespearean tragedy plotline (Guy has stuff happen to him that's either really good or really bad, two little subplots, and then everybody dies), but this one lacks spark, or even a pulse for that matter.Well, there's my two cents... Go ahead, find my review unhelpful if you want... but seriously, if it's Shakespeare you want, go buy a different play than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Contain Footnotes to Explain Words","review":"Just a warning, unlike many editions of Shakespeare's plays aimed at a wide audience, this one does not include glosses at the bottom of each page to explain the meaning of archaic language.I tried to check this before I bought the book, but the sample only contained the introduction. :(So unless your Shakespearean vocabulary is top-notch, maybe this edition isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What","review":"I never purchased this item, so make sure you're not being charged for something you didn't buy.

I realized that there were different versions of movies that reenacted the play and once I watched through the play a few times the actual text became clear. Although I had to watch a movie on the play, I would agree that this is a great play that consists of action and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamlet","review":"This book was a little over my head.

I was literally creeping out when Hamlet started making out with his mom. Of course I realized that that was hundreds of years ago and maybe back then that was OK. This story provded us with a look at what literature used to be. I think this a good story to read in class. Hamlet also gives kids a new vocabulary. Many of the words in it were unfamiliar and old.

The characters are very relatable but at the same time very fictitional. All of them have qualities about them that we see in ourselves and each other. They also have qualities that we want to see in ourselves and each other. Although the plot thickins throughout the play, one still gets an understanding of what is going on. The play has its good and bad parts of it, just like any other book or play. The plot is one that is fictional because this kind of thing usually dosn't happen to people. That is why it is liked so much by people. The play begins actually, slowley, so one gets the point of what is going on, then goes into depth about why this is going on. And about why all this is happening and how it starts. Most of all , the play is understandable. Although the words are old english, one still gets the meaning. Shakespeare put in words what he needs to to get the point across."},{"rating":"2","title":"The play about Hamlet was an easy, fun, and interesting read","review":"Hamlet was a very easy play to understand, compared to most of Shakespeares other plays.

All of the characters at some point in the play had trouble confronting their true feelings, which showed some of the mental handicaps that the characters had. The end was kind of confusing, with all of the characters in the play dying. This ofcourse is the way that Shakespear writes.Overall this was a really easy play to read.

The \\"Mousetrap\\" was a good way for Hamlet to insure his susspisions that Claudius was the one that killed his father. The \\"Moustrap\\" was also a fundamental developement in the plot. It also gave way to the end of the play and the deaths of all the main characters.The last Act was very suspensful and dramatic. The dual scene is a very good example of Shakespear's ability to conjur a tragedy and make it plausable. The end was good because every one died and it left no loose ends for one to wander about because they were all DEAD. There was only one unexplained part of this play and that was wheather or not Ophelia killed herself or not.

It doesn't really bug me but it might bug some younger children(If they read it).The old english side of this book is extremely difficult to comprhend. The modern side is alot better and thats what I ended up reading. So I would not recommend this book to anyone who is more of an action type of reader.

Even more devastating to the book is how it all ended. I actually got to say once Hamlet,Gertrude, and Claudius died I was leaping with joy, it was impossible to contain my excitment. Why? Because it meant that if every one is dead, well, IT IS FINALLY OVER! Finally, this book not only is long, boring, and an embaressment to the whole romantic time period. It has no long lasting effect on anyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that any poor, unfortunate soul that has to read this book will never even understand let alone remember what actually went on through the course of the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reading copy","review":"Once you get used to the layout, this is a good copy to read along with as you listen to the play.

But the thing is, this (at least the title song)is dance music. I believe it was originally released on vinyl for DJs (much like the stuff on their Kooler than Jesus cd).Music meant to be played in a club is structured differently than music meant for radio. It tends to be longer (8-9 minutes) and has something of an emphasis on the beat.Anyway, 'Cuz it's hot is one of their best songs. Rather than being industrial or having jazz-ish sound to it, like their later stuff, this is rather house like. Very 'groovy' and disco-ish. But it still combines their trademarks, 'b-movie evilness', silliness, and sex.Most TKK fans already have A Daisy Chain 4 Satan (as it's on their best ablum), but it doesn't hurt to have another copy of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this one on \\"infinite repeat\\"","review":"I am just crazy over this, I used to put it on infinite repeat and listen to it round-the-clock for *months*!

It got really old, really fast, and I got tired of it just listening to it for several minutes in the car. The second track is just a re-work on a piece on \\"Confessions of a Knife\\", but stretched too thin to really offer anything new.I always give a CD a second chance, so I've listened to it a few times since and been similarly annoyed and bored with it.Stick with TKK's other stuff, and you'll be happier.

I would love that because I am a horse loving freak but back to the kitten. I am not sure where mine is right now but I think they are really cool and if you have a child that wants a kitten, cat, puppy, dog, bunny, chimp, or even a horse I would suggest you start them out with a furreal friends animal they may be a little pricey but your child will have hours of fun and they will learn how to take proper care of a pet so like if they pull an animals hair then with the furreal friends cat it will growl at them or they wouldn't because they would learn to love pets and not abuse them I would totally suggest this cute little kitten."},{"rating":"2","title":"This kitten is so cute!!!

Great watch to have with you for hiking, or traveling in places you are not familiar with. This watch is solar powered, so you don't need to worry about batteries.

It was refreshing to read a book where the gentleman falls for the lady first and not for her looks (although Anna was a beautiful girl). The only reason why it did not get a full 5 stars is because you really do not know if Valerie and Anna renew their friendship. I would have liked the reassurance of it.

The driver, Drew (Ryan Hulshof) goes up to the house to attempt to get some assistance. When he doesn't return, the kids come after him. This was your basic slasher formula. The kids in fact joke about it as they look around. The dialouge was immature, and I thought realistic to the point of being bad. The slasher character was not developed at all. Who is he? How is he related to the kids? We find out about midway through the film when we are read an old newspaper clipping, something every good slasher keeps.The blood, killings, horror, and suspense just didn't make it.F-bomb, brief sex, no nudity, Jenna in a bra/ bare midriff in a sweetly tanned body.

The bad guy half heartedly tries to catch the last two girls who keep getting away from him. He appears and stands there while they get away usually after beating the crap out of him.

That's when the fun starts, it took me a week to get there and as soon as i started reading that, in 2 or 3 days i was finished. I the plot is awesome from then on. How Lestat looses everyone and then gets them back, how the Enkil is jealous of the Akasha and Lestat and how Marius plays them. It's also fun to listen as vampires speak about the children of the millenia and other myths like that and then pick up a book(i.e. Pandora) and learn about them... We also get some insight on what is happening to Louis in the present as he goes with Lestat to his concert. If it wasn't for the slowness in the start/middle i would have given it 5 stars.

Anne Rice gives us some exsistential philosophy from a vampire's point of view. Can you live forever without going mad? It is a worthy sequel to Interview if not even better. The reason I don't give it five stars is because Anne divulges to us the origin of vampires, which in my opinion would be a good thing to leave unresolved. What is left there for the sequels? But up to that point an air of mystery pervades her rich but not too lenghty writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW & BORING","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews!

You realise after a while that the author is educating you for a reason. I now see her master plan and embrace it.From the streets of France to Cairo to New Orleans, this book takes you on a journey of discovery. The discovery of what it means to be the great Vampire Lestat.But I am ramble on to much. Just read the book and you won't regret it.

As soon as you open the first page you are drawn in to his incredible life. Lestat's mission is to let the world know who he is. He is willing to go against all he's been taught. The cover of the book makes you feel as if Lestat is sharing his adventures while sitting in his own wise chair. One of the lines that captured me was \\"The feeling of eternity is far to broad for one's mind, what is eternity? What is forever?\\" This is so true. No one can grasp the meaning of eternity.

It was very intriguing, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book in the world","review":"The Vampire Lestat is the best book in the WORLD... There is no other book that has given me the any feeling as the Vampire Lestat has. To all out there that say that the book is not good, because it is boring.

The saying 'All that glitters is not gold' definitely applies to him. There has been too much written about him already.

What I mean is that it is an absolute MUST to read Interview with the Vampire first. Actually, not so much as a MUST, but more like a strong suggestions. The vampire Lestat portrayed in I.w.t.V. is so different from this. He's not the cruel blood thirsty villain we've come to know (and possibly to love) in the previous book, but a young vampire searching for his roots. I especially loved Marius, and his portrayal, who comes to be very important in Lestat's life. This is not a book to be read lightly, and probably will take a while to complete, but at the end, it's going to leave such a beautiful taste in your mouth, especially when, at the end, Lestat finds himself in the company of..

The Tale of the Body Thief remains my favorite of the Vampire Chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Interview","review":"I enjoyed this one a lot more that The Interview with the Vampire. Lestat's life story was intriguing and compelling. Though the \\"Rock Star\\" idea was a little weird for me I was glad to find that the story was based in his past rather than the rock star present. It was interesting to see what Lestat hid from Louis and why. I like his philosophy to \\"life\\". Armand is a prat, though I though Lestat was an ass after the first book so I'm sure Armand has redeeming qualities as well. Akasha and Enkhl are quite frightening to me so I am looking forward to the next book, I hope that Lestat is able to free Marius from wherever her is."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I cry...","review":"This is still, I think my favourite book.

From there he goes to paris where he meets the infamous Armand and starts up his own theater company. This is the best book in the series Lestat isn't like the other vamps, if something isn't going his way he does something about it. This book is actualy pretty belivable except for the whole vamp thing. this book is good to read if youre feelin' down. it's long and in some parts takes some perseverence but it's worth it for the the explosive endin' but don't take my word for it read it yourself.

It was a pleasure to read, and I could hardly put it down, as cliché as that may sound.\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is basically the \\"autobiography\\" of Lestat. At the first of part of the book, he tells about his new career as a rock star, and his craving for fame and adventure. Next, he tells the story of his life: some events in his mortal life, how he became a vampire, etc. Then the book ends with a cliffhanger set in the present (I can't tell you what it is though : p).It was enlightening because having read \\"Interview With the Vampire\\", I still thought of Lestat as a greedy, nasty vampire; this book told me his side of things, and showed me that he really wasn't as bad as Louis portrayed him to be.This book, along with \\"Interview\\", is one of my favorite of the Chronicles.

That sounds as though I am just trying to make this book sounds better than it is like some people so but believe me I am not. This book made me think it made me think up things that could happen to the characters such as; Lestat, Armand, Louise and Claudia. Ann Rice was very descriptive in the scenery, appearances and the way the characters spoke. Its seems as though she looked into things for the characters every detail was perfected every scene they were in. Louise (the main character) progressed and changed through out the book, first he was more human and loving and thoughtful, when he made Claudia a Vampire he became more quite dark, less talkative and more thoughtful (meaning he thought more into things) and then in the end he almost never talked he hated everything and argued a lot more with Armand.All and all this book rocked."},{"rating":"1","title":"very slow","review":"The Vampire Lestat reads as a very slow philosophical autobiography.

Each character that touches Lestat's life is beautifully fleshed out, and made as real as Lestat himself. It's wonderful to have this book turn your feelings for a character completely around, because in Interview, Lestat is made out to be such the bad guy, or at least someone who is not very nice. This story turns it around, and you learn who Lestat is, and why he did what he did to Louis in Interview. I can only strive to someday have a book written that is as wonderfully descriptive and full of every emotion possible as Anne Rice did with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lestat = Cool. Louis = Whiny.","review":"This Lestat bears very little resemblance to the creature we are introduced to in Interview with the Vampire. I wanted to kick that Lestat in the crotch. This Lestat, I want to offer my neck to. While the author does try to explain pieces of his behavior in her last novel as misunderstandings and ignorance on the part of Louis, I don't really buy it. I think it would have been more congruent to character to introduce an entirely different vampire and ascribe these experiences to him.I would have liked to have had more of this book take place in the present, as I feel the conception of his musical group and his reasons for wanting to reveal himself are not really explained. While I enjoyed very much the stories of Lestat's and Marius's pasts, I felt that they went on rather longer than necessary. I read this as an e-book and even in Microsoft Reader, it was 908 pages!I am enthralled with Akasha, however, and am very much looking forward to reading Queen of the Damned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to 5 stars!","review":"I rate books three ways: it's a book 1)to forget about as quickly as possible 2)fine for a quick easy read, entertaining enough but not worth reading twice 3) amazing, unique, well written, worth reading again and again because each time the book becomes richer. Anne Rice's books are in general a 2. Her ideas are imaginative and unique, so it's unfortunate that her writing style is a little self indulgent. Interview with a Vampire was fine, but ,my God, I had to force myself to finish this second in the series. Furthermore, I find that her charcters have no depth and eventually become worn out. Plus, I have no sympathy for any of them, so it's hard to get involved with the book. However, if you don't expect a piece of literature or don't even want one, then it's fine. You won't be worse off for reading any of the Vampire Chronicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"just pointless","review":"This does not come close to Interview. It's probbaly one of the worst structured books Ive ever read. Its made up as it goes alng. Die hard fans would give 5 stars for anything Rice wrote so dont follow those reviews. I just dont understand how a book about vampires does not fit into horror, action, adventure, drama? It was just a story. It could have been summed up in 100 pages but instead it dragged on and on. The biggest reason I give this 2 stars is because it is narrated the exact same way Louis narrated in Interview. And it's almost like Rice picked up on this as well because over half way through it's like, \\"oh by the way, Im a loving emotional guy too.\\" Huh? Its Louis writing as Lestat!Now I have the next book which continues the story and its twice as long. I only wish I could read as fast as Lestat, but then again I only had to read every other page in this book to know what was going on. I just skipped over the 5 paragraphs it takes for Anne to desribe a grain of sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"In one sentence, the characters emotions tend to swing from one extreme to another leaving me, the reader, not only uncaring but bored. If I didn't have a life, perhaps it could keep my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. In honest truth I found Interview with the vampire a little boring and hard to read. All Louis does is complain.But in this one we discover a wonderful character. A very different Lestat. One that is not even a shadow of what was described in the 1st vampire cronicle. I cannot wait to read Queen of the dammed if its half as good as this one I shall enjoy it inmensely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute feast for the senses.","review":"The second book in Rice's vampire series is truly her masterwork. The book follows the mysterious Lestat from his birth into darkness into the life he leads as a creature of night in the most decadent society in history. Many wonderfully thought out characters appear and Rice avoids her earlier tendancies towards angst. The plot moves with alacrity through the years and does not leave you feeling the need to \\"skip to the good parts\\" that the previous book did.Rice originally wanted to stop writing the series at this book, but her fans would not allow it. The books after this one are uninteresting trite attemps to appease her fans and have none of the heart and work that this book does. Definitely read this book, but I would recomend you quit at this one. It literally doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"The Vampire Lestat is an absolute must read! In this sequel to Interview with the Vampire, we begin to more fully understand The Vampire Lestat as he explains to us about his life in his own words. This story is poetically and beautifully written. Lestat is, by far, the most unique, seductive, and real character I have ever read about, and this book is a perfect reflection of all those qualities. The Vampire Lestat made me feel more for all of the characters than any book has ever done. I highly and absolutely recommend this phenomenal book in the hopes that you will find yourself lost in Lestat's story as quickly and completely as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd in a series . . .","review":"is generally not as strong as the first. In this case, it's a tad weaker only because the first, \\"Interview with a Vampire,\\" was so new and original. It does, however, maintain a sense of intrigue with Egyptian and Celtic mythology interwoven with the entire vampiric landscape. An entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but good read","review":"I am reading through the series. This book is very descriptive and tells the history behind Lestat. It also brings up others that we hear about again later."},{"rating":"2","title":"the vampire lestat","review":"Book was GREAT. Could not put it down!!! Anne Rice has an amazing writing style and i can't wait to get to the rest of the vampire chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST INTRIGUING OF ANY VAMPIRE BOOK I HAVE READ!!!","review":"This book was the first of Anne Rice's books I have read, and I absolutely LOVE Lestat. I have watched the movie every day for almost a week now. I watched it last week for the first time. Yet the book surpasses it by far. I don't think any movie on it could touch the emotion or depth conveyed in the novel. I can only wish it could. I am nearly finished reading \\"Interview...\\" and I am a bit bothered by how Louis conveys Lestat. I believe Lestat is truly misunderstood by Louis and Claudia. Yet I can sympathize with them. I hope that the rest in the series are just as awe inspiring and I hope that Anne Rice doesn't end their story for a long time to come. I would highly recommend \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read Interview With A Vampire, stop there!","review":"I wonder if Anne Rice has actually read Interview With A Vampire. There were so many inconsistencies between the two books that I sincerely doubt it! Vampire Lestat was a tedious waste of my time. I skipped ahead many chapters and wasn't lost. I was wholeheartedly disappointed, since after reading Interview with a Vampire, I was looking forward to the series. Like a bad relationship, I'm glad it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major let down","review":"I loved Interview With the Vampire and I really liked Lestats character a lot so I was surprised by how Anne Rice potrays him in this book.He goes from being a complex evil character to a whiney, childesh idiot! Am I the only one that winces when he is called the \\"brat prince?\\" She made him cute, cuddley and mischievius in a little boy sort of way, a major difference from the Lestat in Interview. That lestat was more mysterious, although he loved being a vampire and accepted it(unlike Louis) you get the feeling that there is more going on in his mind than Louis can see. His character in The Vampire Lestat on the other hand is silly and can really got on your nerves.There is nothing at all disturbing or dark about him, you know he will never really do anything totally evil, hes too sweet and adorable too. Its not really that this book is so bad(compared to Menoch its a masterpiece)its just that if she wanted to write a book about a charming,charismatic vampire why did she use Lestat?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read","review":"Anne Rice is by far my favorite author. When I saw the movie Interview with the Vampire, I immediatly fell in love with the characters, (especially Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, oh! And we can't forget Christian Slater now can we?) and so, I went out and bought the book. I finished it within a few weeks. It was wonderful, so naturally, I searched for the others, and found them better still, (amazingly enough, I didn't think they could get any better!) But of all the ones I've read, The vampire Lestat (my favorite character in the chronicles) is my favorite book ever. If you have any taste, you will definatly buy this excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a Vampire","review":"The Vampire Lestat a thrilling piece of writing by Anne Rice, she never fails to tell a tale of greatness.I found myself utterly overwhelmed by the darkened sensuous atmosphere amidst the pages i read, the Vampire is such a sexual creature and Rice reveals this reverently.An enjoyable read and hopefully more to come...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, disappointing hardcover","review":"I used to have this book in hardcover back when the cover was yellow and had only the title on the front and my brother borrowed it and lost it. I was excited to see that I could order it in hardback once again but was a bit disappointed when I arrived. I was expecting a larger than paperback hard cover book, but what I got was a paperback size book with hardcovers. Anyway, I thought I would put this type of review for those out there who were looking to replace this book rather than it being a first time read. I am a huge Anne Rice fan, especially of the Witch and Vampire Chronicles and was hoping to replace a favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vampire Lestat by Anne Rice","review":"The Vampire Lestat is a likable villian to many. After reading this book, Anne Rice conveys his hardship and pain so well I think that he is more like an \\"homme fatale\\" (newly coined term, huh?). Rice's ability to leap back and forth in time to tell the story as if it is a movie is very obvious. And the story is very engaging, and Lestat is very human. His life in France before becoming a vampire is interesting indeed. And his reasons for coming to America are too. He seems, from the author's description, to be a natural born actor. I certainly hope that any band he now created makes it. I hope it's not Satanic to Anne Rice any more. Just \\"fatale\\". This book makes me wonder how many fictional vampires are real. So Anne Rice has snagged my imagination. The book is entertaining and provocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for realistic fantasy!","review":"It is an excellent story. Gripping from beginning to end. Fills in a lot of holes from Interview and promotes further understanding of the vampire's of Anne Rice. Much better than the first and set to change your mind about Lestat forever. It is fantasy that is very closely rlated to the real world. Reading this book could change your mind about the existence of vampires on this planet forever. Extraordinary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably exciting;romance and \\"smart\\" love at its finest","review":"Can a book be any more entertaining? Anne Rice has blown me away with the second book. The story completely took off and delivered me to another world that is so seemingly real I truly believe Lestat exists. The passion and lust for life and love between the vampires is so tantalizing to read that you understand what vampires feel when they drink. Anne knows how to write \\"real\\" romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"lazy writing indeed","review":"in first pages a young male has a grizzled beard. huh? VD is under control in mid 80s. right. either lestat is a moron or author is delusional about reality. Even fiction needs some basis in facts. I read this once...meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yea!! I actually finished it!!!!","review":"I cannot believe how many people love this book. The first paragraph was excellent! The last 20 pages were awesome!!! The rest of the book was so tedious to get through. I am actually celebrating that I survived it!!! OK, this is a little sarcastic, sorry Anne. When she does dialog between people, her writing is fantastic. When she goes into telling background situations, I've never read anything more borring. It's like writing about some guy walking over to a tree and taking five pages to describe every detail and every thought that went through his mind. Geeze, I'm really bummed. I thought I'd love this series. Interview With the Vampire was fabulous. I love Lestat. He is a great character. I just wish The Vampire Lestat, was more about Lestat. For some reason the way she wrote the other characters, I could not have cared less about them. Sorry, I have to disagree with the majority on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as great as it was in 1998!","review":"This was my first \\"This is Alice Music\\" CD - I missed Volume One (just was able to purchase two yesterday - FINALLY! Have been looking for years). I was thrilled to be able to buy this CD since it had some of my radio station's great songs and the proceeds went to breast cancer research charities such as Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Also, they sold out right away the first year so you had to hurry to get them when they were released. The funny part was that I had just gotten back into listening to music and had already purchased many of the albums represented by the songs included. I bought two of this volume at the time and I still have one never opened. I found out it is now a collector's item -- the same as all of them. In case you don't know, Alice Radio is in San Francisco at 97.3 FM - KLLC. Try it, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favourites!","review":"Ok i first heard Eden Fire which was a very decent album, but when Only Inhuman came out god damn i loved it! An extremely good combination of heavy metal, generally classed as melodeath (melodic death metal), it's an awesome buy! I would recommend it to those that love the heavier sound that has a very catchy sway to it.

She recommended this book to me, and while I have not yet competed it, I am impressed by the author's observations. Although our family, like so many others, came to the United States in the 1800s, our generation follows many of the traditions, language and customs of our grandparents. Much, of course, has been lost in the past 100 years in this country, but some of the sayings remain in nearly daily use (for example: \\"starosc nie radosc, smierc nie pocieha\\" is one of them and the author gives a fair translation early on in the book). This book, for me, will be a reference book in my library and a welcome edition it will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A feast for the eyes and mind","review":"This is an absolutely gorgeous coffee-table book that speaks of the mythologies of cultures from around the world. I bought it primarily for the art; brilliant color photographs and original drawings are included to illustrate most of the stories.This book is also remarkable for its inclusion of often-marginalized cultures. I've seen many a \\"world mythology\\" book that doesn't seem to notice that Africa or the Americas exist. This is not one of them.It does seem to generalize a little--nobody can be a complete expert on every mythology in the world. For example, the Celtic section emphasizes the role of male sky and sun gods, like those of Greek myth, when in fact there were many non-sky gods (both male and female) who were just as popular, and when there are many solar-related goddesses to be found in that mythology. But this is definitely a beautiful and useful reference if you are looking for general information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation","review":"It's impossible to fit every myth from every part of the world into one book, but the editors did an admirable job in collecting various myths and organizing them in this book. The myths are concise and the book is easy to read due to its excellent organization and its lovely pictures. For anyone wishing to learn about world mythology or just one country's tales, this is a wonderful introduction. This book has a treasured place on my bookshelf, and for good reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite","review":"This book is the best thing I have bought in a long time!! It gives great overviews of most of the non-christian religions and mythologies from all over the world. It is easy to read and very enjoyable to read. Because of its already large size it can't give every detail of every mythology, but it definitely gives you enough information so you could know where to look to find more details."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work in progress? Not recommended","review":"I am using this book in my \\"Intro. to SQL Database Programming\\" college course. I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this book - it was obviously rushed to print before the bugs had been worked out; figures are missing important details (e.g., the Schema in Fig 1.4); and the index is laughably deficient. Not enough examples are given. This book should not have been printed in its present form. Numerous typos exist. It needs a lot of work. NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Quite enlightening\\" Enough said","review":"I like this book. I would like to find everything this author has written. Unfortunately most are out of print. Here it is in a nutshell. It is a good read. Just the material on life's cycles of 7, are worth the purchase price of the book. I made charts using the calendar for all the members of my family based on this section. I hear from them all the time on the accuracies of the cycle trends and most of my family now look ahead to the upcoming cycle to see what's in store for them. Recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystical Review","review":"As a student of mysticism for most of my life, Joseph Weed has presented an excellent overview of mystical principles and cycles forces that affect us. Ignore the usual publisher's advertising hype written to buy the book - quick fame and fortune. The exercises in the book provide a good starting point for students wanting to experience more about meditation, and mystical exercises, and understand the cyclical effects in their lives. If you closely examine the 52-day cycles and arrange the beginning/ending periods to fit your personal date of birth, you will have an insight into the real cyclical effects of your past successes and failures. Once you prove this to yourself, then you can use the cyclical effects of the 52-day cycles to plan your future decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dispelling the Darkness of Mysticism This book does it!","review":"I had always been taught that the Rosicrucians were huddled in with that batch ofcrazy, demonic devil worshippers. This book proves the exact opposite is true. Two elements of character are emphasized--perseverance and balance. Karmic retribution for misuse of these powers is stressed. Detailed steps to progress in your relationship to the divine permeates the book. ...Don't sound like the Devil to me!To be fair, if I wasn't already on a mystical path, I would assume from the surface of it all, that the title was an overstatement. Not true. But as the Rosicrucians say, some people may not be ready for this. My best endorsement is that I own three copies of it now. While the book does NOT do tirades, it is clear from what IS inferred, that we have been lied to grossly at every turn. This is a good place to start that turnaround. It is one you need to hold for a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best purchases I've ever made","review":"If you are interested in joining any esoteric society this book is a must have.

Only Makaveli tops this album. The best songs on this cd are Dear Mama, Death Around the Corner, If I Die Tonite and So Many Tears. You can feel his emotions in every song. Although the beats arent as good as All Eyez and Makaveli, the lyrics make up for it. Every song has a message in it.

It's raw, gritty, honest, and full of emotion. Tupac takes us along with him through his struggle in this album. This definitely outdoes All Eyez On Me... this is real. If you're just getting into Tupac, pick this cd up first, you wont be sorry, its definitely his best. Highlights of the album include: Me Against The World, Shed So Many Tears, Dear Mama, Lord Knows, and my personal favorite, Outlaw. As always, Tupac's lyrics are on point, beats are good, production is good, guest appearances are kept to a minimal which is one of the reasons this cd is so good, but the guests that do appear definitely hold it down. This cd belongs in the collections of any and every music fan. It's a masterpiece. Go get it!!--Tupac's #1 Fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Might Be The Greatest Rap Album Ever Made!","review":"What can I say? This album is just classic through and through. The greatest rap album of all time is definitely one of Pac's, some would point to All Eyez On Me and The Don Killuminati. Well me I think this is his best. Well the lyrics will literally blow your mind! Their so deep and heartfelt and Pac was going through such a rough time when he made this. He is not the best lyricist though way above average which is what some people say he is. But the topics he discussed in his songs are some that people like R.A.K.I.M. and Nas could never dream of doing. Probably the number 1 standout on this CD would be \\"Dear Mama\\". That song is just amazing, Pac could make songs like that without losing his street cred. Why because he was real. Pac with no doubt is a legend in every ghetto, his music will change the world one day. Every track on this is great you won't have to skip once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pac's best album","review":"Classic, this is Pac's best, this album is deep because of all the real life troubles he was going thru at the time.

His music explains exactly how i feel everyday. I relate to his music and his feelings. His song :Me Against the World\\" explains what it is like to be separated from everything around us.

Pac gave his all on this album, and it shows in EVERY song. Here's the review:Album Highlights: The entire album.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up. Who else in hip hop could come like Pac did?The Last Word: EXCELLENT album, his absolute best. No other album in Pac's catalog can top this.

This is his most personal album and that's why it's my favorite. This album is incredibly solid from start to finish, every song is a masterpiece in it's own way. There are no big name producers on this ablum but the production is still great. There are only a couple of guest appearances which are made by Dramacydal and Richie Rich and that's plenty. This album really shows the lighter side of Tupac Shakur because it was made before he was shot for the first time, before he went to prison, and before the beef with Biggie started. Song for song this is definitely his most consistent album to date, every song flows together smoothly in a very unique way this is truly a masterpiece. If you are REALLY into 2pac's Death Row style you probably won't like this as much \\"All Eyez On Me\\" but I feel that this album is more artistic.

Well, in my opinion this is the best one personally, and probarly lyrically, not production wise.I won't brake down track by track, since overall the album doesn't have a weak track, but it does have a few weaker tracks than the others though, but that won't stop me from giving it a five star rating. 'Cause this is definitely after all one of the best hip-hop/rap albums of all times.Songs like \\"If I Die 2Nite\\", \\"Me Against the World\\", \\"So Many Tears\\", \\"Temptations\\", \\"Lord Knows\\" (lyrically), \\"Death Around the Corner\\" & \\"Dear Mama\\" are all classic songs.If you have doubts about getting this album, then it's now time to forget them.

No filler tracks on this album, if you are an avid hip hop fan and don't want to listen to the \\"music\\" that we all suffer through on a daily basis on MTV and radio stations across America, then go buy this. There's no need to go in depth and describe every track, because you can listen to the whole album all the way through each time you play it. If I had to choose favorite tracks, I'd say \\"If I Die Tonight\\", \\"So Many Tears\\", and \\"Dear Mama\\". So, as I said before, go get this album.

The only reason that I didn't rate this 5 star is because you will need more than this course to feel confident. The additional lessons from PIMSLEUR are extremely expensive. I recommend PORTUGUESE IN 10 MINUTES a day (less than $20) and a basic Brazilian Portuguese course(often inexpensive or free). If you wish to go deeper into the language, get \\"501 Portuguese verbs\\" and \\"Essential Portuguese Grammer\\". Don't waste your money on the Lonely Planet Brazilian Portuguese Phrase Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, basic, and effective","review":"I teach Spanish and I wanted to review my Portuguese. I find this program to be a nice introduction to conversational Portuguese. If you know that you don't have time to learn the basics of the language, and you are more in the survival mode, this program would be a good start. It may be useful even if you are planning to continue on with more advanced study. I recently was asked by a friend to recommend a phrasebook, etc. for Mexico. Had I reviewed the first six lessons of Conversational Brazilian Portuguese as I have now, I would have recommended its counterpart in Spanish to my friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While the audio portion of the program is fine, there is no workbook as is referred to in the audio. This makes it a bit frustrating, knowing that I'm missing out on the important reading part, especially with a language like Portuguese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to speak portuguese","review":"I think this product is very useful. I am going on a trip to Brazil this winter and need to learn a little bit in a short period and this product has been great so far (I'm about halfway through). Each lesson seems to be about 20-25 minutes long, the first couple I didn't need to repeat but the later ones it helps to repeat the next day to enhance retention. I have surprised my girlfriend several times with some of the phrases and have begun to be able to create my own phrases with some of the words I have learned. I recommend this to anyone who is going to Brazil and has the time in the car to do the lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starter Course","review":"These CDs are great if you have a commute over 30 minutes or so, and can just pop them in and listen. They build on the words introduced in previous lessons and are a very effective introduction. The one thing I missed was a written lesson plan or list of the words used, so I could see the spelling. This was especially significant with Brazilian Portuguese, which pronounces letters very differently from English. (D is pronounced as a J, Rs sound like Ds, etc.)That said, there is quite a bit of variety in usage demonstrated (and requested,) so you do get to (just) start thinking in the language. It's an introduction, probably ok for vacation trips, etc., so plan on something deeper if you are going to stay longer (or have a deeper relationship!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around","review":"I thoroughly enjoy this product! I have found that it was exactly what I needed to begin learning Portuguese. I am an auditory learner so this technique worked just well enough that I was able to learn quite a few things so far. If there were one thing I wish this product included it would be a book with all the lessons written out so I could read how I would read the word I'm learning, although it is called conversational Portuguese so I got what I paid for. And it works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brazilian Portuguese","review":"I like the voices of the people on the CD's.

This disc is a greatest hits that has a couple electric, but the majority are acoustic versions of the songs we know and love. Even though this is a bit of a bummer, it is not a bad thing. Bolan knew how to write a song, meaning no matter how they are played they still rock. If you are a T. Rex fan already buy to see if it tickles your Bolan taste bud. If you are a newcomer to T.

From the first time I tried them, I noted that they were uncomfortable and the sound quality was mediocre; not what I would expect from Koss.If you're looking for ear buds, I suggest trying the in-ear-sealing type--Several years ago, I was turned off by that type because I never liked putting stuff in my ear. I quickly grew accustomed to it though and now appreciate the sound quality and isolation that those offer compared to these (P15) type. If you don't want sound isolation, then I suggest looking at over-the-ear headphone sets. For example, the Koss PortaPro's are likely the best sounding headphones I've ever heard (my personal favorite).Generally I would avoid these unless you are set on getting the hard-plastic standard-ipod-type headphones, to witch these would probably compare a little more favorably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design, short life-span, mediocre sound.","review":"I've had these for about 6 months and the left earphone just gave out.

It's not terrible, but there's very little bass and poor mid-range definition. Again, the only other earphones I've owned recently are the standard iPod phones, and those have a much better sound that this one.I'm looking to replace these now that they've given out, and I'm certainly going to buy something different this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound as cheap as they are","review":"tinny, no bass whatsoever, they just sound bad. they are also uncomfortable because of the way they are shaped and don't fit well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment on Christmas","review":"I bought this doll four months before Christmas and stocked it back for my 2 year old for Christmas.

Valentino is portrayed as an idiot and a thief and the story is far from factual. It's just silly, why they bothered I don't know. I had to actually stop watching during the first 15 mins and I wish I had not been curious enough to buy it in the first place. For film lovers, bad film. For valentino fans, it's simply pointless and upsetting that a bio pic could be so stupid as well as inaccurate. Did not want to give it any stars but I had to so I gave the film one totally undeserved star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vigilance, Readers!","review":"In fairness, I have not yet finished the book. Yet I am already disappointed that so little was included about the European ideological and theological heritage that went into the Articles and the Constitution. Also, very little was said about the motivations and concerns of the Anti-Federalists.The layout is attractive and easy to read. At times, the information content per paragraph is low. Some of the incidents are interesting or good cocktail party fodder, but they seem to shy away from presenting thought provoking material without accompanying commentary. In other words, I feel they don't trust the reader to think for him/herself.The authors manifest their views everywhere but do not admit that they are opinions or discuss how the presentation is crafted around those opinions. As with any book, it is important to recognize the authors' goals and rationale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit of Fun","review":"This brief novel is a fun way to spend a few hours. It's centered around a church in the periphery of a Catholic diocese in the 1950's and peopled by a number of odd characters with a connection to the church--a gaggle of nuns, the parish priest whose the worse for drink and faith, a nosy rectory housekeeper, a progressive bishop with a secret. And, of course, there's Fludd himself, who shows up at the rectory one night and becomes the pastor's assistant. Who (and what) Fludd really is is the core of this novel's interest.For the Catholics who read it, this book brings out a lot of things to think about but doesn't bang you over the head with them. It's always a fun novel and never a philosphical lecture. For the time it takes, it's certainly worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really good read. Mantel succeeds again!!","review":"A very engaging plot. I liked all the characters and the writing was superb. I would recommend this without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vs. evil 50's style","review":"Mantel uses her sardonic wit and clever storytelling to create a parable on modern life. Set in the 1950's, the story and characters are driven by the (as yet incomplete) modernization of the Roman Catholic church. But like the author's other work (e.g. Wolf Hall), the story is only a vehicle for explorations of more universal issues: the definition of good and evil, power and subjugation, and the conflicting human desire for both stability and change."},{"rating":"1","title":"An odd little novel","review":"An odd little novel by the winner of this year's Booker prize. It was one of those books I'd always known about -- who knows why? -- and was determined to read one day. The story centers on a Roman Catholic parish in a provincial English town in the 1950s. Fludd is the name the young curate whose arrival upsets their little world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked, funny, but flawed","review":"This book starts out like gang-busters. It's wicked, it's witty, it's nasty... but about halfway in it starts meandering and ultimately gets lost. I wish the author had kept her sharp tongue.. instead she gets fuzzy and a bit obscure. The writing starts out crisp and ends up blunted, at best. Too bad, because the early parts of the book are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"becoming one of my all time favorites","review":"The best bands are the ones who bring back the past, but without putting a finger on it. In guitarist Terry Six's last band The Exploding Hearts there were moments that could remind you of the Buzzcocks, Nick Lowe, or the Undertones. There was something of a hidden euphoria, because instantly the songs would sound great, and you couldn't get tired of them because they were so sweet sounding.Moving past the Exploding Hearts tragedy, Six hasn't lost his touch. He, along with members of the Riffs, made songs just like the Hearts did: Swooning surf guitar lines, endearing lines, and altogether a album with soul and vitality. You may call it retro rock and roll, I'll call it perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not find a way to mount it to my truck rack","review":"Cool concept on this tie down system but I couldn't find any way to mount it to my rack.

The heart of her teaching concept relates to allowing each student to read what they are interested in reading and slowly become self-motivated learners. The teacher guides the students through teacher oral reading, a large in-class library, interesting class projects and most important of all \\"time to read\\".

The advice she gives in this book is taken from seminars put on by Tony Robbins and his like. There is not an original idea in this other than the literary device of telling it like a series of stories about individual women. Worse yet Ms. Perry does not follow her own counsel. She overspends, depends on men for investment decisions, and still believes in the \\"white knight\\" herself. In fact she does not really play a significant role in managing money at Take Charge Financial at all, she hires that function out to a professional money manager, a man! Nothing inherently wrong with that except her premise is that women should learn to make their own decisions. In short this whole book is a fraud! Reads nice but if you think about it she is talking down to us women who really put our money where our mouth is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great motivator with good financial info","review":"Perry's \\"A Girl Needs Cash\\" is a great motivator. I was especially happy to hear here opinion that an investor shouldn't wait before credit card balances are zero before saving/investing. The book also encourages self-reliance when it comes to money matters, which is a terrific goal for any financial planner trying to help a client.I was dissapointed that Perry several times in her book referred to home ownership as having no ability to provide future income. A reverse annuity mortgage may provide needed income to a retiree. She also refers to variable life insurance products as \\"private pension plans\\".

I enjoyed how the author was able to turn the book into an acutal story instead of just writng facts about enconomics like an encyclopedia would. Not only did the author show us the lives of other people and how their financial lives were going, but she also put herself and her experiences in the book which made it much more interesting to know that even people like her at one point stuggled with money. My favorite part of the book was the section on \\"The White Knight Myth\\". The \\"Money Machine\\" was also a very helpful tip. This book contained some very good advice and was motivating.

While his verse may seem random and vulgar at first glance, The Light the Dead See stunned me with its familiarity with Death as a companion and friend. With this in mind, it seems no wonder that Stanford eventually felt compelled to take his own life.Stanford's poetry is without bounds. The imagery he puts forth concerning the backwaters of rural America gave me chills, not because it was frightening, but because it illustrated the truth about the often violent and arbitrary turns of chance rule the lives of many of us.This book is not to be missed.

In particular the author humanizes the Mexicans -- from Santa Anna on down -- and tells their side of the story with rare sympathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me more","review":"I thought I knew almost all there was to know about the Alamo until now. I really enjoyed hearing the story from both the Texas and Mexican side and learned a great deal about the battle and the reasons for it. Very exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I ordered this book late last week and received it on Saturday It is in excellent condition and is very well written. I recommed \\"The Gates Of The Alamo\\" very, very highly! Kudos to Mr. Harrigan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Texas seek independence from Mexico?","review":"I will admit that I have not read the book yet. I did read however the customer reviews to see if this book shows a more enlightened version of the battle. A version different from what Hollywood and the Lone Star State will have Americans believe. They did not. Not one review touched on WHY Texas set out to form its own nation. One main reason was that Mexico had OUTLAWED slavery, which was incomprehensible to (white) Texians. I'm sure that the men on both sides fought bravely, but the Anglos fought to OWN slaves. If this fact is not mentioned than this piece of work is more fictional than historical. Thus many people may find it hard to see the Texians as the \\"good guys\\". This may upset some people, mostly Texans, but look it up. It is the truth. However I will read the book and write an honest and full review. I bet you Texans can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"new to south, great learning experience","review":"What a great way to learn a lot about the Alamo while also getting a spectacular secondary plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open The Gates!","review":"Harrigan paints a haunting portrait depicting the effect the historical events leading up to the fall of the Alamo, had upon the inhabitans of Texas at that time. Although fictional, \\"The Gates of The Alamo\\" is obviously well researched, and presented in a glittering setting of historical accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sherbet, not SherbeRt - 6 colors, NOT 3","review":"According to the OFFICIAL Ty site, it is SHERBET the Bear.

Easy to clean up and the Flame Orange is so cheery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Lucy--but--hate this 5 box set.","review":"As a Lucy fan, I was rather disappointed in this 5 box set. The first four videos are redundant and simply show the same material with a small piece of something new thrown in every now and then--with each consecutive video. The 5th video is a double feature (60 minutes) and this is the only reason I gave this review 1 star. The \`Goodtimes Home Video Corp.\\" did an awful job putting together a documentary of Lucy's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Fantasy for the D/S afficiando","review":"This is a far better-than-average erotic adventure set in that ever-popular exotic location: the harem. What sets this book apart is the quality of writing by author Cleo Cordell, and the emphasis on the psychological reactions of the heroine to her situation. The man who has imprisoned her sets out to seduce her rather than simply overpower her, and in fact the two never have intercourse in this story. Which is not to say there's not a lot of sexual tension, sensual delights, and a few sex scenes. . . . but Cordell is aiming for a different kind of impact than what is provided by a more traditional novel of sex-scene after sex-scene. I highly recommend this book if the subtleties of dominance and submission are a turn-on."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I got this in a package deal with 50 Shades but didn;t realize it was S&M.

Sturdy, forgiving but still rugged. Break in is fairly quick and I only have a little discomfort initially with the upper ankle area. This is due to the stiff rubber/plastic that wraps the ankle. I do not mind the break in period as this same piece offers good ankle support also. Only drawback is the price, ouch. I have never paid $200.00 which is the price at the time of this review as they are usually around 129.00 to 169.00.Overall a good boot and I also prefer them to the Acadia."},{"rating":"2","title":"This review is probably going to be useless","review":"Self-described new wave/punk rock band Solemite released a single album (that wasn't a demo/teaser/burned in their friend's garage type-deal) before their unfortunate, unfortunate demise.

Shame on me for thinking that these were \\"extended versions\\" of the cuts when in fact they are the exact same versions from \\"Twenty\\" and \\"Live from Steeltown\\" .

It said nowhere on the case it was live, and I am not a big fan of live CDS! So if you think this is a ''greatest hits'' CD with the original studio recordings, its not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Forewarned!","review":"This is not an album of extended versions , but instead a live album (I guess it was recorded from Pittsburg, but I'm not sure if all of the cuts are.)

BRAVO!","review":"This music has it all - from the simple to the extremely complicated! I was part of a production company that performed this as a live musical and the response was outstanding!

As soon as I bought the CD, I knew I had to have this book to play the songs for myself. Unfortunetly, the publishers have it listed as a hard cover edition, when it isn't. Still, well worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordering glitch?","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of Amazon, and this is really the first time I haven't been happy with a purchase. I was TRYING to buy a copy of the script for \\"The Secret Garden\\" by Lucy Norman published by Samuel French Co. Unfortunately when I went to purchasing options hoping I could download the script onto my Kindle, it sent me the easy piano version of the show! My biggest complaint is that I wasn't able to double check or amend my order; it all happened automatically when I clicked on the button for Kindle. So, I haven't opened the book. I already have the piano score for the show, and definitely don't have any use of easy piano music, especially on my Kindle. That's the only reason I'm upset by this transaction, especially after having had such positive experiences in the past. Maybe someone at Amazon can look into why this happened. Did I do something wrong? I can't imagine that I'm the only one with the problem. Thank you for taking the time to read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret Garden had a slow start,","review":"The Secret Garden had a slow start and gave too much detail, butit got better when Mary starts to be nicer to everyone.

I bought two of these for my twin daughters for Christmas yesterday. They were so excited to use them & the first one broke right out of the box!! If left in wagon mode, these might be okay, but the girls think it's fun to switch back & forth from teeter-totter to wagon. And it should be easy to do!! It was difficult for me & if it's not done just right, the wheel mechanism breaks & won't go down all the way or come back upright. Save your money on this one ~ a stroller is definitely better.

Have you ever seen a button flap leather cover pocket bible? That is the design of the case. It's secure in covering the front and back, but does not cover the sides, instead leaving the sides wide open and susceptible to dust and scratching. Also there's the screw at the bottom. What kind of compact camera case has a screw? This one does. You'd screw it in and it locks into the tripod screw port. How annoying. I want to feel my camera, not have it tied to the case 'til death do us part.For me, I'm more comfortable getting one of the other Sony or Canon Powershot cases that are similar in size and provide better protection & practicality. Something like the Sony LCS-NA, tho' not as slick in design, serves the purpose more than well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guide to visiting Yellowstone!","review":"This is one of the my favorite books. The writer was not only a tough grizzled mountain man but a pretty good writer considering he kept a 12 year journal while travelling around the West fighting indians and trapping beaver.We took the book and went to Yellowstone and retraced the route of 1 year of the dairy.

I tried to install it on MY computer, and it took forever...so I just stopped the process.We took it back to the store and got the PS2 version, instead. Yes, the PS2 version is double the prices but it's WORTH it. Judging from the complexity of the PS2 game, I can't imagine how a child (or adult!) would find navigating this game on a PC any fun at all...especially having to use a variety of keys just to move around.I can't comment on the game itself because I couldn't open it!

It will only load 1/2 in my brand new computer.However, I work with computers and made sure this new computer had a really good video card when I ordered it. ALL other games I have work except Curious George. So apparently this game only works with some specific video card, which is ridiculous. MOST consumers wouldn't know that. Why not make it compatible with most video cards of a certain speed?

Sure, snug \\"permanent\\" connections - won't come loose or deteriorate over time. Might be a little too tight for some applications - such as in situations where temporary connections are needed. Once these are twisted and firmly pressed into an RCA jack, they want to stay connected forever - sometimes very difficult to remove. The cables themselves have very stiff heavy shielding and thick insulation, almost solid - they do not droop or hang down, and do not bend around corners very well. Not be suitable for installations where connecting cables need to be folded or wound up to be tidy. These want to run in straight lines or long curves between components."},{"rating":"1","title":"too tight for all my electronic devices (tv, dvd player)","review":"The cable looks very attractive due to its appearance.

I felt silly after buying them because I didn't notice a difference in quality.Pros: It works?Cons: They are so bulky and thick that my TV mounted on the wall will not angle down enough because they stick out of the back so far. You need a solid few inches of clearance from the plug. This is a problem if you need to have it close to the wall or need to loop them up from the bottom. Big issue for no gain and higher price.

Later on I switched cables around, with other brand, cheaper component cables such as Philips PTS1000 (the HDMI standard owner by the way), and also other HDMI cables (even no name brands coming with my DVD player). You know what? I see absolutely no difference even under close examination. The SONY XBR960 produces the finest pitch you can find on any TV. You think about what that means.

Because these are adapted from speeches Nee initially gave, there is some redundancy in the text, which is what you do when speaking publicly to emphasize points. But this redundancy doesn't distract in the least from his message. He is clear, methodical and intensely insightful into the Scriptures and how he uses them to measure and motivate his life. I recommend this to new and seasoned Christians alike because there're some tremendous insights to think and pray over. I recommend this to seekers for the same reason. I also recommend this to those who don't believe as it may provide its own insight into those of us who do. Meaningful and interesting on every level."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spirit-Filled Life","review":"Nee describes the essentials of the Spirit-filled life in such simple, clear, and yet profound terms.

What was once green blobs atop brown cylinders became gorgeous, complex trees in their full, leafy glory. In a similar way, thanks to Nee, I see the details and wholeness of God's greatest gift to us, His Son.Watchman Nee makes Paul's Letter to the Romans accessible and applicable. I have been a Christian for many years and participated in many Bible/Christian studies. Nevertheless, I did not grasp the fullness of the Cross. The Normal Christian Life explains in everyday terms the many benefits of Christ's sacrifice for us and how to walk in Him. Please read this book and share it with others. It is a life refiner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical teaching you don't get in a lot of churches today","review":"The title of the book doesn't stand out but the point is that most Christians are not living what God considers normal but what is actually subnormal. Watchman Nee presents what the normal Christian life is all about and the reasons why a lot Christians never get above subnormal. The book of Romans comes alive and the normal Christian life is meant for all believers not just a select few. It is the overcoming life that is meant by normal. All believers are overcomers because of who they are in Christ but not all believers recognize and appropriate this fact into their thinking and are, therefore, defeated and/or subnormal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"The Normal Christian Life is undoubtedly the best Christian book I have ever read. Scholars have debated for centuries as to where God and man intersect. This book systematically lays it all out in a wonderful way. A must read for all - especially Christians.

After reading this book, I know why.The Normal Christian Life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relief From Self-Effort!","review":"This book is a rich resource for believers.

It displays the American Great War soldier as a cold blooded psychopath, idiot blue-blood, cruel southerner, well you get the idea. The characters are cliched monsters that only a \\"hate America first\\" mind could generate.Atrocities occur in all wars but to depict the Yanks as universally deranged and emotionally depraved is nothing less than propaganda.A badly written screenplay magnified by a level of production that strives to reach mediocrity.

They seem to have the prowess and knowledge of this subject matter, and have not disappointed its viewers - this one anyway.My father was a sailor in World War I, and two uncles served in the US Army. So I have a special interest in this genre. I highly recommend it, and the others of its class. Its genre is that of World War I. More specifically, documentaries and/or movies of that conflict. I have purchased and seen most of them: The only ones remaining to see are Passchendaele and Fly Boys. I have concluded that Beneath Hill 60 is the best (or among the best) I have seen in my lifetime.They all have been purchased from Amazon.

He was perhaps too much involved in party politics. Thanks to this CD I know he was a quite talented and intelligent composer. He was surely influenced by Scriabin, as you will find in both works in this CD. I believe his Chamber Symphony is a forgotten major work within the Russian music. It has an overall influence of early Schoenberg, but is much more than that. One of the fast movements reminds me of Stravinky's Firebird, and cleverly uses a folkish tune. The symphony is a long work but very well crafted and organized. I liked at first hearing, and more so afterwards. This CD was my find of the last months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superhero 70s Slapstick","review":"The picture & sound quality of the \\"Legends of the Superheroes\\" dvd is great. And unlike many of Warner's other MOD releases, a few extras are included in the form of outtakes. As for the contents, well, this isn't the tongue-in-cheek camp of the Batman series. DC heroes & villains are played strictly for laughs, but at the time this was broadcast, it was fun seeing so many costumed characters in live action. According to his biography, Adam West hoped this outing would lead to having the Dynamic Duo in a feature film, and was less than proud of the slapstick results. (Batman & Robin chasing Mordru on jetskis? Holy Sea World!) Still, it's nice that Warner Archives made this available to purchase. Can the \\"Shazam\\" series be far behind?"},{"rating":"1","title":"From an Old Batman TV Show Fan: 2.5 Laughs, 1 Star","review":"I grew up in the '60s watching the great old campy Batman TV series, and so I really, really, really wanted to like Legends of the Superheros. I laughed twice and nearly laughed a third time, all during the second half, the \\"roast\\" of the Superheroes with Ed McMahon. The rest of this dreary DVD wasn't clever enough to be campy; it was just bad. The talents of Frank Gorshin and other great actors were just wasted, and the actresses got to do virtually nothing at all, serving primarily as window dressing. Because it featured superheroes, and especially superheroes I like, including the very same Batman (Adam West) and Robin (Burt Ward) from the original Batman TV series, I made myself watch the whole thing, and even the DVD extras (including a villainously unfunny blooper reel). I'm sorry to say that this is the worst thing I've ever forced myself to watch from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful.....","review":"I watched this as a kid and it does not hold up at all.

The actors/actresses must have received some cues from Adam West and Burt Ward, because their performances were spot on with them. KUDOS to the costume and make up artists.

We've tried everything from chemicals to box filters along with Algae Eaters. We even just let the pond sit for a month to see if the algae would die. Our water would be filtered through a pump and box filter then down a waterfall for good circulation and nothing worked! Every time we changed the water, 2-3 days later the pond would be a bright green color and you couldn't even see 2 inches into the pond.We bought this filter in combination with their 2,000 gallon per hour pump and within 3 days we could see a slight difference. We were able to see the stems on our plants up to about 6 inches deep. Two days later (5 total) we could see the bottom of the pond (24 inches) and by day 7, the water was crystal clear. So far, no performance problems. I'll update this review if I have any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"We bought this filter a year ago and it's still going strong!

Shows a complete lack of understanding of the space industry. Was amused by the other reviewers (Lou Dobbs as NASA Administrator--I guess wasting tens of millions on Space.com wasn't enough for the reviewer). Seems that the other reviews were written by people more interested in space as an idea than as a business. Lou Dobbs should stick to what he does best -- being a business newscaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth behind SLAVE.com","review":"After a procession of inept Upper Management Lou 'writing' a book 'profiting from his experience' there is a joke.His continued micromanagment and focus on things that didn't really matter in the long term run of the company proved to be a complete waste of time.And some of the Upper management that allowed him to do that were just as guilty of the inevitable failure of the company. While he can be a very charming man, his penchant for megalomania proved to be the detriment of the company.If this is an example on how to run a company, then this should be rephrased on how not to run a company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"Mr. Dobbs's personal interest in space is genuine. So is mine. But to claim that space and business are on the verge of an explosive boom - well, that was over-optimistic even before the Columbia disaster. Now it looks as unlikely as ever.........unless of course American companies are willing to out-source satellite-launching to foreign countries like China, at a fraction of the cost in the US. That's the only hope for a boom in space-related businesses, and the more down-to-Earth solution.A handful of super-rich space-tourists willing to risk their lives on a Russian rocket are simply not enough to make an industry. Besides, manned spaceflight is now on indefinite hold in the US, which renders space tourism stillborn, at least in the US.Mr. Dobbs ought to plant his feet firmly in the ground of reality and make a choice at some point which scenario he prefers. The premises of this book are at best premature - at worst totally unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is junk","review":"Lou Dobbs is a national embarrassment. He obviously doesn't know how to think straight, as this book clearly shows. It is totally unrealistic. Space is not the next business frontier unless we are willing to hand over the satellite launch business and space tourism business to the low-cost and reliable Chinese. And that's something Dobbs does not realize in his wildest fantasy. This guy has zero imagination and clearly doesn't know how to make money. I wish I could give it zero star as it doesn't deserve any. The author of this book belongs in a lunatic asylum."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Next Frontier?","review":"Why not let the Chinese make all our rockets to space, under contract from Boeing? After all, their manned spaceflight is a success. Besides, EVERYTHING is now made in China at a fraction of the cost here. This way space business is guaranteed a future. The next frontier indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Up Lou","review":"It is very ironic that outsourceing to China, the only hope for a boom in the satellite launching business, is repeatedly and heavily criticized by Lou Dobbs's Moneyline on CNN. I see no alternative when the Chinese can do it cheaply and safely while our own space program is not going anywhere. Lou, watch the news as the Chinese send a man to space later this week. And if this doesn't open your eyes, talk to executives at Boeing and ask them what they think of your views. And I haven't even mentioned the numerous technical errors in this book which have been covered clearly and hilariously by somebody else."},{"rating":"1","title":"China: the Next Hope for Space","review":"Lou does not have the wits to realize that China is the only hope for future space business.

I was first introduced to it while whatching a great (and funny) movie called NOTHING TO LOSE. The main character had accidentally lit his shoes on fire and was dancing around to this song trying to put out the fire on his shoes. It was hilarious, and the song was an excellent choice, for it really emphazised the excitement and hurry the man was in to put out the fire.The song starts out with just a jumble of \\"un-lyrics\\" if you will. The artist merely makes quick noises with his tongue. It is very interesting and creative. Then the actual song is just excellent. With the fast, deep singing, about how anybody can do anything. Its a great song: Inspiring. Creative. Fantastically wonderful!Order this single RIGHT NOW! You won't regret it!

The first thing I noticed was how raw it seemed compared to their highly polished later works. Far from making this a worse album than those it just makes it equally good in a different way. It struck me how much Dempsey's voice resembles Bush frontman Gavin Rossdales in this album and even some of the music was Bushesque which I loved being a huge fan of that band. If your only into Something for Kate for their radio friendly pop songs then this album probably isn't for you but any true fan of the band should definately get this.

It runs at one temp and one temp only on my range and never empty.Do NOT buy this set if you expect, as I did, that the company will stand behind their product. In fact, I'd stay away from Emerilware, T-Fal, All-Clad and Cephalon as the letter sent to me indicates that they are all the same, extremely non-customer focused, company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent set for the money!","review":"We have been using Analon Professional for years supplemented with some specialty pans. I bought one of the Emeril non stick pans to replace our worn Analon and fell in love with it. It truly needs no oil or better to saute something or cook scrambled eggs.

We both love the set. We have only had it for two weeks but have been very happy with the pieces. As written before the handles do get hot--they are not covered with a heat resistant material. I expected that. We cannot put them in the dishwasher, which I prefer and they still wash very easily. Yes, food gets stuck around the handle rivets--I would rather have that than handles that are merely welded on and fall off easily. Wanting to keep the pans for more than a year, we only own wooden spoons and plastic spatulas. Tonight while washing the skillet, my husband noticed there are the beginnings of scratches on the bottom. Considering how careful we are--these were an expensive purchase for us--we are shocked. If these are going to scratch that easily, I don't know what we did wrong, we're going to return them and get the same thing but the Costco brand at a much lower cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you love Pool like I do this book is a great read.It's filled with great stories of the best players of the older generation.The writers style will keep you hooked till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted to be a professional like these guys!","review":"This is a great book for all the baby boomers out there that loved to play pool (pocket billiards).

To live in Little Egypt during the early 40's shooting pool with Minnesota Fats would've been incredible. Or riding with Sonny Barger in the mid 60's or any other kind of walk on the wild side fantasy one could concoct.The author clearly feels the same way in a midlife crisis sort of way. The subject matter is definitely fascinating, but I wish R.A. Dyer could've taken himself out of the text more. The book reads like he learned all his tough guy speech patterns from Scorcese films.Another thing that would've helped the prose is to explain the games more within the text.

The car seat just rests on top of the frame and you have to rely on the flimsy little strap to keep the car seat in. That's fine for level sidewalks, but not much else.

Our Baby Trend Latch-Loc infant car seat doesn't actually \\"snap\\" onto the snap bar, but it is pretty secure when you strap it in (you should thread the straps through the sides as if you are threading a seat belt in a car for best security).

Instead of using the bar the manual suggests, just use the BT Bar and screw it in at the Snap Bar position III. The carseat snaps on much more securely on to that bar than the one they suggest. You have to wedge your fingers between the stroller bar and the release handle of the carseat in order to remove the carseat from the base, but you easily get the hang of it. I have found the Snap 'N Go to be a wonderful product that works great with the Graco Snug Ride. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because you really can't use it once your baby grows out of their carseat (which mine has and he's only 7 months).

The problem is that the Eddie Bauer carrier is only held in place by a strap - it DOES NOT LOCK INTO PLACE, like all of the other carriers would. Now, it may seem that why not use just the strap - well, the strap is the SECOND saftey mechanism for the seat...and really should not be used as the only one b/c when you move the stroller the seat moves around....the latch is for a reason, and if you cannot securely latch the carrier - they should NEVER instruct you to be able to use it - just to make the $$.

Considering I'm a very small lady, and was in a lot of pain during the last part of my pregnancy (due to my huge baby), that's saying a LOT. My husband has been very impressed with this item as well. It turns easily, but the wheels are big enough not to get stuck in gravel or grass. Plus, I got to choose the carrier I wanted. I love not having a bulky stroller to push around or try to shove into the back of my small car. Definitely a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Easy to Use","review":"We had not registred for this but a friend who saw that we were registered for an \\"infant\\" car seat (that pops in/out of base for carrying) said that this was a must have. In terms of portability - it is very light and very manuverable (can steer with one hand). Once assembled - it is very easy to set up and get the baby in/out quickly. Makes trips to the store easy. We returned our other stroller once we received this as a gift. We will be sad to see it go when our son grows out of his infant car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Convenient","review":"This stroller is the perfect alternative to those so-called light weight travel systems. After having my second c-section, I needed something light weight and convenient - this was it. Easy to fold, easy access to a generous-sized basket, and most of all, baby stays asleep in carseat. If only the frame could fold with the wheels down instead of up by the handle - I would have given this product five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woonderful Gift","review":"I loved this CD so much I just ordered on as a gift.

Turns out she's an overtly Christian artist, and all of the arrangements sound about the same. Very pretty, but predictable. I was very excited by the possibilities of this CD, but disappointed by the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gift : Christmas Carols in a New Light..","review":"This cd has an angelic quality.. I have never heard the carols sung here more reverently performed.. moreover they are classicly done, and Corrinne May's voice shines through the new arrangements like that star over Bethlehem must have shown for all mankind back on that magic birthday, the birthday of Our Lord, Jesus. The true meaning of Christmas is captured for all time.. like fine art, a treasure to be cherished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roadpro Sandwich maker","review":"this is a good product to buy IFFFF you are patient and you are going on a long trip or offroading like myself. i personally dont like cold sandwiches, not get offensive, i like my sandwiches with the cheese melted that i cant even take a bite becuase of how hot it is.

No wonder the Coen brothers (and about every other crime writer and noir director) has been so attracted to Hammett. The guy can write. Makes me want to go watchYojimbo,Blood Simple,Miller's Crossing, andLast Man Standingagain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Hammett in one neat bundle...","review":"Hammett is a master of fast-paced narrative and snappy dialogue. He wastes neither his own time nor that of the reader's with unnecessary characterization or flowery descriptions. The intensity of his writing is most evident in \\"Red Harvest\\" with its numerous characters and non-stop action. The clever story builds, along with the levels of suspense and violence, to depict a savage world in the heartland of America. Far better than the jovial \\"The Thin Man\\" or the lingering \\"Maltese Falcon,\\" \\"Red Harvest\\" showcases all that Hammett did best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Noir","review":"This is vintage noir and Hammet at his best. However, that being said, David Goodis still rules the nest in this genre form...for while Hammet created the form and excelled at it...Goodis took it a step farther, elevating the form from being about detection to the dark gravel that exists in the grime of the human spirit..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yojimbo! After the Falcon, my favorite Hammett","review":"This book is the source for the movie Yojimbo and its American remakes. I did not like it over much the first time I read it, but when I reread all of Hammett I found I liked it more than any except the Maltese Falcon.It is much less violent than modern riffs on the theme -- and there are many -- but somehow Hammett captures a hardness and ruthlessness that no-one else (not Ellroy or Thompson or Vachss) quite can.And the prose is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While this novel may have an important place in the history of crime fiction it is simply an awful read. The plot is convoluted and the violence is over the top. If you were going to read only one Dashiell Hammett novel please make it The Maltese Falcon which I have read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Hammett at his best.

When i've heard Outside Looking In,with the other interpretation to \\"It Hurts me too\\",i've tought you've done so right.It touch me inside my soul with rare feelings! This is an album to be heard for so long long many times... An album of a blues guitar man with his own way to play slide guitar,like only few men ever did with this competency!!! Great album Hole,and of course all of your fans at all of the corners in the world...they're happier than never!!! Thanks a LOT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"It's my own fault for not checking the size of this book before I bought it. I was hoping for a usuable cook book but this is more like a coffee table decoration. Fortunatly this is a gift from my 5 yr old and this person has coffee table-type books lying around. The pictures are all like charcoal sketches. It's ok but I probably wouldn't spend $10 again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this for the History, not the Quality","review":"I was very unhappy with the Tech Quality of this DVD. The master they used for the \\"Popeye meets Sinbad the Sailor\\" short was very bad. It almost looks like they found the film in someones basement.If you want to see some history making animation this might be worth the $10 but don't expect any better quality that you get on TV.I give it 0 stars for the quality and 2 for the animation history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to Rent, but Not to Buy","review":"I found this DVD for rent and I am glad that I did. The transfer appears to have either been horribly botched or done from a low quality original. This is sad.Does anyone have a print of \\"Ali Baba\\" where the soundtrack in the final big fight scene is in sync ? I have not seen one yet.One star 'cause someone took the effort to put these classics on DVD, but 0 stars for the lack-of-quality of the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic new wave from the mid 70's","review":"I bought this when it first came out on vinyl and then recently I watched their DVD \\"...With the Wild Crowd\\" and got nostalgic. I saw them live once in the early 80's in Portland and it was just like that. Here though I had forgotten how terrible their cover of \\"Downtown\\" is. But that's forgivable considering everything else on here is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely recommended","review":"I see \\"Wild Planet\\" as the B-52's masterpiece as opposed to this debut album like most people, but I still recommend it. Despite a couple of clunkers, \\"Rock Lobster,\\" \\"52 Girls,\\" \\"Planet Claire,\\" \\"Lava,\\" and \\"There's A Moon In The Sky\\" make this album worth owning. Plus, it started off what was, for a few years, one of the weirdest and most offbeat bands in music history (at least, for a couple of albums). I don't really see the appeal of \\"Dance This Mess Around\\" though-- it's a bit grating."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Outgrabe's \\"Love Cream Pie,\\" you'll love this album!","review":"The B-52s are my favorite old-time band! Super bouncy and fun, with that weird double-throwback thing going on. Whenever I feel like a trip to the 60's via the 80's I pop on the B-52s, and this first album is their best! Let's hear it for girl singers, ironic commentary, and guitars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy","review":"The B-52's self titled album is a mixture of both surf-rock and new wave-rock. Most of the songs are fairly basic, but the B-52's are able to take full advantage of simplicity. The lyrics are very original, and the songs have an upbeat feel. I'd have to say that this is one of my favorite CD's, and it's a top priority when I'm throwing a party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defining An Era","review":"It was 1979 and the B-52s were on Saturday Night Live. I was in AWE. Yes they did \\"Rock Lobster\\" and \\"Dance This Mess Around\\". When they were doing the latter, my parents walked in from a night out and my mother said \\"what is THIS???\\" Of course, the very next day I got the album. \\"Planet Claire\\", \\"There's a Moon In The Sky (Called the Moon)\\" are all great.The B-52s have better songs on later albums (\\"Housework\\", \\"Wig\\", \\"Song for a Future Generation\\", \\"Mesopotamia\\"), but this overall defined an era in my life that I still love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreverent fun","review":"Looking for something fun?

I'm not even sure how to categorize this. Surfing music on crack? Whatever it is, it's too weird for l'il 'ol me, and that's all I really gotta say about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"sappie rides again","review":"L'Amour does a great job of maintaining the drama with foreshadowing and a twisting plot line. However, the ending is sappie in the 1940's and 50's hollwood movie tradition. The lovelorn will probably like the ending but since this genre would appear to be directed toward male readers, of which there is a decreasing number, it comes off as sappie."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharp, witty prose","review":"Ellen Currie's prose is tight and vivid.

Ms. Baldwin's personal journaling experience is honest and open, much as she is in person, and gives permission to be the same when one is journaling. Her encouragement and examples made me return to journaling after many years' hiatus.I would recommend \\"One to One\\" for anyone who wants the opportunity to reflect upon their life's journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Advice","review":"I guess I was expecting more from this book. I didn't get a lot out of it other than standard journal-writing advice like using free association and looking back at older journals for patterns. The author seemed more concerned with working out her own problems with writing by putting a lot of her own entries into this book. I can't think of a single thing that I will use from this book in my own journaling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful journaling resource","review":"This is a wonderful book on journaling.

There are also 5 other journaling books in the Healing Journey series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best!","review":"I admit,I hate puzzle games. But they mixed up action and a story in Meteos,which makes it really fun. You use te touch screen 100% of the time (inless you want to use buttons at the menus). There are lots of planets to destroy,but teh game can be easy sometimes. Overall,this is a great game. YOU should buy it if you have a DS"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME GAME!","review":"When I bought this game and started it I didn't really give it a chance. Now that I picked it back up I have found a new love (and hate...get to that in a moment) for the game. The only thing i would recommend would be to use the stylus to control it because if you use the d-pad then the game is much too hard. Now the thing i hate about it is that i can't sleep at night after playing it...i see the meteos in my head and still play it even if the game isn't in front of me. Excellent game and one I'm glad I gave a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this game. It has elements of other puzzle games but is different (see other reviews).

It can be easy or very challenging and you get to decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, difficult, engaging","review":"This game is very difficult and is up there with Tetris. I actually think it is much more difficult to keep up with Meteos, but it's a great game and you'll definitely enjoy playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific...a must-have!","review":"This game...wow, what can I say? This is the best game I have for the DS, one that I find myself going back to over, and over, and over again. The premise is simple...combine like-colored \\"meteos\\" in an attempt to launch them into space, should the planet's gravity permit it. It's a creative, fun variation on Tetris, and offers a ton of unlockables, several different modes, and a multiplayer option that is incredibly intense and enjoyable. The graphics are great, with bright, vibrant colors, and the music, believe it or not, is actually quite good, with different tunes for each planet. In short, a great puzzler, perhaps the best game out there for DS right now...get yours today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, Useful, and Fun!!!","review":"I have purchased this item multiple times for all of my friends expecting a little one. The baby thermometer works wonders when a little one progress from using a baby bathtub to being alone in the big bath tub. I was always afraid of giving a little one a bath in hot water and I was always giving my little one a cold bath. With this thermometer, I never have to worry about the temperature of the bath water again. The kids love it as well. It is very durable and the kids love to play with it.The way it works is by dunking the thermometer in the water for a few seconds. As long as you see green numbers on the thermometer, the water is good. If the number is blue, it is either regressing or progressing and you need to adjust the temperature as needed. All of my friends love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 99% of what you'll hear on the radio","review":"I've heard Fergus McCormick play in New York, and his songwriting is some the best around.

But they're all great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic introduction into Gigabit Ethernet","review":"This book is fantastic if you need to get a grasp of Gigabit Ethernet fairly quickly. The explanations are clear and concise and it's fairly easy to read. I skipped the first couple of chapters because I wasn't concerned with some of the historical perspective, and the book was still very readable.It has the best explanation of 8b/10b encoding and autoconfiguration I've found as well as doing a good job describing the differences between Gigabit Ethernet and the 10Mbps and 100Mbps versions.There's even a little humor to spice the book up. It is bad engineering humor, but humor nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much obsolete information!","review":"Everything here was written before the actual Gigabit Ethernet we use today was finished,, so this book is just too old to be of much use today. Most of the technical facts are about things that might have been, rather than about things that are.This would have been a great book in it's day, and a re-write in the same style describing Gigabit Ethernet as it is actually implemented would be much appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Source On Ethernet","review":"An excellent and must have book on ethernet.

I was skeptical as I've never ordered jewelry on-line, but I must say that I was very pleasantly surprized.

It left me wondering if there wasn't much change in medical education over the past 60 years, since there's not much mention of developments in the latter half of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Bonita Boyd is unbelievable. Her artistry is so real and so spiritual that it speaks to anyone. Mo matter what she is playing, she plays the flute like she is a virtuosic singer.

I was, however, surprised that at times the writing struck me as a bit mundane. Some descriptions were rather repetitive or unimaginative, and some of the things that the characters said almost made me roll my eyes and think, \\" Oh, please! \\". I was also a bit disappointed that many issues were left unresolved, such as the fact that Sara never did tell her birth mother, whom she became friends with, who she really was. Obviously, this leaves the door open for the sequel, which I do intend to read. The people are interesting and mostly likable, and you want to get to know them better. But I would like to see the writing become a bit more original and imaginative. Still, this is a pretty good first effort, and I look forward to more from Kinkade and Spencer."},{"rating":"1","title":"More branded product masking as substance","review":"Yet another offering from the Kinkade art product assembly line.

It was obviously written with the idea of sequels in mind - there were just too many unresolved issues at the end - all waiting for another book. I don't t hink Mr. Kinkade probably wrote this book but leant his name to it. He should stick to his mediocre paintings.I was expecting something more along the lines of Jan Karon's Mitford books and this doesn't even come close but it will sell well because people like his paintings. That makes no sense but it's my opinion. If I choose to read the next book in the series, I'll take it out of the library and not waste my money on it.

The cover of this book is very pretty. Thomas is a great painter. I would not however recommend him as an author. This book at best was predictable. I should have spent my time time napping because I kept falling asleep anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look up the word \\"dreck\\" in the dictionary","review":"...and you will find a picture of this book. We have been assaulted with Kincaid in every shopping mall in America and NOW he has a book? This is not even as good as his sycophantic paintings (which are really Hallmark cards on posterboard). I implore you to stop supporting this machine. It is robbing humanity of thought and reason. Besides, it is really poor writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cape Light could be my home town.","review":"I found this to be refreshing story involving could-be real life people for whom life consisted of more than sex and money.The references to Christian values merely illustrate that Christianity is a way of life that meets the needs of real people. I found Jessica's problems with going back to a small town very valid and rejoiced with her when she learned what is most important in life. The mix of other characters who had various problems to face added intrigue to the story as you wonder how they will handle their situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those in need of a little retreat","review":"I enjoyed this book because of the authentic characters whose interwoven lives make Cape Light a nice retreat at the end of a long day. I chose this book after reading The Inn at Angel Island, which I thoroughly enjoyed.If you enjoy encountering typical life situations in a small New England community, Cape Light is a welcome retreat where life\`s trials are often a call to prayer, drama is kept to a minimum while everyday situations provide sufficient challenges.I look forward to my next Kinkade and Spencer adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Capturing!","review":"Cape Light reminded me of my small home town when I once lived in New England. It was hard to read at first but past the first chapter I couldn't put it down. You almsost feel as if you know the characters. One of the best if not the best book I have ever read. The lead characters Jessica and Sam have a very powerful relationship that you can't wait to find out what happens. I love that it gives you a realistic story one that many can relate to in their own lives. Easy reading, but enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple realistic LOVE not LUST story. I also enjoyed the great deal of faith the small town had.A definite must read! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Dumb Painter Writes a Really Bad Novel!","review":"In a morally just world, a painter with the talents of Thomas Kinkade would be limited to painting his dopey scenes on the sides of rustic handsaws and flowerpots. But clearly the self-proclaimed \\"painter of light\\" has managed to dupe a lot of lowbrow midwesterners into believing that his paintings represent an interesting vision of the world. (Do these same people stock up on Precious Moments figurines as well?) Whatever the case, you can skip this novel. Compared to Kinkade, bad Disney movies seem to created a varied and complex view of character.Most likely you're just scrolling down the Kinkade page for laughs. So I won't going on about this novels lack of merrit. As with other such obviously dumb books, the \\"reader response\\" section will soon be come an insult fest. If that's what you're here for, fire away. But make it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already","review":"I don't konw when I've read a worse book. I was expecting something on the order of Jan Karon. Clearly that's what Mr. Kinkade and his writer were trying to emulate, but missed the target by a mile. So sweet it gave me cavities. Without a doubt the painter of light has crossed the line into \\"over saturation.\\" I swear if I see another Kinkade painting, plate, birdhouse, afghan or god knows what else, I'm going to hurl. This book is really not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A non-reader originally from the Midwest.","review":"A horrible painter, an even worse writer. I can't believe this man exists, let alone gets published. In response to the reader in Florida who cannot spell \\"merit\\", let me just say that the midwest does not have the corner in bad taste. This coming from someone from the \\"sophisticated enclaves\\" of the Everglades - where trailers are king - who actually had to read a sentence of this book in order to write a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"I enjoyed the book, but it was not the book I requested.The book I requested was the #2 in the Cape Light Series.

Miller."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good book","review":"It's a shame that \\"Christian book\\" seems so often to mean \\"sappy and poorly written\\". It's a shame that many publishers and writers rely on the word \\"Christian\\" to sell a lot of books rather than creativity and quality writing. It's insulting that publishers think we will buy anything just because they deem it \\"Christian\\" on the jacket.This book is as boring and unsurpising as Kinkades art has become. You would think if a person is going to use a ghost writer they'd a least get one that can write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant social/political/sexual satire","review":"In the great tradition of Henry James \\"Turn of the Screw\\" and D.H. Lawrence \\"Lady Chatterley,s Lover\\" Kinkade has written a subtle, satirical send up of our shallow culture. Like Sherwood Anderson \\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" his thinnly masked disdain for smalltown provincialism is skillfully disguised by his overly flowerey stylistic mocking of tepid popular \\"Christian\\" prose. The undercurrent of sexuality is undeniable in the disjointed and fragmented character development. Their frustrated, unfulfilled lives only heighten the sexual tension like a delayed or denied climax. His mocking, even in the title, of our great Presidents Ronald Reagan \\"Shining City on the Hill\\" and George Bush I \\"A Thousand Points of Light\\" must be forgiven with a literary talent this immense. One sees glimmers of Swift and Defoe in this talented newcomer. Bravo Mr.Kinkade!!! What next?? Poetry? Symphonies? Dare I even say it---Film?"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to grasp","review":"I love to read christian fiction but this was a bit disapointing. For the first time I actually wished that the main character, Jessica, would just go away. I mean I actually wanted to throw this book out a window a couple of times. I didn't even bother to finish it. And I don't think I would call this a christian faith based book. In fact it said in very broad terms that all you need to do is go to church and pray and everything will work out in the end. Not a single mention of the plan of Salvation, which christian faith is based on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kincade will never be as good as Karon","review":"I frankly felt that the character Jessica was very contrived. I had to push myself to even begin to care what happened to her and to read this book through to the end. I certainly didn't think Cape Light was a Bible-thumping town and most of the other characters were really believable. Too bad Sam fell for that twit, Jessica."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"The best book about dating relationships I have found... and it's about much more than just getting dates. As a male psychiatrist at a major university student health service where inability to make good choices in finding a healthy relationship is a common presenting complaint I recommend this book when I feel the patient could benefit from some study concerning the matter. Ordinarily I'm not really a fan of what I consider pop psychology but this book is very insightful and gives a good framework for understanding a process that we are taught very little about but somehow we are supposed to know. The reality for most us is learning in a trial and error fashion, often blindly, without much understanding about why things are going so badly and accumulating baggage along the way. There should be a course on this in high school if education is about preparing people for life, and if so, this book would be on my required reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a healthy relationship choose your partner wisely","review":"The main theme of the book is to provide a method to have choices of who we date and early in the dating process communicate what is the true potential of the relationship to meet your vision of your future life. The goal is to communicate early so both parties can understand one another and build the relationship from there. The book provides insights into talking about what is important such as religion, spirituality, career, children, money and sexual intimacy. The book details talking about feelings for each other, the relationship potential, where we currently stand, issues that need resolving and an agreement to inform each other if feelings change. It is a book that lets both parties be responsible and truthful about making the dating relationship healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most thought-out approach to dating yet.","review":"A real game-plan for dating with the idea of finding a lasting relationship, not just another rollercoaster. Progressively getting better from chapter to chapter, it gives substance to the process of getting to know someone. The insights on communication and the actual relationship information was as much or more valuable than building a \\"date\\". Atwood's \\"Date Lines\\" is the same way, in that the meat of the book is far more powerful than the title indicates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic advice. Heavily geared towards women.","review":"The basic message of this book seemed to be: Rather than go to bars and sit around at home waiting, join activities you're interested in and just work expanding your social circle and having fun.This book was mainly just that one point and was rather uninsightful. It also felt very centered around the author's own experiences and very targeted to a certain type of women. It was totally useless to me and I would expect it would be the same to most other men as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this","review":"I ordered this book and \\"The Temptations of the Single Girl\\" also by Nina Atwood. Well, do yourself a favor and just get the other book, which is fantastic. This book was written by the author ages ago and contradicts the other book. I wrote to the author and she agreed that this book is not nearly as good and that she has \\"grown since writing\\" this book. With the author's blessing, this book went right back to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading the book a second time!","review":"Excellent book that puts finding a mate/relationship into perspective. I have highlighted throughout the book, and reading it a second time to take notes. The author could not have been more descriptive in her analysis of how to determine what direction (north, east, south or west) the person that you have an interest in is headed. I love this book!

I bought this as a temp replacement for my mattress when I got bugs and needed something before I could drop a few bucks on a real bed and to make sure the bugs were gone. Great find. Very comfortable, very large(the only gripe I have with the mattress is I think it is a little too wide, almost 6 feet), then internal infating fan is great, and if you ever need to deflate it does it in a hury. Much better than any other air mattress I have slept on, and It has taken some abuse because I have still yet to purchase a proper replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest Set Up I've Ever Seen","review":"We were expecting company to stay, and nowhere to put them. Amazon was the first place I looked for Air Mattresses. We actually bought two at the same time. I was familiar with Intex, but had never used their brand before. I was thrilled at how easy they were to set up. Then the fact that they stayed inflated for 3 days without needing additional air, that was an added bonus. After our guests left, it took my husband and I about 5 minutes to deflate, roll up and store away each mattress. I would recommend this brand to anyone needing a comfortable, convenient, reliable air mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Airbed","review":"My wife and I have been sleeping on this bed for the past week while staying with her family.

We will be buying one for camping for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air Bed Mattress","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this mattress for the price.

It doesn't contain anything on naval strategy, evaluation of doctrine, characteristics of leadership, strengths and weaknesses of destroyer design, or any basic or advanced questions.

Its language is that of the patrol report: hits on targets give \\"satisfaction\\" to crews; fires are \\"holocaustic;\\" explosions \\"volcanic.\\" Those looking for sea yarns or details should read first-person accounts of those who served on ships of interest.

That's fairly insulting to people who enjoy fashion and think it's important, as well as being overly-reductive about the value of education.

I am of the opinion that Burton is a genius, thank heavens for a risk taking eccentric. Here he became mired in the backgrounds and lost himself in the substance.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory cannot hide behind its overweening fantastical settings; the screenwriter and director are LAAAAZY. Then again, Burton has never been strong on scripts -- look at his Batman films (plot holes ALL over the place) for some perfect examples.

Just wasted, empty time. Johnny Deep's character casts Wonka as an effeminate sociopath emotionally and psychologically crippled by a repressive childhood. It's just not believable. It felt like the incredibly overrated Johnny Depp trying to act weird and creepy instead of the character being so. There's no laughs. There's no warmth. There's no suspense. The musical numbers are plain dumb and desperate. It's a complete fail. There really was no need to remake Wonka. Gene Wilder's performance was pure genius. Depp's Wonka is simply a case of bad acting to a poorly written script. I don't care about the book and whether this film sticks closer to it.

Plain and simple: THIS MOVIE SUCKED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"Strays from the book and becomes a morality play about estranged parents. The original is still the best.Dep acts creepy like a child molester in this film and he bears an uncanny resemblance to a mix between Michael Jackson and Marylin Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was craptastic!","review":"Gawd that movie was annoying. I blindly thought it was a sequel where Charlie had grown up and was ready to pass the factory on to someone else. That would have made perfect sense a generation later. But no-- it was a freakin' remake of a classic. And a sad one at that. Johnny Depp's performance was stilted and lifeless, unlike Gene Wilder who was eccentric and endearing. No wonder he's bitter! I guess the original had some deep meaning to me as a kid, and probably most of the kids today won't know the difference. But man did I sit there bored stiff. In fact the best part was the preview for Tim Burton's Corpse Bride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would smile, but the chocolate has rotted my teeth.","review":"Well what kind of message is this sending to our children? 'Charlie and the Chocolate factory?' I wouldn't be suprised if we see a surge of child obesity and a decline of dental hygiene! Why not 'Charlie and the apple tree?' That'd be wholesome!Also the obvious undertones to the story left a less than sweet taste in my mouth.The children who won the truckloads of chocolate would have died of obesity, or a massive heart attack.Wonka's obvious peadophilic intentions of drawing children into his enclosed factory, treating them and dazzling the parents with chocolate waterfalls and tiny clones.And the blatant ploy by Wonka to get up slumped sails by sending out golden tickets was such a transparent marketing technique.Overall, i give this movie a one. Although i did enjoy the puppets getting incinerated. I hate puppets."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may have Johnny Depp in it, but it can't compare with the original","review":"I think the original is better. That's all I have to say.

Why film makers of now-a-days think that they can outdo something as wonderful as the original production is way beyond me. I was not impressed, if anything the film was extremely distorting. I should have realized that Tim Burton does not have a grip on reality anyway. Hollywood gets more weird each day and i believe that i will be staying away from Hollywood/american entertainment of film making. No wonder less and less people are viewing american films. It seems that whatever is produced in Hollywood should stay in Hollywood.

The 1971 classic even has one of the most beautiful and engaging musical scores ever with the haunting tune \\"IMAGINATION\\". Hollywood fails again trying to top a classic that CANNOT EVER BE TOPPED!! Watching this made me want to get the original even more...which is exactly what I did!! That one merits 5 stars and more!! This Johnny Depp film is pure garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Burton did it all wrong!","review":"Oh my god this is no Willy Wonka at all! The songs sounds terrible and that Willy Wonka theme is annoying. Johnny Depp looks awful as Willy Wonka. Why the hell did they choose him? The original Willy Wonka is better the new one looks crappy and those Oompa Loompa guys don't even look the same as the original. It almost looks like another movie of The Stupids. It looks horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another timeless classic that didn't need a remake.","review":"Sometimes a great actor needs to know when he cannot save a film; especially if he is part of the problem. Whether this was Burton's skewed vision or Depp's worst decision since Private Resort, this movie bored me to sleep. Depp's deadpan reprisal of Gene Wilders brilliantly warm and touching performance left me feeling like the novocaine would never wear off. I can't even remeber the last time I turned off a movie half way through. This movie can only be appreciated by adolescent youth who have never seen the original and have no frame of reference for how badly Burton butchered this timeless classic. Tim, Tim, Tim...Corpse Bride, Chocolate Factory, Big Fish, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks? Get a clue and get back on track. Remember Edward Scissorhands; it was his last great movie. Let us hope that he does a better job with Robert Ripley's life story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","review":"That's the only way I can describe this remake with Johnny Depp. This version lacks the charm, warmth and humor found in the original version with Gene Wilder. Johnny Depp comes across cold and unfeeling without any enthusiasm thru out the whole entire movie. The rest of the cast stunk just as well. I can't even imagine how this movie got the ratings that it did but I for sure will never watch this version again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saccharine","review":"This reminds me of Gus Van Sant's remake of PSYCHO...what little there is that is any good here is lifted wholesale from the original (Burton claimed to greatly dislike Mel Stuart's version, yet he borrows quite liberally), and otherwise adds absolutely nothing. Johnny Depp is awful, and the woeful addition of a backstory, to put it diplomatically, defeats the purpose of Wonka by humanizing him. This version robs the Dahl book and Stuart movie of all the precious moral and otherworldly ambiguities of Wonka, turning him into a pathetic recluse whose cure can only be provided, in Burton's version, by the magic of family. Nauseating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depp should not make childrens' movies","review":"No need for a scarey updating of the Wilder film - I was given this to show grandchildren and after seeing it, I gave it away to some adults who for some reason think depp can act.

Gene Wilder was untouchable as Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp was awesome and brought a new sort of life to the character but still not Willy Wonka like. I know this movie is a unique adaptation of the book, so it would have a different \\"feel\\" but once you watch the version directed by Mel Stuart everything else is just a second rate imitation.If you have never seen the 1971 version then watch the remake first or you may be disappointed. :)Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Special Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It dosent have to have a point, that's why it's candy\\"","review":"This movie is great!

I think the only reason he got the roll for willy wonka is cuz the evil director known that all his stupid girls fan club would go see the movie and it would be a hit, thats the problem with the modern mainstream society, everything is done without passion and is done for the sake of making millions of dollars instead, or just compare this version of willy wonka to the orininal one and you'll see what i mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fell flat to me.","review":"This movie just wasn't all that great. It seemed more like an excuse to give Johnny Depp screen time than to actually tell the story. I'm rather neutral towards the actor, as I am about most actors, the movie itself just really doesn't hold up. It seems like it was weird for the sakes of being weird without a whole lot to redeem it. Depth was lacking where it was needed, and depth was added in areas that could have been left alone. I did read the book BTW, a long time ago - the whole Willies dad angle could have been left out, it didn't seem like it really added anything to the story. I'm not one of those people who expects a movie to exactly follow a book, but I am one of those people who expects a movie to come out well."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERYBODY SING......","review":"Oompa Loompa doopity dooI've got another review for youOompa Loompa doopadadeeIf you are wise, from this movie you'll fleeWhat do you get with Tim Burton remakes?CGI crap and bad music...NO THANKS!Johnny Depp stinks and the kids are all lameAll Tim Burton's movies look the sameI CAN'T STAND TO WA-A-ATCH THEM!Oompa Loompa doopity diceTim should stick to making Hot Topic merchandiseThis movie really reeks through and throughSmelling worse than Oompa Loompa DOO DOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Version from the original!","review":"We love the updated version of this heartfelt movie!

A lot of people, whom I consider closed minded, thought that it did the first movie no justice at all. What I have to say about that is, It wasn't supposed to. Tim Burton is a Genious. He is not stupid. If he wanted it to be like the first, it would have been. This movie is follows the book so much better, where as the first is loosely based off the book. This movie in my opinion is so much greater thean the first because you get the whole story. All should own this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ups and Down of Charlie and the Chocalate Factory","review":"Maybe if I didn't read the book and watched the original movie I would have given it 2 stars, but I did too much. It was different then both of them. Both of them were better.The oompa loompas (I hope I spelled it right.) are not like the original ones. There songs are good, but I absolutely love the one in the original movie. I think they had the hardest part in the movie which is pretty sad to me seeing as Johnny Depp or whoever plays Charlie should.The part about Willy's childhood was sad but made no sense. How do you love teeth better than your own child? Did the dad only search for him when he made candy? Why could Willy just let them live in the factory in the first place? His family is not all that bad. Just because he didn't get enough love that doesn't mean he can't either.I liked how they showed the outcome of the other Golden Ticket winners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Veruca Salt!","review":"We love Veruca!

My kids love both."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Very Clever","review":"The 2005 version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is much easier for me to take than the original. Since we must compare the two, I will have to say that Gene Wilder's Wonka was just creepy. I can't imagine that this is what Mr. Dahl had in mind. Depp provides a mix of innocense and mischief that are truly child-like and come off as hilarious and so very entertaining. The Oompa Loompahs are no longer creepy and much more enjoyable to look at - using the same man is genius. The enire film is genius.And a huge thanks to Tim Burton for not including the weird acid trip garbage in the tunnel ride. In my opinion, that alone makes the 2005 version better than the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful adaption of a good book","review":"To open this review I have to say that this movie was a awful movie to a very good book.

The Oompa Loompa's look was redundant and uncreative. True, it was nice to see teh songs put to music, but this film, IMHO, sucked A LOT. My cousins and I were making fun of this movie after we saw it, and we were trashing it, that's how bad we thought it was.The original owns, at least Gene Wilder didn't make Willy Wonka seem like he was out of touch with the world.

I watched the new version of the film and then re-watched the old one and the old one was so much better. The child actors played the parts especially better than the children in the new version of the movie. The new one is just over-the-top and seems to force computer technology in our faces to make up for the lame acting.

Anything such as that, which would even suggest Depp=Wilder, is an immediate contrast of common sense.I think Tim Burton would probably be better off shooting himself before he has the opportunity to destroy his own work as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Movie, Beautiful DVD","review":"Maybe I watched the original movie too much as a kid, but for me, it just didn't feel like this film had a heart. It's just flat out boring.I was surpised - coming from Tim Burton - to see so much computerized special effects. The technically precise, glossy makeover to the film loses some of it's original charm.Aside from all that, the film is beautifully transferred to DVD. There is no noticable film grain or compression artifacts. The surround sound is very nice as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...","review":"It might be the face that the orginal Charlie and The Choclate Factory was so good that the remake by Tim Burton didn't live up to my standards. I like Tim Burton and the movies he makes but, tampering with a classic is just wrong. Everyone who had seen the orginal loved it but people who went back and saw the remake were less than satisfied. They left out parts of the orginal like the everlasting gobstopper and the bubble scene. These two things were not in the book but made the first movie that much stronger. The movie was appealing visually but that what Tim Burton does best. Overall this movie was a so-so makeover which left critics and fans frowning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oookay","review":"I was really hoping for a good movie, because my kids loved the book so much, and the Gene Wilder version was a little weird.This movie is bad. It seems that they took old movie and updated it - it is creepy. I love Johnny Dep, but he doesn't seem to have his heart in this movie. The effects aren't even good. The plot is shallow. The oopa loompas are all played by one guy who has no depth. The songs they sing are awful - you can't really make out the lyrics. The whole point of this story is to promote positive behaviors of children - and the point got lost somewhere in Charlie's psychosis. So much could have been done with this film - what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst thing to happen to film since gilgi...","review":"...and it hasnt even come out yet!!!!

Not to mention in this Bush-era, with all the censorship and what not, you know they're not gonna have all the little adult jokes that the original had.but what really has me down about this movie was i reading about the writer, who had never seen the first prior to writing this film, and he said that he was surprised how DARK the first in comparision to his.this one is gonna be strictly for the kidsits a shame"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blob","review":"Charlie and The Choclate Factory is a Blob.It looks very weird.I'm describing it as a simple word \\"Stupid\\"Jhonny Depp(Finding Neverland) is like the best part exept he looks like a girl.I'm happy AnnSopie Robb(Because Of Winn - Dixie)is in it but she's quit not a actress.Thats all I'll say \\"Blob\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Burton and the crap movie factory!","review":"I haven't seen this movie but I can tell just from the trailers it sucks.

I thought that the twisted imagination of Tim Burton would really help to capture the quirky Willy Wonka. This movie was disappointing at best. A few of the visuals were very good (the only reason I gave it 2 stars) but the overall movie production was horrible. What especially disappointed me was the fact that there was only one oompa-loompa. Come on Tim, was there not enough small people who needed work?. The sound of the oompa-loompa musical numbers I would compare to scraping nails on a chalkboard. There is no better Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder in the original 1971 version.

It is strangely cold and unwelcoming. I like Depp normally but this performance missed the mark somehow. It's like he couldn't quite find a rhythm for the character. There are very few laughs and a hackneyed storyline involving Wonka's father that seemed superfluous. The effects are neat, but without a compelling story it really doesn't matter. Burton managed to squeeze the humanity and fun out of the beloved Dahl story, and left us with something chilly and bizarre. And not in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird and twisted","review":"I watched this when I was little, so I wanted my kids to see it.

In this version of the film, squirrels attack Veruca Salt and throw her into a hole.Finally, a brief, yet totally unnecessary, scene of two homosexuals walking their dog is a part of this so-called \\"family film\\".I am extremely disappointed in this remake.

He did a good job for the part he was dealt but he was dealt a lousy part.I enjoyed the original Gene Wilder movie much more and I intend to read the book but I found this movie to be very boring and not the least bit funny or interesting. It was just plain dull.I was not familiar with Tim Burton or I would not have even purchased it in the first place. I got my first taste of Tim Burton with the preview for the movie \\"Corpse Bride\\" before the movie started. If I never see anything by Tim Burton again it will be too soon (and I suspect this was the best of his movies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad....","review":"This movie was such a disappointment on so many levels. It turned a belved childrens story into one describing a twisted psychopath who isn't warm or endearing just nuts. Depp's portayal of Willie Wonka makes the character out to be the type that yo'd tell your kids to stay away from and definetely not to take any candy from. The Oompa Loompa songs have been changed to \\"Rap\\" and the lessons learned are lost in a sea of political correctness (Won't call a kid a brat, etc).

Tim Burton's other effects were good, as usual. Depp's acting was all right - he always goes for something original and he usually succeeds - one of the all-time greats; but Depp did come across as acting in this one, rather than as convincing. Gene Wilder was too hard an act to follow without doing Willy in drag, or something. The reason I would not bother to see this film a second time was the odd decision to use one actor to play all of the Oompa-Loompas (165 of them). What motivated that decision? Every Oompa-Loompa scene (and there are many) got monotonous. I can find other ways to be bored ... for free. I give this film one Oompa-Loompa. That's all Tim Burton gave us."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally creepy","review":"Depp's take on Willie Wonka was totally creepy.

This film is all syrup with no substance and seems 'rushed' as a previous reviewer stated. Why remake something that was already done and done with a grace,charm and style - all without the use of sickly slick computer generated effects. Johnny Depp as Wonka did not impress either. Without any outside influence, I found him to be very 'michaeljacksonesque' and grossly inferior as Wonka when inevitably compared to the genius that Gene Wilder contributed to the character. Wilder is a genius.Period. Depp is ...well.. not!

It's equally stunning that a remake can eviscerate the brilliant script of the original, take away all humor, quirkiness and cleverness and repackage it with ridiculous changes. And then there's the awful performance of Johnny Depp who has no concept of this character. I believe the original choice for the remake was Nicholas Cage who would've gotten the nastiness of Willy Wonka. I loathed the children and acting all around. I loathed the lame songs. I loathed the money that was spent on this. Take a look at some of the making of extras of the original movie and you'll see it was a labor of love. Like all of Burton's latest movies, this was made for the money. It's eye candy, but it sure ain't sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I watched this because I thought it might be an updated, high-tech Charlie & the Chocolate Factory with 21st century effects that my 3 and 5-year old boys would enjoy.

The \\"nicer\\", easier-to-understand one with Gene Wilder and real little people.And that's my biggest gripe: how do you recreate a musical piece with dance and song using duplicates of a single face and a bunch of synthesized voices with images that look like they were cheaply spliced into other images to make the little dude look little? You don't, because even a 5-yr old is able to recognize the poor quality. The Oompa-Loompa in this version sucks! So does the chocolate river."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Movie is much better","review":"This movie cannot hold a candle to Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Gene Wilder simply outperforms Depp as Wonka. Nice visual effects, but the older version is simply much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Waste Of Time!!!!","review":"I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"What this film has going for it is an amazing display of great effects and visually stimulating scenery and some wry and sarcastic lines from Depp. While Gene Wilder's Wonka was a character that was strange but loveable, Depp's is well just strange. The oompah loompahs do get more speaking parts and sing actual lyrics from the actual book which coming from Dahl are naturally very cute and funny with just an aspect of the bizarre. What the film lacks is that emotional charge that made the audience sympathetic to Charlie - of course the title is a misnomer - this film is all about Wonka. While this film is a completely different film from the original it is still worth seeing. I will say that I like the original better but this is an interesting take on the same story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"This movie was definitely weird. It freaked me out. The first one was outstanding. I tried to watch this one multiple times and I still did not, do not and will not like it. Nothing looked real in the movie. Everything was computerized. The only thing the movie was missing was robots. I am surprised the children weren't robots. The contrast of the movie was dark and silver. There was no brightness or color in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, at best","review":"I have enjoyed most, if not all, of Johnny Depp's work in the past. Not this time. His interpretation of Willy Wonka is horrible. Depp's Wonka is annoying, whiney and just plain unlikable - Depp seemed to be going for that tired Jim Carrey goofball routine here - if I wanted to watch Jim Carrey do Willy Wonka I... wouldn't.Beyond Depp's lousy Wonka the movie does have some redeeming qualities - Charlie is a very likable character and sticks pretty close to the original. Violet and Augustus are also pretty good - although the latter's gluttony was pushed just a tad too much. The other children were quite forgettable. Some of the factory/oompa loompa scenes were quite good (the boat scene), while others were poor (finding the oompa loompas... why?).Overall, a movie I was very interested to see is one I will never watch again. 2 stars is probably generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, one of my favorite movies! Tim Burton ROCKS!!!!!!!!!","review":"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are one of my two favorite Hollywood people in the entire world, together they create masterpieces! When I first saw Sleepy Hollow, I LOVED that movie with Johnny's cool acting, and Tim's macabre settings. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is truly one on Burton's and Depp's BEST FILMS. I like this movie SO MUCH MORE than the older one because it has so much more STORY! This is my favorite movie of the year so far! I reccomend it for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"Bought this movie for a 6 year-old girl. She truly loves it. Would buy it again for another gift. Was difficult to find elsewhere, but Amazon came through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp is Charlie","review":"I bought this for my wife who absolutely loves this movie and is a big fan of Johnny Depp. She is very happy with the product and I'm sure will be watching the movie often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to watch it a few times....","review":"absolutely could not get into it...and Johnny Depp's acting choices were atrocious and cartoony...it made the movie all the more uninvolving.UNwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depp stinks!!!!","review":"I hated this movie. All of the characters seemed blank and boring (the exception was the boy that played Charlie).And Depp's version of the character seemed like he was on Valium. The movie lacks the magic of the original, bigtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate remakes.","review":"Especially when they don't come close to original. This one makes up a reason for why Wonka is soooo silly. The author didn't even do that in his book!! Not as good as the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you people saying this movie was bad!","review":"I thought this movie was horrible. The original Willy Wonka is the best but I was disappointed with the new one. Johnny Depp does kind of look like a Michael Jackson impersonator in that Wonka costume. I would just wait for the DVD to come out. Don't bother seeing it. The special effects are okay but the set and the new Oompa Lompa's are just bad even the songs get kind of annoying. The original was better do not see this one but if you really want to see it wait till the DVD. Don't waste your money to see it in theater!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory","review":"TERRIBLE. This was the worst re-make I have ever seen. It was billed as \\"Charlie\\" and the Chocolate Factory, which made it sound as if it was a \\"continuation\\", not a \\"re-make\\". And, as far as I am concerned, nothing can compare to the original \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\". However, I do enjoy a good re-make - but this was far from it. The characters were WAY overdone. The acting was terrible. Johnny Depp has done SO much better in other movies. He acted totally gay, and just stupid. I like Johnny Depp in general, he has done so many wonderful movies, but whoever wrote his part in this one just ruined it. Even in the original, Willy Wonka was NOT THAT excentric. He was at least \\"living on the planet earth\\", unlike how this Willy Wonka was portrayed. This new \\"version\\" of Willy Wonka went way too far, and it was just terrible. Neither I, nor any of the 5 others with me while we watched it, would ever see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie and the Perv is what I saw","review":"I love, love, love Johnny Depp, so imagine my surprise when I went to this movie and could not stand it nor did I think it did Depp any justice. I just could not get over the fact that Depp looked and talked like Michael Jackson and believe it or not, I was not aware of this comparison before seeing the movie! I thought I was the only one seeing it that way. The parallels between this movie and Michael Jackson with his never never land ranch were to much for me to overcome and I hated the movie. The oompa's were ridiculous. I can sadly say that now I will never be able to say I loved Depp in EVERY movie I ever saw him in. This one just bites. Don't go see it, rent the video when you can get it for 1.99. I am curious to know what everyone else saw in the movie that made them rate it so highly. I must have missed something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I was so disappointed in this movie. I LOVE the movie WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. It is fantastic. I thought that this new movie would be great. I was so wrong. Where was the OOMPA LOOMPA songs? And the Oopma Loompas were not oompa loompas. They were just one \\"short\\" man. I think it was a great dis-service to release this movie. Johnny Depp was eerie. Not eccentric. Just plain strange and frightening. And what happened to the golden egg laying geese. What good are nuts? Really? The only performance I enjoyed was that of the young actor who played Charlie. I am extremely disappointed in Tim Burton. I expected more from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"Tim Burton should stay away from remakes! This is right up there with his disasterous remake of Planet of the Apes. Both inane and pointless. The differences between the original movie and the book do not warrant this remake. Johnny Depp is just creepy (and I usually like his work), and the Oompa Loompa was just plain wrong! Plus, the attempts to modernize the songs fall flat. Even the young actor playing Charlie, who was wonderful in Finding Neverland, is dull in this film as he whispers his way through. Do yourself a favor, rent the original, as I doubt this one will even be remembered in 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Burton should stop remaking movies.","review":"He ruined Planet of the Apes and now has ruined The chocolate factory. If you go into this movie without comparing it to the original it's not bad, but if you make the mistake I did then you will be disapointed, and badly. I could go on and on, but I won't. I think my biggest complaint though is the song Pure Imagination isn't there. I can't write anymore just thinking about how this movie was destroyed is making me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"INANE COMEDY WITH SCARY DEPP DIPPIN' CHOCOLATE!","review":"My children were scared out of their wits by Johnny Depp in this movie. They had seen \\"Willy Wonka\\" from 1971 and enjoyed it thoroughly so I took them to see this and I so regretted it. Their nightmares began soon enough. They could see Charlie (Depp) chasing them threatning to dip them in chocolate! This is definitely NOT a movie I would recommend young children to see. As an adult, I was extremely disappointed. Hollywood fails again in its attempt to top a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm not a big fan.","review":"I have to say that I am not familiar with anything that has to do with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that did not \\"know\\" of Willy Wonka prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!The film brings to the screen the story of a young boy whose dream of visiting the Chocolate Factory comes true. There he discovers all sorts of surprises that he never even dreamed existed.The acting is about average, the colors are nice and that's about it.In a nutshell, it's a pretty good movie for kids, while an ok movie for most adults; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much better movie","review":"Although i did enjoy the first willy wonka movie, I was much more pleased with Tim burton's version. Somehow the story made much more sense to me in this version, and the acting was a lot better. Depp, i think, is the perfect Willy Wonka, the character is a strange man, i don't think another actor could have done a better job. Of course this version of Wonka doesn't seem like a happy childrens story but, hey, the ones who first saw the original are grown up now. This movie was well thought out, as are all the Tim burton films i've seen. I was entertained throughout the entire movie. This is, in my opinion, the way the story should have went!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Re-Invention of a Classic","review":"Johnny Depp continues to amaze theater buffs with his stunningly captivating portrayal of a lonely, dejected candyman-child. Love the acting, directing, visual effects, writing, producing,cast, and especially the fact that the entire family will be able to enjoy what is destined to be another masterpiece and timeless feature film for children of all ages. Thumbs way up for this Oscar-calliber performer, one of the best of our time. Every grown-up should visit childhood again and see Charlie & The Chocolate Factory if for no other reason than to say hello to the Oompah-Loompah's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weirder and creepier than the original version: 2 1/2 stars","review":"First, I like Tim Burton as a director, I can't imagine any other director who could even attempt re-making Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The problem is that this version is too dark and creepy for kids and too silly for adults.The film has the usual Tim Burton touches: Johnny Depp as the star, Danny Elfman music, very creative art direction and weird characters. However, the musical numbers are terrible, completely uninspired. Also, the entire movie has this dark atmosphere, not really a barrel of laughs.I rented this film, avoiding paying $$ to see it at the theatre and I'm glad that I did. If you do buy it, don't pay too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Someone Say Chocolate?","review":"Pretty impressive acting by Johnny Depp - he was weird as he was supposed to be. The children in the movie are annoying but were so in the Gene Wilder movie. I think I lean towards the Willy Wonka movie but what I really liked about this movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was how they took the movie a different direction and showed Willy Wonka's chilhood and why he came to own a chocolate factory and how he found the oompa loompas. I would have to say that there were some things I liked better in the Gene Wilder movie but some that I liked better in the Johnny Depp. To each their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"No business at the table.","review":"As a lover of the book and the earlier movie I was wondering what this would be. But with Burton and Depp you can't really go wrong.And the movie is fun, it's pretty close to the book, with some updates to our time. Depp is brilliant as Willie Wonka. He sometimes sounds like Dr. Evil, Frances McDormand in 'Fargo' and other characters he himself played.the special effects are all in good order as you would expect. Pay special attention to the remarks about other movies. I have spotted Edward Scissorhands, the Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, Space Oddity and Dracula (Christopher Lee is in it, and there is a scene where WW rises up from a table, dracula-style). But there are probably more.enjoyable! as they say: from 8 to when you are only in bed at advanced age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Tim Burton make children's movies?","review":"Having read the book, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory many, many times, it is easy to say that this movie does the book or the original movie no justice. My questions for director Tim Burton:Why is Willy Wonka so creepy??In the book he is a fun lovable character who Charlie gets a kick out of the whole story.Why is the factory look like something you would see in a Marylin Manson video?The chocolate factory should have been designed as a place of pure imagination and astonishment, not a place that would be fearful for the grim reaper.Many other questions: Why does Mike Teavee's dad look like a child molester? Why is Grandpa Joe a totally unlikable character? Why do the oompa-loompas still give me the creeps after watching this movie 3 nights ago.I wish that Tim Burton would have tried to make this movie for children instead of the mid-twentys goth crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorably Uneven","review":"Stick with \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\". I don't know what Depp and Burton were on when they made this one, but neither of them is up to their usual level. The feel of the movie was inconsistent and Depp couldn't seem to decide if his character was creepy, wise, childish...or maybe he *meant* to seem schizophrenic. The backstory bit was mostly a waste of time, the same goal could have been accomplished with about 1/3 of the time devoted to it. Parts of the movie were delightful, but overall I found it a waste of ticket money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF I COULD!!","review":"This movie was so much worse then I thought it would be. It was terribly dark and has such a evil undertone that I would NEVER let my children watch it. Stick with the original Willy Wonka and don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst remake ever","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was undeniably horrible. This is a movie that should have never even been thaught about let alone scripted and followed threw. I hate to say this but the original Willy Wonkay and the Chocolate Factory actually had better affects than this movie could have even thaught of. I love Jonny Depp as an actor, but after this I question is mental stability. Jean Wilder by far makes the best Willy Wonka and will never be outdone by the likes of Jonny Depp. You can not understand the Oompa Loompas songs let alone enjoy when you grew up with the original movie. The only thing I actually liked about the movie was the fact that they gave a little insight to what was going on and what made Willy Wonka who he was, but even that got a little rediculous. In my opinion, by far the worst remake we have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Willy Willy Go Home! Willy won't go home","review":"I saw the Roald Doal book adaptation of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" and I think Johnny should get away from the Chocolate Factory and get aboard the Black Pearl, but he will next summer in \\"Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest\\" I thought the original was way better, it's a classic. This newis not. I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan since Captain Jack Sparrow, but I like Gene Wilder better for Willy Wonka. Johnny only belongs on the Black Pearl from now on. \\"Finding Neverland\\" was very good, \\"Secret Window\\" was good and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" as even better than \\"Charles\\" If your a Johnny Depp fan still give it a try and see how you get cinema cancer. As great as an actor Johnny is, I guess they can't be winners can they. He was weird in a gay manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one movie that should have never been remade!","review":"Movie really is not that good! First of all, they should have had multiple Oompa Loompas... and the one that they have is SCARY! Johnny Depp's character is creepy too... a cross between Marylin Manson and Micheal Jackson! The original was SOOO much better!!! Don't waste your money on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"emilie","review":"Trust me I love Johnny and all and will go see any movie he's ever made but I have to say that this one really stunk!

I really like this movie. It takes a little too long to get to the actual core of the movie, but once it gets there it goes pretty fast and is extremly enjoyable. Johnny Depp is great, altho i think his acting is not that great. He plays willie wonka, an astranged candy make/inventor, greatly, bringing his own weird aspects to the character. The other actors are all equally as good. The visuals are also amazing, and stunningly beautiful. Tim Burton did a great job with this movie and he re-invented it and tried not to make a tired remake and he succeeded. Great movie and the box office sales prove it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just different... I still prefer the original more","review":"If you grew up watching \\"Willie Wonka\\", you may not enjoy this one as much: not as \\"musical\\" (at least not as romantic and human, so to speak -no \\"Imagination\\" or \\"Golden Ticket\\" songs, for example) and certainly not as deep of a message as the one you may take away with the original with Wilder.However, it has its own merits: the kid that plays Charlie is perfect, the movie as a whole comes across as pretty funny, indeed funnier than the original (Depp is able to pull of more laughs, as he was with \\"Pirates...\\") and also the effects, as expected, are WAY better! Last, there were some parts of the story that were developed a little more than in the original.As for those who have read about a comparison with Michael Jackson, yes: there's definitely something there. :DOverall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait for the movie to end","review":"This was one of those movies that I couldn't wait to end...but I went because the kids wanted to see it. I normally like movies with Johnny Depp, but not this one! I will give it 2 stars because Johnny Depp's acting was still good (I just did not like the story line...and neither did my kids...they said it was too \\"boring\\"). Maybe younger kids (ages 4-6) might like it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie & The Factory","review":"Charlie Bucket comes from a poor family, and spends most of his time dreaming about the chocolate that he loves but usually can't afford. Things change when Willy Wonka, head of the very popular Wonka Chocolate empire, announces a contest in which five gold tickets have been hidden in chocolate bars and sent throughout the country. The kids who find the tickets will be taken on a tour of Wonka's chocolate factory and get a special glimpse of the wonders within. Charlie miraculously finds a ticket, along with four other children much naughtier than him. The tour of the factory will hold more than a few surprises for this bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless Version with NO Redeeming Qualities","review":"Saw the premiere. Waste of time. Burton will prob do much better with corpse bride. It is along the lines of a nightmare before Christmas. but about Charlie. Depp was typical Depp. Burton was typical Burton. The story, however, was told better the first time WITH music. don't give me the story how this is not a remake, but a more accurate to the book telling. Who cares?? There are much worse movies that vary from the book that should have been re-made long before this one. At many points I found myself waiting for one of the famous lines or songs only to see this film try hard not to be the first film. I hope the dahl family enjoys their more accurate junk. I feel bad for all the families that will get sucked into seeing this garbage with the whole family. At todays rates....ouch!! Just buy a copy of the old movie, microwave some popcorn, and sing along with the family instead. Sleepy Hollow and Scissorhands it ain't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"The version with Gene Wilder will always be my favorite, but this remake is pretty good and is better suited to this generation of movie-goers. I'm a Johnny Depp fan, but I think other fans will agree that the 'voice' he used for Willy Wonka was just plain weird if not creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor streaming","review":"We had several issues with streaming this video.

I love this movie so much more than the original willy wonka!... thanks for getting this to me sooner than expected!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror beyond belief","review":"I don't think there are any words that can describe how utterly horrible this movie is but I'll try. I normally keep my comments to myself about most things but for the good of mankind I felt it necessary to warn the world about this movie. It is absolute torture to watch. It truly is that bad. You know the name of that brown stuff you flush down the toilet? That's what this movie is."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Depp plays the best Johnny Depp","review":"Versatlity! They name is Depp!Is there any outcast, weirdo, fish out of water that Johnny Depp cannot play! He turns conventionality on his ear when he dons the familiar Willy Wanka outfit and makes us laugh and think in the process.He's just so unpredictable! What will he do next?! I wouldn't bet on it! If you see what I'm saying. Depp can touch us in any roll he does and he's not above tryign somethign different like being someone who's different from the rest of us but also the same on the inside.And I think that's how we should look at his career -- as a man who took us on a long jaunt of heavy makeup and wardrobe just to show us all that we're all humans on the inside. Except for TOm Cruise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Tim Burton work! what happened to the deluxe?","review":"This is not doubt one of Tim Burton's greatest works next to Edward Scissorhands. And I've been so waiting to get the dvd in November, but all of a sudden Amazon.com has taken off the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) that is going to be released on November 8th, 2005. Why? It was obvisouly going to sell better than the 1disc widescreen edition. I don't know what Amazon.com is doing. Anyway if it doesn't get back before november 8th, I'm just gonna have to buy it in stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just sad","review":"I like Johnny Depp. He's played many excellent roles. This is not one of them. It's not that he's not good here, it just that this should have never happened in the first place. It's a poor adaptation and pales in comparison to the 1971 version with Gene Wilder. I watched it with high hopes but I don't think anyone will ever be able to play Willy Wonka like Gene Wilder did. It wouldn't matter how good Depp played the role, he'll never be able to usurp Wilder's version from my mind. This version is mostly fine if you've never seen the original adaptation. But if you have seen it then this version is worthless. If you haven't seen it, then the old version represents a time bomb that you may eventually set off(by watching it) and subsequently ruin Depp's version for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ok Movie -- Go see the 1971 for a better version","review":"A typical Tim Burton film. Very big and bold graphically but it lacks the human touch of the original.

It is much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This just didn't do it for me","review":"Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was disappointed in the music and the Oompa Loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Six out of Five Stars","review":"As a friend said, six out of five stars. We both consider it the best movie since the Return of the King. It has a rich musical score, and takes a new totally insane twist on the story, with Dep acting like a psychotic Mr. Rogers, with a touch of Hunter S. Thompson. Speaking of, this movie has inspired a love for raw cacao beans, which you can now even buy here on Amazon. They do indeed contain a property that triggers the release of endorphines. gives one the feeling of being in love. .................. I'm sorry, I was having a flashback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love this film","review":"Wanted to, so badly. I've always defended Depp's work, but the focus of the plot of the movie is so sappy and self-absorbed that I can't sit through the entire movie. The children's performances shine through, but Depp adds nothing to the movie.I rented the 1971 movie a few weeks after we purchased the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and I fell in love with the Mel Stuart/Gene Wilder movie all over again. The new movie will never be the classic that the 1971 has become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let your kids watch this bizarre adaption of a great book","review":"I hate it when hollywood weirdos take a good book or movie and remake them in their own weird image. The book by Roald Dahl and the original movie starring Gene Wilder are wonderful. This movie does not follow the story and is scary to little kids. Basically, Mr. Wonka is a mental case who was abused by his scary dentist father. Avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treat!!!!!","review":"This was a great movie. The cast did a great job!!!! Especially, Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore and David Kelly as Grandpa Joe. They were just great. Tim Burton did a stunning job as director. He made the Chocolate Factory into a fantastic place. This was a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say NO..........","review":"Don't do it.

Totally wierd.

YOu should watch it. I'd reccomend it,and it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marred by Burton's Obsession With Psychology","review":"Visually, this film is wonderful, and it has many fine moments, right up until the very end.In the novel and in the original film, Wonka sees and appreciates Charlie's good heart and his love of family. When Charlie wins, he excitedly invites both Charlie and his family to live with him, no questions asked.The whole point of the original novel and movie is to show Charlie's big heartedness.True to form, Burton throws in his own dark, twisted touch; he gets hung up on the idea of Wonka as a socially maladjusted wierdo. In Burton's vision, Wonka can't comprehend Charlie's love of family.The story isn't supposed to be about Wonka, but about Charlie's big heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original...","review":"I watched this movie with an open mind trying not to compare it to the original but it just does not stand up. Jonny depp should of come into this and acted the crazy fun guy he is but instead he ruins it with the crap he put out. Tim burtons whole idea that one person could be all of the oompa's was also very stretched. Some of the songs are very good but again they just try to hard and fall so short."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't that good!","review":"I'm not going to give it one star because Tim Burton tried hard. I didn't really like it much. I can't say it's bad because Tim Burton is a genius and he does good at directing movies. He really did a great job. I didn't like the dialogue much because it was corny. I really did like Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka better than Gene Wilder because his performance was amazing. The songs were kind of annoying and I was about to leave the theater during the half of the movie. The new Oompa Lompa weren't funny in this one. I did like the set to the movie it was awesome but it was getting too long and I was about to fall asleep. I'm sorry Wonka fans I know a lot of you loved it but I hated it. It's not a stupid movie I just thought it was boring. It seemed like that kind of a movie what lil kids would enjoy more than adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film...Great actor......","review":"After watching this movie, I can't watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.... Johnny Depp does it again, great actor and a great movie. This movie was a hit w/ my daughter and her friends. I can't wait to see what else Johnny Depp can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid, dull, boring","review":"I thought \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" was very, very, very boring. Everything about this movie sucks. The oompa loompa's songs are so stupid, and the little side story's of Willy Wonka's dad are... stupid. I have no clue if they're in the book or not. Johnny Depp is without a doubt the worst Willy Wonka ever. He reminded me of Micheal Jackson. How can this movie even compare to the 1971 \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?\\" Gene Wilder was perfect as Willy Wonka. I would suggest that version of this piece of garbage anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joyless and unfunny, but good for the emotionally handicapped","review":"What this movie has in computerized special effects, it loses in character development, wit, humor, musical performance, and joy. In other words, it is another Tim Burton remake of a 70s flick (\\"Planet of the Apes\\" should be considered a crime against humanity). Let's hope that in another 30 years, a better director comes along who is able to capture the frivolity of the original film, especially with its heavyhanded moralizing. Johnny Depp is forgettable in this movie as Willy Wonka, and all his lines fall flat. This movie has no laughs. Don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is excellent. It's Burton's dark vision, mixed with song and humor. It's different than the 71 version and more faithful to Dahl's book. The best part is Depp, who gives an excellent performance. He's starting to become my favorite actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"two words...","review":"CHRISTOPHER WALKENEveryone I know agrees with me as far as who should have been casted as Willy Wonka. Johnny's pretty good and all, but Mr. Walken def. fits the bill for a weird, hilarious, and lovable eccentric. I honestly couldn't think of anyone better to succeed the original fantastic Gene Wilder.*****************************************************************Otherwise, a great movie, 'cept I thought it was kind of a shabby ending and that it also kind of dove a little too deep into Willy Wonka's past.And WHERE was the burping cola scene? I guess it wouldn't have fit the ending anyways. I think Mr. Burton sacrificed a wonderful scene for the rather schmaltzy ending. One change I did like was that he showed what happened to the kids, not included in the original.Corpse Bride looks awesome. Will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chteau Flight - Puzzle","review":"Some gorgeous jazz noodling on Puzzle, Chateau Flight's first album. The duo of I:Cube and DJ Gilb'r blends a strong rhythmic sensibility with a keen ear for melody and mood. \\"Camping Jazz\\" may give you a new appreciation for going out into the wilderness with its broken beats, while \\"Instant Replay\\" is a darker journey with a house kick. \\"Auto-Power\\" starts off with strange wobbly weirdness before settling into a vocal journey.

Misdirection is the word magicians use to wrongly route spectators' attention, focusing it only where it supports the dream. This book is not an how to book but it's one of the best analysis of what misdirection is.The art of misdirection is what makes the difference between a guy doing tricks (properly or badly) and a true magician.The two other books in the trilogy are the Trick brain which classifies every magical effects and the author's book on showmanship.

I like the 72mm CF-7062 CP because it is NOT wafer thin, making it much more easy to handle.The operation is as smooth as silk and the CP effects are as good as my more expensive filters. I use this 72mm CP on my Nikon 18-200mm to enhance macro as well as any other image and the results are excellent. I also have a 67mm Sunpak CP for my Nikon 18-135mm which is equally as outstanding. I would rather take my Sunpaks on the more rugged outdoor shoots than my more expensive Hoya's or B&W's. The Sunpaks, to me, just seem to be more rugged and I've been doing this for almost 40 years! Nowadays, I believe there are lots of good and better filters on the market. I have lots of them and everyone has ones they like better than others. That's what makes some images just OK and others better. Personally, I am just really satisfied with the Sunpaks and have no problem recommending them to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I just received this filter and my initial testing revealed exactly what I expected. It works just like a my other sunpak polarizer, which is great.Yes there are better ones out there, but for the quality versus cost, it works great. Pictures are just as sharp with or without the filter on and the polarization effect is very good. I see some people on here complaining that the filter will unscrew when you turn the polarizer. Well if you just rotate it in the same direction that it screws on, then there isn't a problem. Of course thats what I've done with every polarizer I ever owned.... it just makes sense. Build quality is just fine.Unless you have money to burn, get this filter. You'll feel a lot better if you scratch a $21 dollar filter instead of a $80-120 on! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"This circular polarizer will really make your photos pop with color and take out the nasty glare.The only drawback to this model is that it is somewhat difficult to twist if you have a lens hood attached, but for the price it's something I can live with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpness, of the lack thereof","review":"I've had this filter since February 2010 and use it on a Nikon D90 with a Sigma 18-250 lens. I've found that it is impossible to get a sharp picture when the lens is at or approaching 250mm. I've taken \\"identical\\" shots with and without the polarizer to determine if the problem is the lens or the filter and the filter comes up short. At wide angle to short telephoto the filter seems to do alright, but at long telephoto it produces a fuzzy photo that I cannot get to be \\"crisp\\" either with automatic or manual focusing, even when shooting from a tripod and making sure the aperture is the same to ensure the lens isn't the culprit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunpak CF-7062 CP 72mm sold by Celltime Inc.","review":"Please be careful to check if the item you received is the same as it shown in the picture on the web.

Wrong! The paperback itself is essentially identical except the cover page. As far as I can tell, the tests in cd are the same from 2003.

The review sections are over simplified. To find an answer to the multiple choice questions - you must read through 2 paragraphs of comments and you still are unable to determine what the author is saying is the correct answer. The CD-Rom is a bigger joke - a games section which completely makes no sense and the multiple choice questions never provide you with an answer.I have studied for the CPA exam using self study guides, which allowed me to pass all 4 sections in one sitting. Using Kaplan's review for the GMAT - I think I would definitely come up short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title.

I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor help, if you're looking for new material","review":"Unfourtunetely, I was expecting Kaplan's book to help me and develop my scores at GMAT. But this book didn't help me at all.The diagnostic test is the same as the year's 2000 edition. So if you are lucky and find it in some used bookstore don't even hesitate. All the extras added to this revision are usless. The online help that they promote in the cover are the same examples as in teh CD ROM.Added to this, I write a complain to the client service department, and three month later I'm still waiting for a response. Please consider t buy an older version of this book, it will save you money.If I have to highlight one advantage of this book will be the additional GMAT CAT TEST 4. But be aware if you do the paper based test first. You will find that most of the questions are going to be asked to you again in the CD ROM so one point less to KAPLAN 2004 edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is an album well worth the money (under $8.00 new and used for around $2.00).

Though I love most of the Malawi line, this item is an exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"A conclusion that is both satisfying and surprising.","review":"Franny and Zooey takes place in a large apartment in upper Manhattan. There is an isolation, seclusion and haunting quality to life in the apartment. The story revolves around Franny Glass, the youngest of the Glass family. The Glass parents are successful and talented performers.Franny is at a crisis point in her young life, a spiritual crisis. She appears to have broken down. Zooey is sent to talk to her. Both Franny and Zooey are precocious, and a bit egotistical as they begin a long personal and searching discussion.The book is not dated, and in my view; it is still relevant and brilliant. The simple white cover and young, lively font capture the story's essence. Franny and Zooey goes much deeper than Catcher in the Rye, and it remains Salinger's greatest book. What makes it great is the conclusion. A conclusion that is both satisfying and surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than \\"Catcher\\"","review":"I had read Catcher in the Rye, in high school and really enjoyed it. I had wanted to read more by J.D. Salinger, so I bought Franny and Zooey. It took me a while to really understand what was happening in the book. So much so that I didn't get everything until a few days after finishing it. This is what I think makes it such an amazing book. You might not remember everything they talked about or that happened, but the feeling and meaning of it stays with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absofrikkin'lutly Amazing","review":"My mother recomended this book to me during a time where I really needed some sort of guidance. I needed someone to relate to. Franny was that person. I cannot even explain how much I adore this book, the characters, and what I learned from it. Now, anytime I feel out of place or unhappy I pick up Franny and Zooey and somehow things are put into perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"The insight into a spirtual mind.","review":"I have just finished reading Franny and Zooey, and it( like A Catcher In The Rye ) amazed me. Salinger's style and use of language has again captured me into the heart of this book. I found this book not as good as A Catcher In The Rye, but right up there underneath it. Franny's spirtual struggle, and Zooey's countinued talks made this a great book, that I reccomend for anyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most haunting of Salinger's works","review":"The Franny story is a scary account of someone coming unhinged made even more disturbing by her youth. Like Salinger's other two-tale collection, one feels like a real story with arc and all. The other seems unformed - rewarding nevertheless, but demanding of the reader's full attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franny and Zooey","review":"I really enjoyed Salinger's novel Franny and Zooey more than Catcher in the Rye for which he is famous. This book leaves the reader a changed person. After reading this you question things like society, religion, education and your relationships with different people. I highly recommend this book and think it will open your mind to new ideas concerning things that many of us accept without questioning. I think Salinger's brillance comes across in this novel since he is able to make the reader greatly question and analzye themselves and their surroundings through his stories about the Glass family."},{"rating":"2","title":"and it's tasty too.","review":"This book gave me a feeling, as another review put it, of familiarity. A lot of the philosophies or ways of thinking expressed by both Franny and Zooey reminded me a lot of thoughts that have often crossed my mind and the beliefs that have sprung from those thoughts. I'm actually supposed to write a review for this book in my Creative Writing class in HS. The assignment tells us to pretend that this is a book that has \\"just been published\\" and we are to tell whether it contends to modern-day life. I'd say that the subjects hit upon in this book are indeed time-less and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Novel by a Gifted Writer!","review":"J.D.

It started fine with dramatic tension between the neurotic college girl Franny and her \\"Holden Caulfield like\\" college boyfriend Lane. Then it all derailed with a new character, Franny's brother Zooey (another Holden) and this painful long back and forth wih his mother about what to do with poor mixed-up sister Franny.

I, regrettably, find the book exceedingly repetitive. The scant facts and hear-says about The Man are so re-used and re-cycled in articles after articles in this book. Save for the excerpts from Joyce Maynard's and Peggy Salinger's memoirs--which I am now interested to read, especially Maynard's--this book is a heap of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking, wandering: similar to many \\"classics\\"","review":"With all due respect to Salinger fans, I found this lacking. The only entertaining thing, in my eyes, was the references to Jappam and the meditations. Still, as far as the \\"story\\" itself, there wasn't much of one. Though I'm not a huge fan of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" either, at least that one took you through the life of a boy. This one left you in an apartment and let you hear them talk. Oh boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"After disciovering (and falling in love with) \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" for the first time, I quickly picked this book up next but was sorely dissapointed. The themes here are similar to \\"Catcher\\" (angst ridden youths, the phoniness of modern day society) but where Holden Caufield was an intruiging and symapthetic character, Franny is underrdeveloped and Zooey is smug and unlikable. I was actually surprised to discover how little I got out of this novel and in the end I consider it to be a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The View of a High School Senior","review":"Franny and Zooey was the worst book I have ever read. It is full of pointless dialogue that takes the reader weeks to understand and leaves him completely unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book helped me realize something important","review":"I hated this book. I hatedThe Catcher in the Rye, too, but I figured that it was because I read it when I was eighteen and Just Didn't Get It because it was Important Literature and I Simply Didn't Have Enough Life Experience(TM). But now, years later, I've come to the conclusion that I just hate Salinger.His characterization is awful. His characters are despicable, unsympathetic, egocentric, neurotic, and narcissistic. If I wanted to experience the incessant nattering of people who are simultaneously this reprehensible and this boring, I'll watch reality television. I had to read or re-read three other fluff-novels to have enough mental reserves to finish this.I do have to thank this book for one thing, though. Franny and Zooey helped me to realize that life is too short to read bad literature. Never again am I going to fight my way through to the end of a novel I'm not enjoying just to indulge a compulsive desire for completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snooze!","review":"Wow, two hundred pages of useless banter with no action.

Zooey and Bessie engage in a Verbal Karate match and accomplish nothing save the lighting, dragging on, and extinguishing of countless cigarettes.Oh yes - the medicine cabinet swings open incessantly, afterwhich, Zooey explains that his sister's hysteria is due to her poor choice in reading material. The entire 68 page bathroom scene is lightly punctuated by a delightful orange cuticle stick and several passive cameos from a blue bathmat. And more cigarettes: On the frosted-glass ledge and on the built-in enamel soap catch.Read \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" by Robert M. Pirsig.

However, his novel Franny and Zooey was a huge disappointment. His writing is excellent. The characters aren't. I had no interest in them. I became totally bored before reading half the novel. What a shame. The first chapter, however, was a joy to read. The remaining chapters weren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay attention young writers. Study this book.","review":"Let's face it: if you're only going to write a handful of books in your lifetime, let one of them be The Catcher in the Rye, and let another one be Franny and Zooey. Billed by many critics as two stories I find it more fitting to describe the text as a novella in two parts. One-fifth of the way into Franny and Zooey, the narrator steps directly into the novel to establish, among other things, the narrative contract with the reader. In this section the narrator all but introduces himself as Buddy, the oldest living of the seven children of Bessie and Les Glass. Zooey and Franny Glass are the youngest of these children. This lucid contract with the reader belies the narrative complexities of the novella. The final scene of Franny and Zooey, while the siblings speak to each other on separate phone lines just one room away from each other, is one of my favorite, and one of the most moving scenes in all of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The superficiality of the \\"cultural church\\"","review":"Symbolized through the Jesus Prayer, Salinger portrays the \\"phoniness\\" of the cultural church, whose chief objective is to serve as an escape from the fear of our existential dilemma. True faith, as Kierkegaard would say entails letting go of the illusions and discovering Christ the person. And as Zooey points out we do this not by trying to escape God's world, but by embracing it. \\"In so much as you do for others (acting) you do for me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do your homework!","review":"If the ertswhile \\"Pencey Prep student\\" had bothered to do his homework, he would've realized that \\"Franny and Zooey\\" is in no way a \\"sequel\\" to \\"Catcher in the Rye', at least not narratively. It involves a different set of Salinger's characters, the Glass family, although the theme of resisting hypocrisy and phoniness which runs through \\"Catcher\\" also imprints itself on \\"F&Z\\". I think it's Salinger's most readable and captivating book, and the precocious Glass siblings aren't any more \\"self-indulgent\\" or neurotic than Holden Caulfield in \\"Catcher\\". There's truths in these stories which transcend their particular milieus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a good book, allthough like with all of Salinger's books, it leaves me wanting to know more about the carachters, I wanted to continue reading when it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like Really Annoying People","review":"Maybe like most, I thought I would like this because I loved Catcher In The Rye. What a disappointment. The characters are so irritating and unlikable, and the stories did not have anything compelling about them. I was really surprised because I've heard from a few people that this was their favorite book ever. It wasn't badly written; the descriptive language was strong and captured the characters' moods and motivations. It just did not offer anything interesting, it was like being trapped in a room with a couple of bitter people with their complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trifle Thoughtful Story","review":"Contrary to popular belief, I believe this is one story-not two-and would go as far as to say that anyone thinking this novel was two separate stories, or even two interrelated separate stories, must have missed the boat all together. The story of Franny and Zooey is about a brother and sister, whom you are persuaded (rather weakly) to believe were the victims of their older siblings' religious influences. What a bore. Salinger's philosophical spewing is elementary at best. As a side note, Salinger used the word \\"trifle\\" a trifle too many times (every four pages to be exact-- check it out)."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply awful","review":"That adolescents might enjoy Salinger is excusable; his work touches the same chords of narcissism, self-pity, and self-regarding idealism as those other classics of pubescent angst--Siddhartha, Atlas Shrugged, and so forth. But beware, my young friends, if you're over the age of, say, 21 and you can still read this stuff without boredom or nausea you're either an imbecile or a sociopath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite my fear of being accused of...","review":"not being hip, I must venture out and say:Oh my God!!!

Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood. Boring in the 50s and boring now.As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey. Holden was familiar. Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.

I want to scream i am so annoyed. salinger could have showed the reader what he wanted to express in 2/50ths of what he did. one other problem i find to be true about his writing is that he writes about god and prayer and stuff like everyone who reads his books will be a devout christian or whatever. I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD, so sue me. he thinks that everyone in the world is like that, and it is annoying. that's all i have to say about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Message?","review":"I read this book and really enjoyed it, but am also curious if there is some message that I am missing.

For those of you who said it was too full of \\"pointless\\" dialouge fail to look into what the book is trying to say (as do those people who criticize \\"Catcher\\"). If you fail to look beyond the surface then the message will be lost on you. For those of you who have the ability to take a book for more than surface value you will really enjoy this book. Those of you who can't will not enjoy this book and I doubt could enjoy any book of any real value. In my opinion it's sad to see people giving this book a bad review just because they lack insight. It's even worse when they decide to not even give a name or e-mail address when they post an unfounded comment like that. I hope future readers of this wonderful book will be more open minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Veritable Masterpiece for now","review":"If not for my 12 year old sister in law I may have never read this book. And that would have been to my great loss. I \\"made\\" my sister in law read The Catcher in the Rye to give her a little more of an idea what real literature was about. She loved it. Needless to say she wanted to read more Salinger and as I wasn't familiar with the content I read it first. Had I not it would not be as of now my favorite book. The contents af this book are so self exploring to the person who can relate to it. It makes you say hey \\"I'm like that too, but why?\\" It is the kind of book that makes you think. And what else are books for? In conclusion all I can say is Mr. Salinger where have you gone? We'd all love to hear from you again, if not for us do it for the Fat Lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Pregnant","review":"Okay, let's talk about the whole Franny being pregnant issue and why it is completely wrong. Seymour, the guy that died, was having the same problems as Franny and I'm pretty sure he wasn't pregnant. In his other book, Holden was pretty near a breakdown too, and for some unexplained reason, I don't think he was pregnant either. The whole too long a time between sips or drinks or whatever doesn't prove anything because she is far away from him. All it shows is that she really doesn't like him which is pretty obvious anyway. She doesn't need to be having a baby not to want to be with him.I don't think the book loses meaning either. I think it loses its real meaning when you think she's pregnant. Putting the issue aside for a minute, I think it really is a good book, and I think that if you like salinger it's very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual birth or also pregnant with child ??","review":"Salinger has left us to decide whether Franny is pregnant with child or just spiritual birth but the clues are there. First in her letter to Lane she mentions in the postscript that her mother isn't mad and therefore not aware that he'd snuck into the Glass apartment one Friday night weeks before. Secondly he plans to sneak up to her room that night. What better parallel development than a child growing within her during her spiritual awakening ?? Is there no possibility that the physical symptoms are hormonal changes brought on by pregnancy ?? Is Salinger's writing so one-dimensional he'd only provide the \\"hit me over the head\\" spirituality theme in the novel ?? I personally believe the \\"Franny\\" section was a masterwork while the \\"Zooey\\" section was down a level. Taken as a whole it's a beautifully crafted story with engaging characters leaving no doubt of Salingers gift for the writing craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zooey Glass: World's Greatest Religious Scholar","review":"When my younger sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer, she wrote and asked me what in my fifty years of life I had learned of God.

Ten years later, I am delighted to report that my sister is surviving still, as is the greatest book ever written about Jesus' relevance to modern man, in spite of idiotic reviews like the one published by Amazon (promoting?) this classic.After having read Franny at least twenty times over the years, I have just been advised by Amazon's reviewer that the poor girl was pregnant.

This work is cynical like Catcher but it has an underlying theme of deep love and intelligence. Insightful Salinger knows people, knows the world, and presents his views succinctly and humorously. It's dry, it's a slice of another world. Short and delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite boring till the last few pages","review":"I'm a pretty big J.D. Salinger fan, having previously read The Catcher in the Rye and Nine Stories and enjoyed both but with this book I found it very hard to finish, despite the fact that it is only 202 pages. Its pretty slow reading and not a lot is happening in the book. It all basically takes place in the Glass flat in NYC and there are 4 main characters, Franny, Zooey, Franny's mother and boyfriend. It's all about the Jesus Prayer and finding out about religion for Franny and how she lives her life.All Salinger is doing in this book is putting down some tidbit of his philosophy down in fiction form with characters. Only real big Salinger fans should attempt to read this and if you're only wanting to read a Salinger book stick with The Cathcher in the Rye."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real page-turner","review":"You may have read other books by J.D. Salinger, but you're missing out if you haven't read Franny and Zooey. This story is split into two sections and is based on a dysfuntional family, the Glasses. Franny, the youngest of seven, is a college-aged girl who is obsessed with reciting the Jesus Prayer. Throughout the book we learn that Franny is in self-crisis, and how her family members cope. As a teenager I was able to relate with her character, and this made the book so much more enjoyable. Yet another well written novel by Salinger..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it for school and enjoyed it.","review":"\\"Franny and Zoe\\" was an excellent book. J.D.

If you have to read this book in school boy it sucks to be you. The only reason I gave this book one star was because that was the lowest grade I could of given it. I would of given this book 1/4 of star because I like the title of the book.

It didn't really have a clear theme or conflict. The characters were very confusing. It was hard to follow their actions. Franny is an immature girl, who needs help and doesn't want to receive it. Zooey is an sarcastic, cynical and very unpleasant. I didn't really like how it was divided up into sections. At first it starts out with Franny, and a couple of pages later, it turns into Zooey, making it a very rough transition. They were originally two newspaper articles. After reading Catcher in The Rye, and liking it, I thought this novel would be worthwhile, but it turned out to be a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Salinger, but this isn't one of his best...","review":"This is a book about a brother and a sister.

In approx '70-'71, the album was remixed to produce a much richer and enjoyable sonic product which better revealed the depth and breadth of this masterpiece. The remix was used by Warner Brothers for vinyl albums beginning in approx. late '72. Unfortunately (to my way of thinking), when issuing the CD of Anthem of the Sun, Warner Brothers reverted to the original mix which has a much more \\"raw\\" feel. This has some charm, and perhaps reflects the energy of the period ('67-'68), but does not, for me, portray the exquisitely crafted melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic masterwork so evident in the remix. There is a new INTERACTIVE ANTHEM CD - which will reportedly allow the user to mix-your-own Side One, on-the-fly!

Very creative and different from anything else. This album mixed live and studio recordings together to create a seemless jam that sounds like nothing else. The only breaks are the brief pause between Born Cross-Eyed and the break for the side change. The new bonus songs are from the night before Two From The Vault was recorded. Back in 1971, both Anthem and Aoxomoxoa were remixed, Anthem by Phil and Aoxomoxoa by Jerry. Phil later regretted remixing this album promising that next time it came out it would be the original mix. Thankfully, they went for the original July '68 mix for the cd versions of this release and not the crappy 7/71 remix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, great remastering, great extra tracks","review":"This is the album that turned me onto the Dead. 35 years later is sounds as wild, experimental, and fresh as it did when it first came out.You'll enjoy the live performance added to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Independent music at its best.","review":"I had never heard of Ana Egge before I saw her as the opening act for Shawn Colvin in April 1998. This was at a club called Bogart's in Cincinnati, OH. She came out onto the stage with no accompaniment, just a guitar she had made herself. As she sang her songs, I was amazed. She has a beautiful voice, and sings songs perfectly suited to herself. After the show I stopped by the vendor's stand to buy the only Ana Egge CD available, \\"River Under the Road.\\" I can't count the number of times that I've listened to it since then. Some of the stand out songs from the CD (and her performance) are \\"Talco Girl,\\" \\"Fierro,\\" and \\"Fairest Of Them All.\\" If you enjoy singer/songwriters like Shawn Colvin, Lucinda Williams, and Mary-Chapin Carpenter, then Ana Egge is an artist that you will come to love. Highly reccommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice woke me out of a deep sleep.","review":"My clock radio goes off at 5 am.

While I don't usually listen to country music, this album is fresh and lively and goes beyond the usual cliches of country lyrics and music. Thanks NPR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is seriously great.","review":"If you like Shawn Colvin, Lyle Lovett, Gillian Welch, et al, you will love Ana!

However, after a few games, one of the buttons stopped responding, making the game difficult to play.

The game is as good as I remember especially on PRO2. When quiet time is necessary, the sound ON/OFF is terrific. I gave it four stars because the durability seems weak (fifteen minutes of Christmas morning action results in bad button) and the instructions are written poorly.Just a followup, Amazon shipped me a new game even before I had a chance to send the defective one back.

What a disappointment it was to discover that LOVE IT TO DEATH, my all-time favorite Alice Cooper album, was in the hands of Audio Fidelity. I, regrettably, purchased their edition of SCHOOL'S OUT when it was first released in 2009 and couldn't believe that that was the best they could do for the price they were asking. Not that I was expecting them to replicate the original paper panties of the vinyl version, but a bonus cut or two or even a booklet with liner notes would've helped justify the price. The barely noticeable so-called improvement in sound quality alone was certainly not worth it.

A great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this book a negative rating!","review":"I would have to rate this book up there as one of the worst I've ever read. The author talks about people speaking freely because they were anonymous, I think it was more along the lines of people exaggerating freely because they were anonymous. I don't see how people in Silicon Valley have the time for sex at all, they are too busy online in chat rooms, playing with themselves while online in chat rooms and taking stupid surveys.

I've pumped hot water through the hose, nothing. The water flow from my pump is cut in half by the crush zones. If I hold the hose just so, and squeeze a couple of the crush spots to open them with my hand, the pump works reasonably well but not as well as it could. The material of the hose seems to be of a strong, somewhat flexible, and otherwise good quality but the people who package it don't seem to have a clue. I suppose if you were putting 50psi house water through it Those crushed spots might expand but my 2500 gph pump can't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"This book is not what I expected--I had expected an approach from a theoretical point of view. Instead, this book offers a lot of \\"general\\" techniques/advices that I did not find particularly helpful.

I felt a lot of advices are \\"common sense\\", but then I have some exposure to this kind of books.

Fronted by Jeanette Chase with Benatar pipes, you might think this will stick with the Babe Ruth sound - one screaming rocker after the other. Think again. Tracks 1 and 4 (Settle Down and Hand In Hand) could easily be late period Renaissance. The non-LP ballad, If It's True, is lovely and shows off her range - think Kate Bush with a stronger band. Lear Stevens on guitar has all the licks but most of the time he keeps to the melody making for an ear-friendly experience. Even their mainstream power ballad, Come Home, is great (similar to Journey when they hit it right). There is something endearing about the 80s, twenty short years after the Beatles changed popular music forever. Equipment got better. Production got a lot better. Texturing and over-dubbing became the norm. Storm was ahead of its time. Both CDs with bonus tracks are highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOnderful account of a piece of Texas' history.","review":"This story, as told from the eyes of a young girl from Germany, gives a fairly accurate account of what life may have been like for a family immigrating to Texas in 1847. It is appropriate for all ages and backgrounds, but is particularly interesting to the Germans who established themselves in Texas. As I read it, I related to the language, customs, and locations presented in the story. I am eager for my father to read it. His mother might well have written the story herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading to say the least","review":"From the item description, which lists this book as a biography, I assumed it was actually a non-fiction book. Unfortunately, it is just a mere work of fiction which has only the slightest ties to historical fact. In fact, the Library of Congress cataloging data inside the book shows that the book is a work of fiction. There is also no mention that this is a book written for young adults. So, from a genealogist's point of view this book serves very little purpose, since anyone can pull a few facts and figures together from the historical record and come up with a story about someone who didn't exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome..","review":"Fantastic album.The Other One and Playing in the Band are my favorites.You won't be sorry purchasing this, assuming your seller is as good as mine was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tony Hillerman tale","review":"A short book and fun to read.

There are still some good hearty laughter moments at Costello's antics but mostly it's slow moving and predicatable. And if this has actuallt been restored then I hate to think what kind of condition it was in before it was 'restored'. All in all for the price I got it at, it wasn't so bad I certainly wouldn't wanted to have paid full price for it. If you are a fan of Abbott and Costello you may want to buy it to complete your collection or becasue it was one of (if not) the only film that shot in colour, or because it was one of the movies produced by Costello's film company.

The author admitted she only guessed her former partner had Asperger's. My relationship is completely different in many ways, so I could not relate to her very much. Perhaps there is wide variance in Asperger's; perhaps he was not an Aspie at all.If you are interested in reading about other people's relationships, this is interesting and might as well be fiction.

A number of the illustrations continue out into the margin-to the point where one was nearly printed off the page. In my copy several of the pages have been printed with either too much or too little ink. The whole production shows many signs of being thrown together-\\"slap-dash\\" is one word which comes to mind.Okay, so this is all cosmetic, but if the author and publisher cared so little about these things, how much care was taken (or rather, wasn't taken) over the text? I can't prove there are any major mistakes (after all, the book's audience is beginning woodworkers, of which I'm one).

The writing is very clean, concise, and free of confusing jargon and technobabble for the most part, and the author maintains a consistent tone throughout the novel.The author uses Armitage, one of the novels main characters, as a solid foil for Dredd, allowing the author to reveal more about Dredd and to touch upon areas the previous novel hadn't explored. With this novel, Judge Dredd evolves into something closer to a real human being than he'd been in The Savage Amusement.In a nutshell, if you enjoyed The Savage Amusement, you'll probably really like Deathmasques. If you haven't read the previous novel, then I suggest you think very carefully about what your limit for gratuitous violence is before reading Deathmasques, because this novel is one long blood-bath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its no Moondance, but its essential","review":"If you love Moondance and Cant live without Astral Weeks you also need to get Tupelo Honey.

The CD also includes 'Straight to Your Heart (Like a Cannonball)', 'Old, Old Wodstock', 'Starting a New Life', 'You're My Woman', 'I Wanna Roo You', When that Evening Sun Goes Down', and 'Moonshine Whiskey'. It is my 4th favorite Van Morrison CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tupelo Honey","review":"This recording is jam packed with hits!! They just don't write music that reaches your soul anymore. Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not equal to Moondance","review":"Every song on this cd is great. I didn't really like Astral Weeks as much as this. Tupelo Honey is probably Van Morrison's 2nd best album, the 1st being Moondance. If you are thinking of buying this as your first Van Morrison cd, and get this, then you have to get Moondance to go along with it. Get it if you don't have it"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a keeper","review":"I have all of Van's early stuff. This would probably be number three on my list. Astral Weeks being first and moondance coming in a close second. The FM stations beat to death the title track so I will comment on the others. Moonshine Whiskey is one tune that really flies. It is as close to the other two albums as you can get. The rest of the album is very good, a lot of people rave about \\"you're my Woman but I don't feel what they feel on that one. I'll take Ballarnia any day! So, lastly, I would say get this if you already own and like the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipped","review":"The Cd skipped, but I'm glad it did not skip on my favorite song!

I am so happy with it! I really bought it because of the title track, which is probably one of the most beautiful love songs ever written. The rest of the CD is great too, but nothing can top Tupelo Honey for pure emotion and sexiness. A great song for slow-dancing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tupelo Shows Van's Extraordinary Range and Styles","review":"Purchased on a friend's recommendation, I was somewhat skeptical on how this album can be different from other Van Morrison albums, but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. Not only am I shocked that the song Tupelo Honey has not found its way onto any \\"greatest hits\\" compilation albums, it perhaps ranks up there with \\"Into the Mystic\\" in terms of a classic soul and song. This album has a country flavor to it, but not overbearing. Songs such as When That Evening Sun Goes Down and I Wanna Roo You have the country bent to it. You're My Woman is a great love song that ranks up there with Crazy Love off of \\"Moondance.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"As quiet as stock or even quieter.","review":"I needed to replace my muffler on my 1998 Dodge Ram 1500 because the stock catalytic converter was clogged. I installed a high flow Magnaflow catalytic converter which is much louder than stock, so I assumed this muffler might have a little bit of a rumble to it based on other reviews. Don't believe it; it is quieter now than with the stock system. The fit of the muffler however is perfect. So if you are looking for a stock replacement at a good price with a quiet sound, this is a good choice. I installed it without needing to jack up the truck in about 25 minutes, you will need to purchase (2) 2 1/2\\" muffler clamps unless you can re-use your old ones.I just wish somebody would make a muffler that was a direct replacement but with a bit of a rumble to it.Oh, and don't forget a new muffler will often blow smoke out of the pipes for a day or two until all the oils burn off and the moisture in the packing is turned to steam.

Luigi Bormioli is a well known name in Europe and this finely made glass decanter works marvels. Meant for approximately one bottle of wine (750ml/32 ounces), but able to hold three (88 ounces), the wine slides along the glass until it passes over the concentric circles. These are unique to Bormioli, as this helps to facilitate the wine oxygenation, which improves the taste. I am told that you taste wine, but it is one of those rare treats where your nose is very important. The aeration creates the unique smell or aroma of each wine. The bubble at the bottom helps with any sediment collection.Besides being a great way to make your wine taste better, it looks great on any table. Although it is said to be dishwasher safe, I simply rinse mine thoroughly with tap water and let it dry naturally.

Why were \\"1984\\" and \\"Knock on Wood\\" included, if they overlap with the period in the previous compilation? The answer is: this is a \\"dance\\" compilation. Whoever selected the tracks wanted to show the world that David had been recording \\"dance\\" songs long before the \\"Let's Dance\\" album, released in 1983. Even the ballads (\\"Can You Hear Me\\" and \\"Wild is The Wind\\") are the sort of stuff one would find on David's \\"dance\\" albums of the 80's. So the compilation flows smoothly.

However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut.

Ozzy sounds like he'd just smoked two packs of cigarettes before laying down the vocals in the studio. In terms of historical importance (musically speaking) that title is more appropiate for Paranoid. I'm sure there are some purists up in arms over is---but if it sounds like [...] than it probably is. Skip is album and purchases the following:1.

The band's namesake song is here, still the most chilling composition in Sabbath's catalogue and a successful sonic interpretation of the horror genre; as well as metal classics like \\"N.I.B.\\" and \\"The Wizard\\".

The album starts with their theme song, which in six little minutes started the whole doom metal thing. Then comes The Wizard, which is a harmonica-laden, metallic song. Then the trio, Bassically, Behind The Wall Of Sleep, and N.I.B. Then the sludgy Wicked World with the great middle piece. Then the 15-minute-plus Warning/Sleeping Village.

Last week I finally listened to this album quite closely and the album isn't about devil worship at all but how the devil deceives and eats up people if they aren't careful. I am making my own comparison between this album and Master of Reality which should turn out just fine. All in all, the album may be a bit repetitive, but it is a very good starter. Unfortunately, the US release omitted the song Evil Woman from the album but is included on the UK release. This is a very good rock song and would have been a hit had it been included on the US release and released as a single. Sabbath has made a good start with this one leading to other masterpieces like Master of Reality, Volume 4, and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, all good albums indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad debut...","review":"This is not the best or most famous Sabbath album, but it still has some gems, especially Warning. It's the only Sabbath album that is very 60's and hippie in its rhythm, so it's kind of a serendipity album.

I got to see them at Ozzfest 2004, they rocked, but it all started in 1970 with the release of their self titled first album. At the time of it's release there really wasn't anything else like it. No one sounded so dommy or glummy before. Black Sabbath opens the album with sounds of rain, thunder, and church bells so right off the bat we get into the dark subject matter. Second track is the bluesy The Wizard. Perhaps the coolest tune on the album is N.I.B. Black Sabbath is still a classic 34 years after it came about, and the band is still extremely popular after all these years, headling Ozzfest 2004 along side Judas Priest.

Sure, Paranoid got more popular and Master of Reality had more gloomy riffs, but this is the birth of heavy metal. In fact, this isn't heavy metal at all! It's distorted blues! For those who argue with me, listen to Wicked World, and you'll see what i'm talking about. Pure blues. This album was also very experimental. It's the only time you'll hear them with a harmonica, or a saxaphone(Evil Woman from the english version). The highlight isn't Black Sabbath or N.I.B, but actually it's Warning. 14 minutes long, it has some of the best experimental-blues-metal playing ever.

If I was in a terrible motorcycle accident and was being rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, as I was starting to get dizzy from loss of blood, the sirens would start to sound like the guitar in the Wizard.

I first bought a tape of this back in 1979 or 1980 and was blown away by it. Since then, I've upgraded to CD and still marvel at the music.If you listen to this album, you can really hear the amazing influence Sabbath has on so much of the metal and alternative music to follow. The intersting thing to me about this album is that while it's undeniably heavy, it has a jazz-like quality to many of the instrumental passages. There are moments of real musicality here, not just mindless angry headbanging. Of course there's plenty of amplified mayhem and doom to satisfy even the angriest metalhead, but it's truly, dare I say, sophisticated?I've been listening to this album for over twenty years, and I still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FIRST HEAVY METAL ALBUM EVER","review":"WITHOUT THIS HEAVY METAL ALBUM IT IS HARD TO TELL HOW HEAVY METAL WOULD BE TODAY OR IF IT EVEN WOULD EXIST.

I don't even listen much to hard rock or heavy metal any more, but this masterpiece I always come back to. To me it's also one of the most under-rated albums.

The newer translators may be technically more accurate. And from time to time the may seem more colloquial. But they never capture the verve and the passion that epitomizes the great Russians.

It tells the harrowing tale of an ex-student, driven to murder, and the aftermath of his actions. It is superbly written and loses none of the passion and emotion through the translation from russian.The book holds the readers attention, its insight into the main charachters mind keeping you interested untill the end. The writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky manages to extract an amazing tale from the bleak, severe surroundings of russia in which it is set.In closing, I feel that Crime and Punishment is a book thet everyone should read at least once in their lifetime. It is a thought provoking book, offering deep insights into the human mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Insight","review":"Fyodor Dostoevksy marvelously illustrates the effect that guilt has on the human mind. Raskolnikov, an idealist and impoverished youth, finds himself committing a murder to help his people, but he is slowly transformed, along with his social theories. The unexplainable guilt gnaws at him until he changes his mind about his motives, his morals, and his faith. He realizes that social and economic change do not happen through murder, but through charity and hard work, which he learns through helping the prostitute daugher of a drunkard, as well as his own poor family. He accepts religion and God, as a way to repent and make his life more meaningful, and slowly he drives himself toward a confession.....

The cover art on the Blackstone site even shows that Garnett is the translator but not when seen on Amazon or Audible. Very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I lived near the Red Sea","review":"Although I'm sure this book is wonderfully written in many ways, I cannot help but say that I absolutely hated it. I'm certain that persons with more scholarly inclinations will completely disagree with me, but I cannot help but envy another reviewer who has tossed his copy into the Red Sea. Although I cannot pinpoint exactly where this novel and I got off on the wrong foot, I will say that there was too much repetition, and I could not identify with or even like any of the characters. By the time I got to the end, I was thinking that I wished someone had jerked the book out of my hand and slapped me with it before I ever opened it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There aren't very many books that I can't finish, and I am a bit embarassed to admit that this was one of them.

Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was hard to read and is for serious readers only. That being said, it was a fantastic book. It is not a light beach read and takes effort to get through. When you are done, you know you read a masterpiece.

But Crime and Punishment will always be my first love. Raskolnikov is the demon and the archangel incarnated and his conversations with the police officer are a display of a total mastermind. The funny thing about this book is that it sharpens your thoughts and reflexions. When I had read the book, my mental world grew and I started to think in Raskolnikovs manner (I didn't kill anyone though)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"I recently finished this book, and I must say it was one of the best books I have ever read. As a fourteen year old high school student, I was constantly told that Crime and Punishment would be too difficult and too boring for me. They were so wrong. From Raskolnikov's first thoughts about murder, to his slow descent into madness, the book was impossible to put down.I recomend Crime and Punishment to everyone, it's intelligent and enjoyable. A wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the Criminal Mind","review":"This is the classic psychological novel of our time! Dostoevsky examines every inch of the human mind at its most horrific moment. It will take a good hour before you are fully taken in by the story. Once you are there - you anxiously await the outcome. At the end - you will probably feel more sympathy for the murderer than the murdered, because the author gave us so much insight into the criminal mind. Dostoevsky made us believe that the main character could even be you or I."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cultural Classic Read by an Aristocrat","review":"I feel Alex Jennings is a very good reader. He often imitates the characters he reads as though he were several different people. This helps to imagine the personalities of the characters, lowers the general boredom of listening to an audio book, and creates much immersion. Jennings, with his slight English accent, is crystal clear in his voice. He sounds above the academic and more an intellectual--an aristocrat--who carries the story, and there is no problem in the immersion. He is interesting and perfectly-paced. He reads the text rather happily, without any drone-type sound. He reads delightfully, as though he likes the text and is willing to play the parts.I'm happy with the reader and the audio book. I should add, I have very little experience with audio books. But, Dostoevsky's book is an academic and intellectual classic, and the reading is good, very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"This is a mal-shaped book structurally. Raskolnikov suggests to the lawman about mid-way through this long book that he is the killer...and then the book still has hundreds of pages to go! The second half seemed to me a lot of filler. I think THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV a masterpiece, and it is also about a murder. But CRIME AND PUNISHMENT doesn't deserved its classic status. And Nabokov detested Dostoevsky, because he didn't like the idea of characters coming to spiritual awakening through horrendous acts. And, while I think Dostoevsky was a better writer than Nabokov thought he was, that's one of the problems I had with this book: In the end you're supposed to feel uplifted by Raskolnikov's \\"awakening,\\" but all I could think was, \\"But the guy murdered two women! He should be drowned in the river he is standing near!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I'd strongly recommend Garnett's version. This is far more intuitive than previous version -- with particular attention to the emotional undertone rather then a literal translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"What it was said to be","review":"I don't give very many 5 star ratings. This is a hard rating for me. The spine is separated from the cover-as described. The book is intact and in readable condition-as described. It is well worn, beat up, and old. The seller described it as such. It took a while to decide whether it added to, or detracted from, my collection. It is what it is. An old beat up book. I still dont Know if I love it or not-but it is as described. Even the spine separation was in the seller's description. If you buy from this seller expect what they describe. This book does add character to my collection, as I'd hoped. If \\"new\\" means \\"nice\\" to you-it's not a \\"nice\\" book.

Away from dogs and friends. Great read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take time for the Classics!","review":"I took some time off from modern reading to read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. What a ride! It turned out to be a brilliant treatise into the mind of anapparent psychopath, but may just be any one of us who decides to play God. The characters are brought to life wonderfully by Dostoevsky and their personalities will be recognizable to you. The entangling of the main character's justification for his crime with the psychological drama of his daily life and of those around him, will draw you in and having you asking big questions of your own conscience. The story was written during pre-communist Russia. This provides a great addition to the storyline - a time and place of transition of a historically Christian society into the post-modern world where God is an abstract crutch or doesn't exist at all. You will enjoy this psychological thriller, and probably like me, kick yourself for not reading it before.R"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"We had to read this for English Honors, and when I first saw how long it was, I was not looking forward to it.

His philosophy is simply splendid, the plot is perfect. I believe that this is not a book which you can read just once and fully understand all the nuances of the philosophy. You cannot read this book without full concentration either.

It's like watching a disaster happen slowly before my eyes without the power or the will to stop it.The writing style, character and plot development are all perfect. The only thing I'd complain about would be that the book started off with an interesting moral debate over \\"If you can kill one bad person but save many innocent, should you do it?\\", but that was left hanging as the main character no longer concerns himself with this philosophical debate. But then again, it maybe better left to a different book as it was more of a catalyst for the plot and not meant to be a center piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Dostoevsky is one of the best. Some people get a little lost with his philosophy but I find him very insightful. Often I see his ideas in todays movies and TV shows. He has had a bigger impact with his writing then many people realise. I would rate this his second best surpased only by \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\". I read this book twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book, but didn't quite live up to the hype","review":"Despite other reviews that comment on the poor translation of this book. I found it to be fairly good and not affect the reading at all, and it has a great introduction (that I suggest reading after you finish the book because it has great ideas, but gives away the ending). As for the book itself, it isn't to deep and almost anyone should be able to understand it fully. It is almost more of a character study but the plot does move along quite nicely and the book is hard to put down once you get into it, and like all Russian authors there is some philosoph yin this book, but it is laid out for you very simply. As for only giving it 4 stars, I just felt that it wasn't as great as it could have been (since he was writing it for money above anything else)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Lit","review":"My daughter loves Russian literature ever since high school. So she adores reading the Russian classics and enjoys receiving them as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.","review":"I really enjoy the Russian Novelists. This classic will not disappoint, but it is not quite as good as \\"The Brothers Karamazov.\\" It is a bit long, but engaging. Dostoyevsky addresses big questions, ones which will always be asked, though this postmodern age discourages self examination which dares to moralize. Dostoyevsky takes you inside the mind of his characters (which seems to be common to the Russian authors of the period), and you begin to compare your own thoughts. One does well to use such a book as an occasion for reflection on motives and values. A little self judgment can be good for us, and if you read it seriously, Crime and Punishment will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRIME AND PUNISHMENT","review":"I love the book but miss a table of contents.

It is slightly different from the original Russian version, however, it's the best book of all time. It is envigorating and fascinating. It makes you cry and laugh. It lets you into Raskolnikov's head and lets you see the flow of his thoughts. You feel like you are Raskolnikov, and those thoughts are yours. It's amazingly real and moving.

The story revolves around an intelligent young man by the name of Rodion Raskolnikov.

I read Crime and Punishment 13 years ago, and have spent the following years looking for something akin to this book.Dostoevsky has the rare gift of not just writing; but truly entering the mind of his subjects; every psychological nuance. Every fear; the paranoia, guilt, hatred, persecutiion, and angst of tortured souls (Maybe it was his stay in Siberia that shaped him).Everyone should read this book. It's an open letter about the human condition. Then read The Brothers Karamozov; then The Idiot.It's not happy reading. It's literature with soul. Someday I'll find a writer this good.

I liked Brothers Karamazov very much but I found Crime and Punishment to be pretty annoying, without any payoff. We have to follow the convoluted mind of a moron. The police detective just assumes that he will confess sooner or later because he's a gentleman, not a poverty-stricken crook. What's that about? Why the hell would you assume that a murderer would confess? Must we suspend our disbelief and our common sense before opening the book? Raskolnikov is an annoying person to read about, and I don't find him terribly realistic either. If he is such an idealist, why doesn't he regret, most of all, killing the shy lady? Why does he forget her as soon as he dispatches her? And that ending - I'm not going to spoil it for you but I'll just say I don't believe it.

Because I had had bad experiences with required high school reading, I was really dreading reading this book. Though it begins slowly, I soon became very interested and I couldn't stop reading. It was as if I was inside the mind of someone who was actually insane. It was unlike anything I had ever read before and I found it strangely enjoyable. I finally understood why this book is a classic.

I have to laugh every time I hear it, especially Stuart. I know the whole song, word for word.

Three trips later and my children are already begging me to not make them listen to the cd's. The man's voice is especially annoying and makes my 8 yr old cover her ears and beg me to please shut it off. I am sure that if you listen to the cd's you might learn spanish, if you can keep awake.

I cancelled mine and asked them for a shipping address, but they just extended my trial and said they'd send me an email before the extension ends so I could call again.

The artwork is excellent to say the least; Hirano's style has certainly come a long way since the previous three mangas! His work in Volume four is far more refined, and the storyline progresses in an adrenaline choked suspense ride jam-packed with the kind of gore and gothic crusaderism we've come to expect from Hirano. Again, a definite must have for any fan of Hellsing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true masterpiece from the original Memphis Players","review":"Eightball and MJG come correct on Space Age 4eva.

Well told by people who've been there and know a thing or two about the briny depths and the ships that sail them.

I have learned to trust Patchett in that way. When I have read the plot outlines for her books, it has taken a leap of faith to plunge into them, the situations have seemed too off-beat for my conservative imagination. But I have learned to trust Patchett and I will always go with her. Taft is this kind of book. The fanciful awarenesses are atmospheric for me, not weird, as in other books with such devices. Her characters have flaws, but often great nobility. She is a fine author, and we are fortunate if she continues to share her gift with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful voice, but the story doesn't gel","review":"I was completely mezmorized by the first quarter of the book. Even though Anne Patchett is writing as a white woman, her characterizations of John, the black male ex-drummer and bar manager, and of the other bar employees ring true. The little details in the relationships between the characters, their idiosynchrocies and habits, are intriguing. The theme of loyalty and love surrounding John's longing for his son is equally compelling. BUT - when we get to the heart of the story, where John is pulled into alove-lust relationship with Fay, my stomach had a sinking \\"oh-no\\" feeling. And this instant reaction was correct. This plot line was flat and unbelievable, even repellant. So, too, are issues with Carl, Fay's drug-dealing brother. Anne Patchett is an incredibly talented author.

First of all, musicians don't refer to blues as 'blues music', or to what a guitarist plays as 'guitar music'. Similarly, black men in 1995 are not so afraid of being seen with a white woman that they sweat and panic. Perhpas if this book had been set in the 50's, she might have had something more than a trite and quaint race novel. then again, she might not have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I think Taft would have been more believable if the story was actually written by a black man.

Almost every source referenced in his book is slanted somewhat by the authors of the study. Too many of his references have conclusions that are not supported by the data presented in the paper.

The fact is, circumcision has at it's core nothing but falshoods supporting it. Intact males all over the world stand as proof the penis is created to stay clean, self-lubricate, and protect itself from disease by the presence of the foreskin. The tens of thousands of nerve endings, the muscles involved, etc., are a neccessary part of human sexuality and function.Don't fall for his sick twisted lies.

In a time which boys are still not protected by law against highly unnecessary, dangerous, and invasive procedures such as circumcision, I find it offensive that the author does not make an honest effort to portray this issue.I feel that this book is nothing more than another attempt to continue a tradition that has no basis in medical practice.

Very poor book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overbearing and one-sided","review":"Getting straight to the point, this book is terribly one-sided and not very well written. It does not show the whole truth of this matter. The real truth is that most doctors do not recommend circumcision, especially \\"routine\\" circumcision. All the top pediatricians in the world have found circumcision to be totally unnecessary and painful and carries many dangerous complications. Just in the same way one doesn't go about pulling out all one's teeth just to avoid brushing them, one does not go hacking off body parts to avoid washing them. That's what this book is about: silly excuses for an unneeded procedure. If you're into fiction, this is the book for you. If you want the truth, look elsewhere, this book isn't happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks","review":"I didn't like this book one bit.

It is well referenced and yet easy to understand. Current research in circumcision shows that it is protective for HIV, other sexually transmitted diseases and urinary tract infections. The book outlines much of these facts as well as other more controversial social/sexual issues.I strongly recommand this book especially if you would like to read the arguments IN FAVOUR of circumcision. Brian Morris should be congratulated for not even pretending that the book would give a balanced view and titles it accordingly (unlike many other authors on this topic). If you would like a balanced view on the topic of circumcision, then you should find a book called NOT IN FAVOUR of circumcision and compare it with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched and informative","review":"Morris provides his take on the very contentious and controversial issue of circumcision. Much like the abortion debate, circumcision is a highly charged debate with two bitterly divided camps that are for and against. Both issues have been clouded by campaigns of misinformation by minority groups largely influenced by their religious or political agendas. Morris is an academic and he clearly has an opinion (pro-circumcision) but he has formed his beliefs based on research and science. He doesn't appear to have a social agenda here, which is a refreshing change from all of the very angry and loud anti-circ activists. Circumcision is a very personal decision that parents (and sometimes grown men) have to make for themselves. Educate yourself about the pros and cons and make the best decision for you...don't buy into any extremist propaganda. This book is but one of many resources you should consult if you are considering circumcision for your child or yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually enjoy a good comedy..... but not this","review":"The cultural obsession with removing flesh from the genitals of children has come under increasing attack in recent years. Perhaps that is why the ghouls who actually favour the practice feel the need to step up their efforts. Brian Morris' book is a case in point.Brian Morris' book \\"In Favour of Circumcision\\" consists of much outdated and/or invalid evidence which has not been taken seriously by the medical community for some time. Therefore, when one has waded through all the mumbo-jumbo, one is left with the rantings and ravings of a very disturbed man with an apparent mutilation fetish and a sick desire to promote the genital cutting of children.Although I admit to laughing heartily several times while reading this book, I found my laughter interrupted by the sobering consideration that many foolish parents will take in this nonsense. I'm afraid I can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"So flawed that it's worthless","review":"I'd love to read a well-written, factual book on the positive aspects of circumcision. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be one. For scientific information, Morris relies on studies that are generally recognised to be outdated, flawed, or spurious. He bases much of his work on science that has been thoroughly repudiated.The anecdotal evidence is somewhat better -- but contains very obvious editorial bias. The author has blatantly cherry-picked information to fit his conclusion, and presented it in such a slanted, propagandist fashion that it's almost impossible to take seriously.For those who feel that the circumcision debate could use a well-reasoned 'in favor' argument, look elsewhere. I was very disappointed in that this book is so easily debunked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarmist Drivel","review":"This book is unmitigated rubbish. Poorly written by a moron.

I was hoping to be encouraged by what I read, but none of it rang true for me. I am a middle-aged Amercian, and have watched my penile sensitivity decrease over the last 10 years. Thankfully (to other books, not this one), I now know the cause, and through restoration efforts in just 5 months, I've already regained some sensitivity (Believe me, you know when you feel more.). Based on my experience, I cannot in any way, shape, or form, recommend circumcision to anyone. No amount of case studies or facts in any book can persuade or distract me from seeing the wisdom in nature's protective foreskin. I think it's ok to read this book. But it won't help circumcised men recover any of their lost sensitivity. And this is the real issue and the sad truth about circumcision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal attacks off-putting","review":"The author needs to be commended on finding the 160 or so medical references to support his position. In the process he needed to overlook or dismiss 10 or more medical articles that did not agree with his bias for each article he found that he agreed with. Like Fox New, any claim to being unbiased should be viewed with healthy skepticism. While the author should be allowed to advocate his bias, he should stick with the facts rather than resort to ad hominem attacks. Doing so makes him look desperate and unprofessional."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next best thing to being there","review":"The Dead will always be known as the quintesential touring band of all time. No studio album could possibly convey the magic that arose from their live performances. Sure, some shows were better than others, but above it all there was always a feeling of goodwill, a feeling of \\"being part of\\" something wonderous, and the feeling that anything was possible at least for the moment.That said, \\"Workingman's Dead,\\" along with a handful of other Dead studio albums,\\"American Beauty\\" being one, showcases the band's deeply rooted blues/folk/pop tradition that typified the band's best work.

As other reviewers mentioned, the IDEA behind the CD is good. But the MUSIC is very different indeed.Christine Giuliano's voice lacks depth and is, at best, mediocre. And such a lackluster voice does not justify the purchase of the CD- plain and simple. With the same [money] that this unimpressive CD commands, you can buy a CD from a woman with an astounding voice, such as Susan Greenbaum or Christina Aquilera.[...] And again, the idea behind this CD was good, but the performer's voice just isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christine Giuliano's newest album of Lullabies","review":"I absolutely love this album.

If you are a new found fan of Audrey Hepburn, this may not be the best book for you to start with, she was a very wonderful - but lonely lady. It is a sad story, a complete chronicle of her very private life including her work with UNICEF. A life very much meant to be cherished and remembered.

The down side of this CD is that \\"Hangin' Tough\\" hit #1 and is here along with the over played and on everything #1 hit \\"When I see you smile\\" and that you get a bit short-changed with only 12 songs altogether and liner notes are OK (they contain some trivia and news from that important year).

Great romantic story...I think this might have even been filmed before Susan Sarandon made it big. And a fabulous performance by Christopher Walken.

More mystery, more adventure and another alien.When Duncan starts the new school year at a new school, his bad reputation gets the better of him with the school authorities. When Duncan is made to participate in a science experiment, he unexpectedly becomes smarter. He also comes to realize that there is another alien around...but who is it?

There is an exposed flange where the armature shaft exits the tapered bell housing near the collet that is the full diameter of the bell housing. It spins with the shaft. The bell housing is too short for an average male hand to hold the tool without contacting this spinning flange. When I hold the tool, the flange rubs against my hand and burns it from friction. It is very painful. I want to throw this tool out the door every time this happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be better...","review":"One of the best management helps I've ever read.

I always hung out in the lot instead of going in. Maybe that makes me sound worse than a deadhead. Oh well. I have a slight disdain for the laissez-faire attitude of hippidom, but I gotta say, this band can play. This one is not so much for kicking back in the dorm room as it is for driving down the highway with the top down blasting it. The St. Stephen->Eleven is amazing. Jerry is simply wicked. Pigpen grandstands beautifully on Lovelight, and the closing Goodnight is breathtaking. This album makes me wish I'd seen the Dead when I had the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous late 60's rock at it's very best!","review":"What more can I say than this is the record I never grow tired of! For the past 21+ years this record have been my all-time favourite record! I have listened to it about 250-300 times by now and it still feels so fresh. Amazing! This is the record to get if you're looking for good late 60's improvised rock. The music might not grab you by your throat right away, this is the kind of music you have to listen to with open ears and an open mind and let the music play you! There's so much to say about this record - a 1.000 words is not enough! Get it and get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Dead","review":"This is arguably one of the Dead's greatest albums. If you're a beginning dead head, or have been one for a while now, there is no way you can live without this album. The 30 minute \\"Dark Star\\" is spectacular.

From the mindbending Dark Star to the superlative St. Stephen>Eleven, what more could you have asked for? But, then begin the first notes of Lovelight, and I can envision Pigpen strolling out from stage left (where he stood in those days), grabbing the microphone and belting out THE SONG (Lovelight) on this album. If you want to hear someone give his heart and soul to the music, just listen to this song. No wonder he and Janis were soul mates. Indeed, even Jerry loosens up and lets us hear it from his soul on Death Don't ... Amazingly enough, this compilation of songs spanned performances from 1/26/69 to 3/2/69. It goes to show you how incredible this band was playing during this period. GET THIS ALBUM, then get the bootlegs from this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"DaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarkStar Crashes","review":"Therre's a reason my roomie Jimmy spent an entire day listening to Garcia's solo from Dark Star 27 times over trying to learn the part...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not deserving of 5 stars...","review":"In my opinion, this cd...well, read on. I am a fairly big Dead Head, but i did not really like this album. The dead were supposed to be great in concert, but this album still does not catch the same feeling as seeing a band in concert, just as most albums don't. Very select albums do, some are Allman Brothers, Clapton, and Frampton Comes Alive. This does not hold a candle to these albums. In a book i recently read, it votes this album as one of the worst albums ever made. I don't know if it is the worst, but it is not one of the best \\"jamming\\" albums.

Some of them are extremely long, i.e., Dark Star on this album is over 23 minutes long but still it is an amazing experience since this showcases the bands amazing ability to improvise. The booklet contains many fine photographs and we also get well-written linernotes by Lenny Kaye. In addition to this we get a list of whom plays what. The critics all liked this live recording (Allmusic, Christgau, and Rolling Stone). 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever!","review":"This is an album that you can just keep listening to over and over and never get tired of.

THE qunitessential acid-rock voyage. A band of hippies attempting to transcend reality. From the first few notes off Phil's bass to the monumental peak before the second verse (over twenty mintues later) this version of Dark Star is unmatched. Every member at their best, entwined in ecstasy. NAILING every twist and peak. Jerry Garcia loved this version. So far beyond the countless other versions I've heard. You'd swear there was a higher power at work on that stage.You don't have to be on drugs to enjoy this disc. Just into improvisation. Followed by Saint Stephen and a rollicking, super-charged The Eleven, the Dead never sounded tighter, more direct. Plugged into your synapses. Toying with you. Ear candy.Obviously beloved by Deadheads. I recommend this for any fan of live music. It simply cannot be done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You haven't lived til Live Dead.","review":"If you are looking for a CD with live concert music, this is the CD for you.

It's 20 minutes of bliss and beauty and it will make your head spin and heart churn because Dark Star is stellar. St. Stephen is a great follow-up and ending with We Bid You Goodnight couldn't be more perfect.Whether you're stoned, trashed, or just high on life, this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dead will Live On","review":"This is one of the greatest live albums - dead or otherwise.I think the beauty of their improvisation will always be appreciated and find a home in listener's hearts - and I hope more people come to know this album as one of their greatest works.

This was the first successful attempt to capture the essence of a live show and share it with most of the world who had never seen them on stage--it was the stage that made them legendary not the recording studio. Subsequently this recording helped in the later successes of \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"Workingman's Dead.\\"For me this one is special because it was my first experience, way back when, with \\"Dark Star\\" a classic the withstands the test of time.\\"Turn on Your Love Light\\" is the full length version that was shortened for their first greatest hits album, \\"Skeletons from the Closet.\\" I'm sure this was to make it more attractive for the radio. When one hears the full version one wonders why someone would ever think of cutting it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe I'm Too Young","review":"I've become a great fan of the Dead in the past year, and one of the first albums that deadheads have told me to get is Live/Dead. It is obviously an album of great importance to rock music in general. Jefferson Airplane broke new ground in live albums with \\"Bless Its Pointed Little Head\\" in 1968, which changed live albums from simple rehashings of a band's studio hits to a genuinely creative endeavor, involving improvisation and fresh sounds. The Live/Dead followed soon after, and attempts the same thing. Dark Star is absolutely magnificent, completely breathtaking, spacy psychedelic improv. St. Stephen/The Eleven is really good, but forgive me when i say that Lovelight is really BORING. Sorry, but it's true. The same can be said of Death Don't Have no Mercy. Feedback is cool if you are chemically altered, but it's not something to dance to. We bid you goodnight is cute. All in all, overrated but worth the price for dark star and st. stephen/the eleven."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, the CD is out-of-date","review":"Awesome book, I liked Chapter 3 which instantly gets you into useful programming stuff. The book also takes you from beginner-level to advanced stuff like extending and embedding python, sort of the python equivalent of the Perl camel book (programming perl) and panther book (advanced perl programming) rolled into one. I think there's enough stuff on net programming to justify the title. The CD-ROM in my copy of the book has python 1.3, the current version is 1.5 something. The book too might be dated, but I skimmed the latest ORA python book, Learning Python, and I think this is more my speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too shallow","review":"I was very disappointed when the roaster buffet trays arrived.

The story is riveting as Ben attempts to adjust to a new school and cope with his father's disapproval. Bull is a character you won't forget. He is overly hard on his son, often calling him names and mentally abusing him. Ben's dad wants one thing for his son- to become a marine fighter pilot. He shows his affection for his son in enough suttle ways, that despite his many obvious short-comings, it is difficult to hate Bull. Ben is conflicted between following the wishes of his dad, or following his own heart. Much of the story is autobiographical based on Conroy's experience of growing up with a strict military father. I greatly enjoy all of Conroy's books, and this earlier work is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disjointed","review":"I read this book at the suggestion of several friends, who thought it was Conroy's best. I'd just finished \\"Beach Music,\\" which I feel is much more developed and well-rounded. This book, with many similarities to \\"Beach Music\\" (both in characters and in setting), seems to be more of a rough draft of the book that Conroy later wrote.There were many scenes that were Big Scenes -- deaths, rape, violence -- and then the chapter would end and it was on to the next adventure, with little or nothing said later to tie the loose threads together.Perhaps it does take a military background to truly appreciate the book, and while the language is (as in all of Conroy's books) beautifully written, the overall story didn't hook me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I have read all of Pat Conroy's books, and this one rates up there as one of my favorites of all his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repititous!","review":"This book became too \\"ho-hum\\".

The constant sibling rivalry was humorous until around page 75, then it became too much to bear. You won't miss anything by skipping the back and forth teen dialogue. Can't imagine that the conversations as written hadn't already occurred several times in their past. Thought the old saying, \\"and so's your old man\\" would have been better. Same for Santini and the constant barrage of over the top manliness. Sophomoric at best. See the movie and forget the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything by Pat Conroy is great.","review":"When reading Pat Conroy's books, I feel I'm right in the room with him telling me the story.

This was a great addition to any collection of cds. The only place where the cd slowed down was the song Try, Try, Try. The rest of this cd was worth it. All 73 minutes of it, I don't think it was too long, I think it wasnt long enough. I stand by the Smashing Pumpkins, and I have for a long time the only time they disappointed me was with Adore, but that was only because of the absecence of Jimmy Chamberlin. It is not like they are perfect though (no pun intended). Adore was just a slip-up in an amazing career, that is continuing for a long time hopefully. You should definitely buy this cd. If you buy it because of The Everlasting Gaze you will be overwhelmed with the sounds of Raindrops + Sunshowers, Stand Inside Your Love, I of the Mourning, Heavy Metal Machine, and probably the whole cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy...","review":"What I actually have to say is very little. For thoose of you who found that Adore CD entertaining, start your engines. It's back, with a new upgrade. Here's the recipe: one(1)sick drummer named Jimmy Chamberlin. one(1) almost back to normal pumpkins album. there it is, Machina. I like the album, but not like I enjoy pisces iscariot and previous albums. this album is for the true pumpkin fan out there thatis willing to listen to those really long songs so that you get the whole mesage(yes, I am talking about glass). power to them, but lets hope for more \\"stand inside...\\" on the follow up to this one. that song has some sick beats and the workings that grew on us from MCIS. \\"What I choose is my choice\\"-Billy Corgan"},{"rating":"1","title":"i am the iscariot","review":"i refuse to believe this is a pumpkins album. adore was considered a \\"failure\\" but to me, it was very lyrically and instrumentally beautiful. i don't listen to it much, cause it depresses the hell out of me, but i think it's a damn good album. i was looking forward to machina, but i still can't believe what a disappointment it is. though billy remains one of my favorite songwriters, the songs did not match the music. i rather just read the words and put on some headphones and listen to some gish. and i've been hearing this album being compared to a mix of gish and siamese dream. that's an insult to the genuistic past that the pumpkins had. and christ, get d'arcy out of rehab and bring her back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I have been a Pumpkins fan ever since I first heard \\"Today.\\" Although not as hardcore as Mellon Collie> (i.e. X.Y.U. and Tales of a corched Earth), this CD was suprisingly addictive. Although I didn't like Adore> at first, I gradually fell in love with it, in particular to \\"Tear,\\" \\"Pug,\\" among others. However, it was incomparable to Mellon Collie and its infinite sounds. Adore was too repetitive. Although Machina does tend to be repetitive, it is purely Pumpkins. \\"Heavy Metal Machine,\\" \\"Everlasting Gaze,\\" \\"Imploding Voice,\\" very good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great release by a monumental band!","review":"I have been a huge fan of the Smashing Pumpkins from the release of Siamese Dream.

This to a part is true, the album does indeed rock far more than it predecessor, but that does not nessasarly make it a good album, for good album we need good songs, Machina does have good songs but way to few of them. The major problem is that just to many of the songs sound the same and tend to drift by without making an impression, i've owned the CD for a few weeks now, but still can't place all the titles to the songs. So on a whole I found this quite a disapointing album, with few highlights......Must do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good background noise, not good listening","review":"I'd like to qualify this by saying that I'm a huge Pumpkins fan. I particularly like Siamese Dream and Melon Collie. But with Adore, they started to sound a little stale, and I think Billy set out to prove all critics wrong at that point. Machina makes use of the talented new drummer and brings a much harder edge that adore was lacking. But what they haven't managed to right is the feeling that they don't have anything more to say with their music. The lyrics here just aren't the beautiful lyrics I remember - and miss - from the earlier albums. I play this in the background while I do other things, not to listen to directly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pumpkins have changed. But is it for the better?","review":"I'm one of those Pumpkins fans that fell in love with Gish and Siamese Dream. Even though I'm glad Chamberlain is back as the drummer (his presence was dearly missed), the Pumpkins lack the melodies and musical talent that they have shown in the past. Seems to me that in the early days, it was only about the music. Now the band is a commercial figure with a bald headed lead singer that is promoting more of an image than music itself. In the old Pumpkins music, Billy Corgan only sang when he had to which let the music shine through. And when he did sing, he wasn't screaming his lungs out like he does these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something has to change","review":"Taken from The Chicago Sun Times:Although they have released perhaps the strongest album of their career, the Smashing Pumpkins have watched \\"Machina/The Machines of God\\" slide steadily down Billboard magazine's pop albums chart. After five weeks in the stores, it fell from a debut peak at No. 3 to No. 54, with total sales of 340,000 copies so far.The \\"Machina\\" figures seem like concrete proof that a new wave of young pop fans has turned a deaf ear toward alternative rock.I couldn't agree more............"},{"rating":"1","title":"theyve come undone","review":"Oh, the boys on the radio They crash and burn They fold and fade So slowThose lyrics remind me of Billy/Smashing Pumpkins. Pumpkins have been on a downward spiral since they released Adore and this is ten times worse. I like Stand Inside Your Love but it sounds like the Pumpkins are just making music they think will sell well (even if it didnt). It's really sad that Pumpkins think they can be this egocrazy. Only Trent is allowed to do that. Don't you know anything? Cds to buy instead of this: The Fragile - NIN (if you're looking for GOOD thrashing guitars and industrial sounding greatness) Celebrity Skin - Hole (if you're looking for the beautious poppiness of Stand Inside Your Love that the pumpkins dont do well) Pixies - Surfer Rosa (if youre looking for a band that can do it all) Stone Temple Pilots - Tiny Music (if youre looking for this album done well)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best","review":"this cd is definitly not the smashing pumpkins best work. the songsare so slow to develop in to anything and when they begin to have agood moment something else gets introduced that just ruins it. i liked siamese dream alot, along with Mellon Collie, one of the best cd's i own, but WHY does everyone bash on adore all the time? it's their most MUSICAL cd, it has so many good things about it, you just have to sit down and give it a good listen a few times, cause it doesn't just do the pop radio formula to a hit song that everyones used to; with a little riff and a verse, a bridge, verse, chorus,verse, chorus,end. the try to do the music art thing a little bit, but i will admit the cover book is really, really stupid.

This cd is long and boring. It is sad that not one song on this disc is memorable and is torture just to get thru one. Fond memories of Siamese and Gish I will cherish for years when they were such a powerhouse back in the old days. The sound on this disc is terrible and the songs are too long and pointless.

This may be the case here. It seems that the Pumpkins are torn between art and commerce. On the one hand, they need a single or two to promote and sell the record, on the other, they would like nothing better than to destroy the very concept of a hit song entirely and lead us into a new era of sonic possibilities, it seems. This album is just that, an unsure step into the future, and, like Adore and Meloncholy, will grow on us in time, I'm sure. That's why they are one of my favorite bands, they are leading us deeper into our soul, this experience of living, and into the unknown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan-freakin-tastic !","review":"They finally did it! Another Smashing Pumkins album to rival their masterpiece Siamese Dream. I am so glad that all the original pumpkins were reunited for the making of this album - it shows through the amazing music. (**sobs** too bad they broke up again *sniff*) I had heard The Everlasting Gaze on mp3 format and seen the video before I bought the CD so that song was no surprise (it is still a really good song though), but as soon as Raindrops + Sunshowers started playing I was stunned - this is an INCREDIBLE CD! There is not one bad song on it. But this is certainly not a repeat of Siamese Dream, or anything else that they have done; as with everyother one of their albums they have gone in a whole new direction, with great results. All I can say is get this CD NOW! It is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a follow up to anything","review":"Those expecting the next \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie\\" will be extemely dissapointed. After, reading many of the reviews about expecting it to sound like Siamese Dream etc., forget it. Billy has stated many times that the band will not repeat itself.Those of you looking for great music with deep lyrics, look no further. This album is totally different than any other Pumpkin release. The mix of electronica and guitars works really well.

Why don't I own this album?\\" I went over to my CD collection and behold, I do own it. So I listened to it again once and it's back on the shelf. The first 3 or 4 songs are pretty good, but the rest of the tracks are uninspired. Billy Corgan can whine or scream. I like the screaming best. But he whines through most of this album and the music either whines along with him or drowns him out. If you're thinking about this, get the greatest hits instead. I think it has a few of the good songs from this one and all the [bad] music is confined to the second disc so you can just throw it away and never have to listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"time for a career change","review":"The Pumpkins are well past their use-by date. Their songs are so meaningless and repetitive that the album is not even worth reviewing. Please don't waste your time or money on this NOISE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After this I'm glad they called it quits","review":"Pretty much garbage. Touted as their \\"return to rock\\" but it's more like their \\"return to sinking deeper into the mire of our overwrought angst.\\" Kind of surprising after \\"Adore,\\" which was really kind of an upswing for them (them being Corgan, D'Arcy and Iha then). The funny thing is, the music generally shows promise, as with the first few bars you're tapping your foot along with the melody, then BAM in comes the cracking whine of Corgan, much more whiney than ever (and I thought it wasn't even possible!). You then realize the music is generic and uninspired, at best. Oh well. At least all of the other Pumpkins releases are worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worts up?","review":"I thought Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music\\" was the worst album ever made, but this one takes the biscuit. Billy Pumpkin once again squirts out some more pretentious, pompous rot for the masses who forgot (or never knew?) what good music is. Thusly, this is not (good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pumpkins Last Hope","review":"This album is very good but the only problem with the album is that it felt like the Pumpkins didn't care about this album as much as there other album. For example it doesn't fell like Billy wrote the album with his heart, more like with his fans hearts. But beside for that little problem it is still a great Underated album that any rock fan well like. So do yourself a favor and pick up this album and dont listen to jackass that tell you that tell you the Pumpkins are dead because they are still around in all there fans hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Pumpkins Album","review":"Machina is a really good album. I think that it ranks up there with Mellon Collie and Siemese Dream. I think that it would have been a little bit better if it wasn't so long. The songs are really good and sound great, but some seem to drag on for a while. My favorites on this new installment of Pumpkins music are: \\"Wound\\", \\"The Everlasting Gaze\\" , \\"Stand Inside Your Love\\", and \\"Try,Try Try\\". These songs alone are worth the money for the album. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Most of the songs on here are good songs. Stand Inside Your Love is a great song. Heavy Metal Machine is appealing to me although it almost sounds like it was invented by Marilyn Manson. However, the whole album gets a bit sluggish due to its length. I say - Its better to have an album with 73 minutes worth than one with 30. Better than Adore - not close to Siamese Dreams or MCIS...has the feel of an album made after MCIS but before Adore. Many songs have the soft touch of some found on MCIS. Overall, a decent album...I would give it 3.5 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Personal Opinion","review":"Although I'm an extreme Pumpkin's fan.. I don't think that I care very much for their new sound. I'm a fan of their old work such as Gish, Siamese Dream (one of the BEST albums), LOVED Pisces Iscariot.. Meloncholy & Infinite Sadness was beautiful, but after that I feel that they went to a whole different level when they really should've stayed where they were at musically and not have tried to follow the continuous changes that the \\"mainstream\\" was going through. Their new stuff doesn't sound a bit like their past unique sound, which had made them (in my personal opinion) one of the best bands out there. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"goofball","review":"the pumps first CD was dope. now they are even cornier than that goth sketch on sat night live. this is a bad cd. a bad rock cd. a bad pop cd. a bad smashing pumpkins cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admit it, this CD sucks","review":"I don't understand how anyone who loved \\"Gish\\", \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie\\" can possibly like this album.There is precisely one good song on the album: \\"Heavy Metal Machine\\". There are two moderately okay songs: the first and second tracks, \\"The Everlasting Gaze\\", which is all but ruined near the end by an annoying 10-second rant that is annoying even for Corgan; and \\"Raindrops and Sunshowers\\", of which it can just be said that it is unoffensively pleasant.Virtually ever other track on this album bored me to tears. Jimmy Chamberlain is completely wasted on uninspired beats that sound like they belong in forgotten MTV videos from the 1980s. There are no guitar riffs to send the blood racing and none of the inventiveness and energy that marked the early Pumpkins.There is nothing here that would even break a Top 20 list of great Pumpkins songs. They were right to quit after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM BLOWS","review":"I like the Smashing Pumpkins. I saw them live in 1996. Some of you revewiers were probably 5 at the time. Anyway they clearly went down hill. They should have stopped after Adore which was good. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is clearly their musical peak. What happened to this band. They became too dark. I actually like Zwan better then this last Pumpkins album. Most of the album is too weird. Compare it to their last two albums and you know I am right. They went down hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 good song","review":"Everyone told me to buy this cd. So I went out and bought it. I liked one song only. \\"Stand inside your love\\" My money was waisted. I WAS MAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reeks of desperation","review":"Oh Billy, Billy. What are you doing? Are you that desperate to regain the spark you had? \\"Machina\\" is pretentious over-achievement-not a good thing. Why is it this is the only Pumpkins album I found absolutely nothing to grasp onto? When \\"Adore\\" came out you were so hyped about it and it's new direction, as was I. I liked that album a lot. Now all I hear from you is how much of a misstep that one was and how this is a return to form. I don't think so. Absolutely no chances were taken on this one. All I hear are a bunch of fuzz guitars and pretentious lyrics hiding non-existant songs. Besides that many of the slower-tempo songs sound straight out of 1985, but I digress. Come on Billy. Remember that little contest you had in your head with Trent Reznor? Well, with the \\"Fragile\\" out the score at this point is Trent-4, Billy-4 with the clock of relevance ticking rather quickly. Irrevelance-fear it Billy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated like the rest of their stuff","review":"Sometimes I think the Pumpkins developed their fan base, just because they're so awful. (Believe me, if you've ever seen one of their concerts, their utter lack of talent shows in every regard.) Kids go for it, simply because their parents hate it. This album continues that trend with (what's supposedly the best songs) the dreadful \\"Everlasting Gaze\\" and the equally lifeless \\"Stand Inside Your Love.\\" They have the best production money can buy, some occasionally interesting guitar riffs, and Billy Corgan's usual none-too-pleasant-for-the-ears vocals. Stay away bigtime from this album and, if you insist, opt for the Gish or Siamese Dream. Better yet, get real rock n roll like Zeppelin, Van Halen, or Montrose."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could anyone like this","review":"I though when there last album came out that they could never make anything that bad again Gee Whiz was wrong.machina is clearly the favorite for many as the years worst album unless nsync makes 2 or 3 albums even then Pumpkins still might have the worst album.Dont we all wish for the glory days od Siamese dreams"},{"rating":"1","title":"Former Pumpkins Fan","review":"This album is a major disapointment! Nothing but a bunch of never ending songs with none of the grinding hooks that the Pumpkins usually have. Billy Corgan's ego needs a reality check.

This album has seriously been out for 12 years??? Regardless, I've enjoyed this album greatly - tracks like \\"Stand Inside Your Love\\" and \\"Try\\" are imo - classics. Don't get swayed by the negative reviews, this is a legit album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly, the last record from one of the best bands ever","review":"It's really too bad that they decided to break up after putting out such great music. This album takes the progression of the Pumpkins' music one step further, bringing the great sound from 'Adore' and adding the rock element that made their early music so amazing. It's a bit faster-paced than 'Adore' while it still maintains meaningful lyrics and fresh tones. The band has come so far since 'Gish,' and the fact that they have kept their music alive and new for so long is nothing short of amazing. It is truly unfortunate that Billy Corgan didn't feel that the band's internal problems couldn't be overcome to continue making such great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Smashing Pumpkins Best Work! My Favorite Album Ever!!!","review":"The Smashing Pumpkins are my favorite band in the world. This CD made me love them even more. If you give it a chance, you will realize that it is the best CD that they ever did. It is my personal favorite album ever. It has EVERYTHING. The lyrics and music are so beautiful. I promise you, if you get this CD and give it a chance, you will realize that it is one of the best CDs out there. PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy this CD for yourself. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! Trust me. It is pure excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish they'd have gone back to their roots . ..","review":"I will admit to being an ardent SP lover. I have been since Siamese Dream, Pisces Iscariot, et. al. I thought this album would build on where they went with Adore, which I liked very much. Unfortunately, this was not to be. This album is a plateau, with many of the tunes largely forgettable. \\"Stand Inside Your Love\\", \\"Raindrops + Sunshowers\\" would be the standouts, and \\"Age of Innocence\\" a one-off worth listening to. The rest of the album could have been left on the floor, so to speak. I hope they plan on coming together again sometime in the future to rectify this. A throwback to the Gish/Siamese Dream/Pisces era would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review=not gods word.","review":"this is going to be short and sweet, basically is a very good album, the re are some great melodies and rythms, and the diversity is phenomenal at times, i agree that maybe 'with every light' and 'the crying tree of mercury' could have been dropped, at any rate they could have made excellent b-sides. the only thing which perhaps spoils machina for me is the inclusion of these two songs which do make the album overlong and clumsy. but forgetting two songs out of 15, the rest of the songs are beautiful, melancholic, euphoric and mesmerising, personally i love adore just as much as the other albums, so i don't see it as a change for the better/worse, it is another part of the smashing pumpkins 'legacy'."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENCHANTING CD!","review":"I am now a new big fan of the smashing pumpkins ever since I bought this CD. I have liked the Pumpkins other songs but I don't have any of their other albums, but that is going to change! This cd has great lyrics, yes, some songs are poppy, but still VERY VERY good. I love title of the songs and Billy's voice.I don't know why some people didn't like this cd, but I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up from Dublin!","review":"This an excellent cd. While the Pumpkins may never recreate the sublime sounds of 'Disarm' and '1979' again, songs such as 'Wound', and 'I of the Mourning' are among the best they have ever released. The only thing missing from this album is D'arcy's excellence on the bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take some time with the CD","review":"When I first played the CD, I was dissapointed. I only enjoyed listening to about 3-5 songs. However, as I spent some time with the CD, and became familiar with the layout of the tracks, I quickly liked more of them. It seems like many of the SP songs are like this. Much of the music is ladden with emotion- as they are trying to communicate something with the songs. As you learn how each song will play itself out- you will be sure to find yourself emotionally collaborating with the band- with every scream, smash of the drum, and slash of the guitar (rather than fighting them with it). Favorite tracks: 2,3,4,5,6,8,11,13,15. If you don't like powerful, sometimes disturbing, artful music- you may not relate to this CD. If you are willing to take some chances with SP, and love intensity, this CD will eventually become that one you listen to when you want to wind down after work, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adore is much much better","review":"This thing has some unabashedly radio-friendly BS and then a couple of mediocre axe grinders, all in all a very tepid last poof from what was once an exciting band.

And they [were bad] in concert playing these songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"the pumpkins have lost it","review":"disapointing, jus disapointing, I've listened to this album almost every day for two months and it isn't working, sp are in a music free fall, corgan can't write a good riff anymore, or even write a song that you can listen all the way through without wanting to shoot yourself, I'm talking musically here, he still writes some good lyrics here or there, but I can't stand his big ego, he should listen to pearl jam or the pixies a little more so he can remember how to make a great song, so good bye to sp, once a great band now a pretensious and commercial product. that's what you get billy for trying to copy cobain in everything: total musical block"},{"rating":"1","title":"A drama whose plot is lost...","review":"In which our tortured hero retreats from the front lines and takes refuge, battered and withdrawn, in past glories. Pity he listened to departing fans and zealous critics after Adore, a glorious battle whose victory was one of integrity rather than bounty. Surely he can't miss the irony in his own words - \\"what is it you want to say?\\" This time, sadly, he says nothing. Methinks he punishes us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of 2000?","review":"Unintelligent, contrived, commercial-dollar-begging,pretentious, overproduced, underwritten, egotistical, desperate: all words to describe this reprehensible recording. Billy Pumpkin's worst and thankfully last album that Billy paints himself to be some kind of rock and roll martyr: HE WAS RIGHT. He deserves a good martyring after this. I didnt want to give in to my dislike for this album so I waited to write my review for a motnh after so I could give it a chance. It obviously didn't work... The one half-way salvageable song: Stand Inside Your Love. This is a single with a collection of throwaway b-sides. Billy will not be missed even though he's gonna return with his new travesty, The Marked. He's so deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE the PumPkiNs that are in the process of SmaSHinG . . .","review":". . . but, back when this came out, I could only bear a few listens to MACHINA before I knew I'd never go back to it. Don't be fooled by the cool title. There's a reason why this is their last official release: the magic is M.I.A. This is the last album a new collector should get by the Pooompkeens (as the Brits say), and really, only if you're a die-hard fan.

Age of Innocence, for example, is one of my top-ten favorite Pumpkins songs, period. I also really like I of the Mourning, Stand Inside Your Love, Sacred and Profane, Blue Skies Bring Tears, and Glass and the Ghost Children. I must say, though, I am shocked that people like the Crying Tree of Mercury. I think it is, without a doubt, the worst Smashing Pumpkins song ever, and furthermore has the distinction of being the only Smashing Pumpkins song I truly hate (and I am a pretty passionate Pumpkins fan). Furthermore, before reading the reviews on Amazon.com, I had never met a single other person who disagreed on this matter. Just goes to show ya, different strokes, I guess. But, man, I can't even bear listening to Crying Tree..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This CD has to be one of the best CD's ever made. I admit that I am a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan but that's not why I like this CD. To me Billy Corgan is able to place his feelings onto the tracks which makes this is by far the most emotional CD the Pumpkins have ever done, even more the Adore. Its the romantic side of Billy in the sense of loss and longing. Many people don't like this CD as much as older Pumpkins work, because it is different. The song aren't earth moving rock songs with powerful rifts. These songs are soul crashing rock songs. I highly recommend this CD for everyone who is open minded. This is the perfect ending CD for the Pumpkins that leaves the listener satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing Pumpkins - Machina","review":"I love this album. One of the Pumpkins best as well as one of the best CDs of 2000. I am always listening to this CD in my car every place I go.

Some songs (\\"The Everlasting Gaze\\", \\"Stand Inside Your Love\\", and \\"Try, Try, Try\\") have a radio-play appeal, while most of the album is very complex and rather strange, to say the least. But beneath all the obscurity, the Pumpkins' artsy, unorthodox approach to rock is still there, and though Machina begins to lag towards the end, it is still a memorable album. It is not a masterpiece a la Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, but it is an appropriate end to the Pumpkins' grand, bizarre journey through alternative rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is everything I have been looking for","review":"For a long time I have searched for a CD as beautiful as this.

They're deadborn babies, even the 'rocking' tracks like Everlasting Gaze. The track doesn't rock; it rocks in a shallow way. There's not a drop of passion behind it.Tired, uninspired. It's really shocking to hear Machina. Heavy Metal Machine is the worst; is this a parody? Just as worse as Crying Tree Of Mercury; a song so revolting and bombastic I'm ashamed to listen to it. The only really good song is Stand Inside Your Love, but you can buy the single too.I was extremely looking forward to Machina, especially because The first albums were so incredible and then suddenly Adore was such a letdown. I read Machina was The Pumpkins back to form. If this is back to form, than I am Queen Elizabeth. It's a good thing they quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Well I am have to disagree with most of the reviews. This album is not a great one. Let me start by saying that I am a huge pumpkins fan, I have all their stuff and love most of it. I even love Adore. Machina doesn't come close to any of their old greatness. The songs have forgettable melodies and not too much new in terms of sound or composition. I was very disappointed. While I listened to the album only 2 or 3 songs stood out as good and that is not enough to carry an album this long.

Then they took a hard left into the toilet and began sounding less like a guitar rock band and more like an unbearably overwrought Nine Inch Nails clone. What the hell happened there? And why wasn't I consulted first? This record is so washed out in loud, distorted, layered, textureless noise that it's hard to listen to in one uninterrupted sitting. Songs like that have always been present on Pumpkins albums to varying degrees of success (\\"Bodies\\" was a good one from Mellon Collie), but where's the \\"Rocket\\", the \\"Muzzle\\" or the \\"Cherub Rock\\" to balance the equation?And what the hell is with that egregiously bombastic album title? Are we supposed to take that seriously? It sounds like a B sci-fi movie from Mystery Science Theater 3000."},{"rating":"1","title":"third rate self-indulgence","review":"this is by far the worst pumpkins album ever. yes, it is a lot like adore, but adore sounded good live. here the the instruments give way completely to billy corgan's nasal (but lovable) voice. why is this a mistake? it isn't necessarily. but he is no james labrie; he lacks enough control of his voice to carry any song properly and/or at least interestingly. this album, instead of being far from modern pop, is closer than he has ever come. being simple is fine and good, being simplistic is not, which is what we have here. if you're looking for the pumpkins at their (his) best, check out gish and maybe pisces. this is a step further in the direction of adore which is another step backwards for the band. this album will make peace with u2 fans and disappoint anyone looking for the musical proficiency and talent that once separated the pumpkins from the rest of pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to respect the SP, forget this album.","review":"Their first albums were powerful and they will be legendary. Adore was awesome, deep, dark, and it kind of announced the death of the band. \\"Machina\\" is some kind of over-produced, well-tamed, meaning-less effort to remind people they were a rock band, with a concept that interests nobody. Even the cover of the album looks stupid. And what's that song \\"Heavy-metal machine\\"? Billy once said it was a condemnation and a glorification of the genre. Come on, that's non-interesting and pathetic. They should have ended the Smashing Pumpkins after \\"Adore\\". Now, they just look like \\"Aerosmith\\", after Permanent vacation.

It is very melodic and dreamy. I love the lyrics, Billy Corgan is such an amazing songwriter who has inspired me many times. Songs that really get me, are Raindrops and Sunshowers, I of the Morning, Try Try Try and Wound. The songs on this album make you feel---, well it's hard to explain, but they are like other pumpkins songs that leave you with that funny feeling - a good feeling. Someone told me that their music gives you a high like no drugs can give, and I do agree with this. Machina is an awesome, touching album and recommend it to people who appreciate very good music. Thanks Billy and co - for the music. Peace and Love"},{"rating":"2","title":"Falls a bit short.","review":"I listened to this album and I started wondering where all those bad reviews for it came up. While the album is not perfect, it is still worthy of the Smashing Pumpkins name. It has a big epic feel in it, and only during \\"Glass And The Ghost Children\\" does it drag. If you a fan of the Pumpkins, then you should definitely check out this album. P.S. I still don't see why people thought \\"Adore\\" was such a travesty. It was a very gorgeous record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as usual","review":"Corgans done it again. From what I've listened to on this cd, it has a great number of good songs, a few of them are Everlasting Gaze which sounds a little too much like Zero of MCIS, Stand Inside Your Love, I of the Mourning, The Sacred and the Profane, Heavy Metal Machine which everybody including me says: has strong Black Sabbath traits in them, This Time, The Imploding Voice, Glass and the Ghost Children this has alot of Guitar Feedback in that sounds pretty cool and lastly Wound. This cd sounds a little bit off beat from traditional Pumpkins and sounds slightly like Adore but without any Keyboards. The best thing about this cd Loud Guitars and lots of fuzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Machina is Meana!!","review":"a brilliant album, still fresh after a year of release.Check out Machina 2 as well - download it from smashingpumpkins.com.both classic releases"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THEIR BESTS","review":"This album is truly a masterpiece. Every song could be released as a single! They have their hard rockers such as \\"Heavy metal machine\\" and \\"The Everlasting Gaze\\". They have their semi heavy songs \\"Stand Inside your love\\", \\"Imploding Voice\\" and \\"I of the Mourning. \\"I of the Mourning\\" builds up to a final climax which has to be heard to believe. They have their 1979 type pop songs such as, \\"Try Try Try\\", \\"Raindrops and Sunshowers\\", and \\"Wound\\". Beautiful ballads such as \\"With Every Light\\" and \\"Age Of Innocence\\". The production that went into this cd is unbelievable. Rich and textured music with so many tiny sound effects that even after 100 hundred listens you still hear something new! This will probably stand as one of the best cds of 2000. With catchy melodies and rich textures one cannot go wrong. If I get into every song detail, I'll be here foerever. Bottom line is pick a copy up as soon as possible. I promise you won't be disapointed! Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A damned good album","review":"Corgan and Co., may be victims of their own success. In my opinion, they differ from most of their peers in that they kept getting better with each album. Pavement, whom I absolutely love, reached their peak with the album they released first: Slanted and Enchanted. The sunsequent albums were great, IMO, but they never again achieved a peak. The Pumpkins, however, seemed to just get better and better with each album, until this one. Had Machina been released by any other band, I may be gushing over it right now. It does not continue this legacy, however. Good...but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio-friendly Pumpkins","review":"Previous reviews are accurate...if you like the Smashing Pumpkins you will like this new album...the Smashing Pumpkins consistently put out good albums...every song sounds like they were singles made for radio play. (I can't blame them for having a knack for writing catchy radio-friendly songs or becoming successful enough to do it....but it used to be nice to say \\"Yeah, Smashing Pumpkins, you wouldn't know who they are, the radio doesn't play them...\\" Many of the songs rely on softer subtler melodic sounds than the earlier heavier riff driven sounds. Not to say there aren't heavy songs on the album though. Overall, this was an excellently made album, and even the cover is interesting, filled with artwork, and consistent with the \\"feel\\" of the album's mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great","review":"This CD is probably the best I own. I have all of the smashing pumpkins cds and this is the best. With tracks like Everlasting Gaze, I of Mourning, Stand inside your love, and The Crying Tree of Mercury how can you go wrong. I can honestly say that every song here is great. Cant wait for the next one by the Pumpkins, they continue to impress."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise!","review":"This is an incredible cd! I purchased this cd because of the single\\" Stand inside yourself\\". I thought this would be like all of the other SP CD's. I was wrong! I have had this cd for three days and I can not stop listening to it. It is very melodic and is completely diffrent that any of there other ones. The music is great and the singing is incredible.The only complaint that I have is that it should of been produced diffrent. It is very melodic but, you lose some of that because of the excessive noise in the songs. One of the best Cd's I have heard this year. I would recomend picking it up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't Your Grandfather's Pumpkins...","review":"Those looking for another Siamese Dream, be aware, this disc more resembles Mellon Collie. The musical stylings of the album make for an easy transition from the modern rock charts to the pop. Stand Inside Your Love, the lead single, is a masterful song in the same vein as Tonite, Tonite. The disc has many great songs: Try, Try, Try, This Time, The Everlasting Gaze, and Wound are just a few. The only real problem with this release is Corgan's adament refusal to edit himself. Glass + The Ghost Children, while in my opinion is the best song, is over 10 minutes long. Plus, rumoured future singles The Crying Tree Of Mercury and Heavy Metal Machine are horrible. Despite those two songs, however, the other 13 are great, and bring the band back around to a more popular sound then the overly dark Adore. A must have for anyone interested in alt. rock music today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good To Explain With Words!","review":"This is such a good album! Every song makes me feel the emotions that Billy Corgan feels when he writes songs. The only track on this album that I just LOVE, but not embrace and cherish, is The Crying Tree of Mercury, a great song, it just does not stand out like the other masterpieces. The bests songs are The Everlasting Gaze, The Imploding Voice, Wound, and the first three songs that I forgot the title of. Go get this album now! It, like I read in other reviews, is not unmelodic, or especially not boring, but great, and delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Aeroplane is still flying","review":"Definitely not the logical next step. Yet another curveball thrown by Billy and the Pumpkins. From the Beginning to End (i shall refrain from quoting SP titles here) this CD is excellent. You will not be disappointed. There is something for everyone here. They've got everything here more extreme than ever before. From the kickass riffs of \\"Heavy Metal Machine \\" and \\"The Everlasting Gaze\\" to the dance beats of \\"Raindrops and Sunshowers\\" this album is right on par with the others in terms of pure brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Headbangers","review":"When I heard \\"The Everlasting Gaze\\" on the radio it rocked my world. When I got this cd i was disapointed that it was the only good headbanging song on this cd. There are a few good slower ones but I just wish they made more fast ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"a misunderstood cd, but a great one","review":"this is the Pumpkins last cd, which i feel they couldnt of went out better. this cd is the maturation of cds like Simese Dream and MCATIS with the goth-opera sounds of Adore. their is something for everyone of this cd, with the songs ranging from heavy metal tunes such as The Everlasting Gaze and Heavy Metal Machine, (my screenname is heavymetalmachine19) to soft easy-listening songs like Raindrops and Sunshowers and With Every Light. Stand Inside Your Love is the biggest radio sounding song the Pumpkins ever wrote, even more radio-friendly then Today.My favorite songs on this cd are:1. Raindrops and Sunshowers2. Age of Innocense3. I of the Mourning4. Stand Inside Your Love5. The Sacrade and Profaneone last note, this is worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm","review":"It's just the best rock album made in a along time i think ignore the know it alls it's a great cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs, a lot of boring songs","review":"This album feels a bit like Billy Corgan is running out of melodic ideas. For all that Adore was criticized, Machina has no songs that are as instantly catchy as Perfect or Appels & Oranges. There are a few good songs, like Try Try Try, Raindrops & Sunshowers, and Age of Innocence, but on balance, the album is pretty melodically minimalistic and boring -- in stark contrast to some of the great stuff out there now, like Moby, Beck, or Radiohead. Unfortunately, the album mostly sounds like pale, uninteresting imitations of previous great Pumpkins efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"After Adore the Pumpkins had nowhere to go but up. Luckily they came up with a real good record. Two songs that stick out are Heavy Metal Machine and Everlasting Gaze, they rock. The opening riff from Everlasting Gaze is a great way to start off an album, pure energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Pumpkin Fans","review":"This CD does not have the same feel as did siamese dream or mellencollie, but Pumpkin fans should really like it. Any body new to the Pumpkins should listen to those other 2 CDs. I really loved track 4 though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Smashing Pumpkins are fully polished.","review":"True musicians. They bring me inspiration on life. This album is amazing. Poetic, in fact. Just take a moment to look at the progression they have made. They have learned so much musically. Truly moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"My pick 4 album of the year","review":"People constantly talk about how the Pumpkins will never make a better CD than \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie....\\". They may be right, those were incredible CD's that had an enormise impact on my life. But, this CD is (in my opinion) right up there. Billy Corgan's lyrics are always the best you can't top them but in this CD the lyrics have more hope and cheer than the usual depressing lyrics. It would be wrong to deny that Corgan is an absolute genius. As for the rest of the band, they have developed a lot of chemistry and have learned how to work with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolving the Sound of Music, again.","review":"Welcome back Smashing Pumpkins! Well, that's what the mainstream is saying. Those true fans of this band from Chicago would truly see Adore paid off. I find MACHINA a hybrid of Mellon Collie and Adore. I particularly like Raindrops+Sunshowers, which is a suprise hit to me. Many are expeciting 15 tracks of Bullet with Butterfly Wings, Zero, and Silvercrank. Well, no one can make 15 tracks like that and have a go one tour with that. Alternative music, better yet, Pumpkin music has evolved and to find a mix of electronica sounds and a new guitar sound, BUY this Album. Those who followed the Pumpkins would have predicted this after listening to Adore. Music listeners wanting a heavy, blow out your eardrums with no lyrical meaning, I am sure some really good medicore rock bands have new releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars isn't enough","review":"I've loved every Smashing Pumpkins album, from the raw energy of Gish and Simease Dream to the epic Mellon Collie & Infinite Sadness and even the subdued and cerebral Adore. After listening to Machina for the last 4 hours, I am stunned by the beauty and power of the music. Billy Corgan's songwriting is better than ever, with lyrics that read like poetry contrasted with the aggressive guitars and drumming of Jimmy Chamberlin. Machina is a showcase of the wide range of the Pumpkins... from the power of \\"Everlasting Gaze\\" to the beauty of \\"Age of Innocence\\" to my favorite, \\"This Time\\". The duet with Brittney Spears on \\"Heavy Metal Machine\\" turned out much better than I would have guessed (yes, that's a joke!)The 60's had John Lennon and Paul McCartney, the 70's had Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, the 80's had (um, bad hair?), and Billy Corgan has led those of us that were lucky enough to experience Gish in 1991 all the way through Y2K and hopefully far beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Day","review":"I love the Smashing Pumpkins, I love every album up to and including Adore (which I personally thought was incredible), but I cannot stand Machina. It sounds as if Billy, who I have always touted as a true modern poet, is attempting to copy his own style, randomly mashing together succesful bits of other songs in an attempt to relive past glory. The result is a collection of songs that sounds confused, unsure, and unoriginal. Adore represented a step forward, a breakthrough in Billy's artistry, but this album disappoints by attempting to recreate the angsty, hardcore sound of the earlier albums to achieve greater commercial success. Listen to Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie, or Adore, and be amazed by the beautiful progression of an artist, but skip this album, and wait for the next, which will hopefully place the Pumpkins back on track and back at the top, where they belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"what a (...) cd this is. i was a big fan in the early 90's and what a turn for the worse this band took. adore was a step down from earlier works, but this one is godawful. check out mellon collie or siamese dream or even pisces iscariot if you want to buy pumpkins material. anything but this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Album With All Original Band Members...","review":"I was blown away with this album.I read the reveiw's of others on this album before i bought it i was kind of disapointed that they said it was heavy rock. considering i've liked adore the best because of it's softness i was dissapointed that they might have gone back to hard rock but since i've purchased the album i've been impressed. it's so awsome it's not even that rough it's all nicely put together any pumpkins fan would love it. Also seeing that it's the last album the pumpkins will make with all the original band members (d'arcy has left) it's a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy, what the blazes have you done to the Pumpkins!","review":"The return of the addict drummer helps spring them back from their last tragedy (Adore), but not far enough. I like electronica, but I've never liked what the Pumpkins have done with it. I'd rather Underworld and FatBoy handled the synthesizers. Billy, D'arcy and James belong on guitars. Next time, OK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Pumpkin Never Did Come","review":"I have yet to sit through the entire CD. Billy's voice reminds me too much of Cartman from Southpark. And he looks an awful lot like Pinhead in the Everlasting Gaze video. Some artists improve with age and some worsen. The Pumpkin heads have been rolling downhill for sometime. Do something else with your hard earned money, like invest it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"I have liked the Smashing Pumpkins since they first came out with \\"Gish\\". I was one of the first to wear that ugly purple shirt with that rocket-thingee on it. As a long-time fan of this band I have to say it was a huge disappointment. I thought having Jimmy back on drums would have given this band a kick, brought them back to their roots and out of their electronic-induced haze. If anything his drums were mixed WAY too loud. This album is not what the critics say. I have read reviews that say \\"the Smashing Pumkins are back with their rock sound.\\" This album is way too electronic and way too little rock. It's not even something I can say that I'd have to get used to, I can't. There are maybe three solid songs on this album. If you are a fan of \\"Gish,\\" \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie...\\" you will hate this album. Evolving is one thing but this is another. Don't know if it's a Flood influence or if Billy is bored. Wait to buy it used if you must have it. Not worth the 9.99 we paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"they're back!","review":"The pumpkins return to their style of old, siamese dream, and mcis with this album. You have to listen to each song to really understand the power behind it. My favorite tracks are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,14,15. If you love music, or SP, than this is the album for you, it is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"With everyone saying that Machina marked a return to good ol' rock and roll for the Pumpkins, I couldn't wait to go and get this cd. Unfortunately, I was hugely dissapointed. There are only three or four tracks out of fifteen that truly rock and that's including the two singles. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy slower soothing music but nothing on this album is soothing. All of the slower songs are just full of electronic nonsense or boring, repetitive riffs. There is no musical exploration like on SP efforts before Adore. Most of the tracks are 4-6 minute long torture sessions. My last complaint is that Machina drags on way too long and lacks diversity. There a few good songs such as \\"The Everlasting Gaze\\", \\"Stand Inside Your Love\\", \\"Heavy Metal Machine\\", and \\"The Imploding Voice\\", but overall this is a pile of pretentious musical sawdust. If you enjoyed Gish, Siamese Dream, or Pisces Iscariot, do not waste your cash on Machina/Machines of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?!?","review":"Have some of these reviewers ever even heard \\"Gish\\"?! \\"Machina\\" is NOT classic Pumpkins. The Pumpkins rock. They are my favorite band of alltime, - I have every album - but \\"Machina\\" is drab, over-produced noise. I feel horrible that they go out with such an uninspired effort. If you want great Pumpkins, check out Gish, Siamese Dream, Pieces Iscariot, and MC&IS. Don't waste time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Metal Mess...","review":"trying too hard to shift gears due to the underwhelming response to adore, corgan and co. turn up the amps andfeedback. but in this case, you can't go home again.the problem? the pumpkins were growing from record to record up to this point. while adore wasn't as consistent as gish OR mellon collie, at least it was something different. at its best, adore was astonishing. songs like \\"the tale of dusty and pistol pete\\" or \\"crestfallen\\" are right up there with corgan's best work.machina is going backwards to prove they're still a rock band. and what it really proved to be was the end of the pumpkins. a few good tracks (\\"try, try\\", \\"age of innocence\\") get lost in a bloated, 73-minute opus...SP were one of the best, and most important, bands of the nineties - right up there with nirvana, alice in chains,radiohead and soundgarden. but machina shows few, if any,signs of that...- cRAIG"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album bad mix","review":"Great Album, great songs, the only bad thing isthat it's mixed by yet another deaf soundtechnician"},{"rating":"1","title":"Want good electronica? This isn't it. Go buy DM instead","review":"Machina sounds like a second-rate Depeche Mode album that The Pumpkins stole and dubbed Billy Corgan's voice over. The Pumpkins even stole Depeche Mode's producer, so go figure. The Pumpkins were excellent in their heyday, but everything after Mellon Collie didn't have the vibe that made the Pumpkins special. If you want an album that is dark, brooding, and does electronica the way it should be done, then get Depeche Mode's Ultra album. If you want an album that does alternative the way it should be done, then get the Pumpkins' Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"To all the 5 star reviews...","review":"I don't know what the big deal is. This album is exactly the same as all the rest of them; only one or two songs rock and the rest put you to sleep. This album isn't redefining rock, showing a new twist, and certainly not receiving 5 stars. The Pumkins need to give us what we expect from each album we will purchase anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consciously confined","review":"2 1/2Most know already going in that after Mellon Collie albums essentially became techno-tinged Corgan projects, but don't let disgruntled fans convince you this is anything less than competent, if bloated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of genius","review":"Thank you Smashing Pumpkins for all the great music you've given us over the years. This is your swan song and now you've gone, but I'm pretty sure Billy will continue to open the beautiful kaleidoscope of his tortured soul as he does so passionately on this phenomenal record.

It is Billy Corgan at his most pretentious, and the guitars all sound as if they are being played in the same studio where a lawn is being mowed. The only reason I gave this CD 2 stars instead of 1 is the triumphant return of Jimmy Chamberlain. His drumming is, as always, fantastic. However, the CD as a whole is really quite mediocre, and it's a shame this will be their final album. Let's hope \\"Adore\\" is forever remebered as their last album, and MACHINA is looked upon as the enigma that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"SP is back with a vengeance, baby!","review":"well, looks like im the first to review this wonderful album, seeing as its Feb. 29, the day of its official release. First off, it really is structured and complex in some immediate aspects and simple in others. I dont think I can place it on a pedestal above Mellon Collie or Siamese Dream, but it definitely is a strong effort from Corgan and co. Id say it reminds me more of Mellon Collie if I had to compare it to another album, but it still retains its own sound and theme of what the album is supposed to be. I definitely reccomend this album to be placed high in the Pumpkins discography as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are back!","review":"I just picked up Machina earlier today. Therefore,I must be honest and say that I haven't even listened to the whole CD yet. But I must say that from what I've heard so far, this sounds like excellent music - it has a strong hardcore edge to it, and it's exactly what you would expect from one of the best rock bands around today. Way to go SP! It's been a long wait but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OHHHH YESSS!","review":"Well, our beloved Pumpkins are back! And Jimmy is with them! This is an awesome album, every song is great, i don't think ne one will be dissapointed.

Get this album, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Machina I &II are amazing albums.","review":"I never thought they'd last as long as they did, what with Corgan's depression, the fierce band environment, crisis after crisis et all...but they did last and I'm thankful. I'm even more happy about how they have stuck the record industry and all the grumps who have always written this great band off as being nothing but corporate money mongers and posers by releasing their final lp and ep's via the internet for all to enjoy w/o the baggage. This album is a must have! And, go download Machina II. If anyone ever had any doubts about the creative ablitiy of this band...these two albums will prove them wrong. Billy still has it. Wonder what he'll do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goosebumps Continue","review":"The CD is great. For those who thought the band reached their cusp after Mellon Collie (I admit I was one of them), this offering made me happy to be wrong. I saw the band recently on the Jay Leno show and learned they are breaking up after a farewell concert in Chicago... it sort of makes sense to end where it began. Let's all be thankful for what they have given us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of 2000","review":"That is not an overstatement despite the fact that this year saw great albums by Pearl Jam, Perfect Circle, Everclear, Queens of the Stone Age and more. Don't listen to the critics of this album, they obviously aren't getting what I'm getting. This album should be considered a modern-day classic and is one of the better concept albums out there. The songs are great from the unbelievably good Stand Inside Your Love and Blue Skys Bring Tears to the powerful Heavy Metal Machine, the moving I of the Mourning and the brilliant epic Glass and the Ghost Children. This album is great from beginning to end and will deeply move you."},{"rating":"2","title":"BILLY IS BACK WITH A CORKER","review":"Machina is what the world has been crying out for. like spring is to the year, machina brings a fresh wave of rock that has been lacking for a while. hard hitting tunes such as heavy metal machines and everlasing gaze are vintage corgan and melodies such as stand inside and try try try are sung from the heart. somewhat dispondant towards the end but nothing is perfect. a must have for die hard fans and others alike"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Pumpkins yet?","review":"\\"Gish\\" fans may find my review title pretentious, but really, this album shines from beginning to end. Combining the best elements of \\"Adore\\" with the artistic quality of \\"Mellon Collie\\", and the harder elements of \\"Siamese Dream\\", the album shows a maturity in songwriting while at the same time demonstrating a return to form - this due in large part to Jimmy Chamberlain's return - back to reclaim the percussion throne from the electronic drums found on the last album. The production is top notch due to Flood's and Alan Moulder's involvement, with lots of textures that don't take away from the solid writing and straight-ahead performances. While I liked a lot of the direction the band took on \\"Adore\\", there were a lot of filler moments, and \\"Mellon Collie\\" was just too long. While this one clocks in at a hefty 73 minutes, I seriously didn't dislike a single track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jackpot!","review":"Good graphics, fast paced and easy navigation.

And it was too precious for my liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Looking Out A Window","review":"If anything buy the cd for the last song, \\"She Looking Out A Window.\\" I don't know how to put this into words, but this has got to be one of the best songs written in the last 15 years, and sadly enough it sits in obscurity. The rest of the album which consists of demos, is very listenable. But the prize in the ceral box is \\"She's Looking Out A Window.\\" A song that encapsulates longing and regret so well it should be used as the definition in any dictionary in any language. Who hasn't looked back at old photographs when a relationship seemed invincible, only to have it crumble before their eyes? You have that moment forever, frozen in time, but you can't touch it, you can't feel it, you can only remember the smell of their hair, they way they looked when they slept next to you, the way they laughed, and how they cried. This song hits on all those emotions.

The second disc has a couple of neglected but very intriguing serenades for wind instruments composed by Mozart during his first years in Vienna.

You have to use the tuner where there is a lot of population.I enjoy my tuner wherever I go.

Then I discovered that it needed a digital signal and would not work with just my cable connection. Finally, I hooked it to the cable converter box from my service provider. Then I learned that the only signals it accepts are those in HD. Maybe sometime in the distant future it will work with a new TV format.

I am researching the subject as a history major at the University of Cincinnati. There is absolutely no primary documentation or evidence in general to support the satanic cult theory suggested by Hensley. None. In fact, every website that posts the Pearl Bryan murder legend fails to accept the simple historical facts.

They prefigure the direct songwriting and playing of the band's next 2 studio albums. The rest of this varies from decent (if unexceptional) to bad (\\"What's Become of the Baby\\" really does not work at all).The production approach here is largely experimental and playful. Less so that \\"Anthem of the Sun\\", but enough that the music doesn't always put its best face forward. A flawed record with a couple of gems on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bonus tracks -- WOW!","review":"I have only recently started digging in with this album, as I started with 70s Dead and moved forward and backward from there. What really rocks about this release are the bonus tracks! They are mostly instrumental jams and they completely knocked my socks off when I heard them. Spacey, dark, jazzy, deep, psychedelic, and did I say JAZZY? Billy's drumming is PERFECT and Jerry is acting as the fearless captain of a cosmic voyage into the music's heart. The whole band is breathing as one and it's just really neat to witness. Buy this release not just for the great tracks that made up the original album but the neat bonus nuggets as well! It's so great to be able to go back to all the studio albums with all this extra stuff - well done! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underated gem.","review":"Considering this album was released in '69, some of the music seems incredible even now. This album features the most amazing song ever recorded by the Dead: China Cat Sunflower. This song will blow your mind away- it's that good. Cosmic Charlie and St. Stephen also are played well. The only disappointments on the album are Rosemary and What's Become of the Baby (which gets my nod for worst Dead song of all time). Worth picking up for China Cat Sunflower alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fav Grateful Dead Studio CD","review":"Aoxomoxoa (can't pronounce it) is a very spacy CD with beautiful acoustic moments and some trippy stuff as well.There is a different mix (original 1969 release)of the album much prefered by Dead Heads but this is all there is on CD at this stage.A good way to get introduced into the Grateful Dead is getting this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Tatter","review":"Length - 36:07Overall, I think this is a really good record. I wouldn't really call myself a deadhead, but I do have a pile of their records and listen to them regularly. I seem to come back to Aoxomoxoa quite often. Some might say this album's psychedelic divagations are too excessive. I think the spacy jams on this album are offset pretty well by the more straightforward songs like St. Stephen, Dupree's Diamond Blues and Rosemary. I do think that What's Become Of The Baby is too long and boring, but that's the only track that I don't enjoy on this disc. The first three aforementioned tunes, along with China Cat Sunflower and Cosmic Charlie are all great songs. My favorite track on the album is Dupree's Diamond Blues. I recommend this album to anyone looking for something a little different, a little more interesting, a little more dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I'm not enough Deadhead","review":"'Cause I just can't \\"hear\\" this music.Garcia was a musical genius, but maybe this albumis a bit too self absorbed, for certain it's too advanced for me.For others maybe a hit, for me, a big miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda called this one \\"THE WORST OF...\\"","review":"When I listen to Aoxomoxoa, I immediately smell fish.

He literally had briefcases full of bootleg tapes of Dead concerts and played them over and over and over again.Well, I've heard this studio album, and having heard recordings of the Dead's live concerts, I can say that it makes no difference. This no-talent band was so baked that they never knew what they were doing. What the certainly were not doing was making music. It's god-awful bands like this that paved the way for modern grunge rock and (god help us all) the merger with rap to become hip-hop.I give this band and its album zero stars, which is five more than the negative five it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"one thing","review":"I love the Dead (thanks to Heidi) but I didn't like \\"China Cat Sunflower\\" on this album.

Either way, the Dead rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Dead at their finest in the studio!","review":"Aoxomoxoa is the best Dead studio album. Period. Imagine the California folk-rock scene if you will...add to it a taste of psychedelia and a dash of experimentation and you get this wonderfully crafted Grateful Dead album. There is no doubt the Dead were at their finest when live, but this studio album shows what the band is capable of when they really sit down and work. The problem with many of the Dead's studio attempts was their lack of focus, but this album is a diamond in the ruff. Often overlooked and under appreciated, it's a Dead classic to be reckoned with. Grab your lava lamp and your incense...your in for a trippy ride into the world of the Dead!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I already owned all of the cd's from the Dead's folk rock era, so I decided to get one from their psychedelic early era. So I browsed around an found one of theirs called Aoxomoxoa(!). When I put it in my stereo, St. Stephen was the first to come out and I love it right away. St. Stephen, Dupree's Diamond Blues, Doin' that Rag and Cosmic Charlie are timeless classics. The controversial song, What's Become of the Baby, in which Jerry sings with the wierd voice thing for over 8 minutes is O.K.

We bought it for rolling out pizza dough, but have used it to roll out cookie dough and pie crust as well.

First of all, this roller is very sturdy. I have used it for store-bought dough only, both white dough and whole wheat dough, different brands. I have never had a problem with this device. I only need to apply a tiny bit of flour to the wooden rollers to keep the dough from sticking. I generally also coat the dough itself with a tiny bit of flour to keep it from sticking to my counter-top. I use the larger roller first, to do a basic job on the dough, then use the smaller roller to get the sides of the dough into the edges of the pan, which it does extremely well. It seems to be shaped perfectly for this purpose. Both rollers clean up easily by running water over them and rubbing them a little. I would not suggest using anything abrasive on the rollers; just a sponge or equivalent is all that is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a long term investment...","review":"My husband and I make pizza twice a week and use this to roll out our 100% whole wheat crust.

The Cathecism of the Catholic Church and the Bible. This is where you start to learn about what Roman Catholicism is or isn't. Can you be Catholic and Pro-Choice. See CCC 2270. The CCC has all the answers to your questions. Yes, there are many people who claim to be Catholic but you can use the CCC which has all the social and other teachings of the church laid out in easy to read fashion About 70% of the book is scripture which helps put the Bible in context. If one could read the Bible and get all they needed, why are there over 28,000 protestant denominations. Start with the $8 CCC and the RSV-SE Ignatius version of the Bible (easy to read and good translation) and then branch out.

But this is a great game. I remember playing this game for hours on-end. It requires solid combined arms tactics. And the mechanical units gave it an extra dimension. The complexity level was just right for a light wargamer like me. The fantasy background allowed the creators to make focused, storied scenarios that are easy to grasp. In contrast, the other games of the series were bound to include so many units to be historically accurate that the scenarios are daunting to look at, requiring you to study the map for a good half an hour before even making your first move.

The film itself is entertaining if you just watch it without the expectation that it's going to be like a John Hughes movie.

He also teaches that Satan tries to confuse use but God is a peaceful God and does not want us to be confused but wants to teach us what's right and how to protect ourselves from Satan's confusion! Satan in this movie steals the armor of God. It teaches good principles but is geared for much younger children. I would say 4-8.Watching it as an adult now, with it being filmed live, it's not the best film quality. It teaches good morales and the Bible, but as a whole the movie is not that great. When I was younger I did however remember liking them.

This is an interesting and action packed episode. Most boys ages 6-10 love an action filled character they can relate to. Bibleman is that hero. Bibleman is a great character with a godly mindset and he relies on God and Scripture to save the day.

Bibleman and his Bible Team must stop the villains from using the weapon against them.I honestly never knew anything about Bibleman when I received this DVD to review. Not counting the bonus features, the LIVE episode is under forty minutes, and was somewhat painful for me to watch. It's obvious that this shows is aimed for a younger audience. The acting is horrible, the costumes are silly, and the special effects are even worse. It reminds me of the \\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,\\" but with a Christian twist to it. Bibleman is like a superhero with a light saber. There are a few fight scenes to keep a kid's interests.

Some are delicious (like Melitta's and Cafe One) and others are horrible (like Folgers and Senseo). Unfortunately, this brand may be worse than Senseo French Vanilla. For one thing, it's extremely strong and bitter. It also doesn't taste like vanilla at all--more like burnt plastic.Obviously, everyone's taste is different, so if you really want to try it, I'd recommend getting a variety pack with the flavor first, and then ordering the 14 pod pack, so you know for sure if you like it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased with Purchase","review":"I was very pleased with my purchase.

Dr. McKinnon's book is a true defition of the American dream (especially for minorities) and I guarantee this book will inspire you to follow your dreams regardless of how tough it gets!

I think my mouthfell open. My friend's not dumb, anything but. I quoted the line (in the title of this review)and told her it came from Mrs. Dalloway. I told her Mrs. Dalloway was one of the best books Ihave ever read. It isn't easy. It demands attention. If you give it yours, you will \\"shout, embrace,swing, be up at dawn; carry sugar to ponies; kiss and caress the snouts of adorable chows; andthen all tingling and streaming, plunge and swim.\\" And then you will know that \\"life itself,every moment of it, every drop of it, here, this instant, now, in the sun, in Regent's Park,was [is] enough.\\"Don't miss out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I began the book having never read anything by Virginia Woolf, but had heard she was great. I also had only heard of Mrs. Dalloway but did not know the story line. So, going into it blind I am certain handicapped my apppreciation for the work. Virginia Woolf uses eloquent words in Mrs. Dalloway. Unfortunately I found that it was a bit difficult to follow. There were several passages I had to read twice to understand where she jumped from one idea/topic/person to another. Half way in the frustration overtook me and I stopped reading. Having since seen the movie I understand the story much better and may give the book another go. If you do not already understand what is going to happen and are unfamiliar with this style of writing I suggest viewing the movie first."},{"rating":"2","title":"great novel!","review":"Although somewhat hard to get into, Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf ended up being a great novel. Getting into the book was tough because Woolf's syntax is very complex and different from any author I have ever read. The points of view often change without warning and can be somewhat confusing, but once I caught on to Woolf\`s style, I began to like it a lot. The entire novel takes place during one day as the protagonist, Clarissa Dalloway, prepares for a party she is throwing that evening. Other characters are brought into the plot that upon first glance may seem as though they have nothing to do with the story, but Woolf does a marvelous job intertwining the characters and making parallels between each of them. I wouldn't recommend this book if you have no patience or don't want a possible struggle. The novel, however, is beautifully written and worth your time if you are willing to give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not all together awful stream of consciousness book","review":"Mrs. Dalloway is a book very much like James Joyce's \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" which I can say makes it a hard recommendation. The point of view flows from one character to the next without any warning and many readers may be easily lost. I would not reccmond this as a first venture into the horridly confusing technique of Stream of Consciousness. Frankly, a knowing book editor would have helped this book a lot.On the upside, there are some very serious Sapphic undertones to the rambling of the book which make it more interesting than James Joyce whining about how he got beaten by the other boys in boarding school. But there are similiar themes of repression in the two books.The side plot involving Septimus Warren Smith and his wife Rezia was more interesting than Clarissa Dalloway and her silly party and repressed lesbian leanings"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it, really I did...","review":"Having abandoned this novel only half-read years ago, I went back to it hoping that maturity and experience might make a difference in my view of the work.

Kind of like F. Scott Fitzgerald's works... I just don't get it. DO read \\"The Hours\\", you will be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as Faulkner","review":"I had been warned about Woolf, but I just can't accept the fact that I don't appreciate her writing and keep coming back for more. I may not be giving it a fair review since I only made it to page 65 before throwing in the towel, but after pages and pages of surreal metaphors that go on for 10 paragraphs and nonsensical semi-flashbacks, I just couldn't follow it any more. I kept losing track of which character was musing about nothing. The book just does not make any sense. After 65 pages I still could not discern the point of anything I'd read.I suppose Woolf is considered a genius since she was apparently a cavalier writer of her generation, but I'm grateful that contemporary writers can at least string together 2 sentences that follow one another in a logical sequence.I tried, I really did; My suggestion: just watch The Hours - you'll get all the beauty and none of the confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN","review":"The only good thing to say about this \\"literary\\" drivel is that the person responsible, Virginia Wolf, has been dead for quite some time now. Let us pray to God she stays that way as we, the people, all work together to make sure that no future generations ever have to read this nonsense again. Lets burn every sentence she ever penned to end all the unneccesary suffering that curious readers have to go through when they first pick up \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" Aside from being dreadfully boring, might I add that it is also terribly written? Thats right, you heard me. The narrative reads like the inner thoughts of a sugar crazed autistic kid with ADD in the middle of a carnival. Stream of conscience you say? Groundbreaking prose?

And the fuss is about a arather boring stream of consiciousness style ramble about a pretenious, boring upper-class woman living in London and a (mentally) battle scarred man also living in London, with brief crossings of their tangents here and there. There are a few sentences of particularly lyrical writing, but the main impression is \\"And the point is?\\" The narrative is practically non-existent (not always a hindrance, but it is in this book). The characters are boring, except for the wife of Septimus, the man mentioned above - she is not given the room she is due. If this is classic Woolf, i will have to avoid her work in future - Orlando was bearable, but i could not see the point of this.Stick to The Hours - it is a much better book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, and I'll try again...","review":"I generally devour books, but it was a struggle to get through the first fifty pages or so of this novel.

In short, I personally did not care for her style but I think her subject matter is probably good. I might try her poetry ( I think she wrote poetry too) but I am very picky about fiction and writer's styles. I am a nonfiction...history and biographies...girl so perhaps that was the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Confusing, But Overall A Great Piece of Literature","review":"Mrs. Dalloway was the first peice of modernist literature I had ever read. The overall book, as most modernism novels are, was some-what confusing. Many times I would sit reading the book and know someone was narrating, then a second later someone else was narrating without me noticing the switch. At first this annoyed me, but then I realized that this was what made Virginia Woolfe such a magnificent writer. Her talent to switch from one persons thoughts to another's seamlessly is reamrkable. Though, the swithching of the plot and people's thoughts so seamlessly also leads to confusing moments in the book where you aren't quite sure where you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virginia Woolf, master psychologist","review":"I'm not that familiar with Woolf's other work, but this book shows the amazing psychological insight that this woman possessed. There's not really much of a plot, other than intense rumination and speculation, so don't expect any dramatic action. What you will find is a glorious stream of consciousness approach to developing characters and letting their random thoughts weave together an interesting story. This book will certainly not suit all tastes, but if you enjoy rumination, florid sentences that seem to never end, and a whimsical view of the world, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" will please you. Avery Z.

But the absence of any plot structure leaves the reader not particularly caring how the party turns out, or what these generally boring people are thinking about.I feel stupid for admitting this, but my honest reaction to this book was: \\"Huh?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to read","review":"Woolf's stream of consciousness writing is difficult to read. But the Kindle version made it even worse, since it was carelessly done and included large empty gaps and hyphenated words in the middle of sentences.

I also her selection of word choices in conveying her message, that's what made it a powerful read. However, this was one of my least favorite books because of her chronic use of run-on sentences and poor transitions from one character to another. I realize that this is what makes Woolf unique (aka the \\"woolfian\\" sentence in modern literature derives its title from this structure), but it was confusing. While the story itself took place in one day, I think it took me one full day of reading and assistance from Sparknotes to interpret. Much more work than it was worth. If you need or want to read anything from Virginia Woolf, do not start with this book. Some of her other works would be suitable for the novice Woolf reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a classic","review":"Mrs. Dalloway doesn't make sense.

I had read and enjoyed A Room of One's Own while in graduate school. To say that I hated this book would be untrue, because in order to hate it, something would have had to have happened. They say that Seinfeld was a tv show about nothing - well this book is full of sentences that are too long, characters that are never developed, and truly about nothing. Sorry, but just because VW was mentally-ill does not mean that everything she wrote was profound and interesting. This was just plain dull. I'm hoping The Hours is better, despite its inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stream of Conciousness not my cup of tea...","review":"I didn't really enjoy this book, mostly I think due to the writing style.

It possesses a level of depth that isn't present in many novels today. I like the insight the story gives into human nature and how fickle life is.

Byatt. The prose in Byatt, like Woolf, is a deep going but if you wanted that experience then you will be well pleased. In short, expecting an easy read, or even an intermediate one here will disappoint you - somewhat like using a hammer to drive a screw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it...","review":"I enjoy reading classics, give me Thomas Hardy or Charles Dickens anyday, but I did not find the characters in this book engaging at all.

Typically, I am not a fan of \\"stream of consciousness,\\" and being that \\"To the Lighthouse\\" was my first read, Woolf left me not wanting for more. However, in a Queer Theory course in my graduate studies, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" was assigned and I absolutely loved it. In fact, upon finishing this work, I ordered all of Woolf's works.Not only is the work hauntingly beautiful and melancholy, but also rather daring. The book takes place in the course of one day in London, yet somehow, the reader becomes familiar with lifetimes of relationships, some of them homosexual relationships. Woolf's work here is gorgeously poetic.The book generated a lot of discussion because it has so much to offer to many different kinds of readers. I once swore I would never read Woolf again, but this book has made me recant the error of my ways.If you are a fan of poetic prose, read this book. I intend to read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Effort Required","review":"This book certainly requires more effort on the reader's side than many books, but it is well worth the effort. Woolf keeps up her half of the bargain by making effective use of the diffucult style; leading the reader with a purpose rather than pointless meandering. She explores the stream-of-conciousness style effectively, without going to the silly extreme that some other Modernist authors did. Her portrayal of mental illness strikes me as eerily realistic, especially when you take into account her own personal history.The way I attacked it was like this: I read it once as quick as I could, without stopping to figure it out, then read it again taking my time. In the end, I was rewarded with a cathartic experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Kindle edition","review":"This Kindle edition is terrible. The margins change without rhyme or reason.

I've never been so annoyed by the difficulty and pointlessness of a story in my life. I thought Faulkner was difficult to read. At least his stories go somewhere, never mind that figuring out his plotlines is like putting together the pieces of a broken bottle.

Like gagging on good porter when near-beer's been your habitual tipple for far too long. Best taken before or after having your kisser linguistically smacked by James Ellroy, Elmore Leonard et al. Could not have been written before ULYSSES, but had to be written before John O'Hara could come up with BUTTERFIELD 8 - and I reckon F Scott Fitzgerald suckled at this muse too (aficionados, check out Jordan Baker's curtains flying \\"like pale flags\\"in GATSBY: they're \\"dragons\\" in MRS DALLOWAY).

My English teachers will cringe when I say it, but this book, well, sucks. It may well be great literature, but the characters are not engaging, and if it was Woolf's motive to out-do James Joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative, she doesn't pull it off. Again, the characters and the internal mental life simply don't have the power that \\"Ulysses\\" has. Reading Woolf is necessary for a good eduction. I recommend, however, that you read \\"To the Lighthouse\\". I may still be motivated to read the book version of \\"The Hours\\" given how great the movie was. But my taste for Woolf is all done now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A day in the life ( I really dislike this book)","review":"I read the novel \\"The HoursThe Hours\\" where the assumptionis that Virginia Woolf killed herself.

I was very turned off, however, by the lack of pictures and the extensive use of uncommon or hard-to-find ingredients.I know my area isn't known for it's multiculturalism and maybe these things are easier to find in more metropolitan areas, but it was a real turn-off to not be able to make a bunch of these recipes without special-order items.

And the screen directions read like absolute poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaolin & Wu Tang 2- Wu Tang Invasion","review":"Well for starter i had this movie on VHS and i loved it the only problem with this movie. In the setting for the language it didn't let me prompt it to play audio for english. The setting was there but it didn't work and that to me was disappointing.

This was her introduction to Caddie Woodlawn and she loved it! These wonderful stories of pioneer life in Wisconsin in the middle of the 19th century are just as alive today as when they were written 60 or more years ago.

It contains New Age nonsense that dictates \\"weight loss comes from self-esteem\\" - advice that one food pyramid is for everyone, followed by suggestion that the one adapt same old ADA food pyramid that so many of us find unsuitable - tired advice about wearing black and neutrals that's been in every book on the topic written during the past 20 years - and the underlying idea that a heavy woman can have any interest she wants as long as it's exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little of note here","review":"The fashion tips in this book are far from original. The tired ideas about wearing \\"neutrals\\" and \\"the uniform\\" have been presented in perhaps 95% of the books on this topic for the past 25 years. In fact, the truly fashion conscious among us are unlikely to find a wardrobe of black items and, of all things, white tee shirts to be appealing.Though, unlike many popular books today, Catherine's does not contain the \\"poor mes,\\" the trendy, boring ideas about \\"self-esteem\\" (and the assumption that one who is large is lacking in same) are totally stereotypical and tired. One wonders if those with weight problems (with which I can empathise, since it is a lifelong situation of my own) will not stop to think that few genuine difficulties in any life were caused by, or would be decreased by, anything connected with one's weight. It would be far better if Catherine had dealt with fashion in itself, rather than flavouring her work with pop psychology which falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic","review":"Not a bad book, but too basic for anyone but a real beginner in telephone selling.

However, this book has a glaring weakness in its absence of true psychological analysis. One need not have a long history of sales to understand that a single strategy for handling objections will leave you at the bottom of the field. Since people react very differently to diverse stimuli, it is imperative you master prospect cues and consistent interrelated response techniques if you are anticipating any sales success; something this book gives far too little attention to.As an overview of phone sales, this book succeeds only in that it will assist readers establishing their goals, system, and client preservation; however this book does not contain any major \\"secrets\\" or any of the psychological principles that most quality sales books typically include."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressive TITLE!","review":"Impressive TITLE is ONLY what this book it is all about.

It is completely different than the stand that comes with the true version.4) The material it's made out of feels cheap and rubbery. True PVC should feel solid, almost porcelain-like.In conclusion, I'll keep it for display purposes, but if you're looking for a TRUE Kotobukiya figure, you're not going to find it here.

Their men have the look of permanent boyhood; their women are curvy and compliant. The Immis' gentle hedonism gives them poor preparation for the acts of bravery. When a dark shadow falls across their land, the Immis draft Odkin into heroism and then exile him for the trouble that follows in his heroic wake.A great chef can built extraordinary treats from everyday ingredients. That's what Wood does here with staples of the fantasy genre. There are wizards, mucled heroes, grunting bad guys, and lots more of the usual. But, with Wood's enjoyable art and quirky spirit, the story steers well clear of cliche.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat beats.","review":"Wow. I just got done listening to the samples. This compilation totally reminds me of being in an unbearably body-heated, suffocating-with-smoke warehouse grooving to the beats blasting out of a stack of bassbins in front of me. Trippy 8mm loops of black and white mickey mouse doing a dance similar to the running man on a cloth screen overlaped by colorful computer-generated animation of everchanging geometric shapes and colors. Can someone say flashback? Great music, especially for the oldschool brakbeat enthusist. Though I haven't noticed any mention about the album being continuously mixed.

The author has done some fine work: His non-fiction works, \\"The Zebra Killings\\" and \\"Five against the Rock\\" are compelling reading as is his fiction novels, \\"The Wardens\\" and \\"Dirt Rich\\".

The cds helped me so much in terms of pronunciation, as well as rhythm of the language. I have tried other language cds, and I think the Pimsleur approach is so different and effective, that it's really worth the price difference.

Per Amazon's recommendation, I first called Pimsleur directly and spoke with a customer service rep, who would not replace the CD without charging me a $20 shipping fee--not acceptable, since the CD was defective. I then called Amazon and spoke with a customer service rep, who sent me a replacement set free of charge, but lesson 14 on CD 7 of the second set was also defective.

Audie England's character (Eve) escapes from some kind of prison - the kind where the prison keepers don't even know who they're keeping, and the kind with a high-tech alarm system with more holes than a Swiss cheese. Even with that kind of start, the strain on one's credulity just keeps getting worse as the movie rolls on.The biggest attraction may be in the moments when Audie appears wearing only Audie - and I have to say she wears it well. Those scenes are much too brief to make up for the weaknesses elsewhere in the movie, though.

In Trinidad) and brings us to today's still relevant problems (Taxes On The Farmer Feeds Us All).

While this book contains many useful tips, it is also pedantic and argumentative. As many of the reviewers noted, Graves and Hodges often illustrate poor writing with examples that seem, in an initial reading, to be sound. Perhaps this merely shows that modern readers are being anaesthetized by bad prose, but I don't think so. If Graves and Hodges loosened up a notch or two they would have written a much better book.The authors leave the topic of style a little too early for my taste, making the book more of a guide to editing than a guide to writing well.Still, the book focuses on developing a prose style that is logical, clear, and succinct--the backbone of all good prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"estupendo","review":"Un libro escencial para reconocer a los genios del arte de vanguardia contemporáneo, a lo largo de sus páginas nos vamos sumergiendo en las claves necesarias para descifrar las contradictorias y a veces conflictivas actitudes de la vanguardia artistica del siglo pasado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful to originals","review":"If you lack the originals and have only memories of these great tracks, you will not be disappointed.

I have tried many times with you but still not able to pay them. The biggest problem is with usps have had nothing but problems with them, lkast 4 or 5 orders with them they keep saying they delivered the packages but I never got them, and days later the packages they said I recieved mysteriously end up at thier office and have to go pick them up. If i order from amazoned again and find out thye are using usps for delivery I will cancel order I want nothing to to with them, just this one order have spent hours trying to reslove this and am getting very fustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's inexpensive and then there's just cheap","review":"The only thing I did with these washcloths was to put them in the maintenance room in my condo building for wiping tools.

I didn't send them back because it was easier to toss them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps my rosacea","review":"This product helps my rosacea.

Yes. I tracked down the brand they served and it was Douwe Egberts. I bought the Senseo coffee maker and have used Douwe Egberts ever since. I'm not the only who loves it, either. Whenever I serve coffee to guests they rave about it too. My daughter's mother-in-law bought a Senseo because she thought it was the best coffee she'd ever had. She drinks decaf. You can keep Starbucks. It tastes burnt. You can have \\"Blue Mountain\\" and all the other premium brands. Douwe Egbert's is the best, bar none!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak coffee","review":"While I enjoy Senseo-brewed coffee generally, the breakfast blend is far too weak.

Of course this also doubled the price making the deal not so good after all. Using two pods was a little too strong for my taste. Senseo rates the coffee as between mild and med. It was VERY, VERY mild!In all fairness to this product, I purchased these pods to use with my EZ-Cup in my Keurig.

It is very convenient to get it once a month also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love medium roast Senseo coffee,","review":"The Senseo medium roast coffee pods make an excellent cup of coffee every time. It is always fresh. Never old and burnt or sour tasting. One reason is that it makes only one cup at a time. The other being it is an excellent tasting coffee. It is rich without being too strong. Can't wait for my cup in the morning. I have the Hamilton Beach coffee maker which uses the Senseo pods. The only problem with that is that it only holds 12 oz. and I like a 14 oz cup. So I just let some go through and then add the other two ounces before I begin making my breakfast.

Nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meeehhh not so good","review":"I'm really not a coffee snob and only drink about 1 cup or so a day but this coffee was not so great. I do not like strong coffee but found I needed to use two pods for an 8oz cup and it still had a \\"watery\\" taste even though the coffee in the cup was very dark and appeared rich tasting. I wish they made a reusable pod for my Hamilton Beach model #49970 so I could grind my own coffee. I cannot recommend this coffee. Very disappointed.

Boo-hiss on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost not drinkable","review":"Well, the reviews were really good for this coffee, so I decided to buy in bulk. Big mistake.

What's with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite coffee","review":"We drink Senseo Douwe Egberts coffee in my house every day. I usually use one pod for my morning coffee, and a \\"double\\" on the weekend. While I like all the varieties, medium roast is my favorite. We buy it by the 4-pack case in my house.The coffee has good body and is not bitter. I take mine with cream and sugar, but it is so easy to drink I could even go without and it still tastes great to me. The pod system is so clean and easy too. I love the fact that there is no cleanup. I think it would work especially well for someone who doesnt normally drink coffee but would like to have something nice when guests come over. Because the pods come in small lined bags, it stays fresh longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the product, but...","review":"I love using the Senseo pods, but recently I purchased these on Amazon and there are coffee grinds on the bottom of the package. This causes an issue because I have to wipe them off before using them. It's not a huge ordeal, but I would much rather not have to fuss with something before I can use it.

What more could you want, except for those of you who prefer being in a cafe full of strangers drinking coffee drinks around you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"Senseo Sumatra Blend neither smells nor tastes like true Sumatra Mandheling. It tastes more like a stronger (barely) Breakfast Blend with an acidic aftertaste. This is a bland, boring, characterless coffee. In addition, the Senseo pods are very thin, with very little coffee in them, causing a very weak brew even on the 5 oz. setting. For a much better Sumatra Mandheling, stick to Java One or Molto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee pods","review":"The individual coffee pods come in a variety of strengths and flavors.

Excited about my new machine, I brewed my first cups of coffee only to be disappointed, not by the machine itself (awesome!), but by the quality of the coffee. The light roast was so-so, and the medium TERRIBLE. I quickly ordered the dark to compare, and can now HIGHLY recommend the dark roast over the other two options. The dark also works the best in espresso-like brewing mode, using two-pods with the 1-cup setting. It's still not the best coffee out there, and I'm looking forward to comparing with the upcoming podhead.com pods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseo Vienna Hazelnut coffee pods","review":"The expiration date was too soon.

I steeped it for 10 minutes, then added lemon and Agave just like I do with my other teas. There was hardly any taste! With my other Rose Hips tea, the flavor is strong.

But when I tried to watch it, it wouldn't play in my dvd player or on my computer. The only way I could watch it was on my family's old xbox.. Really weird. I would rather pay a few more dollars for a compatible DVD. It is extremely annoying that I can't watch a DVD on a DVD player.. But not worth the shipping to get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endearing","review":"Jane Fonda was certainly lovely in this film, and her fey charm forgives the fact that she was clearly showcasing herself here and not truly interacting with her equally photogenic co-star, Robert Redford. Neil Simon's wit and clever use of human beings as props in sight gags has never been so polished in any of his other productions, and there is something truly endearing about this particular film. I think it is the mixture of its time and setting, all combined with the fact its two lead actors are still fresh enough in the business to exude real life excitement about their roles. This movie is funny, effectively coy a time or too, and just bizarre enough to stand the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"barefoot in the park","review":"a wonderful movie , so funny. the mother is a delight. i was just wondering why when almost everyone ended up there on the roof, nobody fixed the problem ! any way seen it many times and loved it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but Goodie","review":"It's been around a long time, but it still works.

Robert Redford usually not really known for comedic roles, shines in this flick as the straight guy. Jane Fonda, known for being a little eccentric in real life, has no trouble playing one in this movie. The rest of the cast fits their parts to a tee, including the mother-in-law who's comedic delivery and timing is superb. This movie is and will always remain a three generation family favorite. I only wish my mother had lived long enough to watch it again with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I never saw the play on which this movie is based, but I do have to say that I think this movie is hilarious and really light-hearted. The first time I saw it was on TCM (Turner Classic Movies), and I could already tell it was a classic. It was such a simple movie, yet so memorable. There are many catchy lines and quirky situations that make this movie a \\"must-have\\". I recommend it for anyone young or old who has the urge to laugh and smile through the day. Thanks for reading!=)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Silly, Enetertaining (almost required viewing for newlyweds)","review":"Based on Neil Simon's paly (he is also the author of the screenplay), this is a lighthearted, comic and silly yarn about two newlyweds (Redford and Fonda), who, after spending a brief honeymoon at the Plaza Hotel, move into a rented a walk-up apartment in New York. The challenges of the couple - lack of heating, adjusting to living with each other, dealing with in-laws and neighbors are well narrated and acted. Highly recommended for newlyweds, particularly those who are professionals and live in an urban environment!For a more serious movie love story set in New York with Redford (and Streisand), see the 1973 Best Picture Oscar nominee \\"The Way We Were\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought...","review":"... that with Jane Fonda and Robert Redford in a Neil Simon's play there would be some entertainment. But, because of (and no thanks to) Gene Saks' unability to be a real director, the result was pure crap, no matter how hard the leads could try : they were not given a chance. We must consider to be very lucky his output was so tiny.....The least Neil Simon could do would be to give excuses for helping the production...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barefoot in the Park","review":"Barefoot In the Park - Paramount, 1967Jane Fonda is adorable in this Broadway hit play by Neil Simon converted to the big screen. Fonda and Robert Redford are Corie and Paul Bratter, newlyweds adjusting to their newfound married life. Corie is carefree and vibrant, whereas her husband, Paul, is prim and proper. Together, they make a dazzling team that answers the question: Do opposites attract? The script rarely leaves their hilariously small apartment, located on the fifth floor of a building with no elevator. This adds for some laughable moments in the movie as visitors have to walk up five flights of stairs to reach them. Mildred Natwick plays Corrie's concerned mother, and she livens up the script with her dry wit and humorous lines. This is a wonderful romantic comedy that will lift your spirits. I just wish the movie was a bit longer. . . I would have loved to see what became of this lovable couple"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work!","review":"I received the movie but it wouldn't play on any of the DVD players I tried!

I finally broke down and bought \\"Barefoot in the Park\\" on DVD and wasn't disappointed. This movie has aged well, thanks in large part to Jane Fonda's wholehearted performance. Redford, unfortunately, looked sadly out of place. The movie bounces bouyantly along on the strength of Jane's indomitable will, aided by wonderful performances from Charles Boyer and Mildred Natwick. At film's end you wonder why Corrie still has anything to do with her deadbeat husband. Redford looks positively goofy dancing barefoot in the park, but you just have to imagine he has a good heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and hard to sit through","review":"This film was entertaining for the first five minutes and then it became almost tortuous to sit through. It is so vapid. The couple is severely mismatched and you actually end up hoping that they don't get back together in the end because in the long run, they lawyer especially, would be better off without such a dingbat woman for a wife. Now both of the lead actors are in their prime in this movie and they are both very good looking. Robert Redford bears an almost uncanny resemblance to Bill Clinton, although, even better looking. Jane Fonda does well in her dance routines. But truthfully, I see little reason to even bother with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"odd format","review":"DVD was formatted for use in Europe.

I gave it enough of a chance, and it did manage to settle down into something milder after a few hours, but it was still an unattractive smell. It smells like something a much older woman would wear. I think it's because of all the overwhelming florals. Burberry Classic is my signature scent, and this had none of the creaminess or fruitiness of the original. Just a steady, strong old floral.

It is perfect for use during the hot, humid months but be sure to use a sunscreen because it does not contain sunscreen. That may be why it's not greasy, but I don't know. It's expensive, but I think it's worth the money. During humid months, you do not need more than a dip of your finger. You may need a dip more during the dry winter months or possibly a second application. So it seems that this moisturizer will last for a while.

While these coolers appear to be nicely manufactured, they leave much to be desired in terms of keeping beverages cold.A single cold bottle of water remains cold for no more than 2-3 hrs after which it takes up room temp. By adding a large pack of BlueIce the bottle remains cold for an extra 2-3 hrs.These are no better than the cheap coolers u can buy at a gas station.If u need a cooler that keeps ur goods cold for more than a cpl of hours, this is not the cooler for u want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for work.","review":"I bought this cooler because I wanted a way to bring my lunch to work without it looking like I was lugging around a cooler or a lunchbox.

If you froze a twelve pack and no ice and stretched the zipper to the max, maybe. Threads are already starting to fray, zipper pull has pulled out. The side zipper pocket can barley hold a Cliff Bar (flattened out by the end of the day I might add). Opening the thing is a pain empty, full is a workout. Why is there an identical cooler on this site for $10 less and a different name? Not sure but it more like a promotional cooler you get at the company picnic, while the boss get the Rolex. Do not waste your money. The other reviews must be from relatives of the guy selling these promo coolers as the next best cooler. I was a sucker, don't follow my lead or you will be one too. I would give 1 star but it is a cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed in this, built well but too tough to use!","review":"I was very excited to order this to bring lunch every day and liked the fact it is so durably made but the issue is that the top of the bag is so tight that opening it and putting in some lunch items is a struggle. I wish this case had a top that could just be opened and left open. This bag reminds me of those little coin purses that needs to be flexed to be opened. I am sorry but this case feels bullet proof but it seems very small for a 12 pack to me and just a major dissapointment. I feel like it would be useful for bringing 1 sandwich and soda. Trying to stack up containers was not easy at all and the bag filled too fast. I bought another popular bag that is smaller on the outside but much roomier and more convenient on the inside. Really wish I had not made this purchase but don't want to deal with shipping it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have gotten a bad one","review":"I bought this cooler on the recommendation of a lot of kayak anglers who think it is just wonderful.

The bag is smaller than you'd think though -- getting 12 cans in would be a challenge. Also, it's a bit hard to pack due to the padding. Overall it's a great bag, but I'd recommend getting a size larger than you think you'll need."},{"rating":"1","title":"They keep drinks cold, but ...","review":"They leak. I've had several of these. They are great if you need to take a cooler in a place that coolers aren't allowed because they look like a piece of luggage. But they don't stand up to daily use. The lining gets holes in it and leaks. If you were going to use it on special occasions, they would be fine. They do hold ice for a long time, even in hot weather. We got a lot of positive comments on the looks. It works best with cans. Bottle caps will destroy the lining. Don't bother to email customer service. They won't answer you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps it cold for 24 hrs!","review":"Being a fabric cooler, it amazed me that my items stayed cold (the same temperature from the fridge) for at least 5 hours plus my ice packs still had some chunks after 24 hours.

Kind of wish I sprung for the 24 pack size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the 24 if you want room","review":"I ordered the 12 pack, but found it way to small for my needs.

At first I thought it might be to big to pack in a suitcase but it worked fine and I don't think I would want a smaller one although I am considering buying the smaller version of the Polar Bear cooler ( 6 can size). It was easy to carry everywhere we went. Comes with a nice attached bottle opener. I am hooked on this cooler and will take it on every trip we go on. Highly recommend it.

There are no noticeable signs of wear. The rubber lining keeps my credit cards nice and secure, and there is plenty of room inside to stash away a note or receipt. Moisture seems to stay out of the wallet - my cash is always dry. The best thing about it is how slim it is. It's holding about 24 cards and is still half the size of my old wallet.The only possible downside is that it's a little noisy. It crinkles when you take it out of your pocket.

The layout of the pockets is good however that is where the benefits stop.Issue 1: The material that it is made of sounds like a potato chip bag. every time I move, I can hear the wallet make a crinkling sound which is annoying at least and embarrassing to more realistic.Issue 2: The slick nature of the material makes it so that the cards do not seem to want to stay put. This is not a good thing to have cards falling out while trying to make a purchase.The only reason that I didn't return the one that I bought is that I'll use it for a pattern to make one for myself out of a better material (probably denim).In short, I can't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I'm not a wallet guy.

TWICE in the last year, I decided a wallet was in order. But thin had to be a TOP priority. Well gentlemen, this is it. However, if you want something luxurious and supple, you will absolutely need to look elsewhere. This is made out of sailcloth nylon and can be relatively noisy. In fact, it crinkles so readily, that I have mistaken it for the vibration of my cell phone when in my pocket. It takes getting used to.

I left it setting on my coffee table and my wife and both of my children that are still at home comented about it bring junk. I decided instantly that I would send it back to Amazon. I don't know why but over the next few days I went on Amazon to get return authorization but was unable to find the link.

I think it's an innovative concept, but ultimately, I was not impressed after having received it. Firstly, the material might as well be wax paper. It literally crinkles while in hand causing me to only assume it will not last. It's puzzling how cheap this wallet is made. Second, the cash pouch is not impressive either. The need to dig deep into a wallet to retrieve cash was annoying. And finally, you might be able to store 16 credit cards, but sorting through each unorganized slot to find the right one was well, not efficient.

When filled with cards this new wallet is thinner than my old wallet was when empty.Some reviewers mentioned that cards slip out. The latest version of this wallet has a rubbery surface inside the pocket so cards don't slip out anymore.Not only is this surface grippy but it also stretches so the pocket can accomodate one card or a lot of cards.And regarding the noise... when new and empty the wallet did sound crinkly but in practice, filled with cards and some cash, it hasn't been an issue at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin, and that's it.","review":"This is definitely much more thin than your regular wallet. If that is all you care about then you would rate this a 4 or a 5. However, it sounds like you have a crumpled up diaper in your pocket.

Love it. As for the sound, yes, at first, the material does swoosh a bit but fairly soon afterwards the sound goes away as the cloth breaks in. As for loose credit cards, well, I've always been careful when I open my wallet so that isn't an issue for me. I will say that the recommended number of cards per pocket is low. I can put 4 in each pocket easily as the cloth breaks in. 5 would go without issue and then they will be snug.Love this thing. Love it. MY biggest problem is that I can't tell that it's there so I often hang up my suit jacket or pants with the wallet still in. Don't even know it's there. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wallet is a lie","review":"First off, cards don't actually fit in the pocket. I had to force a single card into the pocket. That caused the seams to tear. This was a regular old debit mastercard, nothing like an Amex Black. US dollars only barely fit into the cash pocket. Forget about any currency even 2mm wider. This is supposed to be a European model. It's a joke. If you really want to spend $15 and not get anything for it, just send it to me.

On one hand, it can not hold coins or keys the way that other wallets can, but, on another hand, when you put it in your back pocket, you can sit down and not even realize you have a wallet under your buttocks, and that more than makes up for its limited capacity to hold coins.

Some of the vocal stuff on this disc is okay. Some of it is hideous. Overall this tribute makes you wonder two things: 1.) For the artists to get the rights to do these songs, they had to agree to not play the songs as they were originally (read: screw them up), or 2.)

A fine melding of the past and the present through the eyes of the biographer, it was a wonderful way to read the story. I enjoyed drifting back and forth between the past and the present. I bought the book on Friday afternoon and finished it by Sunday at noon, and wished there were more to the story.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Through Prayer","review":"The book completely passed me by. when an author writes for \\"The ministry\\" I see a red flag called ego being hoisted.

In fact this is a pack of two. So I purchased four. I recieved four packs of two - eight total. When I contacted the company to request that they pay for the return since the error was caused by their lack of information/misinformation. They told me they would accept them back without a restocking fee but that I would have to pay for the shipping. They also recommended that I send them back via a 'traceable' method since they are 'not responsible for items lost in the mail'which makes me a little concerne about how the return process will go. To send the items back it will cost me at least $5.00 probably more if I use a 'traceable method'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"My son has just started collecting and trading these cards.

That was a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brotherhood of War: The Generals","review":"As far as I'm concerned, The Brotherhood of War series is simply the best set of books ever written.If you like, historical fiction based on fact style novels, this series is a must read.The Generals is book six of nine in The Brotherhood of Wars series."},{"rating":"1","title":"why this title?","review":"The series got boring even before this book! It's always the same plots just in different times!And if you care for details in a series, to follow the whole history of the caracters, don't buy any of Griffin's books, because he is mixing everything: names, ranks, places, dates,...! It can drive you crazy. Doesn't he ever control what he writes?What made me really angry at this special book, is that there is no reference to the title, concerning the main caracters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible-skip this one but read the rest","review":"The rest of the books in this series are very good. This one ends with loose ends and essentially not much character growth or connection among the characters. Like some of the other reviewers I felt let down and discouraged. I wish I had skipped this one and moved on to the prequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the most accurate protrayal of military life.","review":"From a family of charter members to the W.P.P.A. (I have lived in Quarters 1 at Fort Benning and Fort Monroe) this is easily the most accurate and readable series of books about life among the officer class in the United States from the 40's through the 70's. Written in an exciting yet detailed manner, it serves as an accurate history of the United States Army from one who has been there. To me personally, the most exciting part is the history of Army Aviation, from the death of Scotty Laird to the secret wars with the Air Force. Though each book stands on its own, this series is a must read for anyone with an interest in the history of the Army. My only regret is that the series ended. Perhaps one more book - The Cadets? . . . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"W.E.B. Griffin has done a superb job of this story","review":"Although the series of books are about Special Forces & Army \\"Airdales\\", (I'm sorry, it's the Marine coming out of me), I enjoyed the novel very much. The whole brotherhood series builds on grade structure and is a conitnuity unto itself of the characters involved. Great reading and you don't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, it almost feels as if you're there yourself!","review":"Griffin marvellously creates an atmosphere that really absorbs you as you read.

I think this album should get a 20 year anniversary like Thriller because it was at one point the second biggest selling album of all time, with a record breaking tour and 5 #1 singles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad is a classic","review":"Bad is michael jackson's best and most perfectly produced album. And even better, he wrote all the songs on it and he sounds really good, and the music videos and the tour from this album are his best ever. This CD and era is so good that even the younger crowd today rocks to it, I have little cousins who cannot get enough of this CD, the music videos that came from this album and moonwalker, it is truly the best!

There's no denying that it is still a fantastic album. What is interesting to note is the quality of the omitted songs \\"Streetwalker\\" and \\"Fly Away\\". The album would have been much better if these two songs had made the cut rather than the corny \\"Just Good Friends\\" (Nothing against Stevie Wonder but the song just sounds silly) and \\"Speed Demon\\" (ok so the chorus is cool but as a whole the song sounds too wierd). \\"Fly Away\\" would have made a perfect closing track, because IMO \\"leave me alone\\" is such a good song it leaves you craving for more and always leaves me dissatisfied at the end of the album. \\"Bad\\" is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true treasure","review":"This is a true treasure if you consider yourself a fan of Michael. The concert is - as anything Michael did - outstanding! The video quality is surprisingly clear and makes everything so much greater. Oh and by the way...watch out for a cute moment towards the end of \\"Bad\\" ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"BAD\\"- Definitely Jackson's best work to date.","review":"BAD is a masterpiece of music-making! Its 10 original tracks, from BAD to Smooth Criminal, all have awsome rythmic qualities and all-round great sound! Its bonus track, \\"Leave Me Alone\\", is also good for a listen, though it isn't nearly as powerful as the rest of the album's contents. In my opinion, BAD surpasses Thriller in all dimensions including: melodies, rythms, and all-round musical sound. By saying this, of course, Thriller is the second best album of Jackson's. The best song, musically and meaningfully, on BAD is \\"Man in the Mirror\\". This track lets us hear Michael's powerful vocal abilities and lets us know that to make the world a better place, people should look to change themselves first. If there is one album that you purchase in the near future, it should be this one. Congrats to Michael Jackson on providing his fans with a great piece of art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Jackson's Bad CD","review":"If anyone ever wanted to hear what it took to make this album then they should buy this to hear Quincy Jones give his own interpretation of how the 33 songs Michael Jackson wrote either made it to the album or not. Very entertaining as well as interesting and comical in parts. Just buy it and you will see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"His Best Album Since Thriller!","review":"Okay album, but not groundbreaking as the previous two were. This is where he begins to believe in his own self-importance and in caring less about making good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry has everyone lost their mind?","review":"This record is crap. It was a major let down sales wise after Thriller and only sold as many copies as it did because it was a follow up to one of the biggest albums in Pop music history. Jackson peaked with Thriller and everything after it was a pale comparison. Plus you could not give Micheal Jackson CD's away before he died. There was a reason he was so broke! I am not going to go into his personal life. You don't need to. Based on music alone this record is what it advertised! That this record is Bad. Not bad cool. Just plain old bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"Got this CD for my 9 year old.

The package arrived in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met Expectations","review":"The original CD we all knew how good it was. Now, with the remasterization, it sounds even better. I could hear nuances that I either never paid attention to or were not crystal clear enough before. As for the bonus CD, there's no earth-shattering songs, but there are 2 or 3 really good (like \\"Al Capone\\", for example, which sounded a bit like a different, previous version of Smooth Criminal). All in all, I recommend if you are a fan of him and never had the first CD, but I probably would have not bought it just for 2 or 3 songs. But if the price is not high when you get it, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King IS BACK","review":"Compare to Thriller it's a close second. The funk of this music is eye-popping good.

But, all that aside, he has made some of the most memorable pop and dance music ever, and this album just goes to prove that you cannot judge music by the 'cover'. Greatly overshadowed by various scandals and tabloid stories, Michael's music became secondary and some people even refused to buy his records because of that. And that's too bad, because what you have on this album are well produced, well performed dance/pop songs, one a duet with Stevie Wonder. 16 page booklet includes lyrics and photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad","review":"This CD is definantly MJ's greatest work in terms of the fact that he wrote 9 of the 11 songs. This CD is as good as Off the Wall and Thriller. I like all three equally for different reasons. So, if you don't have the original album like I do, I got the CD to play all the time. I would highly suggest that you buy them. Michael Jackson was unquestionably the biggest pop star of the '80s, and certainly one of the most popular recording artists of all time. Jackson always remained bigger than life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST have for any MJ fan!!!","review":"This is a great package to have for any MJ fan.

Jackson's audience would continue to dwindle with each subsequent release, perhaps owing as much to the Self-Proclaimed King of Pop's well-documented tangles with law enforcement as the quality of the albums themselves, yet Weird Al Yankovic nonetheless enjoyed tremendous success with his BAD-inspired music video, a rare example of a \\"cover\\" improving upon an original recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"most unusual reviewer and listener","review":"I borrowed the cd From a friend few years ago to try it.most of the tracks were O.K except Track 9 \\"Dirty Diana\\":that song sounded awfull and sadistic to me considering the way he sings and screems there along with Steve Stevens Guitar solo.and to make things worse there are some strings played in the song.I'd listened to it few times for a second chance but NO.Im not listening to his songs anymore since they remind me of the exsistance of \\"dirty diana\\", and im not his fan anymore.I dont recommend this album or his other stuff for those musicologists who keeplimited records collections worth listening to, and for those who understand complex mental psycology."},{"rating":"1","title":"let the dead rest","review":"Although this was once a great work, it does not survive well.

Although I don't like better than Thriller, this album is much more mature. My favorites include:1. Liberian Girl, a quiet storm ballad driven by Michael's smooth vocals2. Another Part of Me, an R&B; dance track that is exhilarated by Michael's effortless delivery3. I Just Can't Stop Loving You, a heart-wrenching ballad sang beautifully between Siedah and Michael4. Dirty Diana, a rock groove that showcases Michael's dynamic vocals, as well as Steve Stevens guitar playing5. Fly Away, words can't describe. How did this song NOT make the cut?This album is a distinguishing land-mark in Michael Jackson's repertoire, and remains the only album to have 5 #1's.

Thanks AMAZON."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever","review":"Bad is a really great album. I guarantee anybody who buys this album will like at least 9 out of the 11 tracks. The best is definetely Smooth Criminal. This is one album that anybody who gives it a chance will definetely like. Michael could not have had a better follow up album to Thriller than this, it is a perfect transition to get to his new and even better album Dangerous. Michael believes that you get better not worst and he has surely gotten better everytime. HIStory was the best and then Dangerous, Bad, Thriller, and then Off the wall. I didn't count Blood on the Dance floor because it is not a complete album, but still a good album. If Michael ever reads this I want him to know that America still loves him and he needs to tour here once again I promise he will sell out anywhere he goes! Trust me Michael!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good album!","review":"I never bought the original back in 1987, as I just became now a fan of MJ, and was just recently introduced to all his music. I bought all his re-released remastered albums (Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous) and bought his new album, Invicible, and all his new singles. This album, BAD, is really the best to be able to dance to. It is just sooooooooooo good, I can't explain it. Every track just makes puts me in the \\"chase a girl\\" or \\"come with me, or get out of my way\\" mood, you have no idea. Michael Jackson is truly a work of art.

There are no weak songs, so it's no wonder Michael got 7 number 1 songs from this album. Most songs are upbeat, but there are Speed Demon and Dirty Diana (My favorite song) which are rock/pop songs. Man In The Mirror and I Can't Stop Loving You are sweet soft ballads. Just Good Friend got the best 2 vocalests in history, a duet Michael with Stevie Wonder. and I must say they're great together.

The characters in her series continue to develop and grow together and sometimes apart. I have to say that I sometimes am displeased at Robin Miller's reluctance to make a committment to anyone, but, hey... that's her character. In book 4 of the series, I was shocked that she and K.T. actually broke up.... I was extremely pleased to see that K.T. was back (though not completely) in book 5.

The opening track (Safety in Numbers, live w/ harmonica!) transists perfectly into Victim of Love; you have to hear it to believe it. And the remix of Soldiers Return; really fun sound effects make every second enjoyable. Andy sounds like a little boy when he sings. The Victim of Love remix brings out some great guitar chords.

This compressor says 125 psi max but the most I could ever get it up to was 90. At that psi, its not enough to break loose any stuborn bolts. I'd say it would only break loose something tightened to maybe 50 ft lbs at best. Thought it would be good for breaking loose or tightening lug nuts for wheels. That requires roughly 100 ft lbs torque but this compressor is way under powered for that. It's a noisy and wimpy compressor.

The latter is a great ballad with a swooping chorus and moving lyrics delivered by LeAnn's great voice, sounding better than ever. The rest of the album is a collection of uptempo songs and ballads. LeAnn has an amazing voice and has proved throughout her career she can handle any type of music.

First of all, this is probably not one for beginners. Mike and his team of 2 incredibly fit looking women take you through your paces for an intense whole body workout. There is an emphasis on functional movements and compound exercises where you utilize many muscle groups all at once. This adds up to a super burn. Mike very nicely demonstrates each movement before you get into it- this helps because many of the exercises have multiple phases. More attention could have been paid to describing good form but Mike does do a fair job of this. The DVD production is good with a bright studio and good cueing between exercises.

The way the movie deals with mental illness is innovative and should be looked to as a great example. Highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies of all time.","review":"This beautiful, delicate, simple story of growth, the mystery of love, friendship, acceptance, amoung other things is spun into an amazing tale that will keep you interested from the first moment until the closing credits.Lars lives in a small town in the guest house on his brother's property. He's a reclusive, sad sort of guy with no friends, no life, no love, until he meets Bionka... an adult sized realistic looking plastic doll. Not only does Bionka change Lars' life, but the life of the whole town. This story flows seamlessly, blossoms magnificently, being so well acted by Ryan Gosling. You can't help but fall in love with every character in this movie, covered in skin or plastic, and that's the moral at the end.If you like quirky, charming, life stories about not everyday people then you'll love Lars and the Real Girl. Because, she is in fact real, in the hearts of everyone around her, and that makes her as real as anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Effective","review":"I can't remember a film I was as reluctant to see as this one. Its trailers seemed particularly unpromising... a comedy about a man and his inflatable girlfriend? Ick.Obviously, I was wrong. First, the doll isn't inflatable. Second, the story is outrageously sweet and affecting. I should point out that at some stage in this movie, I made a choice to view the story as allegorical. Otherwise, the notion of an entire town \\"playing along\\" with one man's delusion was just too unrealistic.But by disconnecting my need for everything to make sense, I was rewarded with a funny, touching, and even brave film unlike anything I've ever seen before."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is this movie about?","review":"Well, I think that my answer would have to be compassion & tolerance. The main character is going through his own kind of private hell but he can't find a way to reach out to others to deal with it. So he reaches out to the perfect solution, hence the \\"Real Doll\\" part of the movie. The doctor in this movie who reminds me very much of Sir Ian McKellan's character in \\"Swept By The Sea\\" is really the only person who is able to deal with Lars & the whole town in a way that almost drives the entire movie. She's very much a big hero in this movie, not just a supporting member of the cast. This movie was a very unexpected pleasure to watch & achieves that through a fantastic ensemble cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for anyone who's ever been alone.","review":"If you've ever been alone, you can really sympathize with Lars.

No bad language, no sex, no violence. Only an amazing script with amazing acting.It was very sweet and tender, but also very funny.

But, in this day of overblown, overacted, star-studded, special effects extravaganzas, Lars and the Real Girl is truly a breath of fresh air. Perfecty cast and smartly written, it has quickly become a favorite movie in our household. My daughters (14 & 16), my husband and I were all captivated by the quirky characters and charming, albeit rather strange, story. I would give it 6 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart-warming","review":"Lars and the Real Girl is a heart-warming and insightful look at one man's struggle with reality and a community's willingness to bring him back from the edge. Quirky and unpredictable, this is an entertaining story that is portrayed effectively by the ensemble cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt and Charming","review":"This film is a little gem. You do have to suspend your disbelief at some of the characters' actions here, but the cast does an amazing job at drawing you in and keeping you there.

Stupid comparison joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow: Gosling is Great in this movie","review":"There will be those that will not watch this movie based on the bizarre plot in which Lars (played to perfection by the ultr-talented Ryan Gosling) orders a life-size doll to serve as his companion. It will be their loss. This is a great movie that is worth the purchase. The acting in the film is top-notch and you can't help but care about the characters. Even, believe it or not, Lars's girlfriend Bianca. Note: Bianca is the doll. This is a dramedy with some poignant moments mixed in with some true belly laughs. A 5 star delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow... Not what I expected","review":"I had been meaning to see this film for a while, because I thought it would be odd and quirky and a laugh. And yes, it was all of these things. But I didn't realize it would make me tear up at a number of moments, and I certainly didn't realize that Gosling would be delivering one of the better dramatic roles of recent memory, with an absolutely endearing portrayal of a kind, sensitive, and out of balance man who struggles with his life of loss by finding comfort in a not-quite-person (and who of us haven't done that, in some small way?) This is a movie that I will be recommending to all of my thinking friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the realdoll enthusiast...otherwise, a good movie.","review":"Being a realdoll enthusiast I naturally expected to enjoy this movie, but I ended the film with mixed feelings. While it was touching and funny, especially in the beginning, I was turned off by the fact that Lars eventually buries the doll (a $5000 virgin doll, buried forever! he should have sold it on eBay!). But that's just my bias - I like dolls a LOT.If you think realdolls are awesome, this isn't your movie. BUT - if you find realdoll relationships creepy like most people, you'll identify with Lars and feel happy for him when he moves on with his life. This film has some hilariously awkward moments, but it is definitely not a comedy. The bulk of the humor and novelty is in the first half. As the movie progresses, takes a much more serious, psychological tone which, IMO, drags on a bit.Ryan Gosling's acting was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm ...","review":"The concept was good, the acting was certainly well above average, but the film lost momentum and failed to hold my interest about 1/2 way through. I tried to hang in there, but I eventually had to hit the STOP button on my remote control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but very real","review":"as I watched this I kept wondering \\"can this happen\\". In today's world we have man problems that face our society. Lars become delusional when he hits bottom and seems to disconnect from the world around him. He embraces this \\"doll\\" and becomes attached to her as if she were real. But when the real world comes knocking on his door his actions are very interesting. Throughout the movie you start to feel for Lars and pray that he gets through his situation. It's great to see how well the entire town comes together to help Lars overcome his struggle to find happiness. The ending was just perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky but in a good way","review":"The Bottom Line:An endearing independent movie that succeeds by takes a potentially absurd premise (a man not only falls in love with a sex doll, but believes it's an actual woman) and treating it with the utmost seriousness, Lars and the Real Girl is probably the best movie that could ever be made about a relationship between a man and a sex toy and certainly the most charming; if you want a date movie that's neither formulaic nor stupid, rent Lars and the Real Girl instead of some tripe like The Proposal.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"So entertaining!","review":"I purchased this movie for my good friend. I told her about it and she shares my sense of humor. This is a touching and humorous film. There is not one scene that plays falsely. Ryan Gosling is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"This lovely, sweet, and offbeat film tells the story of a neurotically shy young man who has a relationship with a silicone love doll -- and in the process, winds up re-joining the human race.Everyone in the film is splendid, including Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, and especially a de-glammed Kelli Garner (one of the sexy stews in the dopey Pan Am TV series) as the real girl of the title.If you like whimsical romantic comedies in the \\"Harold and Maude\\" vein, you will love this film. I notice that Amazon is offering a two-fer deal on \\"Lars\\" and \\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\", and that is an excellent combination. CSL is as sweet and funny as \\"Bridesmaids\\" and possibly even more so.I sure wish Hollywood made more films like this one instead of the mega-budget, mini-minded comic book spectacles that have sent intelligent audiences fleeing from the cinemas.\\"Lars\\" is the real deal, to be sure. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy Charmer","review":"This is a quirky funny movie that is in a class by itself.

If quirky for quirky's sake is your thing, then you'll like it","review":"This movie has a couple of \\"chuckle\\" moments, but as I watched it, I couldn't help but feel sad for the characters in this film.

At least a divorce lawyer will never bleed him dry!He got the black head first, and added more parts to complete the wife. The news story showed him feeding the mannequin a Snickers bar on the side of the road, and wiping the mannequin's mouth.I thought it would be interesting to watch this video after it was mentioned in the news story.Horrible jerky video and muffled audio. It's obvious that nobody at Amazon has ever used their video rental service to watch a movie on a PC.Maybe the actual DVD is better, but I'll never know.

A useful learning tool for students taking an abnormal psychology class that are learning how to diagnose certain psychological disorders. This movie is definitely meant for an older audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of Lars and the Real Girl","review":"The price on the DVD was very reasonable and the shipping costs were great. The problem is that the movie was breaking down in several places and i lost the audio and video due to the quality.

MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THAT TO GO AROUND.A man develops a RELATIONSHIP/ROMANCE with a BLOW UP DOLL and every one goes along with it--I MEAN EVERYONE. I guess there is potential for humor or tragedy or SOMETHING, but not the way this is played. This indy misses the mark, BIG TIME. I do not understand the many rave reviews.

It seemed too quirky and the title made me think dumb comedy. Well recently, it was recommended by a radio personality so I decided to rent it. Boy was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film! First of all I love Ryan Gosling, he played the part perfectly! This film has some funny parts, but mostly I was touched and actually teared up in many parts. I'm glad I finally got to see it and would recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you expect","review":"I remember years ago someone told me they saw the film and said they cried. I thought 'Ok, no big deal.' I'd seen it hear and there and meant to watch it. I also found the cover intriguing. I wanted to see it recently and so I actually purchased the DVD from Amazon. I don't buy DVD's. I never watch them again. I bought this one. The movie starts and I'm thinking it's gonna be kinda silly/quirky. Well it was, but it was oh so much more. I get why the person told me they cried, and you will too. That is, if you get the symbolism of what is going on. If not it will be a stupid quirky movie. If so it'll be so much more. This would be great for a psych class viewing and discussion.Ryan Gosling was the perfect person for the role, he's sort of boyish and yet has a handsome \\"man\\" presence which worked together perfectly.Anyway, I highly recommend it. This would also be a great present for someone who is a little different in some way or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD!","review":"I thought Alas was immediately likeable.

That is if you dig Idaho as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yearning for more...","review":"This cd left me yearning for more in a couple of respects. For one, there are only 9 songs on this cd. Second, and most importantly, what is here is a wonderful collection of sings that toe the line between being catchy, accessible pop, and songs that are simply much more ambitious and adventurous. It will take a couple of listens to get used to, but the aching lines of guitar feedback that drive several songs, the outstanding drumming and percussion, and the fleeting glimpses of sun-shiny melodies will prevail and win you over. Similar to bands like Low, Red House Painters, and Acetone. Looking forward to the next record..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I am fortunate in the fact that the CD alas did not introduce me to Idaho. I am fortunate because had this been my first sample of the band I would have not given them much, if any thought after it.

Her tone is clear, radiant and she exhibits warmth and stylistic versatility. The interpretation is really the main thing here. She communicates the subtleties of the poetry in these songs.Grieg is, of course, the best known, on an international scale, for his songs, and some of these are indeed familiar.Sibelius wrote over a 100 songs, but his reputation for symphonic works has overshadowed these songs...they are well worth our acquaintance.The other composers are unfamiliar to those outside the Nordic countries and again we are rewarded by becoming acquainted with them.This is a beautiful, exquisitely delivered compilation which is sure to please those who love the art song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Home Baker...","review":"I had this book on my wishlist for almost a year and received it for Christmas. I sat down on Christmas evening and eagerly paged through the book. What a disappointment. Most of the recipes did absolutely nothing for me. Most of the recipes were time consuming and tedious. Yes, it's nice to look at, but I want to taste, not look, and this book totally put me off to trying many of the recipes. I was very disappointed. If you want truly decadent chocolate desserts, I highly recommend Chocolate Desserts by Pierre Herme. These recipes were specifically written for the home kitchen and are truly inspiring and decadent. It doesn't get any better than Chocolate Desserts. Don't waste your time/money on this book unless you want showpieces rather than decadent desserts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Chocolate book by Tish Boyle worth having","review":"I've found that perfection is very subjective, when it comes to both chocolates and to books, and that for me, any book by Tish Boyle on chocolate is worth having and enjoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"I am a professional pastry chef and have bought the other two books put out by Chocolatier, which are useful, however this book while being good in the home is useless in the pro shop.

The religious right may have some political issues to deal with, but scripturally they're correct! This author is deceived and is deceiving others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE REISSUE!","review":"This first posthumous release is excellent. I don't know if Hendrix planned to have these songs together, but a great job was done making it sound like a cohesive offering. One could be fooled into thinking the album was finished prior to his death. I know the songs were put out on 'New Rays Of The Rising Sun' but to me this is tighter. 'Freedom', 'Angel', 'Drifting' are all great. 'Straight Ahead' jams. Basically, it's all good. Get it if you can. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another underrated Hendrix album...","review":"This album is worth purchasing just for \\"Angel\\", let alone other stellar tracks like \\"Drifting\\" and \\"My Friend\\".\\"Angel\\" is simply the most beautiful song I've ever heard..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe this CD is out of print !!!","review":"This is an endeavor where Jimi used the electronics of his Electric Ladyland studio to his best advantage. It is his rock work with some humour and upbeat offerings. Instead of being his normal otherworldly self, cuts like \\"My Friend\\" and \\"Belly Button Window\\" show Hendrix as he really was. A class A musician (perhaps the best rock guitar player of all time) and a person who could see both the seriousness of the failings of our time and the humour in that seriousness. \\"In From The Storm\\" has to be listened to several times to hear the elegance of the studio effect. Plus Emaretta Marks (of the original Hair musical cast) adds soaring vocals. I recommend it to any TRUE Hendrix fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hendrix Album Ever . . .","review":"This is my all time favorite Hendrix album. It was released after he died, but it captures Jimi's music at the peak of his talent and creativity. The etherial image of Jimi on the CD cover really fits with the music. This album is a fitting tribute to the man who changed guitar playing forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and entertaining at the same time!","review":"This was my first WAR DVD purchase. As an aviation enthusiast and flight simmer, the presentation was really wonderful. I appreciated the aircraft walk-around prior to cockpit preparation. The cockpit procedures and checklist were easy to understand (despite their accents). Another great feature was the inflight meal preparation which was meticulously done by an inflight chef. When the crew encountered a fuel imbalance during cruise, I paused the video and thought of the possible solution. I'm glad that it was right! This DVD is a truly recommended material. A great way to start my WAR collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Power Pop Effort","review":"It's hard to tell from the disc's opening track but by a couple of tunes in, Psychotic Youth are starting to tip their hand. By track five, a dandy cover of Cheap Trick's \\"Surrender\\", there is no doubt, this album is about power pop. It's mostly outstanding too. Okay, punk rock figures in the mix as well but it's those relentless hooks that'll bring you back to this time and again. Band originals, like \\"Girls Out of Reach\\" recall that late seventies sound. Without a ballad in sight, this makes the perfect disc to blast in the car and just in time for summer! Wow, I wish there were more bands like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product, but...","review":"This is a second one for our winter home. The \\"Sport\\" seems much sturdier then the #2 model. Did take a while to assemble. Disappointed that they can not design one that folds up.

I purchased another pair (olive colored) and am very pleased (again!). I think the shoe size runs a little small, so on the second pair I got them 1/2 size larger so I could wear thicker socks with them.

The leaf and line cutouts are both functional and aesthetically pleasing, and the dulcimer resonates beautifully. You can hear the sound reasonate for several seconds after you have stopped playing. It is essential to use a pick, though; the sound is flat and sounds rather quiet if you pluck the strings with your fingers. Thus my 4 star rating.

This dulcimer is a great buy for all dulcimer players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap looking...shockingly cheap looking.","review":"This dulcimer came with one very positive customer review about its wonderful sound quality.

I really hope Amazon starts to carry it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animated title sequence/American version of Release","review":"The animated title sequence was added to the film by the American distributors/producers (Martin Ransohoff). That is probably why it is not on the dvd edition, being it is the directors' cut. There were various other items that the American producers did to the film, including speeding up some sequences to look like \\"Keystone Cops\\" segments and dubbing the original voices with different dialog lines, because at the time, the studio didn't know what to make of a comic horror film and how to market it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klichés Exaggerated To Pure Fun","review":"The Fearless Vampire Killers Or Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Neck is simply the best vampire film AND the best horror comedy made so far.The fact that it's made in the 1960s does not matter in this case - in contrary. Polanski has taken every fantasy we have about vampires - surroundings, landscape, castle, characters - and exaggerated these stereotypes into a such extent that it becomes pure fun. A parody with an unbeatable humour! And one of the very rare films which succeeds in combining comedy with horror and thereby making both genres better!Highly recommendable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"A great classic, but apparently it is very difficult to pass Blu Ray, but still without elaborating the movie is fine, pass it to dvd is to give longer life, some scenes really move from whether to laugh or be scared , stop me is wonderful to have it in my collection prune,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad spoof","review":"This film was a great spoof, with pretty good performances by Jack McGowran and Roman Polanski, and a very good music score that really pulls you into the mood of the piece. I had previously seen a shorter edited version which was confusing and not well paced, so it's refreshing to see the movie in a longer form and more complete. This movie has to have one of the all-time funniest gay vampires. A must-see just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creature Features","review":"As a young man of 9 or 10 years old there was a TV show that came on Saturday nights at 11:30pm called Creature Features. I would sneak out of bed and go into the living room and watch the old horror classics. The night that this movie came on was one of my best experiences of my childhood. I had never been truly scared by a movie up until that point, but something about this movie got to me that night and it has been my favorite vampire movie every since. Polanski, while I find him personally vile, made a masterpiece of film that has remained largely unknown by most horror fans. It is well worth the money to add this flick to you collection. Especially if the old school Scifi/Horror movies makes you want to stay up late with the lights off and some fresh popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Longer Afeared!","review":"Polanski showcases himself and his wife, the late beautiful Sharon Tate in this quirky yet horrific vampire movie. Of the 60's period, costumes, hairstyles, etc., lend themselves to the whole of a quite original storyline for the time!Who doesn't love the 60's? In a true deliberate style signatured to Polanski, we follow the trials of an innocent yet determined and committed student of a professional slayer that find themselves in the midst of a village dominated by a nearby lair. Rejoice, revel, review the 1960's in this most original never duplicated Vampire movie. Sharon Tate, immortalized in \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" but elevated to Goddess in this role!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"This is a good movie for that type of genre. I bought this for a movie fan and she really liked it. I'd seen it before and it is kind of funny! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best spoof vampire movie ever","review":"This is a classic hillarious movie full of snappy one liners Hunchbacks ,...Vampires and not to mention the late Sharon Tate. If you liked Dracula dead and lving it you'll love this. Great performnces from Roman Polanski, Sharron Tate and Just about all the rest of the cast.To top it off it also has an incredibly creepy soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Laughably awful... though, I suppose a success on some level. Purchased for my father, who got a kick out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not spooky, not funny, not sexy","review":"There's a reason Polanski is not known as a comedy director. I dont know.

The movie has a few laughable moments; however, overall it is not funny. I wish I had not wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, horrible cover.","review":"Finally, Polañski's masterpiece gets a decent DVD release (the only previous one, from Brazil, suffered from horrendous quality), with a good transfer but, alas, practically no extras (primarily a short documentary, \\"Vampires 101\\"). Based on the information released so far, I only have two complaints - firstly, the imbecilic cover (this awful doodle looks like \\"Le Petit Nicolas\\" rather than \\"Fearless Vampire Killers\\"), and secondly, the apparent lack of the maligned animated introduction, made for the butchered cinematic release in USA. Yes, the introduction was horrible, but it should have been included as a bizarre curiosity (its lack is even more inexplicable considering that the Brazilian DVD *had* it as a bonus feature). Still, even if this disc is very poor in extra features, it should at least look nicely, if the Warners' promise of a restored transfer is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Class Entertainment","review":"I first watched this film on the television at Christmas in about 1982 (under the title \\"Dance Of The Vampires\\"), and even then, as a 12 year-old, was impressed by this superior vampire 'caper'. The film starts with a beautifully haunting score (by the late Christopher Komeda) and the arrival of a pair of intrepid vampire killers to a Transylvanian Inn. Throughout the film, the viewer is treated to a visual and musical feast, enhanced by brilliant acting from the likes of Ferdy Mayne, Jack MacGowran, Alfie Bass, and of course, Iain Quarrier as the token gay vampire! The enchanting qualities of Sharon Tate as the inn-keeper's young daughter, Sara, add to the overall enjoyment of the film; which, in my opinion, is easily the best vampire and/or Polanski movie to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fangs\\" for Nothing","review":"Caveat emptor. The tip-off that you get what you pay for is when the director has a starring role. I fear that this is Roman Polanski's finest work and he, his Fearless Vampire Killers, and its subject matter share one thing in common -- they all suck.This film is so bad it's not even cliched, yet those who have a taste for heavily endowed women in Edwardian attire will not wag their tongues as I do. Twelve year old boys...pull up a chair. The Fearless Vampire Killers is potentially the crudest film one might stumble into. In fact, it may actually require the inability to walk erect to be amused by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning . . .","review":"I'm stunned, STUNNED, at all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this film. Watching it, I found it to be beautiful and atmospheric in its sets and cinematography. It is a shame it wasn't a full on horror film, ala Hammer Films. The two younger women in the film are nice to look at, Sharon Tate especially. However, this film is supposed to be a comedy, and it is painfully unfunny. One mild chuckle at best, and now I am hard pressed to remember what that was for. Looking for some reassurance of my opinion, and finding little here, I read Roger Ebert's original 1968 review for the film at www.rogerebert.com. The review is funnier than the film, and it's not one of Ebert's funnier reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"No plot, no acting skills displayed (except bad ones), poor music, poor photography, and an overall worthless movie from start to finish.This movie is billed as a comedy but fails in every aspect of movie making. It is not funny. The plot is non existant, and the music and photography are not just bad, they are awful. The viewer cannot tell night from day, and the story line doesn't help one decide if it is night or day. The acting is so bad that it makes a cartoon look good. The sound is also bad and the dialog is almost impossible to follow.One star is too much for this movie. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't know...","review":"I started getting interested by vampires with this movie. I saw it for the first time at age 8 in 1982. It made me laugh a lot, and the overall texture of the set, lighting, music, cast and script, creates tension, even though the movie is meant to be funny. My parents presented it to me as a comedy, but when they first saw it, back in 67, my mother got scared! Let's just say that she doesn't know much about vampires..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique and Memorable Film","review":"To all of those reviewers who disliked this film, think it isn't funny, and doesn't include any memorable quotes:OY!

I saw it several years ago at the Starlite Drive In located in Priceton, In. It was a refreshing different view! If you enjoy comedy and vampire flicks and if you don't mind the other themes in this film then i think you will like it. Bumbling vampire killers, lookout!! While Bela would have put the bite to your neck, thse might have bit you somewhere else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic 60's Horror/Comedy","review":"A great horror/comedy with everything from a gay vampire who only bites men to a Jewish vampire who's not repelled by a cross. I saw the USA cut-up version in 1969. The unedited version now available on video is MUCH better. The storeyline (a bumbling professor and his bumbling assistant out to destroy a colony of vampires) flows much better without the edits. BTW, I'm VERY Squimish. This movie has no graphic violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining mix of vampire horror and humor","review":"In my opinion, this is on of Polanski's best movies. He and Jack MacGowran work well together as a team. The movie starts off with the pair traveling to a small village that, they quickly find out, is plagued with vampires. They must rescue the inkeeper's daughter from the evil Count and his, shall we say, gay son who has taken a liking to Alfred. Can they outsmart the vampires long enough to escape immortality? Buy it and see. A very entertaining movie throughout with a surprise ending, this movie is a sure bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"LE BAL DES VAMPIRES","review":"J'ai vu ce film dans les années 70 et je dois dire que pour moi c'est un classique des meilleurs films du genre.

It thrills me from the lavishly odd musical intro to the quirky period picturesque feel to the film. I feel like I am IN Transylvania. The film achieves the look of \\"old.\\" The professor is wonderfully kooky and watching young Roman Polanski is a delight. I did not realize that his wife, Sharon Tate, was so beautiful. I don't know that I have ever seen her in anything else. There is plenty of humor in the film. I wasn't so thrilled with the one vampire being gay, but it was not pervasive to the film and I saw the humor in the situation. If you are looking for a gory, scary vampire film...do not bother...this film is more about the period, the place, the charm of a fun caper gone awry. In our house it is the only vampire movie we drag out every now and again to enjoy. Thanks Roman and Sharon!

It is not. It routinely pours water out of the steam holes essentially drenching the clothes and ironing board. The iron with shut off mid use and the only way to turn it back on is to unplug it for several seconds and replug it in. The steam settings seam to have no effect on the amount of steam (or water) it expels and the you are required to go over wrinkles multiple times to get them out. I also bought a Euro-Pro Shark vaccuum that has had nothing but problems. I cannot recommend this iron nor any products by them. I ended up pitching this iron (after only 3 months) and bought a Black and Decker instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful iron","review":"I am not sure if this is the exact model I bought a little over a year ago, but the model I have looks very similar. What an awful excuse for an iron. Water floods out of all the crevises (where it is not supposed to come out), even when set at dry ironing. I totally quit using steam and just spray my clothes with a water bottle to steam them. I would advise staying AWAY from this iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHARK IRONS - WATCH OUT!!

When the first one broke, I didn't complain - just ran out to the store and bought a new one, which incidentally happened to be another Shark. Now this second one is suddenly not working, even though I have cared for it very carefully. I called customer service to see how they could help me... and get this ... they want me to not only pay to ship it back, but also to pay to repair it. OUCH! I have never, ever, ever experienced a combination of such shoddy products and poor customer service in my life. Watch out for Shark irons - they are pure junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"My experience is the same. I bought this iron on sale at Macy's and it has never worked correctly.

Just yesterday I replaced it with a less expensive Sunbeam brand. What a waste of money, not to mention the aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Leaky Iron","review":"This is an awful iron.

I expected more judging from alot of the other reviews. I felt that he did not give good explanations. I really felt lost quite a bit. I was able to figure out the math by teaching myself, because I've always gotten straight A's in math. Some of his formulas were overcomplicated. I was able to rewrite some of them simpler. I feel that this is definitely not a \\"For Dummies\\" type of book. If it's truly for a beginner, it should be explained in a way that a child would be able to understand it. And I know it's not just me, because I'm a very bright woman and graduated from college with honors. But he really had me confused with the math, the fundamental analysis, and the graphs were very confusing. This was the first book I read on Forex and the first time really learning anything at all about it but I would not recommend this for a true beginner.

Here, on one disc, are the songs that put this legendary artist on the map. Guerra's magic stems from his ability - unique in today's predictable Latin sound - to combine thoughtful lyrics with melodies that remain in the mind and in the heart. From his paean to love, \\"Burbujas de Amor\\" (a love song between two fish - no kidding) to the overwhelming \\"Ojala Que Llueva Cafe en el Campo\\" to \\"La Billirubina\\" Guerra proves why he's Latin Music's equivalent of Frank Sinatra. A vocal stylist who is peerless, the man can sing his heart out with dizzying effect. \\"Grandes Exitos\\" is certainly a terrific addition to ANY music lover's collection. Even if you can't understand the words, you'll be dancing in the aisles. Pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"I am a person of zero Hispanic heritage who was given this album by a friend. All I can say is I wish I could find more music like this.

I couldn't of compiled it better myself. If you are familiar with and like Juan Luis' music and are looking to have some of his best on one cd this one would satisfy your requirements. I like most of the songs on the album although there are some that are not good as the others. The big hits on this album that seem to always hold strong are: La Bilirrubina, Burbujas de amor, Ojala que llueva cafe, El costo de la vida & Bachata Rosa. However, popularity varies from region to region. But I must say this album has power because in every Latin country that I have visited in the past and present somehow from a store, a car or a house I would hear this album playing and could imagine the joy that it brings to its listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Grande!","review":"I am a forty-eight year old white Anglo-Saxon female who decided to take dance lessons and immediately fell in love with Latin music.

Also herein are five live songs, which are also on the Spit In Your Eye home vid ( a must have also!). These gals really tear it up live ( Ive seen them once, and Im begging them to return again), as these tracks show you. Mercedes is amazing on her kit as always, and the rest of this equally talented band continues to shine. My only complaint is the length of 19 mins, but hell, its Kittie, I can live with it. Keep an eye out for their new album, rumored to be due out sometime this spring. Its expected to be a lot more complex vocally and riff wise, so its definitely gonna be another winner.

The Paperdoll remix is the best song on this EP, but over all the only song that I like on this (live, anyway) is Do You Think I'm a Whore.So all in all, if you must have this, I recommend downloading it or buying it very cheap used.Please keep in mind, I'm a huge fan of Kittie and I love all their albums to death, but this particular EP I didn't like.

The interesting prose and slathered-thick symbolism livened up this tale of a man who is DETERMINED to have everything.

There is Dame Lettie Colson who is pestered - but perhaps it is an illusion - by anonymous telephone calls with a voice saying only \\"Remember you must die\\", her brother Godfrey and his wife Charmian who live in a sort of ménage à trois. Their life doesn't get easier as they advance in age: senility and physical decrepitude are handicaps they try to live with, sometimes conscious of them but not always.Then there are the twelve female occupants of the Maud Long Medical Ward, a nursing home, who spend their time gossiping about petty scandals, mostly about wills being rewritten in the favour of another person for some trivial behavioural reason.The plot is both funny and macabre because all the characters are mean, jealous, curious, witty or confused, probably as they used to be all their life.

His God-given gift for drawing these illustrations is similiar to those of Clarence Larkin, author of \\"The Greatest Book on Dispensational Truth in the World\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush job?","review":"This novel is the epitome of \\"so-so\\". It's ok. I've read it once and I'm ready to pass it on. Plot development is thin. Character development is thin. This is the equivalent of a writing assgignment being written the night before. Only rap songs have more grammatical errors than this book. I can't sell mine as new because punctuation and grammar errors are marked with yellow highlighter on practically every page!Romantica (not a spelling error) scenes are unfounded. For all their emoting, the main characters barely know each other and what they find out about each other mostly comes from alternative sources and not each other. But at the end of the day, one doesn't really buy a book like this for its literary pretentions. For the money, there are much better books than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent CD","review":"This is a collection of 18th century music for a sadly forgotten instrument.The English Guittar was a wire strung instrument related to the Portuguese Fado guitar. The tone is bright and shimmering, and Rob MacKillop brings out the subtlety and resonance of the instrument.His light and sure touch brings out the lively lilt of the pieces. The music ranges from brisk and playful to gently serene.If you're a fan of Bach and Sanz, this CD can be highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think","review":"This book is a strange work of graphic comic fiction. It is aimed at a mature audience, I hope. I would place it in the genre of Adult Swim if it were on Cartoon Network. I first read this book as a young child. It was strange and dark and weird. It may have helped develop my sense of adult humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is beautiful.","review":"Having met the author and experienced her loving heart, I discovered reading her work opened her loving heart to me, and enabled me to experience the humor, pathos, and everyday life of a remarkable community. I had to buy the book to share my experience with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Ant Movie Lover","review":"I'm an Adam Ant lover and this was one of the many films he did that I just had to own. I was quite suprised when I received it as there were several actors in it that I knew of. I can't say I'm a fan of Grace Jones, but I was suprised at the acting abilities of Robert Hayes. Most people will remember him for the idiot he played in Airplane, constantly spilling his drinks on himself. Perhaps he was unjustly typecast as this role helped bring out his acting abilites. The plot line of this movie is good and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see how it ends up. This is just one of those sleeper hits that probably didn't get good reviews or advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful fiction. Move on, people...","review":"There was a time Freud was considered an genius; we now know that his theories were grossly inaccurate. There was also times when humans thought the earth was flat, and witches were burned at the stake.Likewise, there was a time that psychologists believed that autistic children were victims of cold, unloving mothers. And, as with Freud's theories, that belief is now known to be false.This book, as a work of behavioral science, is outdated flat-out wrong. Perhaps as a work of escapist ficiton, it is worth a read. But don't kid yourself, Dibs was autistic, and anybody believing this is an effective therapy for autistic children obviously know nothing about the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"comments","review":"I am not use to watch movies because I have many other assignments which never permit me to watch movies. But I think above comments are very good and give real view of the moive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Parents have so many different expectations of what they want their children to be. Dibs is a real eye-opener if you are able to just be present with the child. A must read for anyone who works with children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary 50 years later","review":"As a child of a radiologist and OR nurse who \\"lost his way,\\" I related to this young boy of a professor and surgeon who was almost sent to a home for the mentally unstable but instead found strength within himself at six years old through play therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"This classic work is one of the most inspiring I know. It shows how the human spirit can heal and flourish through a self empowerment obtained by accepting reality, not denying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you will remember","review":"As a bookworm growing up, I pretty much read everything I could get my hands on, including all my mother's college textbooks and required reading. My mother went to college to become a nurse when I was in elementary school and this is one of the books that made it's way home with her. Since I had already been reading her child psychology textbooks, she gave me this to read. I fell in love with the book and I've read it at least one hundred times since then. I never tire of it. The true story of this amazing and misunderstood little boy will touch your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A positive book to read if honesty seems too hard.","review":"I read this book as I was starting Therapy. Dibs is a true story that helped me to accept a very difficult childhood.Easy to read and filled with memories/feelings that I had tried to avoid for years. Very positive and very little about blame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dibs in search of Self","review":"I think dibs is a very good book. When i first started the book I thought it would be a very boring book. Virginia M. Axline did a very good job writing something that would normally be extremely boring into something that is very interesting and fun to read. The back of the book gives a good summary. Overall this book is 4.5 stars. After the about the second chapter I couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book still in print?","review":"Yet another book trying to blame autistic behaviour on cold, intellectual mothers. Axline spends an entire book telling us how nurturing and warm she herself is, but the book is narrow-minded, prejudiced and cruel. This sort of stuff should have been left behind in the 50s"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking and endearing books I have ever read. In fact, I have re-read it 3 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good educational material","review":"this story is educational in nature but as you read along, you will be moved and touched by the story of this child. Very good reading material"},{"rating":"1","title":"Men shoe from Lady Footlocker???","review":"I ordered these cleats thinking maybe Lady Footlocker sold mens cleats, not the case.
