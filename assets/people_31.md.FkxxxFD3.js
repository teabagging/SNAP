And what an undertaking it was. It's been a long time since I had to actually work myself to get to the end of a chapter. While I held out as long as could, wading through endless trite observations and self-congratulatory manic-depressive episodes, the fact is these characters have no substance whatsoever. I'm sure his fans will contend that is exactly the point of the novel, but I'd rather learn that lesson from a read with an actual story. This novel was one meandering paragraph after another. I couldn't shake the overwhelming feeling that I was witnessing a bad reading from an old college writing class. It's the non-violent, deficient love-child of \\"On The Road\\" and \\"American Psycho\\". In the simplest terms, this is an extremely boring read.

What a disappointment; still can't believe it. The Light is gone from the characters AND the plot line. Sad day when McMurty defaults to the tired theme of old, depresssed, lazy man meets young educated hard-working beautiful woman (and a VIRGIN no less!) who serves the old fart devotedly while he offers little (nothing) in return. Sorry state when a famous and well-loved author defaults to word for word description of a porn video to fill up pages under the guise that the old fart is educating the accomplished young thing who has a sex hang up. Don't waste your time or your money on this.... unless you're an old man who needs to keep the myth alive in his own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survivor Duane","review":"What a great book! Just when you think McMurtry can't pull anything out of his bag of tricks, here comes a slim wonderful volume about starrin Duane Moore. McMurtry presents Moore with a new dilemma, told with his signature sympathy and compassion that makes him one of our best storytellers writing today. Many contemporary writers can take lessons from McMurtry on sheer storytelling genius.The only flaw in this story was the detailed sex sequences, though at the same time you get a character that is reacting to the current influence of telling everyone way too many details about their private lives.Long live Duane and long live the writing genius of McMurtry. McMurtry is one of our national treasures, pure storytelling bliss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so old-guy porn fantasy","review":"I am roughly Duane's age in the book, and after hearing a brief description, I was looking forward to a story of re-awakening and perhaps passion for an old guy like me. Instead, I believe this is something McMurtry dashed off in an afternoon after waking up horny after a nap. There is barely a realistic character or situation in this very slim book. The sex scenes with his very unlikely partners seem right out of the trashy porno paperbacks that we secretly passed around as teenage boys so many decades ago. The non-sex events are usually described in a very detached way, leaving you to wonder if it was supposed to be humorous or existential, then you realize he just wanted to tick off the plot points quickly to get to the next (often curiously detached) sex scene. A great disappointment--despite McMurtry's great talents, I can't think of anything to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't encourage him","review":"Larry McMurtry can turn out wonderfully written compelling fiction.

However, the relationship between Duane and Anne is just silly, as is much of their dialogue. The graphic sexual descriptions are really all this book has going for it. They are unnecessary to the story and frankly grossed me out a little. I wonder if McMurtry knows that most women don't have orgasms from intercourse alone....could be a big part of his (or Duane's) problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"A token afterthought","review":"This book read like a cheap afterthought. The sexual scenes were a put off and felt as if they were stuck in the book to spice up a dismal effort. Thank goodness the book is short. The Last Picture Show was great, Texasville was not great but good and the rest of the Duane saga sputters out. This book was not what I expect of a writer of McMurtry's caliber.

The most disappointing part about the soundtrack, however, was its omission of the most important song in the movie. \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" was featured prominently in the film and performed by the actual cast. Imelda Staunton sings the lead, and Hugh Laurie plays the piano. Both are talented artists, yet this song was omitted from the soundtrack.

The 1980's pop songs that actually are on the soundtrack are readily available elsewhere and are really just background music which sets the tone and establishes the time-frame of the movie.

It touches on strength training and the brief nutrion chapter, which basically says, if you eat garbage (empty calories) insteady of health food (fruits and vegetables) is better than a lot of popular nutrition books I've read.

If you decide to purchase this, it should be noted that the only way you will get the perfect picture (as shown in the store) is to have an HD signal. We currently have a standard satellite package, so the picture is a little pixelated and fuzzy. We are in the process of upgrading our satellite package to an HD tuner and will purchase the necessary HD cabling to go along with it. I'll report back on this product as soon as it is installed.Also, if you buy the HD cabling at Best Buy, they want about $80 for the cable.

I do not like shoes where you can't feel a grip on the ground and with these you don't. And last but not least, the upper front part of the boot where the wooley lining is sticks out at a point and looks too damn ridiculous.

I'm returning them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boots are comfortable and very warm","review":"These are very warm boots. And they are not slippery. I have a back injury and wanted something to keep me stable on my feet in the winter months. These worked fine walking across a large parking lot with many ice patches going to and from work, shoveling snow, and even cute enough to go shopping, although they did get warm. I have the hardest time finding boots/shoes that are comfortable (foot problems from years of standing on my feet at work) and these were quite comfortable.

One of the reviews I read mentioned a problem with the zip. I can't agree. Admittedly a diagonal zip is unusual,but as long as you're aware of that and adjust your pulling-up grip, you'll soon get the hang of it. I found that they live up to their description: They keep you cosy and provide the grip you need, which of course also depends on how fit and physically balanced you are.

I was amazed by the vivid imagery and word choice in his writings, and the story line didn't follow the typical pulp-fiction romances that are so prevalent. This story leaves lots of wonderful comments on relationships, and what is really important in life and dealing with adversity. My only complaint is the story was difficult for me to get caught up in at first (but that's probably just the \\"feely-phobia-guy\\" in me coming out) but after a certain plot twist I couldn't put the book down.

I finished it in a couple days with the last 4 straight hours reading it through the end. I really like the way the story goes and how each character is woven into each other. It's a love story, but not the type that made you sick in the stomach. Instead it touches my heart. A few times it brought tears to my eyes. Very touching.

Everbody has the equivalent in an old spiral notebook from 7th grade stashed in a closet. If Culkin wasn't Culkin it never would have escaped. Its not enlightening, its not compelling, there's nothing here that's fresh or inspiring. Its just a guy working out his emotional \\"issues\\" (like most have) with clumsy bad awkward pretentious writing (again, like most have)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a mess","review":"Apart from two passages where he seems to seriously write about his family/father situation, this book was a ridiculous mess. It would have served Mr. Culkin better had he taken himself seriously and wrote a memoir, because it does seem he can write well, from the couple of \\"real\\" parts of the book that remember moments from his life and address his father. Additionally, the references to being \\"Monkey Monkey Boy\\" were quite depressing, and conveyed well.

The book contains profound instructions for developing clarity within the sleep and dream states.The relevance of these teachings is that they allow us to practice even while sleeping and dreaming, because these states make up almost one-third of our lives. Moreover, it is said that if a person applies a practice within a dream, the practice is nine times more effective than when it is applied during the waking hours. Dream practice is very important for liberating us from habits.\\"When the state of dreaming has dawned,do not lie in ignorance like a corpse.Enter the natural sphere of unwavering attentiveness.Recognize your dreams and transform illusion into luminosity.Do not sleep like an animal.Do the practice which mixes sleep and reality.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformation and Liberation through Dream","review":"Tibetan yoga seeks clarity and continuity of consciousness in waking, sleeping, dreaming, imagination, memory and the thousands of sentient experiences that we call mind from our first to last breath and beyond.

I'm a travel writer myself so I know that miserable experiences often make for the best writing afterwards. 'It'll make good copy' is something writers tell each other when things are tough.

Big deal. But it works, it sticks to the wall, it's loud enough to hear over the shower and the ceiling exhaust fan, and it took 10 years for the battery section to corrode.

The battery life is good, but it's not worth the aggravation trying to figure out what you're listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying thing...","review":"I thought this would be just the perfect size for a radio in my bathroom. It is. However, the FM tuner on the radio automatically resets to 88.1 FM EVERY time you turn it off. It won't retain your usual station, and start there when you turn it back on. And since there is a button to scan to the next available radio station (instead of an old fashioned tuner-dial), you might need to press it 10 times or more each morning to get to your preferred station. It's really quite annoying, and I end up listening to NPR for traffic instead of my favorite station, which is much farther down the dial. I would not have bought this product if I knew that ahead of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I just bought this shower radio because I thought the price was good and all I needed it for was the clock and radio functions. Well what a mistake! I agree with the other reviewers that it is EXTREMELY ANNOYING to have to keep pressing the scan button in order to find the channel you usually listen to. What really upsets me is that you don't know if you have reached your usual channel since there isn't a dial for you to see what channel you're currently on. I have to listen to another radio in another room for me to know what is playing on my usual channel, and then run into the bathroom and try to find that channel on this radio before I jump in the shower. Whoever made this product is an idiot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Don't bother buying this item. I wish I would have read everyones reviews before we picked this up while shopping one weekend. After about 2 weeks, you can't tune past 92.5.

We hated it. It was packed away when we moved into our new home three or so years ago. I just found it last week. I just remembered that I hated it.This radio has horrible reception. I could get over that if you didn't have to push a button to go through the channels. It only sticks on channels it wants to (whether they are powerful enough or not) you can only go up through the dial and when you reach the end you have to press reset. When you do find a channel it will cut out for no reason in the middle of a song. Sometimes the channel comes back.On the plus sign it keeps good time. Clock still worked years later when I found it packed away the other day...I do NOT recommend this. Unless you are one that likes to use a computer without a monitor, rather with punch tape -- as that is what it is like going through the channels with those two buttons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ratings speak for themselves!

The radio does not come in well, and you can't even tell what stations you are tuning to - it just tunes from one to another with no display of what station you are on.

I bought one after seeing one in action at my aunt's house.I drink lots of tea,so you know it gets a lot of use. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm and has held up for years","review":"I've had this kettle for around four years now and everything is still working fine. The kettle boils water quickly and efficiently, and I've never had any problems with the auto-shutoff mechanism. The auto-shutoff takes longer to trigger if the lid is not closed completely, but as long as you operate the kettle according to specifications, you should have no problems.The cordless feature is especially welcome, allowing me to serve hot water anywhere in the house (or even outside, on nice spring afternoons!). I often brew multiple pots of tea, so it is nice to have a portable hot water source.The design is not particularly space-saving, but it maximizes exposed area for the heating element, allowing for fast boiling.I own one of these kettles and have bought the same model for family and friends, and would not hesitate to do so again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last much past warranty period","review":"I have had 4 of these now. I found it to boil water quite quickly. I also had the problem with one of them that the filter would fall out, but was able to pop it back in easily.The main issue is that only one has last beyond 2 years. Usage on the longer lasting one is probably 1-2 times per day, and on the ones that did not last, maybe a bit less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kettle with several design flaws","review":"Here are some design problems with this kettle:1: the buttons to open the lid are awkward to use, requiring a strange clawing motion.2: the \\"on\\" lamp is on the side away from you when you're using the kettle, so it's not visible.3: letting the lid fall down often doesn't close it completely, but even if it's just very slightly open the cut-off switch doesn't work and the water boils away till the pot is dry.4: being right at the bottom of the pot, the heater switch is easily turned on by accident if you bump something against the pot -- even a newspaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I agree with the previous review except my problem is that on the second time I used it boiling water poured out of the bottom all over my counters & onto the floor which potentially could have scalded my dogs or a child or even an adult had they been standing near the counter.

I called and wrote the company, and for the next two years, received a monthly postcard telling me that their scale filter was out of stock, but would be sent shortly. I guess they got busy building a space shuttle or something and didn't have quite enough time to ship off two meesly scale filters. After standing electric tea kettle watch, I'm now shopping for any other brand but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boils fast, but annoying to use","review":"This Melitta kettle holds lots of water and boils very fast. However, it's inconvenient to use. The lid has to be pinched just right on each side in order to be lifted. The on/off switch is below the handle and must be firmly pressed - the slightest jiggle will click it off. The light indicator to let you know when it's on is located on the opposite side of the pot from the handle, so you must think when you place the pot on the pad. If you don't turn the light so you can see it, you won't know when it's cut off, because there is no \\"Ding\\" to let you know. Big sigh. I had a Phillips kettle which worked great, except for the little problem it had with the kettle separating from the cap covering its electrical parts. So I got the Melitta to replace it. Now, I'm hunting again."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"After 5 weeks of use (we used it about 3 times a week) the pot quit working.

The screen over the spout falls in and without it properly in place the unit's sensor, that turns it off, does not work. This failure mode might be a safety issue.We previously had a Phillips that worked well. In fact I bought another to have one at work and one at home, but the new one, which was at home, succumbed to an electrical short, after water splashed into the bell holes near the switch. The next time I turned it on ... poof... and it worked no more. I did like the bell feature. The old Phillips, now at work, is still going strong. I am planning on ordering a Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so \\"express\\"","review":"I purchased this kettle for its speed in boiling water.

Incredibly the call person became irate and shouted at my mom and hung up on her! We ended up throwing the almost new kettle in the garbage.

This is really a nice product."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever","review":"This one of the worst electric teakettle I have used. Please people don't buy it if you don't want fire on your hands. First of all, you need quite enough might to close lid shut. You may think you closed it but in reality you don't, you have to push it down very hard. Second of all, the filter dislodges very easily. These two reasons are the main cause of automatic shut off function not to shut off at all. So you pour the water put the kettle on and off you go. And you know what- you may came back and notice that plastic kettle almost on a verge of melting because current wasn't shut down by shut off function since filter dislodged itself or lid wasn't really closed or both and it is boiling and boiling and boiling.

Honestly the first strip took the bulk of the hair out, then I had to apply it maybe 2-3 more times in small areas where the hair grew in a different direction, then pull again. It really didnt hurt bad at all. A couple of times it stung but went away in a few seconds. I had maybe 3-4 hairs left after all was done, so I plucked the last few. The oil relieves the sting immediately & keeps your armpits from feeling sticky.Great product! Looking forward to waxing bikini line & legs for summer! And not having to shave twice a day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Came posted to Australia in very quickly and postage was NOT overpriced.

The rest of the time has been spent attempting to make it work as it is advertised to. I've tried their silly suggested methods for starting it by flicking with your hand. Goodluck. The string method, a small red string wrapped around the inner ball mechanism and pulled quickly to generate rotation, works on occasion, but is nowhere near reliable and will result in you fiddling with the thing trying to make it work moreso than benefiting from it. If this is intended to relieve carpal tunnel symptoms when used properly, it would only exacerbate said problems while trying to make this thing work as it should. The few times I was able to operate this device as intended, the resistance offered was minimal and was better suited to very light therapy than any kind of muscle-work or toning.

I couple of complaints that I have about it are that it is very hard to get it going- it comes with a string that you have to loop through the ball in between the blue plastic in order to spin it to get it going- it takes several time to get it right each time you use it and once you get it going it is incredibly noisy! You cannot quietly do this exercise when you are waiting in line or watching TV- it is way too noisy.

No instructions came with the product. Just this gadget and a string to insert and pull to make the dumb thing rotate while you hold it in your hand with the injured wrist.

I did not even get a string with my gyro, so I had to improved and use some generic string. it works somewhat and I better rotation than the slow idiotic method shown of using the magic 'thumb' or the karate chop method. The store 'models' wont give me a refund since I opened the package and used it. So I am stuck with an ugly looking paperweight.

Starting with your thumb requires a very fast flick, and a good feel for the rotation to wind it up to speed from a low RPM.Videos of others starting the Dynaflex are mostly unhelpful or else they are advertisements, so the beginner is mostly on his/her own with the learning curve, and that may be best anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout and Fun","review":"It takes a little practice to get it right.

Getting it started is the hard part- it can take several hours to figure it out. The trick to getting it going is, to have it spinning pretty fast to begin with. It is almost impossible without using the red starting string they provide.I use it mostly as a toy while sitting behind the computer to exercise a little as well. It reminds me of the old gyroscopic toys that were popular in the seventies. After a few minutes of keeping it going you can feel some muscle fatigue- which is a sign of the exercising effect. Almost all of my friends were intrigued by the novelty effect! It makes a great ice breaker and conversation starter for newly arrived guests. Just spin it up and put it into their hands...

It's basically a gyroscope in the form of a ball. When you first use it, the spinning in the ball feels very fluid. However, after regular use, it feels and sounds like there's wear on the inside.

The torque isn't very strong, and the spinning doesn't last long enough. Back in the early 1970's, there was a toy top called the Whizzer which was nearly more effective than the Powerball. For one thing, it was easy to spin, by rolling it on a tile or concrete floor. Plus it did have torque. The Powerball requires a string to be wrapped around it and pulled, and in my opinion, you get more exercise pulling the string than using the Powerball! Anyway, my advice is to save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and not worth the time","review":"This was an impulse buy that I regret. After *HOURS* of trying, it is impossible to get this thing to work. If you are like me, you will start looking on the internet to try different tutorial videos, but flailing my arm around like an idiot in every manner (including the ways in any particular video) accomplishes nothing. The thing spins for 2 seconds and sputters out under all circumstances.Even if I did get it working, it isn't worth dedicating myself to mastering some mystical art of getting this random device started.

The string was useless and the effort it took to get it started as described in the instructions' alternate method (which I suceeded in doing only once) would have been impossible for my wife.

BUT instead of holding it with the yellow ball between your thumb and first finger,(as the instructions say) pull the string fast, after wrapping it very tightly in the crevice) then hold your hand over the green ball (like holding an apple)with the yellow ball facing the floor.Fingers clasped around the green ball move your hand back and forth in a circle. It will start to really spin and you will feel in all the way up your arm, mostly in your wrist.This worked for me, but if you want to hold the way instructions say, go ahead.I tried for 30 minutes the other way and could not get it started. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmm goodness.","review":"I used to work at a retail store where we had an off brand of one of these and we used to use it to pass the time on slow days.I ordered this one because I'd been having a little trouble with some wrist pain. It really helped a lot with the wrist pain and it was a pretty good work out if you do some of the exercises that they include.However, it can be very difficult to start. I was unsure about some of the issues the other reviewers had experienced and I will say the off brand one we had at the store was much easier to get going than this one. Your best bet is to just use the included pull string; while I did manage to get it started by hand once or twice the time and effort required are excessive (30min -1 hr)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Little Wrist Gyro","review":"The Dynaflex Gyro comes with the gryo and a string to help you start it off.

It is too easy to loose the rhythm and then you must restart it. For those that just want to concentrate on exercise this is too frustratingly complex.

Highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad Cover Art","review":"I would have given this book an additional star if it wasn't for the terrible art on the cover. I was embarrassed to read this novel in public. The marketing for this series really cheapens the writing. My friends laugh at me when I show them these books, then insist they are good. I would never buy such an ugly book in hardcover. Get with the times, TOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can It Possibly Get Worse?","review":"After slogging through the fourth book, I was wary of reading HEARTFIRE, the fifth book in the Alvin Maker series - but I bought the book and I was determined to finish it. If you consider reading this book, the Harlequin Romance-esque cover should be your first tip-off.This book starts with newlyweds Alvin and Peggy separated with no real explanation given, Peggy has gone south to try and stop the coming war caused by slavery, and Alvin finds himself on trial - AGAIN. Basically an anti-slavery rant, the characters talk incessantly and nothing happens. Too boring for words.There is another book after this one, can this series possibly get any worse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Acceleration is NOT the word for this product","review":"There's a point in almost any given fantasy series where it all grinds to a halt. The child prodigy grows up, characters accumulate, and the dialogue becomes about as interesting as oatmeal..that you ate yesterday. Orson Scott Card made his transition from an intriguing and thoughtful concept to Star-Trek movie camp in HEARTFIRE. But even while he resorts to tried and tired tricks--marriage, more characters--he manages to keep up the interest other his loyal readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is officially unsustainable at this point","review":"Wow, that went downhill quick. Alvin is no longer a vaguely interesting character in a well-drawn world, but a blatant Christ figure with nothing at all for the reader to relate to, a figure of such saccharine goodness that all obstacles just collapse at his approach. It's a shame Card felt it necessary to inflict this on people who enjoyed the first two books and put up with the next two.For good Christian allegory (if that's your cup of tea), get CS Lewis' Narnia books -- the story stands all by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible and I am a fan!","review":"Incomprehensible. I am an absolute fan of Orson Scott Card, anything he writes I will pick up to read. But this book stopped me cold. Based on the premise of the book, knack's that are almost magical, I should have loved it. But the quality of the prose plummeted in this book. I just didn't' get it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost sermonizing, struggles to contain the plot.","review":"Seems like we (and Alvin) think that Alvin is headed round the bend - he's so busy trying to be 'good' and keep sane, he's heading nowhere. We keep losing the thread of why he's wandering and have to be reminded occasionally of his aim. OK there were some nice touches in there, Audobon & Balzac especially, but I thought the trial was a bit too glib - I reckon that the pro-slavery contingent would have just taken over and had a hanging there & then in real life. But, if Alvin really is the second coming - I guess that makes it all OK. Enough of picky - the book is a good, flowing read, as most of the Alvin series are - Card is a master story-teller, dragging you into the soul of his characters, willing you to keep reading...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"episode\\" in a small book","review":"This little book is an exact reproduction of a chapter 5 in the original book, Winnie-the-Pooh by A.A.

By the way, if a bj on the first page is action, big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I read this book on a recommendation. I'm not a big fan of mysteries. The characters usually seem thin to me and the plots uninteresting or preposterous. But this one is solidly plotted and peopled with fascinating real-life characters.

Through examples he cites in his book, he very clearly shows us the meaning of free will and the consequences of our choices. We are given a better understanding of illness and healing.Through Toni's example, Sheridan points out that we all have gifts from God that we are to use, develop, and then give back by serving others. Through Spirit we receive guidance and help is always available.

O'Toole historicizes tragedy, presenting an accessible methodology for undergrads, taking them beyond purely formalistic analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning","review":"Nyman's best, as well as most original and most challenging piece.

When I attempted to re-attach by re-tightening the Phillips screw, the hole (in the rope itself) seemed stripped. A thin screw with narrow threads seems an inadequate attachment for what really is an easily compromised opening in a piece of rope--for once loosened, the attachment cannot be made secure again.

I recommend the Body Solid unit if your workoutsare heavy and frequent."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it does","review":"I like using rope because it increases my grip strength when doing any exercise. As a wrestler, I need my grip strength. For the Valeo product itself, it does what it does. You can probably find a better quality one but for money, but this is pretty bang for your buck. I've been doing different cable exercises with it and it does exactly what I expect it to do. I put it around a pull up bar and do rope pullups and after about i say a dozen times using it for pullups, its still in mint condition.PROS: Cheap, long lasting, does its job.CONS: The rope quality is kind of cheap so it might hurt certain hands.

What a disappointment. Not only is it horribly written, but it includes sections by several different writers, most of which repeat the same ignorant and negative prejudices spewed against Yoko for years. If you are looking for a well written, objective, intelligent, indepth biography of this intriquing woman, you will not find it here. Sad...Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I love The Beatles. Yoko's story is pretty interesting. The films she has made and how she has been living through John's death.

The book says it is a resource for nurses but it talks about how to insert a central catheter and calculating fluid/electrolyte/glucose rquirements which I will not use.

I was looking for something that starts out more basic and is easier to read. This book is more geared towards physicians or experienced nurses but not new grads starting out in the NICU like myself.

I wish there was a little more \\"direction\\" given with each monogloue, but I supposed some wouldn't want to be restricted too much. The comedic monologues are ok, about on par with what you find in most books.

Before buying this book (or even investing your time in reading it), I highly recommend that you go back and read the full text of the Times review.

I ploughed along through it because I wanted to see how it ended, but the writing here just isn't up to the usual high standard or her writing. I can't help thinking that this was an old manuscript that she wrote a long time ago, that was published after she became successful. The style of writing comes across as if it were written by someone who lived in the 50's or 60's, not someone who is living now. The one thing that was interesting was the parallel between the events she describes in the book and things that seem to be happening now, but that doesn't make up for the dated, stilted feeling of the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"clunky and paranoid","review":"I have enjoyed most of Tepper's other books, but gave up on this one after about 50 pages, then skipped to the end to see how it came out (which I almost never do).A theme running through many of her books is \\"[Most] men will oppress women if given the opportunity.\\" This theme is developed in an involving manner in, for example, \\"The Gate to Women's Country\\" and \\"The Singer from the Sea,\\" both of which have futuristic settings in societies different from our own. Here, however, the book is set in the US, in the very near future, so the idea of a reactionary, supernatural, Catholic-Islamic-militia conspiracy requires too much of a suspension of disbelief for THIS reader.Also, the writing is not up to Tepper's usual high standard. It is clunky and confused, and the characters are not well-developed.In short, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"God - I'd heard good things about Tepper's work, and this was a *big* disappointment.

I was pleased to find that Cambridge offers the traditional Revised Standard Version, which is not often used today. The quality of this Bible is top-notch. The French Morocco leather is nice and supple. The print size is large and there is a comprehensive concordance and several nice maps in the back. I don't think there are many RSV Protestant Bibles left on the market, and still fewer genuine leather editions.

My black edition does have the 95-96 page correction inserted, but this is no big deal, and I might have never noticed it! As for page 51, I'm not quite sure about the problem there.This is a wonderful, small sized Bible that would be great for church! The only problem is that so few churches still use the RSV.

It gets into the brass tacks of what you really need to do to report results that really mean something to the folks that can take action to improve the business. The entire concept of Value Stream Costing makes so much sense it's a wonder we haven't been using it for decades.We have asked manufacturing to change, change, change in order to improve results and compete in this global market yet we have ignored the need to provide the necessary support from the accounting area. This book shows, step by step, how accounting must partner with manufacturing as well as engineering to provide actionable information in a timely manner. The old conventions of standard costing and variance analysis lead to poor decisions and this book will explain why.A must read if you are serious about Lean manufacturing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Convert your accounting methods","review":"Best book on how to get your accoutning function to look at, use and make use of lean costing which really makes your lean projects work."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, never, never again","review":"previous meds i was on caused me to lose hair then was switched to new meds that causes excessive hair growth...everywhere...but noticeable on face ,upper lip, chin. never have used any sort of depilatory so i got this. what a mess..drips everywhere(it might work a little better if someone does it for you and you're supine but my cats have not learned to do this) it hardens so quickly and then it was almost impossible to get off and pain ....who ha. irritated ,irregular red patches on face.. some hair removed some not. had put a lot of baby oil on to remove the wax also. never again.. maybe strips would have been less messy but i dont care if i look like the photo of the smith brothers cough drops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Heat","review":"WHile this product worked ok on my upper lip and chin. .

The wax simply does not set right after it's applied. I have used other parissa kits without having this problem. I have tried everything.

I've tried depilatories, epilators, threading, shaving and tweezing. Some have been disastrous while others just left me unsatisfied. I was a little weary to try strip free wax, but I was desperate and I felt encourage by the positive reviews. I wasn't confident with the process on my first try and I made a mess. The second try was it! Bamm! With very little pain the coarse hair was gone and I felt smooth. I've been waiting for this for a long time. I'm ecstatic. I recommend getting the electric warmer. Heating it on the stove is a pain and can alter your results. Also, make sure you have some extra spatulas.

I am so excited and hope over time that I wont have to wax as often, but this is still way better then the facial trimmer. I also really like that you don't use strips with this wax. I use to go to a lady that used this type of wax, but ever since I moved 6 years ago I could not find anyone that used hot wax. I bought a coffee mug warmer instead of the wax warmer because the coffer warmer was 3.99 and it works very good.

Dissapointed, as the size is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wax lyrical","review":"I bought this because it seemed to be the most popular brand (although I stand to be corrected on this). I found the wax too thin to remove hair effectively. I am used to the brand Veet which is sold in Europe.

I won't be buying this Parissa brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I really thought these would be great to use for bikini but they don't. The wax doesn't work well enough to pull out a lot of hair.. If I wanted to rid just one section it would take repeated attempts. Doing so is painful! I bled. If I'm going to wax my bikini I want it done only once in the same spot! Strips are too small and don't work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This was my first attempt at waxing myself and I can't say that it has paid off ... yet. I read a ton of great reviews about Gigi but opted for Parissa because they were cheaper and more \\"natural\\". The bikini wax kit does absolutely nothing. No hair came off whatsoever and to try to clean up is difficult as nothing gets this wax off of your skin except the ENTIRE bottle of oil. I am pretty disappointed... going to have to try a different brand or just give up altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Yeah, they are easy since they are already prepared but I'm not that excited about them. I am a novice waxer and don't trust them on my eyebrows since there is no definition on the strip and I worry about misplacing it. They would probably be okay on fine facial hair but not so great on course hair. I'll use the ones I have left but won't buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"Might just be me but using those waxing stripes are difficult and no hair removal happens. Would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Not Repurchase","review":"These strips worked poorly. Strips are faced together with their plastic backs on the outside for your hands. You rub the strips together to warm and soften, then peel them apart to expose the wax. Then you quickly place the strips on the desired area and pull against the direction of hair growth. They did not remove the hair as promised, and I'm not especially hairy.The problem is that these don't separate evenly after warming so you get one strip that has enough wax and another that doesn't. They're supposed to be good for multiple passes, but there isn't enough wax to do two effective passes, let alone the five or six the directions say you should get.Not having been professionally waxed before using them, I didn't know how ineffective they actually were until I did go in for a professional bikini wax. I would not recommend these as these are both more painful than a professional wax and significantly less effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, not the worst","review":"These strips were not as messy and did not leave behind as much residue as other wax strips. But they did not remove as much hair either. It says not to wash the skin before use so it seems if you have any oil on your skin they don't work. i was afraid to wash first because I figured there was a reason this product said not to-like you might be more likely to have a bad reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too tiny and not very effective","review":"It was my first time waxing. And I thought the strips would be fabric strips, but the strips are actually a thin clear plastic with narrow areas of wax on them. Yeah, these strips are too small! And the wax would stick to the skin and the hair that the strip failed to pull out. I agree with a lot of the other reviews that said the strips don't have enough wax to pull out all the hair and that these are a waste of money. Would definitely not buy these again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"QUICK & EASY WAX STRIPS","review":"I HATED THESE...NOT QUICK OR EASY, VERY MESSY, DIDN'T REMOVE ALL HAIR ON THE FIRST TRY & DEFINATELY DID NOT GIVE ENOUGH TO REMOVE ANYTHING EXCEPT MAYBE THE UPPER LIP!

I can't listen to Pure Moods without it producing the same effect on me like when I heard it for the first time. This, I believe, makes it a truly exceptional CD.My favorites include the popular tracks: RETURN TO INNOCENCE, SAIL AWAY and SADENESS. I also enjoy CROCKETT'S THEME, YEHA NOHA and LILY WAS HERE. All of the others combine to make it blend wonderfully. I intend to purchase the rest of the collection and I would advise potential buyers to do the same.

So after I listened to the cd in its entirety for the first time, I realized what other entrancing songs were on it and have been pleased so much with it, I have shared it with other friends and they love it, too. I had heard some of the songs on it before (\\"Orinoco Flow\\" by Enya & Enigma's \\"End of the Innocense\\", Mike Oldfields \\"Tubular Bells\\") but I didn't think EVERY song on the cd was so good.

Most of the songs I'd heard before via MTV (Enya's Orinoco Flow, Enigma's Sadness and Return to Innocence). I knew that I had to have it. My daughter purchased the tape for me as a Christmas gift. (I think I've since worn it out!) I grew up a part of the MTV Generation and am sick and tired of the \\"bump-and-grind \\" music associated with yesterday's and today's youth.

Certainly, it has everything that the mainstream pop audience could construe as new age -- atmospheric synthesizers, chants and haunting sonic textures. More importantly, it has all of the songs, from Enigma ('Return to Innocence,' 'Sadeness Part I'), Deep Forest ('Sweet Lullaby') and Enya ('Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)') to Jean Michele Jarre ('Oxygene Part IV'), Angelo Badalamenti ('Theme from Twin Peaks'), Mark Isham ('My Wife With Champagne Shoulders'), DJ Dado ('X-Files Theme') and Mike Oldfield ('Tubular Bells, Pt. 1'). In short, it's new age music for the pop music fan or the baby boomer, and it's hard to imagine that another compilation could cover the same ground quite as well. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Compilation","review":"Pure Moods is one of the best compilation CD's out.

It reminded me of the time when the albums from K-Tel, which I still have, were such a hit.Enya's song \\"Sail Away\\" didn't sound too bad either. Enigma's \\"Return To Innocence\\" and \\"Sadness\\" were powerful as was \\"Adiemus\\" Even though I stopped watching the \\"X-Files\\", that theme is unmistakable.I enjoyed this CD because of the ad I saw on television and it helped that I recognized more of the songs once I listened to it myself. The way the songs are arranged help set any mood one wants. I found this CD very calming.Until I bought \\"Pure Moods\\", I wasn't too sure of New Age music. Different is good. I will definitely listen to more like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"An excellent compilation of innovative, new-age, and electronic music. Enya's vocals soar with the well-known \\"Orinoco Flow.\\" Two Enigma hits, as well as a song from Adiemus capture your heart. Jan Hammer's \\"Crockett's Theme\\" and Jean Michael Jarre's \\"Oxygene Part IV\\" are miracles of modern electronica. Michael Nyman's \\"The Promise\\" and Michael Oldfield's classic \\"Tubular Bells\\" are impressive piano pieces. Ennio Morricone and David Byrne also provide some soothing score music. Overall, this is one of the best compilations of modern new-age music gaurunteed to put you in a pure mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good CD","review":"This is a very nice collection of selected New Age songs from numerous different artists. \\"Crockett's Theme\\" by Jam Hammer is the shining gem on this CD. This album does have it's share of filler. I have no idea what \\"Lily Was Here\\" is doing on this CD. Although the song itself is okay, it doesn't belong on here. A good CD nonetheless but there are better New Age collections out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Except for the Creepy Tracks","review":"I also own Pure Moods II and can say that I find this CD equally enjoyable-except for the X-Files and Tubular Bells tracks. I had no clue that \\"Tubular Bells\\" was the theme song to The Exorcist, until I listened to it for the first time after purchasing the CD. I can't figure out why they put these 2 songs on this CD, considering it's not the type of music that puts you in the \\"purist of moods\\". Maybe had I never seen The Exorcist or watched an episode of X-Files, I could enjoy the music for what it is, but I guess I'll be forever tainted. And, trust me, I've tried getting past my \\"fears\\", but every time I listen to these two particular songs, all I see are images of Agents Scully & Mulder chasing after some alien or Linda Blair's spinning head.Overall, if you can get past the creepy tracks, it's an excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peacefully exhilirating....","review":"This is perhaps one of my favorite CDs, and definetly in the top 5 of my New Age collection. The CD features arguably some of the best in the genre..Enya and Adiemus. In fact , I liked the tracks so much, I have since bought the artists' CDs which featured those tracks. Enigma is at its best in the opening track (you may remeber the breath-taking video). Oxygene Part IV is a great track, thopugh my personal best is Part VI (not available in this collection). The famous X-files theme is a great addition to this CD, though I wont classify that as new age (no one claimed this is a typical new age CD, anyway!).I was however disappointed not to find any Kitaro compositions (though Pure Moods 3 has the most famous Kitaro track).If you are experimenting with New age-type music, this is the CD you want to try first (at your own risk...you will be hooked to this genre!) A great CD to have. The series itself is pretty good, though I prefer this collection to Pure Moods 2 and 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"I used to have tendinitis in my right hand aggravated due to my computer use.

This is commonly known as \\"carpal tunnel syndrome\\" where it is actually under a larger class that are categorized as Repetitive Strain Injuries. In any case, I started using this a bit each day and I found that my pain has gone away. And that's good enough for me!On another note, I found the string to start the powerball very useful at first. However, I also found that it was possible to get the string stuck inside of the powerball very easily. When it's caught in the inner working of the gyro, it's definitely a moment of panic since you could possibly have gotten it permanently stuck. Because of this, I would suggest using the string sparingly, and try very hard to get to the point where you can just start it without use of the string."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little gadget","review":"I bought this gadget for my sister and her family for Christmas last year.

If you do what they do, it's really easy. Just make sure your rotations of your wrist are very wide at the beginning, don't overdo it, and DO NOT lose the starting cord unless you are confident that you can start it with a flick of your thumb. I can feel it working out my arm, and holding it in different positions returns interesting results.

It is too easy to loose the rhythm and then you must restart it. For those that just want to concentrate on exercise this is too frustratingly complex. The only way to start it is with a special little string that is very easy to loose (or the optional starter motor).

The plants look fine, but I have way fewer flowers than I've ever had using regular potting soil. I also had two plants die, and I have no idea why. I read one other review that said her plants were cooking in the sun - that the contents of her containers felt HOT to her. This could be my exact problem as well. Both plants that died were in full sun. Next year I will buy regular potting soil and a big package of Miracle Grow plant food instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly if you fertilze","review":"This soil is unpredictable, except that it's definitely deadly if you add fertilizer during the first two months. By unpredictable, I mean even without adding fertilizer, it may burn your plants due to hot spots in the soil, where the 6 months of time release nutrients come out all at once.Don't use this on prize garden stock without testing first. You simply cannot control the nutrient uptake with this potting soil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gntas and wood chips.","review":"I too have had tons of gnats come out of the potting soil. Didn't they sterilize soil in the past? I bought it to make grow grass seeds for the cats to chew on.I would spray it with bug spray but for the fact that I don't want to poison the cats. I've had some of the soil in planter for 2 months and its still making gnats. I didn't have that problem with the soil that came with the Chia novelty cat grass seeds and soil. The Miracle potting mix has a lot of wood chips in it. I would prefer 100% soil instead of 25% wood chips that cause the gnats. I guess Potting Mix is different than Potting soil. I used to sell New Era potting soil that was good dark earth with nothing else added to it. Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"yup gnats - lots of them....","review":"I bought this potting mix a few months ago and about a month ago I started seeing the gnats, which have been increasing daily.

All got gnats and earthworms (potted plants don't like earthworms). My plants were never so unhappy and sickly. Not sure that it was the soil to blame, I repotted all the plants with a fresh bag of Miracle Gro in spring (after soaking the roots in water bucket overnight to get rid of the earthworms). Still have gnat and earthworm problems.So it seems that Miracle Gro did not just stop screening the soil. The mix was not heat-treated properly to kill larvae and stuff. Do not use this brand, unless you want unhappy plants, gnat infestation, and earthworms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Gnats everywhere.

While this book has some interesting things, the section dealing with the Runes is grossly inaccurate and overly simplistic. The author uses the Runes to spell out charms and spells in \\"English\\", rather than using the ancient Germanic or Nordic languages, and seems to totally overlook the magical aspects and inherent meanings in the Runes themselves. More and deeper study of the Runes and Runic lore is recommended to the author - especially when he makes use of them as a central part of his book. Altogether this book was very disappointing, especially if you are looking for deeper more powerful material to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading and shallow","review":"Although the title claims that this book is about making magickal objects, it's really just another one of Cunningham's bland books with little worth reading. It's more of just a book of spells than anything, with all of them having some sort of object that you make yourself. And like usual Cunningham simply delivers a bunch of spells with no occult or metaphysical explanations for anything. Just spells that are supposed to work even though there is nothing in the name of deep-rooted magickal conncepts. Just like all of Cunningham's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book didn't hold a ton of good info.","review":"These crafts, for the most part, were totally useless to make, they have no meaning for a wiccan at all.

So we can learn to cook like Anthony Bourdain? Maybe to scour each line for mistakes so that we can make the rank of sergeant in the grammar police before we retire? This novel was a pleasing and relatively rapid-paced return to the post-apocalyptic from an author that has ALREADY provided us with The Stand, The Dark Tower series, and just a few others I may have left out. We could wax philosophical about this novel's social implications, discuss King's true feelings about homosexuality and compare it to the ravings of a younger man. Or; we could pick up the book and enjoy. I did. You should, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE STAND","review":"I like Steven King writing very much but this book is a very short version of the stand but it is not the Stand.

I have always shyed away from the supernatural aspect of his books. However, being the cell phone user type of guy in this modern world, I couldn't resist purchasing and reading this book.I was pleasantly surprised. I was fearful that I would recoil if it became too \\"demonic\\" but I didn't. In fact, the zombie idea sat well with me since I don't view them as demonic but more extraterrestrial. Some parts are quite disturbing, but that's the point isn't?The ending left SO many questions unanswered. If in his doing so, King was seeking to command us to continue pondering over the book's implications, he did well. I think a follow-up would be greatly appreciated by many a fan who desires knowledge of the characters' future lives and hows and whys. But Stephen King writing a sequel to 'The Cell'? Seems unlikely.I don't know if I will read another SK book any time soon, but I recommend this one for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"American pop culture cliche shtick at its worst.

I got this feeling from Gunslinger after just 3 books and now with Cell. If it were the first in a series he might find his way but he gave up on this one too soon. Part of the problem is that the Pulse is a world-wide phenomenon and a few \\"normies\\" aren't going to solve such a problem no matter what the cause, a cause that he leaves completely unknown. Even the subplots go unanswered, unlike Dome, where it's a local and therefore solvable crisis, complete with all his witty observations on human character which he's good at. Anyway, a bit of a disappointment unless he finishes it up with a second novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept waiting for the punchline...","review":"I really had a lot of hope for this book. It started off with a bang and I expected it to end with one. Well technically it did end with a bang, but not the kind I mean.Besides the obvious lack of character development and the resulting lack of empathy towards them, it was just extremely predictable. I kept thinking as I read this, \\"ahhh, okay Stevie wants us to think this is going to happen, but that's too obvious, so I'm sure we're in for a good surprise!\\" And then when you finally think there is going to be that, \\"Holy smokes, I didn't see that coming\\" moment; the book ends..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing!","review":"This is a real shame - never before have I felt so let down by a book.

The whole concept seemed so promising and from reading the blurb the book sounded as if it was going to be brilliant and for the first few chapters I thought the book was great and I really got into it. However, as the book continued I was left feeling confused, bored and wishing that SK was with me to explian the ending. The biggest let down ever and a waste of my time.

This one is right up there with It, The Stand, and Insomnia for quality, characterization, and readability. I read it in two days and would not have minded another hundred pages or two.The only negative comment I can make is that it needs an ending. A prologue of some kind. We want to know what happens with Johnny and if the conversion of the Normies was complete before the showdown. If it wasn't does that mean the fate of the world is in the hands of one breeding couple and an otherwise all male entourage? Is the signal going to claim them the first time someone accidentally turns on a battery powered scanner or a f/m radio? Enquiring minds need to know.

The ending is anticlimatic after all the build up. And there are many unanswered questions, unlike The Stand, which had a similar apocalyptic plot. Who sent the pulse? Does the cell work on Johnny-Gee? King has a tremendous talent for creating real people and circumstances, which makes his horror elements so scary. Yet, there are characters we get to know very well in this novel that are lost to us without any explaination.

I have been an avid reader of his books for over 25 years, and this has to be one of the weakest books he has written.This \\"The Stand\\" wanna-be is ill-paced and feels empty and pointless. Missing are the suspense and depth typical of King novels.

After reading a few reviews of Cell by the author, however, I figured I'd give King another chance. Big mistake. In true Stephen King form of late, he grabs your attention in the first few chapters, builds up anxiety and expectation towards the middle of the book, then ends up dropping the ball at the end. He has gone from writing bad endings to not writing them at all. So very disappointing when you consider how great his early work was.

I hadn't read a good book in a long time, so it was passable to listen to this one. If I had just read a good book, I am sure I would not have been able to get past disc one.

As some people have mentioned, it's similar to The Stand but a lot shorter. The premise of having cell phones wipe people's minds is pretty original. The first half of the book is very intense. However, I couldn't help feeling something missing. Some of the characters, especially the women, are not really given much character development. The one who is, is killed off. Also there are huge jumps in time as well as shifts between time periods. The ending is rather rushed and the cell phone epidemic is never explained. That being said, yeah, it's no Stand but it is a short enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the party to whom I am speaking?","review":"I've been a fan of Stephen King's books since I read _The Shining_ in the late 70's, but I stopped reading them after _Misery_. It seemed to me as if King had begun believing his own press, and his story seemed to lose the old edge of his masterpieces like _The Shining_ and _The Stand_. I listened to _Cell_ as a book-on-CD with the same fascination I used to feel with his older books until, near the end, when the story no longer seemed even remotely plausible and I realized that _Cell_ was just another shaggy dog story. If you like episodic tales that don't really go anywhere, _Cell_ may be to your liking, and it did cause me to think about just how pervasive cell phone technology has become. But in the end, it was just another long drawn-out story, and it'll probably be a long time before I feel drawn to read another of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this!","review":"After having not read a King book in a couple of years was uncertain about reading this book.

Probably his worst endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it's an IMPOSTER AUTHOR!","review":"Like many of Stephen King's \\"Constant Readers\\" as he has dubbed us, I too have read everything (yes, yes, everything) that he has written.As I worked my way through Cell I kept waiting to be truly sucked in, to feel something for the characters and the outcomes... but it just continued to feel superficial.Then, a thought came to mind... this isn't actually Stephen King, it's somebody who's writing just like Stephen King (without the real hook, the real 'goods') and soon Stephen is going to pop out and say:\\"FAKE OUT\\"!\\"Just a hoax, another gimmick I'm trying to keep this whole writing business fresh and interesting\\"(oh please, oh please let that be true!)I don't really want to believe he would just coast through a book like this one. \\"Phone it in\\" as they say in the acting world.I won't give up on him, never, not ever.

Familier as in: Hey, I've read this before....In another King book!Yup, it is like a recycled The Stand, but really boring and goofy. The \\"raggedy man\\", the phoners and the thing with the boom boxes was just dumb.

It is not.Second, if you hate cliffhanger endings don't bother with this book. I am one of those people and because of this novel I will probably never read another King book. I detest lazy writers who leave open endings. I didn't want everything answered. For example, I didn't need the who or why. There was only one thing should have been answered.Anyways, this book was ok until the ending. There were places were the character dialogue was laughable but other than that it was ok. But the ending just ruined the entire book IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"King delivers yet again!","review":"Cell is one of those novels that, within 5 pages, you're hooked. This story is 'historic' King at his finest. If you're a fan of books like 'Salems Lot or Tommyknockers, this book is a must for your King collection.Written in a believable atmosphere and with characters you can related to, this book takes everyday items and makes you look at them twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"CELL","review":"CELL-----1 STARThis book actually started off absolutely amazing!. From the very first page to about the 40th page were unbelievably intense, and frantic. After that, it kind of settled into some silly stuff, about zombies that has been done to death. Something went very wrong here, and I just couldn't bare myself to even finish it. During the midway point there were characters coming out of nowhere, no development to them, EASY way to frustrate a reader, therefore LOSING the reader.....writing 101....STAY CLEAR FROM THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed it at the beginning...","review":"I'm a busy wife and mom. Having said that, when the opportunity to read a good book comes along, I take it! I was totally engrossed in this book at the beginning, squeezing in an hour here and there to read it. Little more than halfway through it started to become somewhat \\"over the top\\". King usually can make you believe that anything is possible but not so with this book. Too many unanswered questions (I know, maybe that's his goal...) and an ending that seemed to be written in haste. It almost seemed as though King lost interest in writing it and just packed it up and sent it off to his editor. Shame because it really had the potential to be an excellent read! Just left me feeling like I wasted a lot of my time getting to an ending that didn't actually exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Stephen King","review":"Like with his older novels, I started King's latest book and couldn't put it down. I loved his writing style, his characters, his use of modern slang and culture. He kept me rivited until the last page. I pondered the end for awhile, wondering why Clay didn't first \\"practice\\" on another phonie, but then I realized that wasn't the point. He had one shot, it either worked, or it didn't. A good place to leave us. A good book stays in your thoughts after you finish it, and I'm still thinking about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing :(","review":"Accurately stated by \\"azjudyann \\"meteorologist wannabe\\"\\", this is a very disappointing way to treat a dear loyal reader.

I am sorry for you and me. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Reader is (again) disappointed","review":"Unfortunately Stephen King disappoints again. \\"Cell\\" is a wordy, long-winding, empty and meaningless story. Page after page King drones on and bores his clientele. The end is absolutely NOTHING, as though his word processor had suddenly (and mercifully - for the reader) given out... I was a BIG fan of King, books like Misery and The Shining still belong to my all-time favorites, but this is exploiting his readers' fidelty for what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"After finishing \\"Cell\\" I felt mildly disappointed..the plot was much too loosely woven, there were many unanswered questions throughout the book, and the ending positively stunk. Definitely not the caliber of the \\"Dark Tower\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am (or was) a huge Stephen King fan from the very beginning.(Salem's Lot and Carrie)I have read all of his novels and have been there in line at the book store on the first day. But this new book was a gigantic disappointment to me. The storyline is interesting, but its playing-out really reeked. King's characters are usually so well done that they are like someone I feel I know; however, the characters in this book are a little flat. Totally un-necessary use of multiple curse words. I am no prude, and I appreciate an occasional d--n, or f***, but just about every sentence issuing from the mouths of King's characters was foul. Even the 12 year old academy kid! The ending of the book was as if King just got tired of writing, and quit. Maybe he had something better to do. I can tell you that the next King book that comes out I will get from the public library and not purchase it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"After only a few pages in I closed the book, walked into the kitchen, and then tossed it into the garbage atop the leftovers from the previous night.Years ago a read two books by King. Although I considered them passable at the time those two novels were far better than this. I found no redeeming value in filling my head with this disjointed rubbish. I would rather it sit in a landfill than to fall into the hands of someone else. Even though the two previous books were superior they too are no longer something I would read today. The motivation for why I ultimately decided to read it is because it was a gift and, recommended. King is obviously a talented writer, but he fills pages with unnecessary profanity and disgusting visuals; he is wasting his gift. I have finally grown to where King is removed from my books list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Technical Writing But No Scares","review":"Levitating and Psychic zombies are the least of this book's problems. Forget the ridiculous premise of phone signals downloading instructions to the masses or the fact that a major plot point was written a number of years ago by author Brian Keene (going after a missing son in THE RISING), let's get down to brass tacks here -- it wasn't scary in the least!King falls back on his usual formula of gathering survivors together to battle the big baddie and then, of course, prevail so conveniently and in such a preposterous and illogical outcome, you have to ask yourself, \\"Why is this a bestseller?\\". Having the name Stephen King still sells books, but at some point, people will realize that the master of horror is now past his prime. Mr. King needs to go back and read his early work from the 1980's to remind him of why he was so great in the field of horror, and ultimately, how to scare the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I spent the whole day reading this book","review":"I recently found myself wondering what to do with some overdue vacation time. Fond memories of Firestarter, Carrie and Nightshift compelled me to pick up Cell - reading a book seemed like the perfect way to disconnect from work. While it was an engaging read, much of it had similar references to The Stand. Finally after reading the last page of Cell I slammed the book shut and exclaimed \\"I can't believe I spent the whole day reading this book - there's no closure!\\" However, Cell was engaging enough so that I was able to disconnect from corporate America for a little while. I suppose this alone was worth the cost of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very engaging","review":"I listen to a lot of audio books because I spend a lot of time in the car. I normally can't wait to get back into the car because I am listening to something good and I can't wait to hear what happens. However, this was not the case with \\"The Cell\\". I found this book dreadful. In fact, I didn't even make it to the end. The audio version was 13 hours long. I made it a little over half way and decided to give up. I knew what was happening and was following the story, but I just found it incredibly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stand Redux","review":"King trots out a rewrite of The Stand- mankind self-destructs thanks to uber-progress; only this time its the ever-present cell-phone gone amuck (which an end-note from the author pointedly notes he does not own), instead of germ warfare on the loose. Major flaw-who is the villian??? Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was good","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a quick read.The end did leave me wanting to know more about Johnny gee and Clay and the others, which is why it only got 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Typical Zombie Tale","review":"I was hoping this book would be Stephen Kings epic Zombie Novel. Instead it is your typical Steven King book with weird characters and twist and turns. He seems to have a hard on for having a lone \\"Bad Guy\\" and this was kind of similar to The Stand in that way. To me that idea doesn't really work with a Zombie Apocalypse book but maybe I'm just hating. This book could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cell by Stephen King","review":"I really thought this was lame compared to King's other books. Im starting to think he has lost the charm of his older books but the only other ones ive read ARE his older books. So just FYI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Use Your Cell Phone","review":"The wonderful thing about King's new novel, Cell, is that he takes a relatively ordinary phenomenon of contemporary life and turns it into a shocking horror fest. This is King's great talent, and no one does it better. From the pet cemetary in the woods to the nice family doggie (who now has rabies), King populates his middle-class American landscape with familiar things that have now turned nightmarishly psychotic. In Cell, King jams an urban myth into the highest gear. What if cell phones didn't cause cancer? What if they did something much worse? What if they turned the user into a zombie killing machine? From the first page to the last, you're hooked. It doesn't matter if the reading calories are empty; you can't stop reading. That's why King, above everything else (and perhaps in spite of everything else) has remained the best selling author in the world. You can't stop reading him.Donald Gallinger is the author of The Master Planets"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cell","review":"As an avid reader of Stephen King books I can say this definitely wasn't one of my favorites but the plot pulled me through to the end...or was that an ending? If the ending hadn't left me feeling like there was more that had to be revealed I would have given it higher ratings. Oh well, sometimes he does that in his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"FASPhoenix","review":"If you have read any of King's earlier novels, say twenty-five years ago, i.e. before his name was a household word, you would be convinced this is one such story. It opens well, by page 3 it has your attention; from then on, however, it bores the reader with 300+ pages of exactly more of the same stuff from page 5. Talk about redundancy and repetition! This novel barely earns a one star in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really new here.","review":"OK, let me start by saying I am usually a HUGE Stephen King fan. I've read most of his books, and more then once. I enjoy his \\"what if\\" style, taking everyday things and situations and twisting them.But this book just didn't do it for me. It had too many echos of The Stand, one of my favorites. The end-of-the-world scenerio, the survivors being seperated, the misfit band trying to save the world.And I HATED the ending. Won't give it away, but hated it.This seemed to me to be too much in rough draft form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love all of the Stephen King novels I have read so far, but this one is his best work yet.

But it did not really grab me. it was a good book and just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best from King, but...","review":"Yes, this is not Stephen King's best work. I'm sure his best novels are behind him now, but this is still an enjoyable read and probably much better than most other authors in the genre. I read one of the other reviews from someone who said they'd stopped reading King after Insomnia (which I read as well). I felt the same way after Reading Gerald's Game and stopped reading King for a while, but I found that in the horror genre there weren't many authors who had the ability to make you feel for the characters the way Stephen King did. And considering the volume of work he's produced you have to accept that not all his books will be great. That being said, I did enjoy reading Cell, I did notice some similarity to The Stand, but only in the \\"end of world\\" scenario. This book to me was a \\"Quick King\\" as it moved fast and took you along with it. I would recommend it to a Stephen King fan, but would suggest other books of his if someone had never read his novels before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could have used 2 1/2 stars","review":"This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half. The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writing was dead on as always and character development was good. This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont answer the phone!","review":"Stephen King's Cell kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. I found myself being up way to late on many nights until this book was fininshed. King has once again found a way to turn a common fear into a fantastic story. My only wish is that king would have (SPOILER ALERT!!) provided a little more closure to the end and told what happened to clay's son after the phone call, and whether or not they ever linked back up with the rest of the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cell","review":"I have to start by saying I tend to feel this is a return to form for King. If you look at this against his complete body of work, it isn't the greatest, but taken in it's own right (which we should really do) this is a good story that should keep you hooked and turning those pages. I find it frustrating he uses the same metaphors from book to book (who recognises the 'nerves like over tightened guitar strings' phrase yet again?) but I guess after 40 books I can forgive him. I found the story to be downright chilling in places and reminiscent of 'The Stand' (still his greatest ever book!) due to it's end of the world survival themes. The idea is original and this book has a good ending which leaves you feeling satisfied. It's also good to see an old-fashioned Zombie story again. Compared to the lack lustre affairs of his last few books, this is great horror reading and King doing what he does best.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst King Novel Ever!","review":"I am a huge fan of any horror, thriller, psychological suspense genre books. I have read several of King's books and have been overly satisfied. But with this one, this one just took the cake as far as the worst book I have ever read! The book wasn't very progressive, but I kept reading, waiting for the next big thing to get the ball rolling as far as story telling. And in the end i was greatly disappointed. The ending of this book was by far the worst way to end it, with no answers and abrupt end. At the conclusion of reading it, I literally threw it as hard and as far as I possibly could (which also happened to be in the same direction of my husband). If King's purpose was to make you remember this story, he succeeded, because the book throwing story comes up quite often and if anyone asks for a recommendation for a book, I tell the to read anything on the planet except The Cell."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.U....","review":"I've read most of Steven Kings work, and this was by far the lamest.

A replay of The Stand, only in cell phones? I was sometimes really surprised how alike they are, nobody REALLY realized it???? If it was mentioned before, I do apologize, but if not....That was his first book, I really was disappointed of.

I will admit, he is still at the top of his field as far as describing gore and mayhem, and the first hundred or so pages keep you very entertained. Then the novel begins to drag on into a series of predictable plot twists and increasingly ridiculous turns that leave you wanting the end to come as soon as possible. It drags on a bit long, it gives way too much credit to the intelligence of the characters involved (especially the younger ones, who seem to operate on a level even higher than the \\"phone-crazies/people\\"). To sum up, though mildly entertaining at times, I was left quite unimpressed with King's latest work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor rehash of The Stand","review":"King is my favorite writer.

Worst King to date","review":"Stephen King takes a great premise for a novel, starts out with a great first ten pages of reading and then crashes, and burns !! His characters are two dimesional and entirely unlikeable; his ending is not only abrupt, but doesnt answer any questions or provide any satisfying closure to where the characters went after the credits rolled.

I will say it starts out fast like Desperation(which I loved) and has characters similar to The Stand(which I also loved). That being said, it has all too familiar characters. Almost every single character says the F word. That's not bad for a few characters, but almost all? Come on. This is so much like Dawn of the Dead where the people hole themselves up in a mall. He even says at the beginning of the book that it is dedicated to George Romero! And the premise? Give me a break. Cell phones wiping out your hard drive. Then re-booting? People turning into 'phone crazies' and 'phoners'? This book gets tiresome after the first onslaught. And the little kid seems a little too smart for his age.

It starts full force on page one and the main characters are flat and one-dimensional. I just didn't care. A huge yawn.

If you are looking for some good scary entertainment (actually more drama than horror) you'll enjoy the book up to the end.

The scattered normals alternately flee and combat the phoners as they are all drawn to a remote fairground in Maine. As usual, King makes creating realistic characters and an unsettling ambience seem easy.

But that's ok, because the programming that coordinates the zombies is decaying anyway.Aside from the political subtext, the problem with this book is that it is dull. Tons of gore, but no danger. Characters that are less lively than their zombie counterparts.I love Stephen King. But this book is just a disappointment, even worse than his latest few. It's as if the man stopped writing after the crash and turned his name over to a syndicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I like Stephen King, but the last 200 pages were bad, bad and boring. Then the end was even worse. Other than that, a pretty good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"It's hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as Carrie, Pet Sematary, and The Shining. I am at a loss for adjectives which describe this sophomoric collection of words. Suffice it to say, the large quantity of unfavorable reviews posted here describe most of my thoughts. I don't believe it when Stephen King claims he does not own a cell phone. I think he did, he turned it on, made a call, and his brain got zapped. Then he wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Gave Up","review":"I agree that the first 75 pages of this book made me think this was going to be a great read. Boy was I wrong!King just mosies along, throwing into this story everything but what we most wanted: Horror.The \\"phoners\\" were lame - even comical. The interaction between the characters was ridiculous and stereotyped.I stopped reading this mess right after the Clay and co. left the boarding school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cell Is A No Sale","review":"This is one mess of a novel.WARNING: The first couple of chapters are exciting, bizarre, and at times sad (e.g. Tom McCourt and his cat Rafe) but after that it is a speedy trip downhill into boredom.The deranged victims of their cell phones pretty much do nothing throughout the book but lay out in the sun, eat cakes and candies and listen to muzak, easy-listening and soft rock (I am not kidding you with any of this!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best, not even his regular writing","review":"If you read The Stand, the similarities are everywhere.

Unfortunately, after a great set-up with the main character describing the chaos that breaks out around him as people with cell phones go bonkers, the story quickly turns to rote Stephen King story-telling. I'm talking about vivid dreams that - suprise, surprise - reveal a future plot development, cross-country treks through a ruined society by a motley assortment of lucky survivors, impossible coincidences, and, worst of all, floating, telepathic \\"zombies.\\" The story just turned so damn silly at the end that I was anxioulsy waiting its conclusion.This seems like the sort of story King can write in his sleep. It's strictly by-the-numbers here, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was great...","review":"but you may not. If you like zombies and post-apocalyptic themes then it's likely you'll enjoy this book. It's a classic horror novel so don't expect anything \\"new\\" or \\"innovative\\".The story is age-old but written in a way that makes one want to eat it up. The action is fast-paced and keeps the reader interested throughout. The characters are typical King characters, but I've always liked King's pawns (unlike so many others) so I felt a \\"connection\\" and they drew me further into the story.All in all I thought it was a great piece of work, but again, this is coming from a zombie-obsessed-post-apocalyptic-fiction-lover. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The End Days","review":"I could not put the book down! I considered it King's most gory and gruesome novel to date. If you can get beyond that, you will be enthralled at this picture of the end of the world. Whether it is by space aliens, foreign bad guys, or God himself, the last days could be portrayed as King writes. I thought the characterization was interesting, as I cared about what happened to the characters. It was a bit reminiscent of the Tom Cruise version of \\"The War of the Worlds.\\" The ending will leave you wanting more. It would make a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disapointment","review":"I was looking forward to a return to king's horror roots.I'm a life-long stephen king fan, but I think his best work is now behind him. this is definitely not up to his usual high standards. in my youth a new king book was an event. I remember the excitement I felt when I read the stand, the shining, and salem's lot for the first time. however I'm afraid those days are over. this book seemed rushed, with no explanation for the \\"pulse\\", weak characterization, another one hundred pages or more were needed. the best horror today is being written by edward lee. go check him out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unused Potential, Generally Disappointing","review":"To be honest, I borrowed this from the library instead of buying it because I was skeptical - cellphones make people zombies. Okay, it could be made interesting. And there was potential there to do so; midway through it seems like there could be something big, sinister, The Stand-ish. It seems that one character could have done a lot more to make it difficult for the protagonists, and doesn't. But that potential wasn't taken.On further reflection, the concept, albeit with computers and logging-in to the Internet (instead of cell phones,) was done in Snow Crash years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"A fan of King's earlier horror stories, much of his recent work has failed to engage me. I couldn't finish either Tom Gordon or Dreamcatchers - they didn't grab me like Carrie or The Shining or Christine or Night Shift.That being said, I felt like Cell relied on plot devices and themes King's done well before, but now just come across as tired and cliched. This was a great premise - the potential to terrorize with cell phones - that just wasn't realized to its potential.

You have action... then our hero's thoughts... and then a bunch of detail all crammed together. Once you get through the confusion it starts to become a decent read until the school part. The story then takes a dive into complete and utter dog vomit.The zombies, crazies, whatever are gaining superpowers. How? No idea. Maybe it is explained, but it became so unbelievable I had to toss it in the trash. I really can't imagine how King could have thought this was a good story... maybe he is becoming senile or something.Anyone see that Family Guy where King comes up with the idea of a lamp monster... that would have been way better than this pile of garbage. If you pick this up make sure you have some alcohol on hand because you are going to need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the rest of it?","review":"The story was interesting. Even though I was assaulted by the \\"F\\" word from every character, which is just uncalled for, (Does he seriously believe that every person in the world talks like that?), I was still intrigued to find out what was going to happen. How did they get out of this predicament? Would the world ever be the same again? What happens to the main characters? Well, don't ask me! You will arrive at the end of the book and STILL have all these questions unanswered! A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"If you have a lot of time on your hands and you want to be bored for a few hours go ahead and read Cell.

Then after hours of boredom I discover that King couldn't come up with an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's almost hard to believe the writer is Stephen King","review":"This books starts out ok, but goes downhill fast. I have a theory about why that is. The start of the book is all action. When the action tapers off, the character development takes over. It's at that point I had to check the cover to see if I had the right author? The characters never develop beyond cardboard cutouts. The dialogue, usually a King strong point, just doesn't ring true. Has anyone also noticed King resorts to corny sentiment in place of character development thesedays. The prose in some parts is mind-numbingly bad as well. I have read a lot of King books, and even though the story sometimes fails to deliver, the writing never does. This book will be marked down as an aberration by true king fans(not the mindless ones who have given it 5 stars here)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok...where is the rest?!?","review":"I love anything written by Stephen King and Cell is no exception...BUT....there are so many unanswered questions that I am hoping there is a sequel in the works....the story feels unfinished....come on Stephen....tell us the rest of the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Give Up Retirement!","review":"Unfortunately the great King is allowed a couple of duds. I just wish I knew before I spent my money. I'm a long time King fan and I found The Cell a tad tedious and full of air. This story could've been written as a short story.

I thought it was time to try again.So, what was the verdict?Enjoyable read. At times, I could not put it down.No one writes gore better than King. He adds detail that makes you feel like you were there. King's easy reading style sucks the reader right in and the reader wants to know what is going to happen next. Uncharacteristically, King fails to do much in the area of character development, outside of the main character of Clay. Too bad.One cannot help but to compare 'Cell' to 'The Stand'. It would be unfair to say that 'Cell' is a mini-'Stand'. The over-arching themes of good vs. evil are not present. The character development is, by comparison, non-existant. 'Cell' is not as good, but not as much of a time investment, either.So - to sum it all up. 'Cell' is good, not as good as King at his best, but definitely worth a look. I give it a grade of B+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit the spot, but STILL....","review":"I wanted to read this book because I needed a break from the more thought-provoking fare I have been reading lately. I wanted something gory, an easy read, not very intellectual, and I got it in Cell. I used to love King - for a while there, I read everything he put out, so I speak with a little of background knowledge. Cell definitely has its moments of suspense and I caught glimpses of the stuff that used to make me breathless with anticipation...but overall, it falls flat. Totally flat in my opinion. And the ending?? What in the world is that about? It seemed to me that he got tired of writing and just ended it! Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fit for a King...","review":"Maybe Stephen King has outdone himself so many times that we, the reader, have come to expect him to top himself each and every time. BUT, maybe it's impossible to top or equal your best work each and every time and Stephen King has proven that here.Cell:A Novel was boring, for me. Very predictable to the point that I started to think that the predictability was a ploy to trick the reader and the surprise was right around the corner. It never came.I'll always be a Stephen King fan and I've already forgiven him for this one.

The first couple of chapters are great and the premise is good, so why do I only rate this book 2 stars?

The ending left me hoping very hard for a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"No ending, but good reading...","review":"Cell is like most of S. King's other books, little about what happens is explained and the story just stops, there is no ending. It is like someone removed the last chapter from the book. You are left wondering about the ending and the entire story, but I suspect that is part of the point. But, the story is pretty good and it does keep you interested, it is not easy to put down. Maybe there will be a Cell 2, and he will explain things and finish the story....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I don't want to regurgitate what others have said except to say that King phoned this one in (pun intended). It starts off promising but winds down to a snails pace, to becoming downright silly in later pages. There is nary a sense of menace after the first 70 or 80 pages. What a drag. I am an avid King fan and this could have been good. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time and Money on This Book","review":"I was compelled to buy this audio book because I felt the topic was a great idea, which turned out to be true, despite what I heard about the book's terrible, incomplete ending. It starts out action packed and seems as though it will turn out to be very exciting throughout. As the story progressess, however, the zombies become rather non threatening and boring. The book, was overall boring, uninteresting, and sloppily and lazily written. The ending, if you can even call it that, was horrible, and the final chapters of the book were extremely boring and seemed to drag on forever. The ending was as if you were reading a book that had the last several chapters left out. I could have written a better ending than King did, having never written a book. The boring, incomplete ending is like torture and ruins the entire story. I highly recommend not wasting your time and money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A recycled \\"the Stand\\" without the great ending","review":"Put this book down and go buy the Stand by Stephen King it is a similar story but much better than Cell. This book started interesting but never told us how the cell virus worked, who did it and why. The plot was similar to the The Stand which made me feel like I was being ripped off by King. The following is my prediction of the plots for Kings next two books: 1. An outcast high school girl who has psychic kinetic powers reeks havoc at her prom dance. 2. A troubled family becomes care takers of a summer resort during the winter only to find out that the resort is haunted. The father goes into a murderous rage. Recycling is a good thing for plastic but not for novels.Jon Schneider"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the King is allowed a dud once in a while...","review":"When you pick up a King novel you expect great things. Great story, deep characters, excellent dialoge, some (or alot) of scary scenes. None of this happened for me with Cell. This has to be the very worst book of King I've ever read. Sure not all his novels are great but none have been bad like this. It was a forced read all the way through. Dialoge was mediocre at best. The characters weren't anything special. But the element that really put this book at the bottom of the zombie pile was the poor story. Don't bother with this one. Not scary, not entertaining, not interesting. Sorry Mr. King."},{"rating":"1","title":"grrr","review":"I liked this book. I hated the ending or lack there of I should say. I never read a crappier ending. All the suspense and then....nothing!

I couldn't tell the characters apart without \\" he said or she said.\\" To me, this book was an unfinished (and I don't mean the lame ending) work in progress. Interesting idea - went nowhere. Throw in some gross descriptions of carnage like a B-movie does and let it fly. I didn't care about anyone in this book or anything that was happening. Everyone sounded alike. I know I'm repeating myself but so does he -- it's his trademark, tiresome as that is. After all these years and the creation of some very interesting characters, how can he not remember that all people don't use the same slang or speech cadence? When he had his little kid putting \\"Jesus!\\" in his note ... I was literally rolling my eyes. In a crisis, little kids don't say \\"Jesus\\" like an adult would. That kind of oversight just seems lazy to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW GOING and FRUSTRATING. BELOW AVERAGE.","review":"A pulse over the Cell phone transforms the half world into crazy people (NOT ZOMBIES). After that, the main character tries to get home and find his kid with the help of two more people.The book isn't bad.The problem is that, after a great 50 pages start, we get 300 more pages of a slowgoing story devoided of any great storytelling. Mainly we get vivid descriptions and lots and lots and LOTS of dialogue. LOTS of it. You can even scroll down entire pages without missing anything really important for the story.And many of the elements here (like the telepathy thing) does not really fit into this. I found it boring and hard to believe.Mr. King gave us great books in the past. But in this one is quite out of his environment.And the endind... big disappointment.

Most of his novels are spellbinding; well written, graphic, and sometimes even heart wrenching. I decided to revisit some of them a few months ago, and about 35 pages in I remembered why I so dislike Cell. It feels like it was written by a high school kid and published under King's name to sell better. Maybe King was just looking for a way to profess his hatred of cellphones and this was the best he could come up with - I have no idea. It doesn't live up to what I've come to expect, and I would recommend any of his other works to this book. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel!","review":"I love this novel.

I was so curious as to who was behind the pulse, what was going on in other parts of the world, was it only local? None of these questions was answered. We are left with a small group of people in New England cut off from the world. But why did the readers have to be cut off too?Very unsatisfying and the ending was terrible.

Needless to say I've enjoyed most of them or I wouldn't keep coming back for more. This last effort has got me shaking my head.

At 10:15 tomorrow I'm going to leave this book on top of the nearest gabage can at the corner of Queen Anne and Mercer in Seattle. So if you want a free (terrible) book you can have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's 'Cell' A Great Disappointment","review":"Stephen King's new book 'Cell' was a great disappointment to me. I enjoyed his early writing a great deal. It was researched, witty, poetic, disturbing and captivating. This novel is pedantic, cliche, politically biased, socially skewed and patently ridiculous in its premise. Give me Dean Koontz any day - an author who has a wide range of plots and doesn't drag his bitterness and ideologies into his writing as King has done here. The Stand is still, in my mind, one of the greatest books ever written - what a pity that King has bought more into Hollywood hype and drivel than into what people actually think and feel in the majority out there. Not to be unkind, but I highly doubt, given an apocolypse, that people would be as weak as his characters in 'Cell' are. Save your money for the next Koontz novel unless you like a novel that bashes our President, our government, the Iraq war, right to life, non-alternative lifestyles and moral living that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all Scary, but just plain Sickening","review":"The books starts out a cross between The Stand and The Day of the Living Dead and goes downhill fast. It contains way too much carnage for my tastes and had me sick to my stomach at times - not in a good kind of way either. The plot was interesting but not well researched or explained. And like other books by King, it contained an ending that just kind of stopped short. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Clunky Writing!","review":"OK, it's a neat theme, and as usual King know how to keep you turning pages. But there are so many turn-offs. Changing from calling the flesh-eating zombies from \\"Phone Crazies\\" to the less judgmental \\"Phone People\\" -- this is political correctness gone crazy! And beating on the harmless dude who quotes scripture, then praising Massachussetts gun-control laws and characterizing the boy Jordan who wants to fight the zombie army as like a \\"Muslim teenager {strapping} on a suicide belt stuffed with explosives.\\" Come on! Is Stephen King running for office somewhere, or what? All the references to movies don't really help to make it topical either -- they detract from the immediacy of the situation, a weakness King has always had with his long expository pages in the middle of action that must be taking place in a few seconds. I'm sorry I read this. King HAS written some good stuff in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I ever read.","review":"I kept thinking if I read more it would have to get better,so much for that thought.

After the first 20 pages, I only finished the book because I finish all books I start. It was so awful it made me angry to even pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"As energetic as a zombie's shuffle","review":"I dig zombie flicks. The claustrophobia, the apocalyptic end of the the world hugeness, the flight from a ravenous cannibalistic mob and the perpetual need to hole up somewhere safe. This book just glanced those themes and the \\"zombies\\" (actually just brain addled living humans) themselves turn out to be telepathic? I give credit to King for creating HIS own world of a \\"zombified\\" apocalypse but it reminded way too much of The Stand. But it wasn't a true zombie novel. The pacing was a little jerky and the characters themselves didn't really portray real human reactions to a horrific catastrophe. I wanted to be scared. I was distracted.

This one, however, disappointed me. It seemed a bit pat, not enough detail or clarity, and just generally not as gripping or interesting as so many of his others.I will continue to read his work, but if you are a first-time King reader, you can give this one a miss for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captivating, but in the end, cheap.","review":"Although I haven't read more than 2 or 3 Stephen King books in my life, I have read a lot of fictional authors such as Michael Crichton and Frank Peretti. I found the first 2/3 of this book to be very well written for it's style and feel. I was captivated, interested, affected, and even scared. Unfortunately, as with many movies out there, the ending killed it for me. I found myself confused and lost late in the book and the end actually angered me a little. Not much was explained or resolved. It just ended. Like he got tired of writing and just decided to stop. It was like being involved in a really wonderful story with a main character that you've identified with and come to care about, and then the author just writes, \\"And then he woke up, and it was all a dream\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ending yet, thanks Steve","review":"Stephen King has a history of writing bad endings to his novels. Nevertheless, his great beginnings and middles have led me to read almost every novel he's ever written. However, the ending to this one may cause me to reassess. The book is interesting, although not up to par with his earlier stuff, but the ending is soooooo disappointing. You may want to stop here if you plan on reading this. Essentially, in the end, you want to know what is going to happen to the main characters who were not affected by the cell phone pulse, who exactly was behind the pulse and how did it work, and what will happen to the main character's son who has been affected by the cell phone pulse. Well, forgetaboutit, because Steve ain't gonna tell you. It's up to you to supply the ending. What a ripoff. If you are a die-hard King fan, I suppose it won't bother you.

I, for one, was convinced that vampires actually existed after reading Salem's Lot and would take the long way around so that I wouldn't have to walk pass a sewer grating, being convinced that I would see balloons down there if I looked too close.Stephen King is truly a major voice of the \\"baby boomer\\" generation and will always be the undisputed King of Horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Forget those blithering reviews above..Save your $$..

Just awful....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing assignment?","review":"Anticipating a good read I took this book on a long flight. The only reason I read it to the end was that my other choice of reading material was the SkyMall catalog. I was quite disappointed. This book reads as if a bright high school student was assigned to write a book mimicking a famous author, chose King, read the Stand and began to write. At some point the student realized that the assignment was due and simply ended the book. If I had been the teacher I would have given the student an \\"A\\" for imitating the writing style, a \\"C\\" for character development and an \\"F\\" for plot.

It starts fast and has a good premise, the ending though absolutely killed it for me. It completely leaves the reader hanging and doesn't resolve a single issue raised during the course of the book. It's like King hit the date for his deadline and just stopped writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Stayed Bachman","review":"In his typical fashion, Stephen King leads us to believe in the first few paragraphs that he may have finally returned to the voice that we all fell in love with. Sadly, this is not the case.\\"Cell\\" is as badly contrived a novel as I could have ever imagined. One-dimensional characters, a farcical style and voice, his ever-present use of slang words for anatomy, and his creepy penchant for including teenaged girls in his stories. King's use of street-level geography bogs down the reader, making us concentrate more on where his characters are physically rather than where they are emotionally. Anyone unfamiliar with Massachusetts is apt to put down the tome in a few minutes, once they get past the macabre opening scenes in which people jump from skyscrapers and gnash at each others' throats with their teeth.Unfortunately, the days of the King are gone, leaving us all wishing for Bachman in all his glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply boring","review":"I cannot believe this book was written by the same author who wrote The Stand. Halfway through reading the book I put it away for a couple of weeks just to see if I would enjoy it more after a break. Nope. It was still as boring then as it was when I initially started reading it.Could be that Stephen King has run out of ideas for a novel?Or could it be that his editors simply let him coast on his once-justified fame? Either way, save your money, skip this one and wait for his next novel to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't care less","review":"The book is tiresome and obvious. The dialogue between the characters (at least as far as I read, about a third of the way)is dull and cliche ridden.The most significant thing (and the reason I stopped reading) is that I cared more about the dog whose ear was bitten off early on than I did about any of the human characters.I have enjoyed King's work in the past, but he seems to have forgotten what makes us care about his characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like \\"The Stand\\" in plot and characters!","review":"I liked the book (didn't LOVE it, like I did \\"The Stand\\"), but it is not something I would read again as I have some of his other books. Speaking of \\"The Stand\\", this book was, to me, just an updated version of that same plot. Population dwindles (The Pulse replaces Captain Tripps), those left are \\"good versus evil\\", and we even have the Harvard Man taking the place of Randall Flagg! Too many similarities for me. I wanted to read a new plot, with new twists, and not just an updated version of something that he already wrote; albeit, many years ago. The initial premise was good, but the development of the story was like déjà vu to anyone who has read \\"The Stand\\". Come on, Mr. King, aren't there enough NEW scary things out there for you write about!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea but boring","review":"The topic was a great idea.

Does anyone else here agree with me that it was not absolutely necessary for Tom to leave the poor guy behind?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending","review":"Other individuals told me before I read the book to not read it because it was so bad. However, as a Stephen King fan, I ignored their advice. Wrong decision. This book goes along fine until the end.

Having said that, \\"Cell\\" is a bad book, possibly his worst. There are good and interesting moments. (Read: \\"Cinematic\\" - coming to a theater near you by Christmas...) The gore is well done, the premise is interesting. But we've read significant elements of this book before and it's disheartening to read them warmed-over here. The ending is an unsatisfying cop-out involving a character we never knew and find it hard to care about. Fortunately by the end it's hard to care about any of the characters or plot elements. The whole effort is limp and unworthy of Big Steve."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old garbage","review":"This book is total garbage and has no redeeming literary qualities whatsoever. And, ironically, I enjoyed reading \\"The Stand\\" and the enormous sweep of that book and quirky characters King created. \\"Cell\\" doesn't even come close to it and seems highly contrived. King seems to rehash the same old gorey themes and makes no attempt to achieve any literary standards, as if he's capable of that.I couldn't finish the damn thing, it was so twisted and convoluted. And I hate cell phones as bad as King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and tough to get through","review":"I couldn't wait to get this book and was shocked when I realized that it took me a month to get through it. I'd read a couple of pages, get bored and find myself daydreaming about something else. I'd put the book down and try again later. None of the characters grabbed a hold of me nor were they able to keep my attention. Very disappointing book, and I will never buy a SK book again because of how much energy it takes to get through them. No enjoyment factor with this one folks. Pick another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Stephen King please come back...","review":"Cell: A Novel, was a gift given to me.

If it weren't for Stephen King's name no publisher would touch this dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"King should have quit while he was ahead","review":"What a really awful book. Stephen King has definitely gone down hill in his writing skills as he had gotten older. He said a couple times that he was going to quit writing and he certainly should have before writing this book. The story starts with an interesting scenario, cell phones wipe human brains clean (like a hard drive), but then he doesn't know where to take it from there. It becomes totally convoluted and silly (stupid actually) after a while. I forced myself to finish the book, but I couldn't help but skim the last couple hundred pages. I highly recommend readers avoid anything written by Stephen King in the past ten or fifteen years. Certainty avoid this monstrosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for a decent read, but...","review":"...King has fallen into a very predictable pattern with his endings lately. I was able to predict the exact moment that the book would end long before it did. It's not a great way to end the book...he ends it sort of like how he talks about _Lord of the Flies_ ending in _Hearts In Atlantis_. It was a pretty good ride most of the way, I am invested enough in the characters that I want to know what happens next, but I can move on. This one seems to be completely removed from the DT timeline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"Quite good despite King's obvious lack of technical knowledge about our cellular system (this bothered me some as I work in the industry). Some classic King gore along with a good old fashioned apocolypse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just finished reading Cell...","review":"...and thought it was really good. I took me less than a week to read, and stayed up way too late one night to finish it. I normally don't like the way Stephen King ends his book, but I liked this one. It was a bit of an odd story, but was a good one none-the-less. If you like Stephen King, you will enjoy this book. It was one of the better books of his I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable.","review":"I enjoyed the story very much, but the ending left something to be desired. In all it is a good futuristic take on zombies, and the characters and their interaction was great. I couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dropped Call","review":"You know that cell phone commercial where the person misses important info because the line goes dead? CELL is like that. A powerful, gripping, unexpected, can't-put-it-down page turner...but it feels like the last chapter is missing. Perhaps a better analogy is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN or even THE LADY AND THE TIGER. Don't go into this book expecting to have everything resolved and answered, or like me you will shake your fist at ol' Uncle Steve, wherever he may be. Who knows, perhaps a sequel is in the works? Or perhaps some things are better left unknown. Either way, it's a ferocious good read, and it's a measure of how enthralling it was that I dearly wish there'd been another 50 pages or so. Or even an epilogue. Can you hear me now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a conversation with an old friend","review":"I'm giving this one a 5 star rating because reading Stephen King after all these years is more like having an interesting conversation with a good old friend. Doesn't matter what we talk about anymore, just so long as we are together and the words are flowing. It would be unfriendly this far down the line to do anything but listen. King is the preferred storyteller among my greater group of literary friends. And CELL is as good as anything else we've ever talked about."},{"rating":"1","title":"No ending?","review":"This was one of the most interesting books I have read. Until there was no ending. The book stops. It builds up to one of those moments that makes suspense/horror novels so gripping, and then it stops. Its as if the publisher only gave King a number of letters and spaces his book could contain, and he reached the limit exactly before the end. Perhaps he decided that there was no interesting way to read it. Even a bad ending would be better than a non-ending, at least in my opinion.I cannot suggest this book for two reasons. It was interesting enough to read, especially the beginning, however there are much better zombie or rage virus style books. One simply expects more from the master of horror. It would be a upper mid-grade contender in a genre with limited competition, although the lack of an ending is so stupefying that one almost regrets getting caught up in the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Beginning, Slow Middle, Awful Conclusion","review":"I'm not really into horror books, and haven't read but a couple of King's. I loved \\"From a Buick 8\\" and \\"Lisey's Story\\". This one, though, seemed to be written at about a sixth grade level. You really had to suspend reality to get through this one. How did people in different places hundreds of miles apart come up with the same terms, like \\"phoners\\", and \\"pulse\\", etc.? And I don't believe for a second that Clay, when he finally stumbles across his wife, would shove her out of his way like she'd never meant a thing to him. My biggest problem with the book is that King never tells us what caused the pulse, who did it, why they did it, was his son ever ok, did the world re-build itself, and on and on. I actually checked the binding of the library book because I was sure the last pages were torn out! I don't need an author to connect all the dots . . . just the POINT of the whole thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, slow, plodding \\"wanna-be\\" zombie novel.","review":"In the forward of King's new novel CELL, he dedicates it to the great George A. Romero and I AM LEGEND novelist Richard Matheson.That is where the mention of the trio in the same sentence should stop.This is just a \\"MESS\\" of a book. I am not sure where to even begin.Let me first start of by saying, that the \\"zombies\\" in King's story are NOT zombies. As a matter of fact, they have the ability of telepathy.Yes, you heard correctly I said: TELEPATHY!They don't eat human flesh, they eat twinkies and veggies.Character developement in the book follows the same silly premise.King attempts to compare the human brain to a desktop computer and his knowledge of a computer is child-like.Finally, the book is just plain BORING. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As with many readers, I got to the end of The Cell, and couldn't believe that there were no more pages to turn. I don't feel that another 200 pages were necessary, and some loose ends are fine by me, but another chapter would have gone a long way towards satisfying me. Normally I am able to finish a book like The Cell within two days - this took me over a week. It was very easy to put down and come back to an entire day later. I love (most) King novels, and sadly, this didn't do it for me. The Stand, Bag of Bones, Needful Things and Insomnia will always be my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It seems that the idea for the story was never fully fleshed out. King came up with an interesting situation - cell phones turning all of Western civilization into zombies - but when it came time to explain the conditions causing the situation, he was unable to produce anything more creative than a scary (and entirely implausible) computer program. The first half of the book moves along at a good clip when King's describing the carnage and immediate fallout of the cellphone conversion, but starts to drag badly when he tries to peek behind the curtain to discover what's causing the apocalypse.As a bonus, you'll get a healthy dose of left-wing opinion as King slings thinly veiled insults at the Bush administration, oil companies, and the traditional nuclear family. Thanks, Steve-O, but that's really not why I read your stuff.Too many loose ends and a terrible conclusion. Borrow it from the library, 'cause this isn't one you'll want to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total \\"cell\\" out","review":"I find this story so ridiculous that it can only be King's attempt to draw in a new generation of reader. I admit that I couldn't get very far in the book because it was just too stupid. The violence is so in-your-face and far-fetched that all I could think of was \\"this is written for 16-year olds.\\"I wish King would stick with what he does best and forget about pandering to the lowest common denominator. Leave the extreme violence and over-the-top gore to the low-budget teen films and get back to edge-of-the-seat suspense that his older, loyal fans love. Let the 16-year olds mature and discover true horror, rather than writing crap in an attempt to be discovered earlier.What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cell: a Novel","review":"Turned up in the post a bit dog eared but was an amazing read!Couldnt put it down.also a very easy read.another great one from the master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost loved the book.","review":"This book was so exciting that I couldn't put it down. I have a son so it took me about three days to read. Most people in the other reviews described the book pretty well so I really only have one thing to add......I hated the end. I shouldn't have been surprised because King has ended a few others stories like this. I was so disappointed I almost cried. Please don't expect to much from the ending if you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"This book is was well written like all of King's work (the reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1), but has a weak premise and an even worse ending. \\"Cell\\" relies too heavily on the \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" franchise, and the old theme of \\"modern technology is evil\\" to be original.The explanations in the book for the phenomenon called The Pulse, how it began, and for the actions (and evolution) of the people who are affected are so unbelievable that whole story falls flat. Outside of the main characters' need to survive, there's literally no reason for any of the events that occur in this book. Character development is almost non-existent (which might be a first for King).The writing is good enough to keep you entertained for awhile, but in the end, \\"Cell\\" is forgettable. If you haven't read Stephen King before, don't start with this book. Try \\"The Stand\\", \\"Salem's Lot\\", or \\"The Shining\\".Mr. King is my favorite fiction writer, but maybe it IS time for him to retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, it's a heavily padded novella","review":"As always, King sets up a wonderful premise, but you feel like you've read it before -- THE STAND. But with THE STAND you had various characters from all over the US and they each had backstories. Here, you have just a handful--and a pretty dull lot at that. Like THE STAND, they have to make a journey and that's where CELL falls apart--that's all it is, a journey. By page 50, you realize that's about it -- the Pulse is NEVER explained, and the pretty dull characters blow up stuff, have mind-visions, and then the book is over.If it had been a 50 page novella, I think it would have been more compelling and successful. At 350 pages, it's simply wearisome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down compared to King's other works","review":"The idea of this story was interesting, but it just fell short in its execution. The ending, especially, was such a let-down, just a \\"cliff-hanger\\" which is inexcusable when investing in a long novel. Stephen King is my favorite horror author - I love his classics, but not everything he writes can be a masterpiece, I suppose. It somebody else wrote this book, I would give it three stars, but I only give this two stars because I expect much more from King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the King Name Away","review":"I would really really LOVE it if King started to realise books under another name again (a fresh unknown name). I cant beleive that these books would even be published let alone get these reviews.Cell is a boring, long winded and terribly derivative book. There is no plot to speak of and criminally (when the zombie victims are really the stars of the book) there is no point, no rythme or reason, to try and justify any of the silly, pointless things the 'victims' do, nor do the actions of the characters make much sense.This might be ok if the journey was good anyway, but poor dialogue, unlikable and irrelevant characters and a lack of diversity kill that. It doesnt even qualify as a B movie actioneer.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Very Bad","review":"King can really tell a good story. But he does not this time. What could otherwise have been a good zombie apocalypse is spoiled by the author's constant pop culture references. It got so out of hand at one point I threw the book across the room when King had his characters (who were running for their lives at the time, mind you) weigh in on a fight in the media between has-been dj Moby and rap/actor Eminem. This is just one example. And there are hundreds. Every time you are about let go and enjoy the dark spooky narrative, a silly conversation like this popped up. Ruined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, so-so...","review":"MY BOY! LOOK WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO MY BOY! (lol) Sorry.You know...How many more stories like this do we have to put up with? You got Dawn of the Dead (both the original and the remake), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (both the original and remake), The Taking, Night of the Comet, War of the Worlds, on and on, even Red Dawn. Their internal components may be different (though interchangeable), but the premise is the same. Small bands of people on the run from the evil majority. It's become tiresome.This time the story surrounds a guy, accompanied by a handful of survivors, who's looking for his son amid a bunch of cellular-zonked zombies. I think I would've like it better if everyone got microwaved from their cell phones and their heads just exploded. The book would've only been about fifteen pages long, but I've always believed in quality over quantity.I don't know what's going on. Really good stuff is so damn hard to come by these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoned it in!","review":"Over the years I have read a lot of Stephen King books. I really had decided not to read any more because I felt like he was in the business of selling books rather than writing a good story. This book did nothing to prove me wrong. It was just one bloody disfigured person after another and a very thin plot line. The main story line really doesn't even make sense in the world of computers, cell phones and wireless communication. I can't recommend it and I think I'll be skipping the Stephen King novels again for a while. Hopefully, he will find his love for writing once again and prove that he has the talent we all know that he has."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC KING PAGE TURNER","review":"Suffice it to say I have neglected too much the past two days while I inhaled this story by the classic story teller.

This is one for thinkers with big imaginations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor man's version of The Stand","review":"Sorry-- I felt that way throughout the reading of this silly book, and before I read any review that referred to The Stand. When will King figure out that his shorter, tighter, and much better written novels/novellas, i.e., Misery, The Body, Shawshank Redemption, Rose Madder, The Girl Who Loved Tom Jones, and Dolores Claiborne (even Cujo), to name a few, showcase the kind of writer he could be, consistently. Even Dean Koontz eventually improved, although it took him almost 20 years. One last thing: the ending of this book made me want to throw it across the room. It was the biggest letdown in any King book I've ever read. Maybe in any book I've ever read. I would not recommend this book to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Re-Vamped Yawn","review":"The devastating plague which kills or drives mad half the human race ... the \\"zombies\\" with their love of blood and gore ... their strange and charismatic leader ... the brave little band of survivors strugging against terrible odds to reach safety -... the devoted father's race to save his child ... the secret which the good guys know and the bad guys don't, which enables good to triumph ... It's all been done before, and making the \\"plague\\" a mobile phone virus doesn't render it new or original. In fact, don't I remember King writing it already - wasn't it called The Stand?

Complete with horror and gore. It was fast paced as many Stephen King books are. My only complaint was that theending was not definative. It sort of kept you wondering what happened when the main character put the phone up to his son's ear. Also how the structure of the world would be now. Also would have liked a definative description of the source of the pulse including what it's purpose was. I suppose leaving these questions unanswered could allow for a sequal book to be written. It is now approximately four years since this book was written so I doubt it. But then it took King thirty-three years to finish the Dark Tower Series or a good number of years to write a sequel to \\"Tailsman\\" so who knows expect from Stephen King.

Steve has been off the boil for some time now & for this I forgive him. He has created such masterpieces in his long & illustrious career, that it would be impossible for any writer to keep up with such high & often genious standards. Shades of the old, brilliant Steve were evident in the Dark Towers 'Wolves of Calla', & in reading this I foung myself encapsulated in the good old days of 'The Stand', The Tommyknockers' & IT. CELL was a quick, economical read, devoid of any emotion or compelling story line, complete with a fistfull of vacuous, immature characters, wandering aimlessly in a desolate landscape. Disappointing, yet readable fluff, that only a recent reader of King could enjoy... delve into that back catalogue & find out what a real thriller is.

As most of the King novels, it opens swiftly, riveting your attention. While I'd agree with some of the commentary that the characters could have had a bit more development, I found this to be a good read that allowed me to envision each scenario vividly (a trait in King novels that I adore). Perhaps the ending is a bit open-ended for those who like their knots and bows neatly tied, but I was not bothered by it, nor did I feel short-changed.I do recommend this book, and if you've read King's entire works, then surely you will not wish to overlook this offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"I have to offset the tool before me that gave 1 star to this book. 1 star despite the fact you call yourself a king fan!? Have you read the dark tower series? You can see his writing style change. No kidding.ANYWAYS... review... review. Ah.. um well If you've read many other King novels you will have noticed that he takes upwards of 100 pages to develop characters and scene... whatever. The big difference in this book is his attempt to grab you on the first page. That was all it took. I remember being like 200 pages deep in salems lot and thinking \\"I hate this town\\". No, no dreary plot develepment not that I'm complaining but here you will find a unique piece of kings work. This book does not quit.

Reading King is like visiting an old friend...you always know it's going to be what you expect. Rarely are you disappointed...it's always just what you thought it would be. You like King's characters. You like the places he takes you. You like what he has to say. You don't always like where he leaves you in the end...but it's his world.I'm glad King still has books in him.

It only took me a few days to finish, but for the time that I was reading....Wow! I'm not going to give any spoilers, so I'll just say it's an adventure-style story with a lot of gore, although most of it takes place in the beginning. I haven't read to many zombie stories, but I think it's safe to say that King puts enough of a twist on his to make them very original. Overall, CELL is a fantastic read, well-written, and a must for any King fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tourists among Zombies","review":"This might have been an interesting idea for a short story (like du Maurier's The Birds), it might even have made an interesting novel if planned properly (like Crichton's Prey), but King just lets the narrative ramble on in a meandering way. The main characters are tourists for much of the story. They walk a lot and they look a lot, but they don't do much, and the things they do consist mainly of blowing things up; the American Way, perhaps, but hardly imaginative storytelling. It isn't even scary, because so little happens. If it weren't for King's fluency of language it would have been a torment to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"just terrible","review":"this book was bad from the start. he gives way too many details about unimportant things, and not nearly enough info on the stuff we all wanted to know. there were countless times when you'd read a paragraph and think, \\"wow, that doesn't add to the story at all.\\"almost every time someone says something, he follows it up with 2-3 sentences that pretty much amount to: \\"he thought about saying this, but then he thought better of it.\\"if you take out everything in this book that is pointless and adds nothing to the story, you'd lose about 100 pages. and you still would have to add another 100 to include the info that is never answered in the book. for a man that has been widely criticized for being long-winded, it's surprising he doesn't include answers to the mysteries in the book. it's a short and yet, long-winded novel.i woudln't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best King novel I've read in a while","review":"Cell is about the end of the world via cell phone. It's very timely, considering you can't get a darn coffee without having to hear someone else's onesided conversation.One afternoon people are going about their annoying conversations when suddenly all who were talking on the cell phones turn into bloodthirsty, violent \\"phone crazies\\". And those who own a cell but weren't using it at the time and make the fatal mistake of calling their loved ones, or 911, to find out what the heck is going on, turn all crazy as well. Soon most everyone has reverted into a raving lunatic. The story follows a small band of survivors who were lucky enough to avoid the cell phone crazy making message as they make their way in this strange new world. It's very violent, often sad and some of the action eerily takes place in my neighboring town!

Stephen King's stong point has always been character development. In Cell, what little there is, is poorly done.

With each new book, this rumor becomes more believable. This is the second book in a row (Colorado Kid being the prior) and the third book of late (Buick 8) that has no ending. The author, whoever's at the helm, just gets up from the word processor and walks away leaving \\"Constant Reader\\" unfulfilled.Gone are the \\"Classic King\\" stories, gone are the characters we love (or love to hate [ R.F. ] ) now there's bottom of the barrel writing fit for a third rate movie of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"OK, in all fairness, this is my first Stephen King novel. Surely, with all the success the man has had, with all the readers who love him, he must have written better than this. Neither the writing style nor the storyline inspired me.

King makes a very interesting point in this novel: people do rely on their technology more than they should. I mean to say that cell phones have their purpose in society today (I myself have one charging at this very moment), but we don't need to rely on them as completely as we do. Also, the whole idea of technological warfare is extremely interesting. It makes perfect sense that a terrorist organization will target the one thing in society today that would impact the most people. I mean, very few people do not have cell phones in the world today. It would be almost ingenious for someone to come up with a way to cause a Pulse that will turn those with cell phones into living zombies. The characters have depth behind them and the plot moves at a brisk nessessary pace that tells the story perfectly. Good job, Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"I read the \\"Stand\\" maney years ago and thought S. King was my kind of writer.

I have a wonderful collection of his works, all in hardback and most 1st editions. Over the past few years I have not been thrilled with a lot of his work, yet I continue to collect. This novel is one in which I tried to read, but only made it about two-thirds of the way through. King gives a whole new meaning to the word 'BORING'. After the initial 'pulse', there's very little action, and it gets to where turning the pages becomes a complete drudgery. I know King is good, and I hope he has a few good novels left in him; however, this one isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start...","review":"Ok, I'll have to admit - half way through, I lost interest and quit.

There's no real character development. I would like to know who Tom was before the pulse or what Alice was like before the pulse. It started off very strong but towards the middle it started to lag and then eventually stopped. I didn't feel like I was reading a true Stephen King book at all. This felt like a third rate 'The Stand' with cell phones instead of a flu virus. 'The Stand' was a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Stand","review":"All previous reviewers hit the nail on the head comparing to \\"The Stand\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".This book is not in the league of either,but may have merited a chapter in \\"The Stand\\".Overall I rate Stephen King a 5 as an author of my choice,I read all his books, but this story was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"an exciting read","review":"I'll keep this short. First, I had this book but I put off reading it due to other reviews that told too much about the book, i.e. the lack of closure at the story's end, etc.. Well, don't let the same thing keep you from reading this latest offering from Stephen King. I'm glad I finally dug in.The book is very reminescent of The Stand, which I have read several times and which still ranks as one of my all time favorites. It's true that the characterization may not be as full and rich, but you will still come to love the people in this story. King is good at making you care about his characters.I wish the book had another chapter or two added, but isn't that the mark of a good story -- that you just don't want it to end? Do yourself a favor and just read the book. It may not be as satisfying as The Stand, but in my opinion it's one of King's better novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's how it ends???","review":"The overall plot of the story is interesting, however the ending of this story makes the entire book not worth reading.

After reading many other reviews, I have to agree that the 'no ending' was aggravating. But I could have tolerated it if I hadn't been left with a million and one questions.

The premise of the story is brilliant; I must admit. By the time I got to page 35, however, I couldn't help but think of a story that was quite similar to The Stand.I was willing to let that notion slide but this story is lacking so much of the depth that Constant Readers find all too appealing in Mr. King's literary world. The characters are flat, the dialogue is boring, and I caught myself too many times, skimming the pages to find the \\"good stuff.\\"Don't get me wrong, Cell is chock-full of Mr. King's signature gory details but it's not enough to keep this reader's interest. His initial premise of the story was quite exciting but the style in which it is told gives me the impression that he had nothing better to do with his time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot written that made no sense!!!","review":"There is no question King has written some great books in the past, but this one is one of his worst.

I love it how he weaves many elements of his book into each other. In fact, Charlie the Choo Choo makes an appearance in Cell, as does \\"The Dark Wanderer\\" (aka Man in Black) in Clay's comics.I give this book 4 stars partially because it's Stephen King & partially because the book was very gripping up until the end (almost). However, the ending was in my opinion a little weak...it was predictable and frustrating at the same time.Bottom line: read the book, but don't expect it to be one of King's best.

The quality of these movies are terrible though - they only provide a full screen version that cuts off stuff on the screen, despite trying different display options. I knew the first couple of Gamera movies were in black & white, but they are so 'washed out' that I can't even enjoy them.

Unfortunately, the quality of the attachment to the wall leaves such a large gap between the hanger and the wall that it wobbles badly when touched. It's actually not very safe if you have a couple of things hanging, and then want to hang another item. The jostling could cause the other items to fall. I had to place a wooden wedge between the metal rack and the wall to stiffen the mount.

I concur fully with those who condemn the fact that we are constantly jumping back and forth from the stage to the orchestra. If the violins are required to play pizzicato, we cut to watch them pluck the strings. If a musician has a solo phrase, we watch him blow. Never does the timpanist strike a drum without the camera cutting to him. From what I can follow on stage it appears that that the production had a director who didn't trust the material and so worked in incongruous and silly bits. I still don't feel that I have seen this opera and certainly will not put myself through trying to watch this horror again. I'll stick to the CDs. You should, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly edited","review":"I have to concur; the performance is fine, but the editing is really bothersome. Face it: would you want to see a closeup of the oboist's beard, or watch the opera? At times, these cuts to the orchestra occur every 8 seconds! Kim Rasmussen (the editor listed) should be forced to spend the next few years listening to Billy Budd over and over again (and my apologies to all you Britten fans out there, but I couldn't think of anyone else that I dislike more)!Addendum: the video image itself is pristine, but all three audio tracks (inc. DTS) are very muffled. The DVD is probably my worst sounding opera.Addendum #2: Just played it again using the PCM digital through an Audio Research D-A over Kef speakers. The audio still sucks!

This happened after about 30 days of total use. Since the beds were used by an adult of average weight, and weren't subjected to any punctures or used as a trampoline, I cannot recommend the product.

It's easy to get in and out of (soooo much better than a simple blow-up). In cold temperatures, I'd advise putting a blanket on top before putting on a sheet; otherwise, even with the velvety top, it's like sleeping on an ice cube. With a blanket, it's toasty warm.

So I tried to return it, but Amazon won't process the return because it's more than 30 days. This policy makes no sense. Does this mean that everything we buy on Amazon we must use immediately? That might work for food, but not for all items - sometime you buy things for later use (like a guest bed) -- and now we're stuck with a pricey, useless guest bed?

AND, Rival will do absolutely nothing to help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk Fire Hazard","review":"I am so happy to see that other people have written similar reviews about this piece of junk. I used it 3 times thinking I had done something wrong. All 3 times my food was boiling or totally destroyed after 2 hours on LOW!!! I reported this to Rival who acted like they had never heard this before and tried to give me instructions on using a crockpot.I have 3 other crockpots and 6 crockpot cookbooks and use crockpots often. I thought a \\"Smart Pot\\" would give me more options. Was I ever wrong!! Unfortunately, my husband threw out the box and receipt from K-mart. This pot needs to be removed from the Market!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooks Way Too Hot!!","review":"I wish I'd come to this site to read the reviews first. I bought this unit, and woke up this morning to beef stew that was a burnt mess, even though I followed the directions in the cookbook that came with the unit. Do not buy this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as everyone says","review":"I have a very similar model to this one, the only difference is that it's white and came with an extra insert that allows me to cook two different meals at the same time. I completely agree that the lid doesn't seal the way it should and it cooks at a much higher temperature than any other crockpot but I still really like mine. I love the extra insert - it's nice to be able to cook a main and side dish at the same time. As far as cooking too fast I've actually been able to use that to my advantage. Sometimes I forget to start the crockpot in the morning but as long as I start it by 2:00, dinner will be ready by 6:00! I rarely ever use the high setting and I've found that the keep warm setting is the perfect low. I love that I can set the timer in half hour increments as well. I know there are a lot of negative reviews out there but I don't regret this purchase. I just hope rival will work the kinks out in their next model!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL PRODUCT!","review":"It cooks way too hot... FIRE HAZARD! Put on LOW and on top of my glass top stove -- the stove top was so hot that it felt like all four burners were on! Couldn't even touch it! All the veggies were mushy and unrecognizable. Chicken was tough and way overcooked! NOT HAPPY at all for $50.00! This could definitely cause a fire! I'm taking it back for a refund because it cannot be used. I emailed Rival a complaint about this product... cannot believe it hasn't been recalled with all the complaints I'm finding online. I want a new crockpot but will check reviews before purchasing another one! AWFUL PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like that rare or well done?","review":"I'm currently on my second crockpot of this particular model. I got the first one as a wedding gift, and when it crapped out 18 months later (one day it decided it was too cool to actually cook food anymore) I bought a new one and returned the old one in the box. Unethical? Maybe, but I was annoyed that a $80 crockpot lasted just a smidge above the 1-year warranty.Now, less than two years later (but past the warranty expiration) it is showing signs of doing the same thing as the last one. Like many other reviewers mentioned, the \\"high\\" setting scalds everything and always burns the liquids to the sides of the crock. Even the \\"low\\" setting used to be a little on the \\"boil until dead\\" side. Now, however, the \\"low\\" setting doesn't get hot enough to cook anything at all. I don't even really use it that often.I will be purchasing another brand of slow cooker this time around. It's not even worth fraudulently returning it for the same model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Lid broke after little use","review":"I am trying to get a replacement lid for this slow cooker and in fact it's a fast cooker. I had it set on 6 hrs and within 4 hrs I lifted the lid and the plastic lid broke (hint: don't buy plastic...stick with glass with no plastic ). I received this as a gift, but i WOULD NOT buy this product again. I am now shopping for a crock pot. Pretty sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine works great!","review":"I'm baffled by all of the bad reviews for this slow cooker. I have used mine several dozen times without a problem and cooked just about every type of recipe - roasts and vegetables, soups and stews, even lasagna. Yes, the unit does run hot, but it hasn't affected my cooking at all and I have yet to burn anything I'm cooking. The timer is a very nice feature, and the removable crockery makes serving and cleaning a breeze. My only complaint is that the lid rattles and will splatter on the coutner, so I gave it a 4 although it's closer to a 4.5. Maybe I got lucky with my unit, but I love this slow cooker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of space and money","review":"While its pretty on the outside, this \\"slow\\" cooker completely burned everything I put inside it on 2 different occasions. Both recipes (one was for chicken, one was for beef) said 10 hours on low. I even added extra liquid just to be safe. By 6 hours on low, both meals were burnt to a crisp. This cooker would be great if you were home to keep an eye on it, but if you want it to truly slow cook your meal, look for the older version that your mom used to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work properly","review":"After a long wait for this order to be instock I am sorry to report that the item does not work as stated.

I waited several months for delivery, the short 45 day return window has closed. So, if you order this item, you should check it out quickly for proper operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rival Crockpot","review":"Very disappointed.

A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooks too hot","review":"I received this top of the line Rival pot after returning 2 others to them because the new programmable pots were cooking too hot. After returning the first two I requested the old style but they sent this model. I do not recommend buying the programmable models until they work out the temperature problems. Their customer service is great for trying to please but I have given up on Rival and I am trying a competitors pot that got better reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing my husband is a firefighter","review":"I got this crock pot off my registry from my wedding and was so excited to use it along with a crock pot recipe book my friend swore by. Did everything the book told me to do and everything came out a burnt mess. The soup wasn't so bad, but the pasta, chicken, and a casserole were burnt except for a little scoop full in the middle. Huge dissapointment. Everything was cooked on low...This thing doesnt even deserve 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stays way too hot","review":"I was very disappointed with my Rival crock pot. It doesn't matter what setting that you use. Even the warm setting makes things boil. It looks nice, but it is just too hot. Stay away from this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had another slow cooker...","review":"My husband bought this for me for Christmas 2005. I was thrilled to get it since I had an older, smaller model. I had never burned any food in a slow cooker before I used this model. I couldn't figure out how to get it to cook SLOWLY. I finally called customer service and was told I wasn't using the right kinds of recipes. She told me that the pot had to be at least 75% full. I used her advice, but it still boils everything on every temperature level. I use it to make roasts and that is all. It \\"sweats\\" horribly and I have to put it on a cutting board so it doesn't burn my countertop. The handle cracked after 6 months. My biggest \\"ah-ha\\" moment was when I came home after a long day out. There had been a power surge, and it had reset itself. My whole meal was ruined and that is when I realized the value of a dial-knob slow cooker. Just back away slowly from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I wanted to like this crockpot. It is very nice to look at but that's about it. I follow the recipe directions and time settings only to come home after work to find the charred remains of what was to be a delicious meal. This happened twice and I don't want to ruin any more food! I have never had this problem with either of my previous crockpots. This will be returned ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't even used it, and it's already defective","review":"I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon. It was one of two crock pots they sold, so there wasn't much choice. I had to replace my previous Rival as steam kept coming out of the lid and spewing liquid everywhere, and the knob melted off!!Right away this lid doesn't even fit the crock. Not only does it rock back and forth, it has a gap in it that you can actually see inside of. I get that you can't pressure seal these things, but I can see steam, liquids, and what-not spewing from this one too. After reading the reviews of it being too hot, I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another unhappy customer","review":"I needed to replace my big crock pot quickly and this one the only one available. I wish that I had not bought it. Everything bad you read in the other reviews is true. I cooked chili in it on low and I came home to a burnt mess. When you call customer service you get a message that says \\"we are not open now please call back when we are\\" and no times! I guess you are just supposed to keep calling? Also the beep on the timer when you set it is VERY LOUD. You have to push the button for every 30 minutes of time. I try and set up the crock pot in the morning before everyone else gets up so I was unhappy about that feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm out $50!","review":"The first time this item was used, smoke and a powerful burning plastic smell came from the digital timer. After the third use (months later), the timer made a continual buzzing noise and the only way to make it stop was to unplug it. When I plugged it back in, it didn't work at all. At this point, the warrenty was up so I had no choice but to throw it away. Now I'm out 50 bucks for something I only used three times! Horrible product. Buyer beware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one temerature - HIGH. Bad product.","review":"I only use this crockpot for soups, temp is way too hot for other dishes. I have one with a divided crock which is a great idea for buffets...chili on one side, bean soup on the other. But you have to remember it has no low or warm, just HIGH, so you need to turn it on and off occasionally.I use the smaller crockpot I bought in 1979 to cook things that need more finesse. If there really were a high, low, and warm on this cooker as the company states, it would be a wonderful product. Unfortunately, the company claims are not truthful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, horrible","review":"I was sooooo happy when I read these reviews because I was ready to give up on slow cooking entirely. I have burned EVERYTHING I've ever cooked in this- I thought it was me! I'm actually a great cook and used to make fun of slow cooking, but with a family it made sense.I bought this because i had started with a smaller version and I wanted a larger crock pot with the 10 hour setting. I had some success with the smaller RIVAL, but it was simply too small to do anything except reheat soup. I thought I'd try this one since it was bigger, had more features, etc. WRONG.I promise I'm not exaggerating- after 6 hours in this thing (at the 10 hour setting) everything has been burned beyond recognition- I was told it was impossible to burn anything in a crock pot. WRONG.Seriously, get another one. I'm online now searching for a different brand that hopefully won't set my house on fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon should not sell this appliance!","review":"Dito on everything said in all the other reviews.

I wanted a larger capacity and stainless steel look. I have never been able to use this cooker and leave the house.

I'm back to using my old 15 year old Rival (smaller but totally reliable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable . . . before it finally died.","review":"I got around a dozen uses out of this before it finally died. The thermostat seemed to have some problems because recipies were done either way early, to the point of being burnt by the time I returned from work, or still needing a couple extra hours. Eventually, it just stopped heating up, so went in the trash.When it worked, it worked great, but I eventually trusted it as much as I trust our president. It kept telling me nice things and reassuring me that everything would work out great, but actions speak louder than words whether you're a crock pot or president of the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"ILP makes more money...","review":"While the poetry in this anthology deserves note, the ILP (International Library of Poetry) is exploitative and preys on the novice/unpublished poet. They achieve this rather neatly by promising to publish almost anyone (those deserving and those not) just to secure 'pre-booked' orders for their works. Even at that, if one wants to be 'published', ILP will do it for you; however, be careful of what you do or purchase from them. They are certainly 'for-profit' and think little of the authors that place faith in them. I can't deny that some of the work is very good...but I can say I wouldn't fund them with a dime. If you have it, enjoy it...if not, do not justify them with your $'s. I am published in a few of their anthologies but, I would never suggest someone purchase one!

I began using v1.6 and then v1.7 and have seen a whole host of issues raised throughout my experience with the product. Trefil's book certainly covers the basics in more or less complete fashion, albeit in a less logically organised manner than would be ideal. But it does cover most of what a new user/administrator needs to be aware of at the outset. It in no way attempts to delve into what 'really' goes on in the day to day troubleshooting process or provide a 'resource kit' style coverage, as with Microsoft's Windows Resourse Kits - if one purchases the book for this reason, they will be disappointed.

Unfortunately, the seal between them is bad, so you either have some of the gas leaking out of the seal or, if you try to screw them harder, are liable to break the rocket (both happened to us).

But even here, the clues are introduced as clumsily as in his Lucky Starr on Mars, where out of nowhere a character flashes what turns out to be the murder weapon.

She gets enough use out of one - maybe up to 3 days. I leave 1 in the bathroom & 1 in the kitchen. There is no odor, so that's good. Also the liner around the pad is light colored so it doesn't attract her attention to bite it. But if I'm gone all day (if I'm @ work) she might go crazy & shred it a little. But I think she's getting better, now that she's a little older, maybe she outgrew that stage. (I hope so - because sometimes she ate the plastic & padding!!!)It could be a little thicker - but at least it absorbs. I ordered another pack - this time the larger ones.

I agree that you might want to freeze what you don't use because you will want to use every drop of it! Great value, precious product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I found this book to be too unrealistic to enjoy fully. True, it's Christian Fiction literature, but everyone in this book that has any relation to the main characters is a Christian, too. It's just too cozy that the business partner, doctor, laywer and judge share the same faith as Tess and her friends. I agree with another reviewer that the dialogue is too unrealistic and stilted - it seems forced somehow. I'm aware that infertility can be heartbreaking and a real cross to bear for some families. As tragic as it is to be unable to conceive a child, it took Tess well over 80 pages to stop whining about it. That coupled with her inconsideration toward her husband's desire for a child (naturally conceived or adopted) just irritated me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"This book was my first attempt at reading from the Christian fiction genre. I wish I had picked something else as I was severely disappointed.This book sucked on a number of levels: The writing was stilted, the dialogue stiff and unrealistic, and the main character, a 36-year-old affluent infertile woman, was unsympathetic and stuck-up. (She goes through a change of outlook, but it comes off ridiculously unbelievable.)She calls herself a 'baby Christian' in so many words throughout the book and that is the way she came off 99% of the time. She doesn't even realize that we're not living under Mosaic law anymore by not wanting to work on the Sabbath by having a work-related conversation with a colleague.Maybe there are some other books out their in the Christian fiction realm that address infertility struggles a little more down-to-earth than this pathetic attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Reference Book but not a good 1st book on the Rising","review":"This is a good book to read for those who are very interested in the uprising. It is NOT a good idea to read this book before reading a current and comprehensive book about the Easter Rising. This would be a good follow up to either Coogan's or De Rosa's books on the subject. It was written and compiled by the Irish Times who was decisively against the uprising and this is very clear in some of the analysis in the book. It also has some inaccuracies and errors that can be explained by both its political prejudice and the proximity in time to the Rising in which it was compiled. It is a mandatory book for those of us who are hopelessly obsessed with those events so long ago in 1916"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job in describing a tough race","review":"Not only does this book describe the toughest race in the world, it really gives a detailed description of the whole race event and the people who live and work in the far north.

After reading, and now re-reading, this book I wanted nothing more than to pack up, quit my city job, and move to the Far North in search of a life dominated by weather, dogs, and the will to survive. John Balzar does a great job describing a life dependant on dogs and neigbors (even though they may be 50-100 miles away) in the huge landscape of the Yukon and Alaska. Although the book mostly focuses on the Yukon Quest dog-sled race, it gives the reader an intriguing look into the culture of the people in and around the dog-sledding culture and the Quest itself. Definately worth the read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"At times I wasn't sure if this book was about the Yukon Quest race or the author mourning the loss of the great white north.There wasn't enough detail about the race, perhaps because Balazar didn't run the race... he hopped from checkpoint to checkpoint and drank beer.

I can't really draw any conclusions at this point. I will say this, the front of the label should say powder on it. I purchased it assuming that these were tablets. The reason why this is relevant is that as a powder, it dissolves very very very poorly. It basically just cakes in water and oftentimes sticks to the spoon that I mix with as well as the sides of the cup I drink from. I would NOT recommend the powder form until they develop a more dissolvable form. Perhaps the tablet/capsule is more effective.Good luck :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save on shipping and just set fire to 120 bucks, it'll give you the same performance gains!","review":"Bought the Airaid TBS for my 2007 Nissan Frontier.

Nevertheless, the collection showcases Petula's lovely and expressive voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats like these","review":"I read the reviews before buying these. We had them when I was growing up and I remembered the quality being rather low and eventually the top piece broke off and we were just left with the bottom piece stuck to the wall. It seems similar things still happen or else they just didn't stick at all. But my husband really wanted these for our cats, so I warned him ahead of time that product reviews showed that they should be nailed to the wall.So that's what we did. We dismissed the sticky tape and nailed the comb up and filled it with cat nip (someone had mentioned they couldn't figure out how to refill the catnip after the comb has been installed, but it is possible and very easy) and the cats started coming around. They weren't going crazy over it and I won't even say it's used a lot, but at least daily a cat or two will walk over to it and scratch up against it. At the end of the day, it wasn't a bad buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mounting tape does not stick","review":"This product is similar to ones I have purchased for my two cats in the past, with one exception...the plastic on the back is too slick for the tape to stick! I ended up using another brand of foam tape to adhere it flat against the wall, because it would not stick at all when bent around a corner. The cats tried to use it but it didn't have the same effect. I will try to find another brand of corner comb in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat really loves this.","review":"I had one of these years ago and then we moved and I went to the store and couldn't find it anywhere. My cat had used it all the time to rub up against and I really wanted to find another one, so after trying every pet store, discount and retail store in town I found it online. It was very inexpensive and was just what I had been looking for. The only complaint I had was that my old one stuck really well and for some reason, even though I had cleaned the wall before sticking it, kept falling off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good for some cats","review":"It's not really a good comb, so even if my cat chose to use this product, I can't see it helping. Maybe on raelly long haired cats it would help with the grooming issue. I could see that it would be something a cat would love, though. Mine doesn't, and that's unfortunate. He figured out how to get the catnip out pretty quickly, and doesn't give a rip about the rest of it now. Unfortunately, I'm scared to take it down because I don't want it to peel off the paint, so we're stuck with an ugly thing that doesn't get used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"My cat uses the comb sometimes, though not as much as he uses the coffee table or my leg to rub on. I had to nail it to the wall to keep it from falling off and the plastic pockets are hard to work with. However, for the price, I'm happy and my cat is happy. Desired effect was to give my cat something to rub on besides the wall and it was achieved. Kitty is happy, so I'm happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"I wasn't expecting anything heavy duty, but this won't even stick to the wall. There are 4 pieces of small double side tape (thin, barely tacky)to attach this to a corner wall. Considering this probably costs 20 cents to make, they could have put some decent sticky tape. Bottom line is I have to purchase something else, to make this product work which is poor quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Cats Love It","review":"I bought these as a replacement, and they're as popular as the first. I've screwed one into the wall because, as another reviewer pointed out, the mounting tape is not up to the task.

The cats really love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This recent edition of this comb and groom is inferior to prev.","review":"This product stinks. The comb does not stay attached to the backing as they have removed the pegs that hold it in place. It also arrived without the sticky strips and I have no way to attach it. I called the company and they ignored me and hung up twice. I would NOT buy this or recommend it in its present condition of cheap China mfg. It used to be a wonderful aid for my three cats and they loved it and it lasted until my 21 year old died and I disposed of it. I got a new cat now and wanted this product for him. This is a worthless piece of cr-p. No help or desire to help from the company. They hung up on me TWICE.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"My cat regularly rubs her face against a certain wall corner in my house, leaving a smudge I have to wipe off, so when I saw this I knew she would love it. It installs easily, in about two minutes. She started head-butting the frame before I even got the combs attached! In retrospect, I'm not sure I even needed to put catnip in the little reservoirs, but it certainly got her attention.

On the first, the sticky pads you are given to put it on the wall did stick. Until the first use and it fell off. On the second, the sticky pads were dried out upon arrival and weren't even sticking to the comb, least wise the wall.So I got out my Goop adhesive and tried to glue it to the wall. As soon as I let go, it slid down and off the wall.So I got out my E6000 adhesive and tried again. Same results.So I got out some duct tape and glued it again and this time taped it. After a few hours I removed the tape on one and it actually stayed up, until a cat used it. I left the tape on over night on the other and took it off this morning. It's still on the wall, but no ones used it so far.End result...cat's love it, but it probably will have to be nailed permanently to the wall for them to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails in one very important feature: sticking to surfaces","review":"This product is exactly what you'd expect, other than one very important feature: it doesn't stick to walls or doors, which is sort of the whole point. I don't mean your cat will eventually rub it loose if your cat's a really enthusiastic and forceful rub-against-er. I mean, you'll stick this to the corner or thew all or door and it will fall off the first time your cat touches it.Other than adhesiveness, the product is solid enough to work. If you have some alternate plan for how to affix this to a surface (glue? screws? magnets? hammer and nails?) you might be able to make it work. I haven't thrown ours away, though my cat has never been able to rub up against it for more than a second. Seriously, if I didn't care at all about the wall, I'd just glue it. I'm holding onto it, in case I get some kind of clever idea for making it stick to the wall like it's supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy","review":"This thing is sitting on the floor in 3 pieces right now, again. The pads are not fixed to the frame and come off with the slightest touch...like when your cat rubs on it! then the frame also doesnt stay on the wall with the included double sided tape. I bought 3M stuff that should work better but the pads will still fall off. My cat loves this thing so I have to find a way to make it work but as is it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cats just didn't like it!","review":"I really thought at least one of my two cats would like this because she's always rubbing the side of her face and teeth on my coffee table and ruining it. I set it up and put the catnip in it and even tried taking the brush part out and showing my cats that it was a brush by brushing them but they only took interest in it for about 20 minutes while they tried to bite the catnip out of it. Then they never gave it another thought, even when I tried to direct their attention to it.A note about the whole process of getting this thing to stick to your wall: As some people have mentioned, the plastic this thing is made of does NOT want to stick to anything. It's a huge design flaw. I had to first sand the plastic to rough it up and then SUPER GLUE some command strips to the back of it to get it to stick to the wall.Needless to say I should have saved myself the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"pot of sound variety","review":"When I first got this CD after compulsively watching the movie several times over, I have to admit that I was a little bummed that not all of the songs I was expecting to hear were there.

A strong man can put it in place and take it off, but most of the time it takes two to get the holes lined up and the hitch lock in.2. Folding up is way worth it! Every time I went to a park for a tournament I dropped off my load and then someone would need something from a store. The ability to fold this up makes this hitch stand out.3. You'll need some heavy duty tools to put this together. Some of the bolts have to be tightened to a certain torque. I took it to my mechanic who put it together for me. I recommend you consider that unless you have a torque wrench.I think this is a great value and am very satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid, sturdy rack","review":"The rack is well built and very solid. It was very easy to assemble and is stable with a heavy load on it. As others have said in their reviews, the packaging is absolutely horrible. The box arrived with holes all over the place. I wouldn't have been surprised if the hardware had fallen out but I was fortunate to find it intact. Due to the rotten packaging the rack is scuffed in a number of places. Sure, a bit of Rustoleum spray paint will take care of it, but why should we have the bear the expense of fixing up a brand new item? Valley should get their act together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"After a long search for a hitch hauler, I decided to go with this one. It is the best value that I found and has done a great job. I have a 99 Ford Expedition and it fits perfectly, especially the fold up feature. Best features, folding feature, adjustable assembly that allows you to fit the hitch you you vehicles size. I used this product for the first tome over the holidays and drove from Texas to San Diego to Lake Tahoe and back. It was very stable and no noise problem. I used rubbermade totes and cargo straps for my cargo and had no issues. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a great hitch hauler. I got the best price on Amazon $115.00 with free delivery, about $40 cheaper than everywhere else. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Title Says It All","review":"This is a great book for toddlers and preschoolers who are learning to put on their clothes. It is not a book on music, but on dressing, just as the title states. My son enjoys looking at the different ways people shower and put on their clothes and comparing how he bathes and puts on his clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"a golden oldie","review":"I have bought several copies of this book over the years, and have recommended it to others. The idea for the book is very engaging, and the drawings are priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Philharmonic Gets Dressed","review":"I am a music teacher and I was purchasing books for my classroom.

The illustrations would not be appropriate to show in any classroom without causing quite a few laughs.I think I could share the book with my own children , but would not recommend this for any teachers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pictures, but for kids?","review":"The book is adorable, but I found the drawings of the people in various undergarments (or none at all) on to be a little too much to give to my 5-year-old nephew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Details kids 4-8 don't need to be concerned about","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I, guess, as a musician I was hoping for more emphasis on music and not twelve pages on bathing, showering, shaving, putting on underwear...well, you get the idea. It's the first Reading Rainbow book I have not liked at all. I had planned to give this to a friend's children but I defintely will not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increasing the probability of solving probability problems","review":"After being out of school for ten years, this book proved to be essential for my M.S.E.E. course in Random Signals. This book concisely summed my undergraduate engineering Signals class with solved problems. In addition, the solved problems acted as a guideline for my Master's class. I felt that I could not have gotten through my class without this book.The reason why I ordered this book in the first place was the advice of my professor. My professor is a Ph.D. in the telecommunications workplace, acting as an adjunct professor. This working Ph.D. continues to use his well-worn Schaum's as a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Why can't textbooks be like this? I want to learn and actually do the problems. Textbooks seem to have obscure problems that have little explanation. This book has real problems professors assign, and this book demonstrates how to solve these problems! I want to do well in my classes, and this book helps me do just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay the hell away from this book","review":"I don't care whether this book is for comedy or not. It trivializes something that should be taken seriously. Infidelity is a huge problem in America and it needs to stop, not be encouraged. Tell you what McCullough...why don't you use your wit and intellect and write a book on how to STAY faithful to your wife. Seems like a lot more people need that than anything else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmmm","review":"I liked the Modern age, but what made me mad was the Heroic age. Couldn't Michael Han Friedman make up his own story instead of copying Brave Heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important point in Klingon history","review":"A scroll recovered from an archeological site throws into doubt the story of Kahless the Unforgettable, who is revered by the Klingons. The clone of Kahless enlists the aid of Captain Picard and Lieutenant Worf to prevent opportunists from using the occasion to effect a coup d'etat.Although his prose is frequently clunky, author Michael Jan Friedman passes the test of a Star trek author, which is whether his novel would make an effective addition to the filmed canon. He has a firm grasp of the characters and his story fills an important gap in Trek history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice and great attitude","review":"You won't find any dancehall slackness in this CD. Most of the lyrics have a highly positive spiritual theme, with bit of romance in the mix. There is also nice variety in the music, ranging from roots (albeit digitalized) to a couple of smooth soul numbers, that really shows off Luciano's range as a singer. He has a rich, very pleasing voice. Strongly recommended, especially to those (like me) who tend to think (I used to think) that nothing good came out of Jamaica after about 1982."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Useful Guide?!? What a Joke!","review":"Unfortunately, Fodor's chooses to flatter sites/hotels/restaurants that are not even worthwhile in this adjective-laced and over-priced guide. Many of the \\"magnificent,\\" \\"remarkable,\\" and/or \\"extraordinary\\" sites mentioned in this guide were far from it. It lacks any candor or frank descriptions. That's not all, it gives no directions to hotels or restaurants and once again describes substandard food as \\"wonderful.\\" I am also curious to know where these rocket scientists came up with their definitions of nice, clean and exciting. The book is a bust, go with another guide, it was a waste of my money.

Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"Even if you don't normally think dictionaries are fun, you will enjoy this one. It is laid out in a manner easy to understand and the entries include humor, both British and American in style. There are some things that are never explained to my full satisfaction, but overall I enjoyed it and will continue to have fun with it.If you like BritComs, British movies or other Anglo-media, you need this book. Everything makes much more sense! If you enjoy English literature, this dictionary can help you understand things more fully, better than you ever could simply using contextual clues or a standard American dictionary.I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather outdated, but amusing","review":"British English A to Zed takes one back in time to a romantic age where an old people's home was called an almshouse, and a car battery was called an accumulator. Alas, this book is so outdated that it is not of much practical value to the average American who is headed to England. On the plus side, it is an enjoyable book full of rich expressions and makes good reading for those not in need of a practical reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it","review":"Don't miss this book if you are going to Europe. It really bridges the language gap between America and Britain. It is packed with useful expressions for everyday communication in Britain.

It is action-oriented, but has plenty going on behind the action for those who don't read Star Trek purely for action. I'm not generally a fan of Klingons, although I'm finally beginning to accept them as protagonists, so if I speak highly of this book, understand that that's an extremely high recommendation; it isn't as though it's coming from somebody who loves any book focusing on Klingons and their culture.If you're a fan of Klingons, this one can't miss. If you're a Kirk fan, you'll love it. One could quibble, and suggest that the relationship between Kirk and the Klingon commander is too congenial for the time period in which the book is set, but that would be an EXTREMELY picky quibble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for Klingon fanatics","review":"Welcome to the basis of the Day of Honor. Read about how Kirk's unorthodox thinking and Kor's honor and reason save a Klingon colony from total annihilation. A must read for all fans of the Star Trek universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Klingon books i read","review":"It is a good, good, good book. Many of Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Kathryn Rusch books are on the top of my favorite books list because they are entertaining, humorous and thought-provoking.In my opinion, Treaty's Law is the best Day of Honor book. As a matter of fact Treaty's Law is my favorite Day of Honor book. I admit I was disapoointed by the other three books.I also liked reading the Day of Honor book for kids entitled Honor Bound (DS9's young adult)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous documentary","review":"This film switches between contemporary footage of the first days of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship and detainees' recounting their experiences. There is no voice-over narration, which makes it particularly compelling. Great film for teaching not only about the Chilean dictatorship, but also about the creation of \\"otherness\\" that allows torture to occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfying","review":"This novel has lots of dips and turns, and despite all the hardships the main character Leo goes through, I really felt like her mental progression in addressing (or avoiding) the matters in her life were believable. One sign of the best of fiction is whether or not at the completion of the book you think the story could have been true. With the combonation of progresses and setbacks Leo experiences I found her completely understandable and I therefore thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loaded with facts and yet...","review":"...I had a hard time liking this book for anything other than trivia nuggets. The author seems to endlessly delight in pointing out errors or outright lies in any and all Gleason anecdotes. He also makes sure to include every unflattering thing anyone ever said about Gleason, with very few kind things to balance them out. While I enjoyed learning new things about Jackie Gleason, I finished this book with an overall feeling that the author not only disliked him, but is almost jealous of Gleason's success, and tries to compensate for this by portraying Gleason as negatively as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean spirited and self righteous","review":"This author takes every opportunity to take The Great One down a few pegs. Even when begrudgingly admitting Gleason's strong points (such as his generosity and support of civil rights), there is an underlying tone of judgement throughout the book.Also, I kept waiting for the \\"Honeymooners\\" period to be discussed, but this entire period seems glossed over. No anecdotes, no behind the scenes tales...It seems the author just wasn't privy to much information and instead composed a smear campaign of a dead man. A shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good old days...","review":"The holiday shows bring back fond memories.

Jailed on trumped-up charges, Joanna Cassidy is Foxfire, an American superagent who takes on the most daring assignment of her career - clearing her name. She does this with the help of the President's seemingly idotic brother and his domieering butler along with a cast of others. This is an action-packed, heart-pounding, suspense filled movie that keeps you tunedin until the very end. That is if you like espionage dramas."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap quality","review":"This is an all-right item. The color is not as vivid as the picture shown, and the workmanship is poor.

It includes basketry, pottery, leatherork, stonework, metalwork, weapon making, weaving and more.It's not a how-to book, but explores materials used, their collection and preparation,techniques followed in their use and style and design. The author celebrates the artisans themselves with quotes and anecdotes and there is a wealth of photos.A brilliant resource for any student of Cherokee crafts, and an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really should have read more of this at Costco before purchasing it. It was well written, but the characters are just too flawed to be believable. Perhaps the author is just another one trying to capitalize on the gay/lesbian issues which are shoved in our faces far too often these days. I won't bother wasting my money on another of her books unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of her novels are very well written","review":"I look forward to her next novel as well.

Man, was I disappointed. I could barely get through it and thought a lot of it was unbelievable. Like the whole relationship between Jenny and Graham... really?

Definitely don't waste your time on this one - read Year of Fog instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream of the Blue Room","review":"I could not put down \\"The Year of Fog\\" by the same author, but I could not get to page 100 of this book. It made absolutely no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and unsatisfying","review":"I think this book had the potential to be a good story, or even a couple of good stories. Unfortunately, I found it to be a little confusED and confusING, unsure exactly what the author intended the story to be about. I think she may have tried to address too many ideas in one novel, which I'm sure can work in some cases but I don't feel it entirely worked here. I read after that the author didn't know what she was going to write about until she started and the story developed to her as she went along - I think that's quite obvious. I almost stopped reading after being 3/4 finished the book and I don't usually do that, but it was becoming too frustrating. Too many details didn't seem to add up, some seemed entirely unbelievable, and too many partial plot lines in turn left me unsatisfied with all of them. Unfortunately not a recommendation from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Michelle Richmond","review":"Not at all what I expected but a very compelling story with wonderful characterizations.

Mysterious, sensual, historically sound...this book crosses the line between real historical setting and occultish mystery very well. The true artistry in this work is the way the author ties the finish into the beginning of the story in such an invisible way. I am an avid reader of historical fiction and this book stands out in my mind these many years after reading it as an admirable deviation from the tried and true formula. Very sensual, too. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in historical Egypt, historical fiction, and/or mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad edition.","review":"I don't know if the movie is any good, as I wasn't able to watch it.

She says that the book helped her deal with the loss - which occurred less than 2 years ago. She has also told me she plans on reading this book every year, around the time of her daughter's death, in order to work her way into the story, to see more of it, understand more of it (and of course to help deal with her grief which intensifies annually at that time).If only physicians could always prescribe a novel instead of a medication...!I figure this novel worked better than Xanax.

I have a 110 year old house in Southern California with the original wood lathe & plaster. Over the years with earthquake shacking and the building settling the plaster had come loose in many areas. The plaster is solid but had lost the key action with the lathe. These washers pulled the plaster tight to the lathe and created a very solid wall surface. They allowed me to repair the walls instead of tearing it all out and installing drywall. This saved thousands of dollars in material and labor cost.One thing I found was, while screwing into the lathe works, whenever possible screw to the studs for best results."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 clips, 12 posts, 20 bucks - great price???","review":"The pricing of this hardware is shockingly high.

What is the fastest way to get news out -- by word of mouth. I challenge those who have read the book to pass it on to as any many people as you possibly can. Well worth it! I saw him last week in Washington and he is indeed a powerful lecturer. A lot of answers to my many questions were answered. Know that God speaks to all of us, each and every one through silence. You only have to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Create your own friendship with God","review":"This book provides a wonderful blueprint for creating a friendship with God. It really doesn't matter whether you believe that Neale is having a conversation with God. Simply use the information from this book and you will find that you can have a real friendship with your God.All of Neale's books are really written to inspire you to remember universal truths as they relate to you, personally. When you read with an open mind you will feel the truth of what is being said here. The insights you have can be wonderfully enlightening and even transforming for you.A key point in Neale's message is that he does not espouse that this is THE way or even a better way. This is just one way to be and you are the judge of whether it works for you. I personally believe that anyone who uses this information to create their own personal relationship with God will be delighted and amazed at what they experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far from the truth","review":"I only read the first eighty pages, but that was eighty too many. I have never read anything so far from the truth. I want to warn anyone thinking of reading this book that they should pick up a bible instead. As interesting as this book sounds, it twists the very basic truths of Christianity and waters down the real facts about our spirituality. Nothing in life can compare or replace true salvation in Jesus Christ. A life lived for Jesus is the most fulfilling thing one can do. Everything else is empty. Please consider God's true and living word instead, pray, and ask him to show you the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on Wishful Thinking","review":"How unfortunate that Walsch felt compelled to write this fictional dribble. At what cost will his false teachings and wonderlust damage those who seek truth and the an authentic relationship with their Creator. This book is based on his fantasy and is limited by his own thoughts, not on reality, for an infinite God is not limited by mans' finite mind. Strongly discourage reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Biblical","review":"When I got to the 2nd chapter I realized it was not Biblical. For example: God said \\"I would not command you to do anything.\\" Read your Bible, He commands us constantly. The Bible is the divine word of God. I do believe He talks to our Spirits if we are in tune with Him and through prayer, meditation and even through friends He talks to us. However, one way we can tell if something is from God is to find the confirmation through the scriptures. They're never wrong.Let's find Him in His word, not someone elses'."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need to read the BIBLE if you have questions!","review":"If anyone is confused about which religion is right, the BIBLE is what one should study, not a book which is simply someone's opinion.

Isn't that special! The reader from Kansas has it right. Even the original Moses didn't declare himself and God \\"friends\\". Wow! There must be a lot of desperate people out there. If they knew anything about the bible, tested by 2000 years of history, they would realize how shallow and self-centered this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't fall for this","review":"I was looking for some thoughts to move the idea of God from the dominating king that's extracted from the Bible by most religious thinking up to now, instead of the God who came to \\"walk in the garden in the cool of the day\\" and the one \\"true friend who sticks closer than a brother\\"; this is not that idea.Instead, this is someone first explaining how God told him it was okay to make lots of money from writing these books and keeping it for himself.Then you see a stream of random, everyday, thoughts, heavily influenced by culture, media, and outdated ideas that the author says is God talking to him. Then you read God quoting the NRA's and conservative media's position on the effect of video games and movies on gun violence.This is an embarrassing, limited view of God and the possible relationship that could be available to us.If you read it, please apply some critical thinking to the ideas presented here."},{"rating":"2","title":"insightful and healing","review":"Again, Neale Donald Walsh bring us great wisdom and healing. A must for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Friendship For Me","review":"Friendship With God, by Neale Donald Walsch, does, indeed, and to good purpose, rehash some of the ideas presented in earlier books.

In any case, if it isn't new to you, skip to the good part: God is no longer an unknown Entity somewhere Out There, Someone to whom we present our case and wait for Jdgement On High. Instead, He/She resides deep within my own heart, and yours, and you and I can have our own friendship with God. And I do, a fact that perhaps makes it easier to believe Neale's assertions that his words are the result of conversations with God. Kudoes, Neale."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a God!","review":"Forget the religious mumbo-jumbo and get in touch with a logical, no-nonsense awareness of who/what God is and how we are all connected. If you've ever tried with difficulty to express your inner thoughts, and if you describe yourself as spiritual rather than religious, then you'll appreciate how everything in Walsch's dialogues rings true. His books are not only enjoyable - they are liberating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual while subtle","review":"If you enjoy books that are spiritual yet subtle in their message, I imagine you may enjoy this one. Walsch provides the reader with personal insights that are intimate, humorous, and profound in expressing the power of faith, love and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendship with God","review":"This is definitly a \\"big picture\\" book, spiritual in nature but with limited appeal to a fundamentally structured Christian ethic. For those with an insatiable appetite, it acts as a lighter hearted continum to the trilogy, \\"Conversations with God\\" and while wordy in places with autobiographical reference, does a good job explaining in practical terms what life is all about. I would recommend it to those who want to continue down the road laid out so beautifully in the author's previous conversations. To those that have not experienced his earlier works, I would suggest starting with Vol. I, \\"Conversations with God\\" and continuing with the series before reading \\"Friendship\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure megalomania","review":"I hate to criticize something which people love, but this book and this writer cannot be instruments of God; both Walsch and \\"god\\" appear to be megalomaniacs. Please, please, go read \\"He and I\\" by Gabrielle Bossis, which is one of the most beautiful books ever written, and also purports to be a conversation with God. The difference between these books couldn't be more striking: in Walsch's you meet a \\"god\\" who could very well be a slurring drunk you meet at a bar, in Bossis' version, you meet a God of infinite goodness and beauty. Read both books and judge for yourself; or just read Bossis' and read something of true beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"White said it best -- Omit unnecessary words","review":"The author has some good thoughts to communicate -- none of them original. But, he uses so many words to do it. And, he repeats them. And repeats them. And repeats them. Ad nauseam.Furthermore, he presents a smug God. I find that very unappealing!He is one of the most self-serving writers I have read in awhile. Reading this guy is like reading \\"a fine Hearst publication.\\"Did the publisher employ an editor to review the work before printing? There are numerous grammatical errors.What he says is not new. Others have said it much better. Notably, Wayne Muller, in \\"Legacy of the Heart,\\" deals with many of the same issues and other important ones. However, Muller writes with respect for the reader, no interest in self-promotion and with a good purpose for the use of the profits from the sale of his works.Friednship with God is not a new concept. It does not require a semantic battle to sell it.It only requires faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Interesting to read, but more like wishful thinking.

In addition, I am going to buy it for several adult members of our family. A wonderful job, terrific format, very readable...

It is the beautifully told story of how children suffer when families split apart, and one family in particular. It tells how sisterly love, kind people, and an unconquerable spirit help one very young girl survive a childhood of cruelty, poverty and isolation. This book is expertly written, and the story so compelling, you don't want it to end. I do not read many books, but this one was recommended to me, and is one of the best I've read in a very long time. For a relatively short novel, it tells a great big story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strawberry Field - Excellent","review":"I loved this book. It is a marvelously written novel about one little girl's triumphant victory over the harshest of childhood misfortunes including abuse, abandonment, and poverty. It is told mostly in flashback through the eyes of the family court judge who lived and survived these ordeals, and is now an instrument in the lives of other neglected, abandoned children. It is a compelling and fascinating story, but it is not a downer. It is an uplifting story of optimism and self-reliance, told with such clarity of language, the reader feels every emotion experienced by the characters, so beautifully drawn, they leap off the pages. The spunk and spirit of the main character alone, makes you pull for her every step of the way. I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air Bed with Pump","review":"The service for buying was very good, It is saying here that I bought a Queen Double-High. Not so.

When I saw this was a Coleman, I hesitated because I've had very bad results from Coleman air mattresses in the past. But, it was cheaper than on Aerobed and the last time I bought I Coleman was years ago. So, I figured they should have gotten better by now, right? WRONG!Within two weeks, a large gash appeared at one of the circles and slowly started spreading around the circumference.

From the time I bought it in early August, I had problems with losing air every 2 days and with uneven distribution of air throughout the mattress. Once blown up, the mattress had a big lump in the middle of the mattress. The head of the bed would lose air first and deflate while the middle humped up. Finally, this weekend it started losing air every 6 hours. Last night the mattress deflated with a 1/2 inch hole in the middle. Now I have to try to fix it or buy another air mattress.

Comfortable. Typically used for family visiting 1 week. About halfway thru the week, you need to top the air off. This does not cause an issue for the guest sleeping (generally), but only that if you get near the edges, then one can notice the reduction in air. I give it 4 (instead of 5) stars because of the slight air drop, and that the plastic valve cover pulled off. The cover does not stop the unit from working, but it makes opening the valve a little more challenging. I still like this bed very much, and consider the best of the air mattresses we have owned. The pump is awesome. I would recommend it, and am looking to purchase one for a family member!One final note.. We have learned that a flat sheet works FAR better than trying to use a fitted one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased two; no leaks .","review":"We bought two of these, a year apart; the first purchase stayed perfectly inflated for about 18 months with no leaks, and kept it's shape. It's been deflated, moved, inflated several times since with no problems. The second one we purchased (identical but a year newer) is comfortable enough, but--as one of the other reviews stated here, when firmly inflated, the sides puffed out and sheets did not fit as well. It appears Coleman may have changed something... different plastic or whatever. Overall, good for an occasional guestbed... we haven't experienced air leaks in either mattress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly low quality","review":"Having friends over for a couple of days, I decided to buy an air mattress.

Well, after a couple of uses, the bed started deflating during the night ( I was extremely careful each time I put it away to avoid puncturing it )and now it deflates so much I cannot use it anymore...I did read the manual that comes with it and I did check the valve, the pump etc...I am not that dumb when it comes to this, so I guess I just wasted my money, a bad choice...poor quality. Don't waste your time and money, buy a futon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty sweet airbed","review":"The Coleman Queen Double-High Airbed worked excellently for me on both trips. It is pretty easy to inflate and very comfortable. It also stays inflated. My only complaint is that it is really difficult to roll it back in to the storage bag that accompanies it.

Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review of the Coleman Queen Double high bed","review":"I am extremely happy with this product. It takes a few minutes to inflate & deflate. Since it is a double high bed, it comes up almost as high as a regular bed, making it very easy to get in & out of. I also like the suede like top. It keeps it warm and helps the sheet stay on the bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Coleman airbeds and air mattresses are complete garbage. I purchased a queen sized airbed for $70, which totally deflated the very first time I used it. Unfortunately I was on a camping trip and needed to purchase a replacement the following day. The only store in the area was a Walmart, which only had Coleman air mattresses in stock. I purchased the air mattress and took it back to the campsite, only to find it also did not hold air. Not only am I out $100 now, since the stores refuse to refund my money, but my entire weekend camping trip was destroyed. I am going to stick with Thermorest air pads, which last almost forever.

I slept on it for 5 days, didn't find much problems. Filled the air 2 times to adjust the comfort in 5 days. From 6th day it started deflating it self. It became really mess during night to get up and fill it again. Probably, needed to use a little more reinforced material to last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Comfortable. If only it held air...","review":"This bed was so very comfortable for the hour or so it held air. I had to add air four times in six hours and still awoke deeply embedded in the bed.As the pump is a separate entity, I had to drag it out and connect it each time. Needless to say, I didn't get much sleep.Having used an AeroBed raised air mattress as my primary sleep mattress for the past three years, I am aware of how to care for an air bed and was careful not to over-inflate it.The valve itself did not leak; I will grant them that much. There must have been a weak seam or something because there were no visible punctures that I could find upon inspection in the morning.By the way, the trick to not losing air in the mattress as you disconnect the pump is to push in the double-lock valve before switching off the pump. Then just close the outer seal after removing the pump nozzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"what are you doing guys?????","review":"Tikkun and Dropped are two, in my opinion, of the greatest albums I possess.

With a mixture of sci-fy (the day repeating over and over, with no explanation whatsoever as WHY??)..sometimes the things going on, just didn't make much sense. Also, the music at times was,at least to my ears, extremely annoying, sounding over the dialogues, which at times, I just couldn't understand..THERE ARE NO CAPTIONS, OR SUB-TITLES AVAILABLE.Ahhh, I don't know, I actually didn't enjoy it...

After reading all the reviews and receiving this item I rushed to take it out of the case to watch it on my home theater system. Well,Disc 1 would not play!! As if it were from some other region or something. So , after taking a deep breath I went over to my computer to see if it would play there, and it did. OK! I can deal with this! I'll just have to watch disc 1 on my computer. That didn't work either the audio & video tracks were not synced together(that means when the actors move their mouths & then you here the word a few seconds later).That's truly how bad it was. How annoying is that. So, I called the company & explained & asked them to just send me another. I was refunded & told to keep it.

An outstanding production, excellent acting, great action scenes, an intelligent plot with loads of twists ... and if you loved Adam Baldwin in the other great (and cancelled) TV show \\"Firefly\\", you will appreciate him in this show. Most of the time when I see a bunch of 5 star ratings for a cancelled TV show I figure it is just a bunch of unhappy fans and NOT a true indication of a TV show's quality. Not so with Day Break. This TV show was a work of art. What a loss that this was cancelled while re-worked old game shows get put on the air during prime time. TV executives really are less intelligent than the general public. Want real entertainment? Buy Day Break ... support quality productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth it","review":"This series was taken off the air before the first season was completed. Well I am glad I bought this, because just as I had imagined, after week 5, it just keeps getting more interesting! The story spins into directions you can not anticipate.

The show was great.This DVD set, however, is the worst DVD set I have ever had the displeasure of trying to watch. The sound is awful. It's very hard to hear what the characters are saying over the background noise and music. The video is very grainy and it looks like someone filmed it with a cheapo home video camera. The lights are too bright, and the darks are muddy and hard to distinguish.I know this show looks and sounds better then what is represented on this set. Someone decided to re-release this to make a quick dollar and screw over consumers. Do not buy this set. You will be sorry. I am.

As described in other reviews it comes in a thick DVD case which should be able to accommodate the four or five Disc that you would expect with 13 episodes plus the extras. When you open the case there are 2 Discs in paper sleeves that sit in a pocket of the case. Very odd. After reading the small print on the DVD packages I did find that it states there are 2 Discs while the DVD packaging gives the impression that it would contain more. What a shame since it potentially had a chance to be a very nice set with the commentary extras.The good news is that this set was found at Target for $5. At that price it might be worth buying since the show was entertaining and did have some closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salt and Pepper...","review":"A relatively decent series.A little slow and aggravating at times.The white woman divorced from a white copand married to his ex black partner isgeneric.

The perfect mid-season replacement for LOST, requiring a little thinking to make the ride worthwhile. And was I PO'ed when they yanked it half way through the run. What was ABC thinking? Were they afraid we wouldn't get it? I couldn't catch the last episodes online, so I waited patiently for the DVD set and I wasn't disappointed. The acting, action, camera work, music, editing...it was all well above average for a TV series. Actually the cancellation may have been a blessing for the true fan since with the DVD set we can hear commentaries on every episode...and I've watched some episodes several times. Want a great way to spend 13 hours+, without the commercials? Buy this and you won't be disappointed.

Every time a scene involves excessive background/ambience noise the main voices from the actors are muffled & hard to hear.I've played it through a DVD player and my PS3 on my Sony Bravia HD TV and no matter how much I try and change my audio settings it still sounds awful when there's a lot going on on-screen.One other point to note, there are no subtitles which I find very strange.If you can \\"find\\" the original TV shows that were aired I'd stick with those and avoid this cheap ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK show, bad DVD transfer","review":"DVD quality is bad, tending to horrible.

These should REALLY be recalled. I can't believe something this bad could have made it to market. I will never by another First Alert product after experiencing this piece of trash. The silence feature is really dumb. When you press the silence button, it chirps for fifteen minutes to tell you that it is in silence mode. (How is this silent?)

However as a last resort it is essential for every female to know how to successfully defend themselves. The two self-defense techniques mentioned (although graphic) are superb.

None of them have chips on the blade, so I contacted Victorinox and they wanted me to send it back with a S&H; fee of $10.00. Well the knife cost me it's not worth it, so I am looking at replacing it with a forged steel boning knife this time. I have other knives from this company and never had a blade to show signs like this and my other knives are used more and harder. So it could be a steel edge problem but not too happy with this particular knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp and Flexible","review":"A boning knife has to be both sharp AND flexible.

The electrical diagrams are abominable. I was perturbed to find the coolant level sensor absent from the coolant system diagram for the 1.8L engine.

The execution is also flawless, with its pianist, Evgeny Soifertis, making each little gem into a diamond. However, I must also warn any possible buyer that my CD came out defective; every other track had horrible scratching sounds the source of which could only be found in the recording process. It hurts me to have to say this of Meridian, a recording label that has traditionally specialized in recording relatively unknown works and/or artists at the beginning of their careers... but, I find it very unsettling that a label could put out a product like this. Any superficial inspection, no matter how quick, should have caught this blaring defect and prevented the item from reaching the public. I will not take a risk buying a replacement copy from the same label - Times are hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective pressing ruins CD","review":"Having purchased a recording from this CD on iTunes, I was excited to finally buy the whole album.

I am returning this today for a refund. Shame on you Meridian!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicole Kidman... a robot???","review":"Ira Levin's famous suburban Gothic THE STEPFORD WIVES already has so much black comic potential built into its premise that making this remake of the much loved 1975 film into an all-out comedy was a mistake from the get-go. So was assembling the creative team and the cast: director Frank Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick are hardly known for the light touch this approach would have required, and nor are Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz (in important supporting roles). Glenn Close and Christopher Walken also seem oddly chosen for a comedy, but the worst miscasting is Nicole Kidman as the heroine, Joanna Eberhart. With her wafer-thin arms and torso and flawless, highly polished skin, she hardly makes the ideal choice to be the mouthpiece for accepting human imperfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish We Could Apply Negative Stars....","review":"The original book and movie were horror/suspense stories, and very well done in both mediums. This remake, such as it is, is an insult to those earlier efforts. The occasional on-target skewering of the entertainment world fell under the weight of painfully silly and unwatchable plots, dialogue and acting. I confess I only made it to the part where the perky Glenn Close started the square dancing fest: at that point I shrieked, turned off the TV, and mentally threw the remote at the blessedly black screen. Puh-LEEZE Hollywood: no more insulting bastardizations of classics films and books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!","review":"This movie makes the original feel like Shakespeare. What a terrible attempt at humor, if that's what it is. Stereotypes of successful women, gays, nerdy guys . . everyone and everything is a stereotype. The premise of the movie is ridiculous, more like a cartoon than a re-make. In the original there was a certain logic and maliciousness that had something to say about our society and how we define success. This movie has nothing to say and isn't even funny. Don't waste your time with it. See the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"P-U!","review":"What a waste of my money!

Don't buy this film. Spend your money on groceries or something of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"The women are not really Robots ? Huh ?","review":"This movie has a major logic flaw. The audience is lead to believe that the wives are mechanical robots. But at the end of the movie, it is revealed that they are really human women who have been brainwashed. That is totally stupid!!! How would you explain the scene where one wife has her neck broken, but the next day she is still alive. In another scene, another wife has the ability to withstand burning fire. The only reason people rent this movie, is to find out if all the women were murdered, or at least placed in a frozen ice cube stasis chamber. That would give the movie the element of Horror and Suspense. I was watching the movie eagerly waiting to find out that horrific ending. But the ending outcome that the director gives is totally unforgivable. I feel as if I wasted my time watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Stuck between 2 & 3 Stars","review":"Three stars is too generous because that would imply this was a good movie and two stars would mean it wasn't good. It was OK.The performances were very good, especially Glen Close and Nicole Kidman, but the story was some what confusing. Robots or chips? Which one was it? I don't think the director knew either. It wouldn't be fair to compare the 1970's version because they are somewhat different. A clone would be pointless and the twists in the new version are welcomed.This movie is more of a rental not a purchase. Not a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's great movie","review":"Am i alone in thinking it's cool movie? Maybe not whole 5 stars, but still very nice, hilarious and relaxing. Very nice actors: Nicole Kidman and Bette Midler makes this movie very funny.But really they could have done a much deeper version of this film and it would have been fantastic. Matthew Broderick wasn't a convincing husband for Nicole Kidman - he doesn't look any older than when he was in Ferris Bueller's Day Off! Funny twist at the end, glad we watched it, Bette Midler was funny as ever.We enjoyed having a night in watching a fun film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stepford Wives Lay an Egg","review":"A few days ago I was delighted to learn The Stepford Wives would be shown on cable TV, but I soon realized I was watching a turkey. The opening scene is a heavy handed parody of the Jerry Springer show, and from that point it's downhill all the way.The plot is weak, the characters inconsistent, and the story incoherent. The production values of casting, costuming and set design are certainly high. But that just makes this movie a pointless, glossy mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Flop for Nicole","review":"Ever since her marriage was a bust - the media has done nothing but shower Nicole Kidman with attention. She starred in such polarizing films as The Hours and Moulin Rouge. It helped she had the box office success of The Others. She was suddenly declared the actress of her generation, but that title was given too her in haste.In her newest film, \\"The Stepford Wives\\" the rose is no longer in bloom. After Birthday Girl, Dogville, and The Human Stain I had hope for this one- but Nicole scores another flop. The critics hated this film for a reason. It's just that terrible. It also went way overbudget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie and Hysterical all in the same hand basket!!","review":"When I saw the previews for Stepford Wives, I expected it to be more of a straight forward story line according to the novel. The novel was much more garish at the end. However, the movie threw me off guard and had me laughing unbelievably hard!! If you're looking for a kick me in the shins comedy..you just have to see Stepford Wives.. not so much a suspense as it is a new age reason to smile and enjoy life!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Enjoyed It","review":"I thought this was a great remake of the classic version. This one was more of a comedy instead of the dark suspensful original. For those who don't know, this movie takles feminism and sterotypes in a story about men who make there women into perfect females by making them into robots. This was well acted and had some really funny lines. Nicole Kidman kicked butt as usual while Christopher Walken was awesome in every scene he was in. Bette Middler provided some really funny comedy as the only woman in Stepford who refused to conform like the other women and was often seen in biker clothes and Deep Purple (rock!) tshirts. All in all, a very enjoyable movie and a worthy remake. I will probably get this on DVD when it becomes so available."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Started with Low Expectations","review":"Good to see your expectations can sometimes be surpassed. There were a couple of funny bits and a plot twist, but, overall, this movie was so slow that I almost checked to see if the DVD player was still running.I told all of the funny bits to my friend, as fast forwarding to them would have been a waste of time and remote control batteries.

There are two levels of atrocious music/movies. The first, which is the better of the two, is when something is so bad it's funny.

The plot is aimless and makes no sense, and not even this all-star cast could save it.Christopher Walken was pretty decent, but I'd even take his 5-minute performance in the SNL More Cowbell skit over this.I know I didn't have much to say about this, I'm just doing my part in an attempt to lower the overly generous 3.5 star rating here."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of worst movies ever made","review":"It is not giving way the ending of this movie to say that the writer seems to have forgeting the plot of movie half way through and started writing a differant one.

In this movie the women simply have computer chips implanted into their brains. I can go along with that for a change, fair enough.

WRONG! \\"The Stepford Wives\\" is the biggest disappointment of the year (so far). The horrific story of men replacing their wives with robots that are perfect little wives has been turned into a comedy that lessens the impact of the story. The brains behind this remake have also changed the ending, essentially putting the blame back on the women! And most irritatingly of all, the wives seem to go back and forth between robots or just being the real wives with microchips in their heads that allows them to be controlled. This movie seems to be slapped together just to be able to get a few laughs out of the situation, with no regard for the audience's intelligence. All the talent in this movie is wasted.

The actors were good and sometimes it was really funny. It was also kind of a mystery movie too with an extra twist. Some people also thought it was boring, but again I was interested the whole time.

I found that just a tad strange. Nicole Kidman gave an excellent performance as always, but Anthony Hopkins playing a not so convincing big shot wasn;t the right part for him.

Kidman did an excellent job of portraying her love for him, but the two stars had no sparks. This movie, remade as comedy, needed either a) romance, or b) more plot, and it had neither.I am worried that the remaking of Bewitched with Kidman will carry the same burden... lack of chemistry between her and Will Farrell.

At best one could think of it as a series of smart one liners strung together with very little drama and a lot of poor writing. The actors in this movie clearly have no idea where they are going with their characters. They often look perplexed and let hang awkward silences that are reminiscent of plays from my middle school days. Some actors are trying to play for laughs while others are playing for realism and the combination is aggravating. The story is similarly divided. It is never truly scary and its laughs never make up for its glaring plot holes and shoddy editing.See this movie only with the purpose of making fun of it.

I could elaborate more on how both plots are peppered throughout the movie, but to do so would give away scenes. Not that I think anybody should waste their time watching this swill, but if you do then I don't want to diminish the experience by giving away specific parts of the movie.In summary, you would have to be brain dead to miss the huge holes this movie has in it.

At the end, it's revealed that the women weren't robots after all, they just had some \\"chips\\" planted in their brains.

I was surprised when I saw it how disjointed the script was and the direction. Unable to decide if it is a parody or drama, the movie misteps scene by scene. The tension never really builds because you never feel anyone is in real danger. The movie tries to be silly and still say something about feminism and the battle of the sexes. The movie has little to say on anything real or worthwile. Nicole Kidman looks lost and stuggling to maintain her footing in this movie. Matthew Broderick comes of strangely flat, like a Stepford Husband. The behind the scenes fights, re-writes and cuts really shows on the film. Frank Oz is a weak and tepid director who seems to not know how to marshall his talent or how to tell a coherent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided","review":"Did you ever see a movie based on a book you really liked only to be disappointed by the lack of depth and how the movie seems to \\"breeze\\" thru the really juicy parts? Well, somehow, this movie achieved the same effect by being based on another movie! It's an interesting decision to make a comedy out of a 70's sci-fi\\\\horror flick, and for that i give kudos - but, the result is a movie that has no idea if or how it should be funny OR tense, and thus achieves neither. I actually thought Kidman did a good job with what she had to work with, but Midler and Broderick are weak, and Close is downright awful in her \\"big\\" scene.

Everything is over-the-top, including performances by such actors as Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Matthew Broderick, Jon Lovitz, Roger Bart and Christopher Walken - each of whom seems to be out to do parodies of their usual 'roles'. But if you like movies like Practical Magic and Rat Race and Cheaper by the Dozen, then this expensive bit of fluff may please.

There are a few comic moments but they seem lost in this pathetic tale of suburbia borrowed more from the antebellum South than from suburban Connecticut. It was a real disappointment to see such fine actors reduced to playing parodies of the original movie. Oz defies all logic in the end, as he tries to undo the Stepford Wives forgetting that they were robots, not programmed women. How else does one expect a woman to swallow a credit card and spit out twenty dollars?

I did not try to remedy my situation with them because it would have cost more to ship the item back and forth. The item I received was no good. I got what I paid for which was a cheap laser that doesn't even point straight. Take my advice, spend the money to get something of better quality. I spent alot on the gun and didn't think I needed to spend for the accessories.

She absolutely loved it and found it very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre quality for the price","review":"Supposedly this is a $500 bike on sale. I made the mistake of not trying out this specific model prior to purchase online. Two major problems: (1) the parts are poorly machined and in several instances do not fit together well. For example, the plastic sleeves that fit on the seat rail would not slide over the main cross bar. Just poor manufacturing QC (2) the pulse monitor handles on either side of the seat (the only ones on the bike) are in a fixed position; given my relatively short arms, I cannot reach them, rendering all the features useless (e.g. having the bike keep you at 75% max heart rate). This is a terrible design flaw. I regret this purchase and am kicking myself for buying online without trying one out at a brick and mortar store. In fact, buying something this heavy, effectively ruling out a return to Amazon, is not a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value Bike","review":"I am very pleased with my CardioMax 700r.

It is a little inconvienient that there is not a battery with it - you can only plug it in to a car or outlet.

Only used it on trips and every time we would stop I would put it away in the bags it came in and then the nice soft carrying bag...I treated it like a baby and it still would play for about 10 seconds then be on permanent pause never to start again. Eventually it just didn't even start. Just warning anyone contemplating buying it...maybe we had a lemon, but we did take very good care of it. Its a very risky buy!

For a few months I would just keep trying - and eventually I could get a movie to play. But I haven't gotten anything to play at all for a while now. We didn't use this DVD player often, probably only once or twice a month, and it sure is frustrating to head out to a long road trip only to find there is no entertainment for the kids.

The screens attach to the back of the car seat head-rests nicely. I had to rearrange the straps a little to be sure that it didn't slip off our headrests, but it wasn't hard to do, and once you attach the back plate, the screens can be taken off and put back on in a matter of seconds. I like that feature a lot! Unfortunately I can't say anything about the player itself since it never worked for us. We are VERY dissatisfied with the lack of support we have received from the seller and are currently working with RCA directly to try to fix this.

The second unit sat in the bag a long time and we didnt use it for over a month never tried it out(silly me)It played maybe a week at most and has died same problem as before just much faster. I paid a 130$$ and feel so ripped off. RCA is not so easy to return to. I really dont want another one as I am pretty sure it will just break too.

It would be great if you could actually get them off the base if you do have to put something in your car but you cant cause they get stuck and you have to take the whole thing apart especially since i have the cords under a seat cover it makes it even worse.

We spent a little under 24 hours in the car and couldn't have done it without this DVD player. If you have ever tried to tie down a 14 month-old, you know what it would be like for four 6 hour blocks of time! My kids rarely watch TV but couldn't keep their eyes off of this thing!It worked flawlessly. It took about 5 minutes to get it installed and running. The screens slide off of the thing that straps onto the head rest for security which meant that I didn't have to go through much when we got to our destination. The connections are simple. If you have an 'audio-in' plug in your car, the sound is great. Of course, now I have \\"whose clues...\\" stuck in my head, but hey, at least the kids weren't crying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for Money--Does what it says","review":"The player performed on an adequate level and we are very happy with it.

Keep searching because this product is not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this! Mine went bad after a few months!","review":"I rarely write reviews of products, but the performance of this product warrants it. All I can say is, we had it for a few months, and used it only occasionally (i.e. on trips) and stored it indoors. One day during a trip we were plugging it in, and......... nothing. No power light or anything. I am an electrical engineer, so I know electronics pretty well, so it is not an issue with the car. There is 12V getting to the unit. I am going to tear these things apart and try to diagnose the problem, but all I can say is that my father bought an Insignia at the same time for the grandkids, and it has worked fine. I have also owned a Cyberhome single DVD portable, and that is junk too. I have already torn it apart and I think I can fix it (power jack solder joint is cracked). Hopefully the RCA is just as easy.

I sent it back and asked them to send the replacement to a different address, since we were traveling. They replaced it, but sent it to the wrong address. When I finally received it, this second DVD player was also broken. Again, one of the screens didn't work (different screen this time). I sent that one back and asked for a full refund, including shipping. They gave me a refund on the DVD players, but didn't refund the shipping. So by dealing with this company, I lost roughly $50 in shipping and put up with a lot of hassle in unpacking, setting up, breaking down, repacking, resending.

The lead characters really didn't seem to have any chemistry. Also, many times, the book seemed kind of fake and clicheish. I don't think the writer did alot of research regarding the Chinese basis of this book. Alot of the information based on that seemed to be copied from some B-grade martial arts movie. I don't know, maybe the people who make B-grade martial arts movies do do the right research for this stuff. The main thing that soured me to the book was that the description made me think the heroine would be this strong person, which I like.

I was constantly reminded of other classic (and more coherent) fairytale stories as I read through this one.Not only is it overly long and a bit dull in its tone, (making it almost tedious at times to finish), it also lacked any originality aside from the colorful illustrations.

I called Izzy for the recipe, and he laughed me off the phone ... wouldn't share. Well, lo and behold, a recipe was right there in Molly Goldberg. I have made this soup ever since.

In fact, it was pretty refreshing in that it wasn't the normal \\"Voyager\\" book which is typically based on the old \\"We need food from this planet and the bad guy's won't let us get to it.\\" That said, I rather enjoyed the book, despite what some of the other reviewer's stated about the author focusing too much on Janeway's enjoyment of coffee and the ever present technobabble. Star Trek in and of itself is based a lot in technobabble, no big deal.In my opinion, this was an extremely well done first foray into the Trek world by Eric Kotani. Hopefully we'll see some more trek stories from him in the future. Overall a well done book and I would recommend it to anybody who reads trek. Thank you to author for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im sorry, Eric, but you have not written a good book at all.","review":"Most of the Voyager books that I've read have been quite good--especially the ones by Christie Golden. She can really write. However, Death of a Neutron Star was anything but exciting. Eric Kotani's writing style was adolescent. Despite what others may say, I felt like I was reading a story that I might have written in sixth grade! The characters were not developed, though they blandly followed their early series-established outlines. The plot was dull, and every single event could be easily predicted. If you want to read a good STV book, read one by Ms. Golden, but for god's sake, don't spend a penny on this peice of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical","review":"I feel that this book is way too technical.

There are better Trek writers.","review":"Mr. Kotani, to me, obviously knows little or nothing about Voyager, its captain, and crew. This novel is science and plot driven, but I believe that it needs a great deal more than just being a repetive action and cliff-hanger plot book. I do not wish to slam Mr. Kotani personally, but he should acquaint himself with the characters in this interesting series. Christine Golden does an excellent job as a writer and getting into Janeway's mind. I suggest that you read her book in the Voyager series. This is the first review I have written under my new nick name; I reviewed The 34th Rule just recently and I believe many readers would enjoy it. In the original series, I tend to like Uhura's Song best. Both of these books are strong in plot, characterization and values that should have us thinking about events on earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring book","review":"Sure the story line was OK but everything sounded too easy to me how there was an area of space that the Neutron Star could go without killing any life and Voyager was able to make sure that the star went that way!

I could easily pull it out and shake out the sand then put it back in. I didn't care what color it is but I think it only comes in beige. There are velcro tabs on the back that help hold it in place. You can keep them covered if you want to drag it across the bottom - which I want to do when I put stuff on it and can't reach it - it just makes it easier to reach. It also prevents spills from leaking into the floor of the van. I had another one that was larger and thicker that I really liked.

I can take whatever you dish out to me.\\" She may as well be a robot.As for the brother and sister, Damon and Desiree, it's quite obvious that they are non-sexual creatures which get their kicks from other things. Trying to seduce Damon is like trying to turn a heterosexual male into a homosexual. There is plainly nothing exciting in the effort. This book is simply a waste of my time and resources. Both of which has been consumed and lost forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"no directions and no patterns","review":"this is a book with pictures of things people have made there are no patterns. there is a statement next to a picture like\\" so and so made this out of felt and it has jointed legs\\", I guess its more of an idea book i was disappointed there are quite a few pictures black and white and color in my opinion most toys are ugly 70s not cool 70s I actually just put the book in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clamps Didn't Hold Up","review":"I originally reviewed these clamps are being a good value but unfortunately must now recall that statement.

I used super glue to reassemble the item but these clamps can't exert any pressure at all when required.The spreader function works after using some effort but again, cannot exert any moderate pressure.

This solo album fits in well with the rest of the band's catalogue music-wise - except that it extols the virtues of God, apparently because Morse has discovered Christianity. I'm fine with the occasional religious reference now and again but when there're constant references and it's in your face, I get turned off. I'm sure there'll be many people who'd disagree with this point of view and to some extent, it should really be only about the music. But when the lyrics start to grate on one's ears, I draw the line. By the same token, I'm sure there'll be a lot of people who feel the same way as I do.

I have a very hands-on job, and my hands take a beating (and therefore any rings I tend to get beat up) but after four days at work this ring still looks pretty good (two other rings I recieved the same day are already pretty scratched).

It is a bad state of mind, to think of your self when the whole community is badly sick. This book remind me of those men who go to remote deserts and dig fallout shelters and hide there with guns and canned soup. It sounds too excited about the possibility of everybody else dying and being horribly dangerous to you like a zombie film, even though it is written by doctors who should be wise and not selling to people's selfishness and fear.

What the bat is used for. You get my drift. But, there is quite a bit of history and facts about baseball and its roots that I really enjoyed. The rest of the book includes strategy and more complicated rules and aspects of the game. Some things I knew and other I didn't, and some that just cleared some of the fog I had about the game.

The definitions in this textbook have an unmitigated liberal bias which for me, as a liberal, are pretty hard to stomach. The authors completely ignore any compulsion for objectivity in this text, the reading of which leaves one feeling like they just got slapped in the face by Bill Maher. Just a warning: political and fiscal conservatives may have a very hard time wading through much of the content of this book, as it is concerned only with presenting the deep liberal bias of its authors. This should not be used as a classroom text, and if it is presented as such, I recommend asking your professor to use something a little less politically charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthropology Unbound","review":"I've been reading this book for about two months now, probably finished half if it, and I am not impressed.

If you set a low or mid temperature it will reach that temp and shut off. So it goes into a stupid cycle where it turns on for 10 seconds and then turns off. When it tries to turn on it has a lot of fake outs. As soon as it tries to turn on the temp is reached and it shuts off. Instead they should've put a timer that if the heater is turned on by the temp dropping it should at least run for 5 minutes before it turns off no matter if the temp rises above the setting. It should also make sure it doesn't turn back on in less than a minute after it has been turned off by reaching the temp. This would avoid the fake outs and not be so annoying.I like the heater design and how the heater itself doesn't get hot. Also I like the fan which better circulates the air.

It will make a starting sound like its going to go and then switch off immediately, then start again and stutter again. If I am very lucky it will stay on for 10 seconds.

With an open mind and a respect for Rinella's honest description of his journey,there is a lot to learn and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a magical adventure","review":"I found this book in the bookstore at the Culinary Institute of America while I was waiting for the college's tour to begin. The title caught my attention, and the first paragraph hooked me. After reading parts of it for 10 minutes, I bought it and finished reading it over the next three days. I took my time, savoring each chapter, each conversation, each morsel offered up by this delightful young author.I have never hunted and rarely eat red meat, but I have backpacked and experienced nature in the raw. Reading Rinella's book, I felt so engaged, so alive, so thrilled with his adventures that it seemed I was living them myself. His sense of humor and his insightful observations about wide-ranging subjects [history, technology, human nature, wilderness, ecology, hunting and survival skills, animal behavior, the culinary arts] increased my pleasure. This was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Journey!","review":"I first encountered Steven Rinella's writing through Outside Magazine... but didn't know it. I later picked up \\"American Buffalo\\" as a recommendation by my father and immediately recognized his style. \\"Scavenger's Guide\\" is no different and is written in the same common yet elegant tone that I've come to expect from Rinella. The way in which Rinella introduces his characters is as if he is painting the mona lisa with a wagner power painter. With one or two shots and somehow he manages to convey all the detail you would need to give each characters eulogy, or wedding speech. Between the elegant simplicity of the building of his characters and settings, Rinella masterfully stitches together numerous \\"spur trails\\" into a single voyage spanning topics such as conservation and culinary history, personal growth, friendship and relationships. And there is no shortage of good old fashioned fishing stories. An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for stories about food and cooking, don't get this book","review":"90% of this book is spent dealing with hiking and fishing and hunting, and very little to do with the actual food--the last ten to twenty pages or so.

During the reign of Chairman Mao, the Chinese tried to eradicate small birds, believing they were pests. Instead, they discovered that they were critically important predators of crop pests. If we continue to disregard the value of wildlife, as Rinella does out of ignorance, we do so at our peril.He is the real backyard pest and should be ignored, both for his advocacy of destroying wildlife and his claims to haute cuisine.Eric Chivian M.D.DirectorCenter for Health and the Global EnvironmentHarvard Medical School"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I learned of the subject matter through my brother, who advised me that I \\"had to\\" learn about this information.

However, I was soon disappointed. While Beth does a good job of explaining the role and necessity of the Dark Goddess (Crone) and relates various goddesses to Her, I found some of these comparisons to be questionable. Also, this book is unfocused, trying to be about the Crone, reincarnation and Atlantis in the same volume with little logical connection. The dissertations of Atlantis were mostly boring and seemed to go on and on. Her past life memories were interesting and entertaining at times, but could have been better connected to the theme of the book. I disagree with her assertion that we repeat the same life purpose and gender in our incarnations. If we don't have different experiences, how can we learn and grow?

And I'm not talking about smoke that you can see, either. Just a small amount in the air. And then there's that d**ned voice (yes, this model has a voice as well as a beep).

It is excruciatingly painful trying to take this unit down and yank the batteries because I burned dinner.

Being an optimist I tried swapping out the batteries hoping that would put an end to it; unfortunately it didn't help in the slightest.

Filmed in the vein of \\"Alphaville\\", a soldier calls for a prostitute. The first one, Physical Love, doesn't excite him. He calls for a second, Eleanor Romeovitch aka Intellectual Love, embodied by the entrancing Anna Karina in her last Godard film. She tells him that they can communicate and make love at the same time... by kissing!

This movie isn't about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of my hair Album","review":"I love this band, I think they are so cool. For ages I have been trying to find this album but I couldn't. The album is really good, but my favourite song is of course safeboy, which I first discovered when I listened to a tape which came free with some music magazine. This is the first place I have found any material by Out of my hair, because nobody else seems to have heard of them. Track 4 is also a great tune.

If you are used to doing step classes at the gym, you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step. I didn't know it was a smaller step or I wouldn't have bought it. It is hard to adjust to the shorter step, especially when doing a turn step or V step. It ends up being VERY close to a basic step. I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up, that I was cheating myself out of a full workout. DO NOT buy this, if you're used to the step at the club. I feel like it's more dangerous on this, and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor. If you already know that you like to step, buck up and buy the club size step, even though it is twice the price of this one. Otherwise, don't buy anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets me sweating","review":"I agree that the step system is hard to shift out of the way since it comes apart easily, but I am amazed how it stays together no matter where you step on it. As far as it being too small, maybe the other reviewer is too big. I'm 5'11 and 180 lbs, and I use one raiser level, and it is perfect. Everytime I use the dvd (which is energetic and even a bit challenging at first -- and I had done step class at the gym about 10 times before purchasing this system), I sweat so much and my heart rate is elevated, so I know I'm getting a great work out; I recommend it -- especially to those who don't like working out.

This issue ruins what is otherwise, a really good knife! How does this get past quality control? This won't do. I sent it right back.I don't blame the seller, but maybe they should pull these out of the box, and look at them before shipping. I didn't order a replacement, but went to Sportsmans Warehouse to inspect before buying...guess what? Out of the three they had only one was acceptable. If Gerber machine grinds these, they'd better recalibrate. If people are doing it by hand, they should be fired.Buyer Beware!

It lives up the the Gerber name, being a very high quality, lockback pocketknife. One of my favorite features of this knife is that it is very thin and barely noticeable when in your pocket. For those of you who like to have a pocket clip, mine came with a removeable one that fits into the landyard hole at the bottom of the handle. It does a good job holding an edge, I had to sharpen mine fairly often because of the heavy use it recieved.

It is user friendly, sits securely in the removable stand and the fuel indicator window makes the entire process of filling the tank with butane and/or monitoring the level of useage easy and worry-free. I think it would have been fun if Bonjour had added a couple 'torch' suggestions, but that's not critical. I like this torch a lot! It does not come standard with fuel and is empty when shipped but butane can be found just about at any hardware or 'Target' like store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit the Afterburners!","review":"I ordered this torch because it looked like a quality piece that it would produce a nice fat, hot flame. I did not order it to make creme brulee, but ended up making it the second day I bought this, because it is such a joy to use. On its highest setting the visible flame extends out a good 8-9 inches. The flame this thing produces is serious, folks! I find that somewhere in the middle is best for creme brulee. The quality appears to be fantastic and it really feels great to hold in your hand. I saw a few people seemed to have complaints about ignition in the reviews. I have yet to have mine fail to light a single time. If you have this issue id imagine it could be an issue of the quality of butane you are using. I am using \\"Benzomatic\\" brand butane and I know Zippo brand butane is also very good. Love this thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonjour Chef's Torch","review":"I Love this torch, I use it for everything that needs fire. Light candles, burn garbage and cooking. A wonderful Item. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creme brlée!","review":"So easy to use. Luckily I read the other reviews and bought a lighter fluid at the same time.

It works nice, fast easy, maybe a little tricky to light first time.looks nice, works well what more could one say.I was fixing a burst pipe from last winter, only just got around to it a couple of days ago. My torch started flaring out, stopped shutting off and let me down. I really wanted to put this job to bed, so I went inside to the kitchen and pulled out my \\"BonJour\\" first off the size is so small it let me get a much better angle, and at full blast it heated the pipes, sweated the joint just a little slower than a joint torch..Bravo to this little tool, it is coming camping ,removed one star due to awkward lighting up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Torch","review":"I have always wanted a torch for Creme Brulee and I finally bought one. I am very pleased with the BonJour Chef's Torch. It is very easy to operate, I love that it has a viewable fuel gauge and it has a safety latch. I have aready used it for Creme Brulee and also to add a nice finished touch to some meringue. I recommend this to anybody looking for their first torch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"This is a great little addition to any kitchen. Works great and I love the adjustable flame. I love it but after buying it I have learned that it would be better to go to home depot and get a hand torch instead. You don't have to buy all the little fuel containers and they burn quicker and more evenly. If you don't have the room than this is your best bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighter broke after less than 6 months - no warranty","review":"The light portion of the torch failed to light the device after about 4 months old. I send numerous emails to the companies website and never received a response. Finally I called in and found that this item has no warranty, and only is replaced if less than 90 days old. If you purchase, just expect it to be a disposable item...maybe last for one refile. Other than that little issue, I loved it, but won't buy another item from this company to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"After doing exhaustive research on kitchen torches, I decided on this one because of the good reviews and price. This product is easy to fuel, easy to hold and use, and has great safety features. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because on the lowest setting the flame is fairly large, and at the highest setting the flame is way too big to be useful. I made a great brulee and some in-home smores with this and it worked great! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a reliable kitchen torch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use it for steaks. Not dessert.","review":"Learned this amazing way to make a steak. Had to purchase this torch to make it. Get urself a 2 inch thick slab of new york strip. Put it in a plastic bag and submerge it in boiling water. (obviously these instructions are much simpler) after 15 minutes pull it and set it aside. Take the liquid left over in the bag, mix it with some cilantro, garlic, salt and pepper, onions and green peppers. Use the torch to sear the steak both sides. Pour the marinade over the steak and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No butane size indication","review":"I went to 9 stores before I finally found one that carries butane bottles (Home Depot). Unfortunately, the nozzle on the bottle was too small and the gas simply leaked out when I tried to fill the torch. Nowhere on the box or packaging does it indicate what size nozzle works with filling the torch. To me, this is a huge safety hazard and it caused me to inhale butane which I really didn't want to do. I'm tempted to chuck this into the trash out of anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given this product a zero, but I had to rate it with at least a one","review":"This product does not work the way that it says it does.

Unfortunately, serial devices are not as plug-and-play as USB devices and thus often require some level of troubleshooting to get them up and working. This handy little tester can be invaluable in determining if the serial connection is mated properly and if communications is occurring. I have used a number of these types of devices over the years and this one is right on par The only drawback is the LEDs are not as bright as I would like to see. If you are in a brightly lit room or out of doors, it may be difficult to see the indication. Overall, I give this tester a thumbs-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary","review":"I've studied flamenco, spent about six years in Spain on and off, and really liked this documentary.

This book is for the Christian that battles each day with the self life, and hungers for the freedom to serve Christ with their whole heart!

It's not about assessing sex offenders at all. It's an attack on the civil commitment of sex offenders. The author spends the entire book attacking the assessment methods used in the civil commitment process. Even this attack is false, since Campbell is an ideologue who opposes committing sex offenders and has a new line of attack every year. It's not surprising that Dr. Campbell has no suggestions at all on how sex offenders should be assessed, since he has never worked with sex offenders. He's too busy writing books attacking things other people do. The ethical code of the American Psychological Association prohibits psychologists from practicing outside their area of knowledge, but apparently Dr. Campbell is above such petty rules.

Yamaha has good recievers so this system is easily upgradable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great receiver, poor speakers","review":"I agree with other reviews regarding the speaker cables--replace them from the beginning (I used 16-gauge). One reviewer spoke positively about the subwoofer having a signal input sensor that turns the subwoofer on/off automatically. The subwoofer that came with my system does not have that.The receiver will take a while to set up, especially for surround sound, as you get used to navigating through the options. The receiver itself is powerful and gives you enough inputs and variables to run most configurations (CD, DVD, TV, etc.).However, the speakers produce very little bass, even at high volume levels. Sure, you could turn the subwoofer on and off everytime you play the radio or a CD, but it's a hassle and doesn't sound the same for CDs as opposed to watching a movie in surround sound.Bottom line: Great receiver, but you may want to replace the speakers, especially the front left/right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for small to medium size living rooms","review":"I purchased this system after trying a similar Sony system. The Yamaha is vastly better in quality, sound reproduction and power. Don't be fooled by the \\"total watts\\" statements from other manufacturers, the Yamaha spreads out the wattage evenly through out all the speakers.

Portland steel that will take and keep an edge you can shave with, done it just to prove a point. the rubber handle is the clincher. It's made out of some sort of soft griping rubber that, even when slippery with fish or hunting mess, your hands wont slip on the handle, and your forefinger drops into that notch behind the blade so you can really steer it when cutting.

Great for those just starting to juice and don't want to commit to a more expensive machine yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot clean without instruction or cone removal tool","review":"I liked the juicer at first because it seemed to work well, with the exception of a little leakage, but then when I tried to clean it, found that I could not remove the steel cone inside that cuts up the fruits and veggies. There was no instruction manual in the box, nor was there a tool so i had to scoop out all the waste myself. It ended up being completely inconvenient.

The video misses to capture the magic and thrilling moments of the series, is full of boring interviews and does not show enough ice-hockey (why not showing a few scenes in slow motion or show some goals from different angles?).

The taste and grit accompanied with it is awful too.The labeling is deceiving (to me), stating that there are 90 servings. When you read the fine print above, you're to take 3 servings a day. Then, when you read the label, it says that there is 610 mg of \\"proprietary HSO probiotic blend\\" and lists what that consists of (barley grass and oat grass being the first two listed). Only if you read the side of the package do you find that there are only 3 billion CFUs of actual probiotic in the three servings. That's the same amount you will find in as little as 1/2 a gram in products like Organic GUTPro orBio-Kult Probiotic. And you spend less per actual amount with these other brands.

The selection of pre-programmed exercises are good as well as being able to set the time.

Breathing slower AND becoming AWARE of your breath definitely has value, but this machine WOULD kill you by stopping your breath because THAT is all it knows to do, KEEP slowing your breath down. No sweet spot, no \\"you're there!\\"...just slower.I DO think it has some value, and you can learn the value of slowing your breath down within 60 days, and then SEND IT BACK until they come up with a likely upgrade that knows something more than just slow your breath until you STOP breathing...Success!

The machine prompts you to inhale and exhale to musical tones until your breath rate reaches 10 breaths per second then it lowers your breath rate to the point that if you follow the cues your breath rate will get down to about 4 1/2 breaths per minute. The problem with this is the manual suggests not letting your rate fall below 5 breaths per minute so then why doesn't it stabilize around 6 breaths per minute? When I contacted customer service I NEVER got a response. This is a sure sign of a company selling a ripoff product.

My doctor wanted to put me on blood pressure medications but I asked her to give me a month to bring it down. I was already really active and eating relatively healthy so I didn't really know what to do then I stumbled upon this and gave it a try. I also started drinking teas with hibiscus.

There is considerable evidence now that mindfulness training has positive temporary and possibly permanent effects on brain function (see http://psyphz.psych.wisc.edu/). Using the RESPeRATE seems to be having this effect for me as well.

But her blood pressure was not improved.HERE IS MY ANALYSIS for your consideration. If your high plood pressure is caused by stress and the cares of life, RESPeRATE may work for you.

When I called for additional direction my \\"dedicated professional's\\" idea of assistance was to re-read the instruction booklet. Nor could she answer any of my questions. Resperate's on-line information is more extensive, but still my blood pressure did not drop.I admire the technology and am pleased some find this non-drug method effective in addressing high blood pressure. I do think it is overpriced in relation to the production cost. I also found that after using it for the prescribed month I was getting bored with the breathing tones.

Anything that has few or, as in this case, no side-effects, other than to encourge you to relax, is very welcome. Very relaxing at the same time, so it is particularly good for those who don't find the time to relax during the day.

What the machine does can really be accomplished by simply concentrating on your breathing. However, I don't feel that just by slowing your breathing rate you can control your high blood pressure. If that was the case I would not have high blood pressure with my low breathing rate. Maybe someone has a breathing rate of 17 or more per minute might benefit, but I feel I wasted money on quite an expensive gadget. The only benefit that I gained from the machine was to become more aware of my breathing rate.

She encounters two of her childhood friends, Gina (who now works in a lesbian bar) and Gavin (who is dangerously anorexic), and together the three collide into and reconcile past pain and experiences. Banding with Gina to help Gavin, Amy rekindles her attraction to Gina. Sifting through the ebb and flow of memory, she also comes to understand more about her continuing self-mutilation. Echoing aspects of Eric Swanson's \\"The Boy in the Lake\\", Green gives us a beautiful novel exploring the invisible and visible scars we all inflict on ourselves and others. My favorite line from the novel: \\"The hollows of the body were what filled up with hurt, and you couldn't starve them away.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"(...)","review":"(...), this is one of the rockinest bo Diddley's cd out there, and you'll be lucky if you can find it.

Finally, the most obvious tell is that you can easily scratch the logo off the counterfeit item with your fingernail but the real item has a completely glazed surface.I have been buying these Floss Action brushes for about 3 years (since they first came out) and I replace them every month, so I've bought a lot of them.

So its intended circular motion no longer worked well. So i though maybe it was just a bad one. I got out the next one, and 2 weeks latter. Same thing happened.So i compared it to a genuine one from walmart, and noticed some differences. It was missing a serial number through the little window on the back, and the plastic piece up in the inside was different as well.

When I looked at it I thought it would not clean good in the corners of the teeth since the round brush is not fully round but I said to myself, \\"oh, it should work.\\" I figured I would not know for a few months. Well several months later and I was right. My teeth have dirty spots on them in the crevice corners and this never happened before. They should discontinue this brand. It does not work. I floss everyday with normal floss, a toothbrush cannot do that. I need to get a cleaning from dentist now and will order the Oral B Pro White Head again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary review","review":"The Oral B leaves our mouthes and teeth clean and refreshing.

A little hard though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good addition to your oral care","review":"Got a good price on these and bought them instead of the 'standard' brush heads. The brush portion itself is slightly larger than on the 'standard' ones, but not so large as to present a problem.

Would recommend as a replacement head for your Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - damaging to teeth and gums","review":"I don't know what's going on with the reviews here. Check out the ones on the Target website. My dentist sold me a toothbrush with two of these heads for 25 dollars, and now I know why. The plastic paddles in this head's bristles are like a jackhammer on your teeth and gums. I have used this brush for a week, and have had gums bleeding and swelling (NEVER any problems before, and yes, I floss daily), teeth getting more sensitive and less clean feeling afterward (they can feel quite clean, but you have to brush twice the recommended time, which is detrimental to enamel and gums), and this head makes a huge mess!

The hardest area to hit is behind the front teeth. It can be done, but there's more of a mess than with the smaller brushes.My only complaint is that they are a bit rougher on the gum line than the Ultrasoft Oral-B model.

It broke off, falling into my hand, as I was very gently trying to inspect it to see what was wrong. I hate paying retail for these, but I went back to biting the bullet on price to make sure I bought the real deal. I am happy I did. Make sure you buy the ones made by Oral B. You will like them. I have been using them for at least 4 years and let me tell you, the dental hygenist spends a lot less time in my mouth - and doesn't have to scrape and dig around the gumline so much anymore.

The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head. I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days. 3 days is the new norm. That's quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.As some have pointed out, the head is larger. It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference. After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it's smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.I will go back to the traditional head."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE - do not buy","review":"I've been using these.

The blatant religious undertones are disturbing, even though Card tries to couch them in somewhat secular ideas.Card seems to have not bothered to develop the individual characters, instead opting for a papier mache cast of cardboard cutouts to promote his thin plot. Moral lessons in a work of fiction are fine, but at least make the vehicle something that makes you want to get in a drive!Card amazed me with Ender and Speaker for the Dead. I have been searching for another Card series to keep me entertained, but so far, much of his other work has left me dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"The Worthing Saga is the usual OSC, a main character who takes the brunt of everything, sacrifices much, and doesn't complain. The compilation of stories are put together in such a way that they all fit and make sense separately as well as together. Brilliantly illustrated characters (some of whom I wouldn't mind meeting IRL) mix with a psuedo-depressing plot to create one heck of a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the effort.","review":"This was a tough read for me. I tend to deplore short stories and was disappointed at the short-stories-cobbled-into-a-book feel. However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that the message is simply the best answer to the question of how a good God could allow evil and pain to exist on earth that I have ever seen. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mix of ideas and action","review":"The Worthing Saga contains bits and pieces from other SF books (Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" and Herbert's \\"Dune\\") but ultimately is Card's own work, with his trademark fondness for rustic settings, abused, brilliant children, interpersonal squabbling and expositions on free will. Overall a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"It was a slow read for me but I finaly got through it.

They are kicked off the planet, however the ship crashes and one man awakes from suspended sleep. He decides to play god, waking up passengers, but not downloading their memories, leaving them as children, I guess is the premise. He sort of starts the world over, leaving every so often to sleep for a decade or so, then returning to see the progress made, giving the illusion of a supreme being. Am I imagining this or have I lost my mind?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still not sure","review":"I like Card's Ender series but I'm still not sure about this one.

The sheer notion that one's shoulders, head, and arms ache due to a decapitation of a Chinaman in the 19th century which is one's past life is just hilarious, really. To say that this book is a report from \\"scientific\\" studies is completely unfounded and blatantly wrong, though. The scientific method is not taken into consideration and the \\"support\\" is inconclusive at best.Don't get me wrong though -- this book is hilarious. Just don't think it's going to change your life, 'cause when my shoulders ache, it's because I lifted too much, not because I was decapitated 200 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This is the only collection of actual case histories and studies available within Scientology. It is truly a bizarre piece of work.

The writing style is very very boring, the 'cases' that are shown here are not all interesting, and some are just random. There are other more interesting books on the idea of past lives. I don't think LRH wrote this book, someone else must have compiled it using instructions or something. It doesn't have any flow or anything, its just case after case after case.

I found the talk time to be quite adequate, would use it for 8+ hours of conference calls from my home office and it would still be going strong. However, I noticed the batteries starting to lose their rechargability in the fall of 2008, and replaced the batteries on both handsets in December 2008. Since I replaced the batteries, there is terrible static on both handsets, and the talk time is now about 1.5 hours before the handset starts beeping low battery.

Kind of confusing, not too helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaaaaay to much emphasis on potty training tiny infants","review":"The author of this book seemed to me to have a clear bias towards methods of potty training used in places in the world where people do not use diapers and thus begin potty training at a mere 2-3 months of age. If I had noticed that such a large portion of this book was devoted to 'baby-training' versus toddler training, I would not have purchased it. The small sections on toddler training weren't worth the money, as they had no more information that you could get out of any parenting magazine article on potty training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool, but...","review":"not the best for a surf fisherman. I really like the tool, and the one-handed snap-out of the pliers is really handy. Until, that is, a couple of grains of sand get in the tool.

When we unwrapped it however we saw that there were definite problems with the game. The \\"operating table\\" was a very flimsy plastic, but that would have been okay if we just used it gently. The problem came about when we attempted to play the game. The \\"guts\\" don't fit into the body without a LOT of setting, re-setting, re-re-setting, etc... they just don't fit where they're supposed to. This game just served to be extremely frustrating for all of us and our daughter didn't even want to finish the first game. This game is not appropriate for children (or adults for that matter) and we would strongly advise anyone thinking of purchasing it to save themselves the time, money, and frustration!

When I hooked it up to my tv with the AV cable, it looked great.The problem came when I tried to upload the videos to my computer. The camera says it comes programmed with its own software. However, my computer won't recognize the camera at all. I've tried everything. So now, all these special videos are in this tiny little camera and I can't get them off.

It has many options and setting to get the exact information you want. However, if you really want to use it to monitor computer activity, it falls short. If you have it on a computer with more than one display, it only gets the primary one. It records only outgoing keystrokes for most chat application (except the main ones like MSN and Yahoo). The playback is difficult to use, jumps around, and turns out to be of little actual value as it usually missing the needed view.

Since I paid $100 for the product and was not going to be forced to purchase more licenses, I removed all copies and asked them for a refund. They said I had 72 hours and would not refund the product after that. They conveniently waited for that period to expire before telling me that I had the product installed on more than one computer. Hence, I am out $100 and have no program. This program allows you to spy on people but you are the one being spied on by Spectorsoft.

The gizmo in the lid - \\"pull out drawer with spoon\\" (that we never use) means that the lid is not sealed. It's never sealed. When I put water in this bowl, screw the lid on tight, all parts pushed in, and turn it over in my sink - water comes dripping out. That said, there's no tight seal here so liquids will definitely leak unless you carry this upright. And how would food stay hot anyway? What a waste of money!

My son started school and wanted soup. When I picked him up the teacher informed me that his soup leaked all over his lunch bag and book bag, making his folder and books all wet! There is a small hole in the slot where the take along spoon is (I assume for ventilation) and when I ran water on the underside of the lid I confirmed that it leaked through this hole. It also only does a marginal job of keeping food hot. When we sent spaghetti or pierogies they were only room temp come lunch time. Again I assume this is because of the small hole in the lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I thought these would be great for giving my kids hot lunches at school.

My daughter mentioned it and I was really surprised so I tested it with water inside, made sure that the lid was closed tight and it totally leaks !!! It seems to come out of the top of the lid but of course there is nothing I can even see since the lid is just sealed. I bought this in california, live in scotland and did not save my receipt.

The frog and base mating surfaces required work with an endmill to get a decent fit and allow adequate movement for adjustment.

In this work Poole explores many aspects of developing, leading, and maintaining SSG's. If you are interested in SSG's this book is a must read.On top of the helpful insight and advice given for SSG's - Poole includes a hidden nugget for personal evangelism. In Chapter 5, 6, & 7 Poole explains the importance of asking great questions, listening well, and \\"emapthic evangelism.\\" These three elements help to outline the most important skills that Christians need to truly share their faith and to love people well. This book gives readers tangible steps that will help them share their faith in a world that is increasingly postmodern.All-in-all this book is a great read for anyone interested in SSG's and evangelism.

This book helped me identify other potential sources for her poor immunity to every cold and bug that goes through the school--(the culprits could be stress, food sensitivities, and/or dehydration (antihistimines can be very dehydrating)). This book also has a chapter on blood sugar which I found very interesting and informative.

Otherwise, the fixture works well and was easy to install. The included bulb is a nice touch even though I didn't use it (sounded like something was rolling inside the bulb but still worked).

It is a cheap knockoff of the gerber and wenger swiss army knife. Not all tools work. The can opener on the pliers is too short so the angle doesn't work and the one on the swiss army knife is so dull it hardly digs into the can. The file made as if someone just scribbled a bunch of scratches on a piece of metal. The fish scaler on both tools is too thick to dig into the scale. The leather hole puncher is not sharp. I can tell you what works: pliers, bottle opener, scissors, knife, screwdriver, corkscrew, and wood saw. Assume the rest is unusable. If you are buying this set especially to use those tools, I recommend getting a genuine article. If you just like buying things, then these can be had for cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is some crappy stuff!","review":"Eveyone jumped on these because we could not believe they were \\"free\\" or so, as they were combined with our deal. If they were free I paid too much. Mine are going back. There are sharp edges all over the closed knife to snag and or cut on. Scratches all over too. I would be afraid to use the pliers. As one reviewer stated \\"junk\\". Nice sheaths, that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the price (and not used)","review":"Unlike the sets purchased by some other reviewers, mine show no signs of use or wear. They're not Gerber quality, but what do you expect for the price? All the tools seem usable, and they look good. Handy to have in the toolbox or glove compartment.I have to agree with one reviewer that the placement of the smaller tools in the multi-tool handle makes it hard to open them up. Also, the brass inset on the screwdriver handle isn't quite flush, making a slight edge that could be uncomfortable under hard use.Considering I got this set along with the screwdriver/utility knife set for $15, it's a pretty good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I just had a bum experience","review":"My set just arrived today and I was surprised to find it scratched, dirty, and slightly bent with fingerprints all over it. It also has either blood or oil in one crevice! It came in a box. vs. the plastic blister pack shown on the manufacturers web site so I suspect this is a returned item that was represented as new to both me and Amazon. Also, there were NO instructions at all on how to use the tools. Although I know most of the functions having owned Swiss Army Knives, there are some tools in this that stump me. Additionally, the tools themselves are either dull or sharp, I find both contained within this set. The lockback knife looks like it's been run over. If you are planning on purchasing this as a gift set for someone, (as I did for my husband) be careful and remember, Amazon.com will take back returns. I will wait to see if he wants to return it before I make a decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlucky - got the used ones","review":"I ordered these tools a few weeks ago without reading the reviews very carefully. I intended to give them as a gift. Bad idea. As others have described, each of the tools in the set is either scratched, greasy or just worn down. Quality seems decent, not great - about what i expected for the low price. (The unlocking mechanism of the knife is rather clumsy.)I am disappointed enough that i will return these - tool that look secondhand are not a good gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The set I received had very noticeable scratches on the brass and the wood finish was dull in several places.

When I received it, I was immediately disappointed. The wood and metal did not fit together at the seams, the metal was obviously poor in quality. It looked like it was left out in the rain for a few weeks. Maybe I just got the worst one, but it looked like it was just poorly made with poor quality materials.

The set I got are pretty scuffed, and the crevices are gummed with what I expect is oil applied to dusty/dirty surfaces. My multi-tool had some fingerprints, as well. However, the blades are in decent shape, and it doesn't look like the tools were actually USED, just kind of scruffy.Like everyone else, I got them in a package deal, and together it's a bargain. However, if I'd bought them at full price and/or intended them as a gift, I would be pretty upset.The tools themselves are decent, and have good heft from the wood. They're not top of the line, but they're better than \\"Winchester\\" or other low-end brands.A screaming deal for the above-minimum quality, in the package deal anyway.However I have to give two stars for the sheer fact of selling used or semi-damaged items as new, ESPECIALLY items that are really intended as gifts much of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Much better than what I was expecting for the price. The folding pocket knife is very nice and sharp. It is sturdy and since it is so cheap you don't worry about ruining it as much.

They come and go, and sometimes come back, but either way dishing out 50-200 bucks each time I buy a knife is rediculous. This knife was one of those lost to who knows where, but the time I did use it (over 2 years), I used it a lot.I am an avid camper/hiker, and this knife was nice. They didn't bother with a big bulky grip, and put a good solid clip on it. The result was a knife that you can stow anywhere, even on the strap of a pack, or in your pocket. It's relatively light, and keeps an edge pretty well.After a few wet trips I did notice the blade starting to oxidize, but a little WD-40 and some elbow grease got it off. The tip eventually bent, but I am very hard on knives. All in all this is another knife that I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one, but I like trying new products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value for the money","review":"I have had and carried this knife for years. I have large hands and this knife fits perfectly. The rubber like inserts are rather unique to this design and really help with the grip. Opens and locks super easy. The combination of plain blade and serrated edge make this a perfect everyday knife. The very light weight makes it perfect for clip pocket carry. Strong construction. The 450 SS takes a bit of work to sharpen and I know that other more expensive blades can be sharper, but the edge has always been more than adequate for anything I need to cut. For the money, I just have never found a better everyday carry knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pocket Knife","review":"This is an excellent lightweight pocket knife.

The blurb \\"Love Story for the Nineties\\" should have warned me off, but having read the book I realise that this was a compliment to it - in fact it doesn't even reach this level. This portrayal of two young people in love never rises above a Hollywood-type fantasy where two beautiful perfect people share a series of corny romantic moments - including (so help me God) making love on a beach - you can fill the rest in yourself from any stock romantic comedy. There isn't a single character in this book who isn't a cliche and I found it impossible to feel any sorrow when tragedy strikes these cardboard people. This saccharine romantic fantasy trivialises the reality of HIV infection and never rises above a sentimentalised cliche.

I've used it in severe cold, and while my classmates were freezing, I stayed nice and toasty in this bag. The material it's made of isn't super durable, so be careful when washing and drying if you want to avoid tears.

Suddenly one day the GXRM10G stopped working - no water out of the faucet.I disassembled it. The post-filter looked OK (still white), but the pre-filter one became black. Worse, the pre-filter then stopped to filter the water well, so as result it damaged the RO membrane, making me to replace all of them.My water quality is fine - for years we have drunk from the faucet. We use the filter just after having childrenThat contradicts to what they claim that the pre-filter can last 6 months and the RO membrance can last 3 years.After relacing first time, 2 days ago, after a month, the filter stopped giving water again.

I use mine a great deal as I love baked apples and use the hollowed out inside for raisins, vanilla, cinnamon and lemon juice (yum!). I need to buy a second one though, because the washer/olunger top at the end keeps coming unscrewed and falling off. I was fortunate that the little washer hasn't gone down the garbage disposal yet, as the plunger did. I was able to retrieve the plunger as it's larger, but it would have been a real challenge to find the washer if it had gone. These corers are not expensive and better than the other corers I have seen, so I'm going to buy another one and hope it stays together a bit longer. That will give me time to ask friends for ways to keep the washer on top attached to the plunger (maybe even glue?) I want a corer on hand in case I lose a part and can't keep putting the one I have back together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to the core!","review":"This little tool is wonderful.

It's a great invention. It doesn't really show it, but it does have a plunger down the middle to push the core out. I love it and it goes through fruit quickly and cleanly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple corer","review":"Used this tool for the first time yesterday, it does a good job of removing the core from the fruit and the plunger is a good feature, saves your fingers from the very sharp blade. The only drawback I found is cleaning it, there is no easy way to get the inside of the tube clean and it can't be disassembled. It's stainless steel so rust isn't a problem but I'm concerned about having leftover apple spoiling inside the tool, especially on the top of the plunger. It's not a deal breaker but it would be better if the tube was removable for cleaning, if they threaded the rod and and the top disc I think that would solve the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple Corer","review":"Worked perfectly for my baked apple. Only problem is that the entire core is removed, so when you bake an apple and put raisens or brown sugar, it goes right through. I wrapped the bottom with foil to solve that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I purchased this apple corer and used it the same day. I was glad to see you did not have to use as much force as another one I have. Pushing the core out with the plunger worked well. I am pleased with this purchase.

It cut through the pineapple fine, but it left some of the core."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really cool","review":"We have one of those handy kitchen gadgets that cores and makes wedges, but this was a necessity when preparing apples for the dehydrator. One push and we've got the core out; then on to the mandolin for perfect slicing. Easy to clean.

While the 18\\" and 4\\" sides are not as important, the 2 7/8 side is imperative for the correct function of the template, yet that dimension of wood, or combination of wood, is unavailable as far as I have found. Given my modest wood working setup, I do not have the tools to fashion the needed block out of a tree trunk, so several months later I have still not been able to use this product.

Compact, light-weight, 5 MP, brilliant screen, ultra-stylish, easy to use, and takes two types of memory (SD and/or Memory-Stick). Add to that the nifty green light bars on front which zoom back and forth when it turns on (reminiscent of a certain talking car from an 80's tv show) How cool can you get?Few things to note. The strap that comes with this camera is about 18 inches long...way too long for my tastes. The included memory is a very stingy and virtually pointless (in my opinion anyway) 16 MB.So far the only really bad thing about this camera has been my difficulty in finding a case that isn't too big. I've tried everything from a pda case, to a mp3 player case, to a small camera case and they're all too big and bulky for this little beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable for such a small camera!","review":"I used to have the oplympus stylus camera, and it was quite disappointing. Most of my pictures were blurry! Now, I am using this camera, and most to all my pictures are fantastic! I increased the exposure setting, and got even clearer/brighter pictures at night indoors! The flash helps the macro for more detailed & finer shots. This camera has a few main menus that lead to many options.The macro is great at 3mp & 5mp (there's no 4mp option).

Unless you have a relationship with the author, and have discussed the intended meanings of her works with her, there is little here that warrants more than an initial read.

I guess they would be fine if you want to lie around on the couch with your player in your lap but they are horrible if you want to use them while walking, running or for any other type of exercise. They make a very annoying noise as the cable rubs on your cloths. If you are a runner you hear a rustling type of noise constantly with the movement of the cable.

Even using the rubber pieces, I can only sometimes hear muffled voices when someone's talking loud.Sound Quality:My old headphones we're cheapy's and these sound nothing like them.

If you can handle in ear buds these dramatically outperform the Bose active system. You get a better ambient noise reduction, from a system that does not require batteries, and a much more neutral sound. If you like the Bose sound thats fine, but I tend to prefer a much less coloured sound, so these suit me. For a Sennheiser fan these will sound good. Also impressive is the build quality, these things are well made and durable, so that helps justify the cost.SUMMARY: great for travel and noisy environments if you like in ear buds. Great neutral sound and high quality construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Just got the E4s, after I accidentally cut the cord on my E3 (long story).

I still haven't figured out how it is possible, but after 3 months I am sick to death of sopping up 2-4 cups of water from around the base on a regular basis.Even after three months, there is still a plastic taste.

I sent it back TWICE to have it repaired, the first time , it still had the bubble issue; the second time they replaced the water meter with the white model version (black on black) so now I can't even read the numbers at all, regardless of the bubble issue, which persists.2nd, the trigger to release the coffee spout broke about 100 pots of coffee into its life... now the coffee just dribbles out. Was this only intended for 100 pots of coffee? With a 1-year warranty, I would not think so. Perhaps they should give it a 90-day warranty so you know it will fall apart.Overall, not Krups best effort! Save the frustration and find another coffee pot. I'm still looking for one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted that money.","review":"1. The only way you know how much water is in it is by the water guage.

It has the same problems as everyone else has stated. I bought a few months ago and it gets bubbles in the water chamber so I can't tell how much I actually have and the filter chamber has disengaged sometimes and caused coffee to go all over my counter and down the side of my cabinets.

This coffee maker has two problems. (1) Its spout is badly engineered. It is impossible to pour out the last 3/4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid. (2) It is a thermos; so the machine does not heat up the coffee, but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed. I like hot coffee. After the first cup, I find that I have to heat up the remainder in the microwave. This is inconvenient. I would not buy another of this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed to last","review":"A year of one time daily use and this coffee maker is already going in the trash. The swing-out filter \\"hinges\\" broke during normal use. Once broken, the filter now no longer stays in place and falls out when the carafe is removed. Hence it's ready for the wastebasket.

The latch to open the coffee filter doesn't always work.

Older model filters never fit in the newer models.If you fill the water even slightly over the 10 cup line (yes the instructions tell you not to) you WILL burn yourself when you take the pot out. The hot coffee will run right over the top of the carafe and onto the handle.I was always a loyal Krups customer, but will rethink my position on that when making my next appliance purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"If you are considering this coffee maker because of its good looks, do not be deceived by a pretty face! I have wasted my money on two Krups Programmable coffee makers within two years. Both of the coffee makers ended up with issues that made them inoperable.

It makes excellent coffee, has a thermos pot that keeps coffee hot, provides \\"coffee interruptus,\\" and can be operated without its water filter. However: (1) it requires conical filters, so you have to wet the filter as a chemist does to keep grounds out of your coffee. (2) It leaks -- it leaks unpredictably, and the useless water gauge with numbers so tiny a magnifying glass is required, is just one of the places where water leaks. Today, the useless water gauge was spouting. These cheap things made in China cost $100, so we are moving to a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design and Performance","review":"Not happy with this coffee machine.

Worked fine for about 2 weeks with just one problem: small puddles of water always formed underneath the coffeemaker sometimes with a slight coffee colored tinge. After the 1st 2 weeks the filter swing-out door stopped swinging out when the button was pushed requiring the door to be manually pulled out. From early on I had to be very careful how I poured water into the fill reservoir lest bubbles formed in the fill indicator tube. When that happens you can't tell how much water you've poured into the reservoir. About 6 weeks ago I swung the filter door out and it came completely off startling me as I wasn't using a heavy hand. Now, no matter how carefully I fit it back into the holding mechanism [ a job that's not easy to do] it comes completely off again very easily.

While it worked, it worked well and the metal carafe was wonderful as we seem to have a problem with glass......but that's another story.

It seems that we have another coffee maker that has the same problem within 4 months (no water indicator although the reservoir is full). Purchased the second time due to easily being able to clean the thermal carafe; however, considering going back to the old fashion method of glass pot. The beeping of the \\"no water sensor\\" and the machine not working due to the sensor makes it useless to pay such money for a coffee maker.Wide opening allows for cleaning the carafe so that no coffee deposits/discolorations are seen inside. Had previous carafes that discolored due to difficulty cleaning it which made the coffee taste differently. Not worth purchasing this coffee maker.

We got it to replace another Krups machine that we had for 8+ years and was still working, we just wanted the thermal carafe. This one is a pain to program, pouring spout is awful, very tempermental, and has a really annoying alarm. At least 50% of the time the automatic timer fails on ours. The controls stop working whenever they get a drop of water on them, which is often given the pouring spout and poor placement of control panel.

Whether the coffee is \\"worse\\" or \\"better\\" than other brands probably depends more on the coffee than on the coffee making machine.

As the Krups' designersmoved from the good old \\"analog\\", i.e. physical, controls, to \\"software\\" controls (i.e. \\" first push button A then button B for 3 seconds, etc.\\", thethe usability plummeted. It's ridiculous that the customer has to continually go back and consult the (good old analog) paper manual to remind ones selfwhat buttons to press when.

The coffee maker was shorting out..the LED screen was blinking on and off and it looked like it was full of water. I unplugged it immediately and was grateful that I found it before a fire started.Other reviews have stated that this model leaks and with the electronics at the bottom, it could be a real danger.

The carafe works well and feels solid. The filter basket is a nice, single piece of plastic that hangs on the swinging, spring-loaded door. A light-up LCD clock and display is easy to read and is surrounded by four comfortable buttons. Unfortunately, the coffee is unacceptable. I typically brew a 4-cup pot daily, 6-cups on the weekends, and 8 or more just once or twice a month. Though the machine has a special 1-3 cup option, the coffe in my 4-cup brews was much too week. Upon closer examination of the grounds, I discovered that they were not getting properly soaked. Despite what appears to be a showerhead design, only the very center was wet and a deep 'well' was created in the grounds by the stream of coffee coming out of the center hole.

It was at least five years old and developed a leak. I was able to remove the bottom and determined that the rubber tubing that connected the reservoir to the the heater was cracked. We looked in all of the local stores, but could not find one. We needed our coffee! When we looked online we found what we needed. It was delivered promptly.

If none of this appeals to you, a courteous Amazon rep will tell you how to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"several flaws","review":"I have a white Krups with a glass carafe that is not programmable..just a coffee maker and it makes great coffee with no problems. I bought this one because I wanted a stainless steel one to match my appliances. Well, I got my old Krups back out after using this one. First of all, the water gauge on the side does not work so you don't know how much coffee it will make. I took a measuring cup and poured in 6 cups of water and when it brewed, it overflowed. I thought this was a 10 cup coffee maker unless they mean the teeny expresso cups! It doesn't keep the coffee hot enough either. The carafe is hard to pour and sometimes it comes out all over the place! I can't get it to program for 1-3 cups. Sometimes the latch to open it up to get to the coffee filter will not unlatch. It's just a poorly design coffee maker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not steaming hot","review":"This is the first time we have purchased the carafe type coffee pot. It probably will be the last. We've used it for a month and we can't get used to the fact that coffee loses its heat too quickly. Also, we were looking for a maker that you could set the night before. While this one does it, we can't use the feature because it's necessary to \\"pre-heat\\" the carafe with hot water prior to brewing your coffee. OK, it's not \\"necessary\\" but if you want to do everything possible to get the coffee hotter, then it is necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee maker ever","review":"We bought this atrocity 8 months ago. the thermal carafe does not keep the coffee hot for starters. The idiot who designed the program feature is laughing the whole way tot he bank. The cleaning cycle comes on every two months which is fine, however even after cleaning it 3 times with solution, the regular clock does not come back up unless we unplug it and plug it in again which means that it also has to be reprogrammed. the clock and auto program function are so ridiculous it is annoying. I would steer clear of this machine. Oh yes, and the top of the carafe doe snot come apart to clean. Again, Do NOT buy this lousy machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee pot ever","review":"Despite being recommended by Consumer Reports this is the worst coffee pot ever. The control panel was illogical and difficult to understand. To get the coffee out you have to turn it all the way upside so two streams come out, one through the pourer and one through the top. In addition, the carafe is supposed to keep the coffee hot for awhile but doesn't. There is a sort of fake system where the \\"burner\\" stays hot but the plactic bottom of the carafe is not conducting heat so it is hard to understand what exactly they thought was happening. Made us wonder if anyone at Consumer Reports actually tried a cup of coffee from this machine. That said, I returned it and Amazon kindly let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"This is the worst appliance I have ever bought. I chose a Krups thermal coffee pot because we loved the one we bought in 2000. How do I count the ways: First, the electronics are AWFUL. Second, it is impossible to pour into the water reservoir without spilling water. Finally, it is almost impossible to empty the carafe (after the coffee has brewed) without turning the carafe on its top--and often spilling it.I am on the verge of throwing it into the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"little annoyances","review":"I really wanted a thermal carafe, and this looked perfect- good name and good price. But there are some problems- first no measurements on the carafe, so you can't tell how many cups you have, and when you use the gauge on the machine, it gets the air bubbles and you still have no idea how many cups you are making. And if you should put too much water in the machine, it just pours out the back. Also, in order to get really hot coffee, you have to prepare the carafe with hot water before it brews, which kind of makes the auto timer useless. other than those problems, if you can get the measurements right and prep the carafe, you will get a really good, hot cup of coffee. It does stay hot for about 2 hours at least once prepped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased Overall","review":"I must say - the negative reviews seems to be more of a defective issue and the others more a personal preference and subjective view. I mean, really, the complaint I read about the cone filter basket not standing on its own??????? Well, what I do is just leave it hanging on the door and put the filter in the basket then the coffee. I have yet to find a cone basket that stands on its own. I've had every type and brand of coffee makers from percerlators to french presses and I find this one to be pretty good. I would just ask for a hotter brewing temp of the water, but its about average as is. The other issues such as leaking water, power problems and stench of plastic, well, it goes back to it may just be a defective item, which happens in manufacturing products......and that is why I use the heck out of a product the first 30 days in case I feel the need to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drives me crazy","review":"When everything works well, it actually makes good coffee. Now what doesn't work: There is a tube on the left side that shows how much water you have poured into the machine. This will typically get air-bubbles in it make it worthless. Next it beeps at you for all sorts of things. Yes the beeper can be shut off, unfortunately it can take several frustrating minutes to do this simple procedure. The thermal carafe does not do a very good job of keeping coffee warm. The biggest problem has been with the door that hods the coffee filter. There is a spring that holds the door open when the latch is released, this spring occasionally pops out and it is extremely difficult to put back. And finally the latch that holds said door shut will pop open during brewing. You can guess where the scalding water goes. Lot's of nice ideas that just don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I have bought Krups coffee pots for years. To the best of my knowledge this is the first one that was made in China and like every other appliance I've had which was made in China, there are little things that don't work exactly right. Bubbles develop in the water gage, so I have to carefully measure out 5 cups of water or it boils over. I still haven't conquered the timer mechanism. It has the first electric clock I have ever seen that loses time. However, I can press the button to turn the pot \\"ON\\". The only good thing I can say about this appliance is: the coffee is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough positives!!!","review":"I bought my machine about 2yrs ago, even though it was a refurb unit...I have not had any \\"major\\" issues...Like all I get the air bubbles, yet that seems to be it.

There is a chemical smell and taste to the coffee that makes it undrinkable. It has happened more than a few times and I'm ready to give up and try to return it. I have been making coffee in my house for 20 years, with the same water and coffee beans, so it isn't a chemical in the water. The filter holder seems to have a smell, but so does the inside of the pot at times. I don't know what this is but it's not good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice But Fragile","review":"This maker has a nice quick brewing time and overall good coffee but there are other problems. The swing out basket snapped off on mine and now occasionally flings the hot ground out onto the floor while brewing. The spring also is broken due to a poor design. The coffee also stay \\"hot\\" for only an hour before it needs to be microwaved. Not for a person who makes coffee every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups FMF5-14 Thermal - Fast and Hot","review":"This is my first Thermal Coffee Maker. I hate the burnt taste of old coffee but heard the thermal ones aren't hot or are slow or noisy. This one is outstanding. It is quiet, programmable and brews very quickly. Morning coffee is actually hot and fresh at lunch (I did NOT have to prewarm the pot - that would be hard the night before!). It is not too tall, easy to clean, and seems reasonably priced. The fill line is easy to see. You can fit a #4 golden filter easily. It is programmable for 1-3 cups, I bet they don't stay hot as long if not pre-warmed. It comes with an optional filter insert which we don't use since we have a Brita on our faucet. Only potential draw back is the 10 cup capacity (I had a 12 cup one before). Yeah, no more broken glas pots!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Java Problems","review":"I bought this Krups to replace a beloved Krups thermal carafe that sadly passed on. This new model features too many flaws. For one, the swing-open filter door doesn't always engage. Minor issue. If you pour your water into the machine too quickly, bubbles can form in the window, so you're never quite sure how much is in the machine. Further, my model always seems to leak both water and brewed coffee from the bottom of the machine. Granted, it's only the size of a quarter or half-dollar, but you don't expect this from a Krups. Finally, the carafe, itself, pours so broadly that leaks are inevitable. Sadly, this product does not live up to the Krups' reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be better...","review":"This coffee maker is the best--perfectly brewed coffee every time with a carafe that keeps the coffee hot forever.

This one smelled and tasted of plastic. I ran about 20 pots of water and some w/ vinegar in it to get the taste out. Nothing worked. I called Krups and they told me to use 2 cups lemon juice 2 cups water. Let it start brewing and stop it and let it sit for 2 hours and finish the brew. Then run 2 pots of water threw it. Now black stuff started showing up in the water runs I did. Like the lemon juice stripped the plastic. It was gross. It is also not uses friendly at all. The pot is hard to handle and pour the end of the pot into to a cup. There is nothing good about this pot. Very disappointing since the last model was so great. We are exchanging it for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups Thermal Coffeemaker","review":"This is my second Krups coffeeemaker. I do think the location of the controls is a very poor design. If your pot runs over the coffee goes down into the controls. Don't forget to put the coffee in or this will happen!!! I had to replace my old coffeemaker brcause the lid broke. I didn't want to just replace the lid because my numerics were hard to read. (see above!) On my new Krups, the door to the coffee basket is a little off and hard to shut and the automatic on will not stay on from day to day like my old one.

We were looking for a replacement for our old Krups coffee maker and learned that it was no longer available, and this model replaced it. The reviews we read were iffy at best, but we bought it anyway, trusting the Krups name. The carafe leaks all over when you try to pour it. The water level column is prone to developing air bubbles, so it's impossible to judge how many cups are being poured into the chamber. Krups Customer Service was not helpful at all, so we were stuck with a crummy product. It's put away in a closet and we are still using the OLD coffee maker instead! Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups quality coffee","review":"I love not having to worry about breaking the pot, early mornings before I put on my glasses that is a risk!But, I did take off one star because of the lid.

I called Krups and was told that, although under warranty, I would have to send it to Illinois for repair (I'm in Texas) at my own expense for shipping. The turnaround was estimated at four weeks.All in all, the quality of the product and the quality of the service were lacking. Granted, sometimes new machines fail; however, to make the customer pay for cost associated with fixing the failure and to have the repairs take a month is absurd.No more Krups products for me.llk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - Keeps overheating and breaking","review":"I just threw mine away. We were having the issue where the coffee maker would not start and would display the \\"Water Tank Empty\\" error. This error is caused by the thermal fuses tripping in the coffee maker (bottom of coffee maker, under the white plastic tubing - make sure you use the same/right temperature thermal fuse). I replaced the fuses two seperate times, each time the coffee maker would run a time or two and then break again. The last time I replace the fuses the maker clearly got over heated and made a burnt plastic smell.This maker is cleary not safe so time to get a new one.

Today I'm ordering a different mfg/model replacement. When that new one arrives the Krups FMF5 is going in the garbage can. What a waste!! It's sad. The carafe does not engage with the drip assembly in a positive manner. Occasionally the coffee leaks all over the counter instead of going into the carafe. Due to lack of positive engagement I can't just start the coffee maker and walk away. And I certainly can't program the thing to start while I'm still asleep. Others have noted the difficulty in getting bubbles out of the sight glass. This is definitely annoying.

Overall, I'm very satisfied.First, the size is great and fits under my kitchen cabinets without taking up a lot of counter space. Second, the brewing temperate is very good. Most coffee makers use very hot water (not boiling water) to get the best coffee taste. People who like boiling hot coffee should not buy this coffee maker. People who like \\"regular\\" hot coffee will like this coffee maker.Third, the carafe keeps the coffee near brew temperature for several hours. Finally, it's easy to use and clean.The only downside I've found with this product is that the getting the last half-cup of the coffee out of the carafe requires a lot of wrist twists and gymnastics.

Sometimes explanations of answers are sooo vague they are frustrating. Sometimes 'facts' contradict themselves in different places; sometimes 'facts' contradict conventional usage.

Too bad there isn't some standard that Kindle books must be as functional as the print version in order to be accepted."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the most \\"honest\\" book on the subject","review":"The author exerted more effort into this book than any other one I saw on the subject. He deals with many aspects of human interactions when it comes to reading and not just eye positioning. Most books use the same repetetive gimmick, which is to concentrate on the center of the page as you read vertically. I would make an educated guess that no author covers more \\"practical\\" advice than kump did -to date. This is the REAL DEAL, I wish I had it in college."},{"rating":"1","title":"speed reading isn't better reading","review":"I gave up half way through this book. I was completing the objectives for the drills and doing 3-4 drills every day afterwards, plus I read a lot.I've always been a slow reader and thought this book would help me, but I'm interested in reading fiction and the reading style this book teaches is \\"speed reading\\". I simply get less out of the books I read at my leisure using this method and I don't read any faster.Once I got to the chapter on \\"dusting\\" I had had enough.This book was a terrible waste of time for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rapid Reading?

I find that with complicated material I tend to be a little slower reader so I set out to improve my speeds. I picked up this book and was very enthusiastic about becoming a better reader, however, I was disappointed. Using your finger is to say the least, annoying. When you increase speed you can surely understand what your reading but I find it very hard to maintain retention. If you're reading a newspaper or magazine, fine, but if it's something saturated in information it is not realisitic that you can improve your reading speed by 2 or 3 times with resonable retention with this text. Maybe if you went to the courses that the author offers over a few months you could improve, but I think it is a joke if you think this 10 dollar book will do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"only recommended for people who are problem readers","review":"I don't think that these methods really work for people who are already competent readers. Rather, they are intended to assist people who have problems concentrating on a printed page because they watch too much television.This book makes reading much more difficult. I read very quickly before the exercises and didn't see much improvement in my speed. The effort to use my finger as a pacer was not worth the slight improvement in speed.If you read slowly, I can see how this book can help you. It will train you to concentrate on a printed page and give you a method of retention that will become second nature. However, if you are fairly intelligent and have no problems reading or retaining, the book is more or less a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced kindle edition 17.99.","review":"At the time of this review, this book on kindle cost 17.99.

I figured that if I even sped up by only like 20% then it would be completely worth it. I had no idea how much I would improve. The author says in the first lesson that after the drill I was about to do, most people increased their speed by 10-20%. I increased by about 35% on the FIRST DRILL. That was only like the 3rd chapter out of 32. On the initial reading test I scored 190 words per minute. It was on the low side of average. Today (got the book on Saturday...5 days ago)I scored 650 words per minute on the day's test. During one of the drills at the end of the chapter I had made it up to around 850 words per minute.

I immediately turned it off and inspected the heater. One of the elements was broken in three different places. This is a brand-new heater, folks.

It is costly to turn the central heat on just to take the chill off a couple of rooms when if you wait long enough it generally will warm up. I have used Holems quartz heaters for several years moving them around as needed. The current model sold here in 2007 is much improved over the ones sold back before 2005. One nice feature is that they include a circuit breaker in a module at the plug end. You can tap that switch to instantly turn one off rather then step through all the different settings using the top mounted switch. I am here checking the current price as I intend to buy a coouple of more of these so they don't need to be moved around.

She did not find it adequate -- it puts out a decent amount of heat, but it is not \\"burning\\" by any means. On a freezing day it does not heat her 12x12 office to 75+ degrees as she likes it. She switched to a heater with a parabolic \\"satellite dish\\" to focus the heat directly at her. That parabolic heater does not warm the office either, but it heats up anything right in front of it, to the point of discomfort, which is how she likes it!I'm not \\"cold-blooded\\" like my wife, and I find the Holmes heater quite acceptable. Running it for 15 minutes warms up my 15x15 office for a few hours on a freezing day. The fan is a bit noisy like a typical desktop oscillating fan, but it's just more white noise in the office. The safety features are good, and maybe you'll like the thermostat control, though a simple on/off switch is enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective upon receipt of unit","review":"I ordered this unit, and found the vertical heat tubes cracked and had to retrun it for replacement.Received replacement and found one of the vertical heat tubes crackedjust like the first one.Obviously they have a major problem in the manufacturing process andare sending out defective unitsHolmes HQH319-U Quartz Tower Heater with 1-Touch Electronic Thermostat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best heater ever!!!","review":"Best heater of its type for sure! I've had this for 2 years now and no complaints. I love the temp setting on there which allows you to set it to a certain temp before it shuts off, this works great in the bedroom at night not having to get up to turn it off or on. Since we live in south Texas I use this in our bedroom to keep us warm in the colder nights and it works exceptionally well.

I unplugged it for a couple of hours and it still didn't work, despite shaking it, etc. It's dead, except for the pretty digital reading lights.Into the trash it goes, and I definitely won't buy a digital Holmes model again.

It must be the overheat feature but the unit comes on for a just moments and then shuts off when the room or unit is definitely not that hot.

I placed this heater behind my desk about 4 feet from where I work and under a window. I am pleasantly warm and during the day the room even warms nicely. Don't expect this heater to be a room heater. It is meant to warm objects near it and this it does wonderfully. I keep the main furnace thermostat about 4 degrees less than the heater thermostat and the main furnace only kicks off when I shut off the space heater at night. I highly recommend the Holmes Quartz heater for those who are fairly stationary during those cold days, but want to be warm without constantly running the main house furnace/heating system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a second listen","review":"I must admit that on first listen, I was a tad bit disappointed with this CD. I've been a Sophie B. fan for as long as one can claim that title. Her albums are on constant rotation in my CD player and I convert people into Sophie fans. This album didn't immediately grab me the way her previous work has. However, after I listened to it only twice, I woke up in the morning with lyrics playing in my head. And I couldn't wait to hear it again. The joy and innocence of these songs is infectious. This album is a love letter to...love. Complain about the simplicity of that all you want but I'll take a healthy dose of reckless abandon any day. Especially if it comes wrapped in one of the sexiest voices of this age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long awaited dissapointment","review":"What a dissapointment. I adore Sohpie's art. I've followed her career from the beginning. This CD is, I regret to say, Sophie's worst effort. It lacks artistry, imagination and interest. It seems she's lost some of her spark. Most of the songs sound exactly the same, the lyrics are rather boring - if not borderline stupid (\\"Blue\\") and I believe a couple glasses shattered while I blared this out of my sterio due to most of the song's much to high range of Sophie's squealing. There are maybe two songs on the entire CD that reflect Sohpie's brilliant work from \\"Whaler\\". A wait this long, I expected much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, unique and wonderful!","review":"How do you possibly define Sophie B Hawkins? I don't even think she can define herself. I see a lot of the reviews written referencing Norah Jones, Diana Krahl and classing Sophie B Hawkins as \\"alternative\\" when the truth is, you can't really compare her to anyone or catagorize her. Each song has a different feel, style, mood and sound.From my first listen to Tongues and Tails, I was hooked. I have to agree with another review saying that T&T was a once in a lifetime album. By the time Whaler was released I was yearning for more and in my opinion it didn't disappoint. But then, a few years later, my opinion was not so positive when I learned of the release of Timbre.Now, after not having heard of the release of Wilderness, I stumbled upon it and had to have it. It's been the best thing I've stumbled upon in a long time. Each track is fresh, new and invigorating. Each song has it's unique style and seems to be a chapter tying together a book. A beautiful piece of art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but ...","review":"The first thing I thought, when I listened to it first: fresh and new. Sophie's music is fresh and new. She sounds much brighter than the latter half of Timbre. The second thought was the reason for the first: Wilderness is not as complex as Timbre. I believe people who love Timbre for it's complexity of the music will not like Wilderness that much.Still, the music of Wilderness is good, really good. It sounds like summer all over the album (and not only at the beginning as Timbre). Beautiful Girl, Surfer Girl and Angel of Darkness are - as I think - the best tracks, concerning the music.Yet she has never written worse lyrics, I think. Too bad.All in all this album leaves a more commercial yet nice (almost wonderful again) image. Just lovely. And remember: Timbre shows that Sophie is probably the best current songwriter/producer/instrumentalist. Let's hope that she produces her next album herself again (with Paul Bushnell playing bass ...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"This is life changing...Siple but, deep principles that leads you to experience a Victorious Christian Life.I have not found something like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as it seems.","review":"I bought this dvd because the info said that it had in it the coverage of Charter Hospital leading you to believe that it is the story they aired on tv.

From the beginning, this album gives the feeling of a bustling city, full of life, but also full of loneliness. This comes out in the slightly odd rhythms and melodies in many of the songs, including Floss, Kids World, and others. Many of the tracks have some element that sounds out of place, but in a good way. Some might also argue that a few of these tracks needed vocals from some guest MCs, but none were used here.On the other end of the spectrum, you have songs like Jigga Why, which is fast, energetic, and has infectious vocal editing. I felt that the album could have used a few more tracks like this one, however.Overall, Machine Drum's talent comes through in his use of samples and intricate drum rhythms. In my opinion, he earns his name on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best video on earthquake effects","review":"I use this video for my undergraduate class Earthquakes.

(and I've tried most) I have bought on average about one a year over the past 10 years. All have worked, but none of them well. Most were more expensive than the Haier TST240SS. The plastic lever broke off my Kitche-Aid toaster (5 months old) and bothered me how it looked sitting on my counter and it didn't toast all that well anyway, so I went in search of another one and came across this one. The price was much lower than I paid for my others so I was skeptical at first. I decided to go ahead and order it and man... am I glad I did. From the first time I tried it, it made perfect toast and English muffins. It's extremely easy to use. A real no brainer. I recommend this Haier TST240SS to everyone who is as frustrated with there current toaster as I was. GO FOR IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Slices, but Only Two Coils","review":"Unfortunately I had the exact same problem that so many have reported here: after 3 months, the center coils stopped working. Called Haier who offered exchange under warranty. However I had to pay $14.99 for the exchange, which hardly seems fair given that this is obviously a manufacturing/design defect (look how often it apparently happens).You should also note that the Haier America website no longer lists toasters under small appliances -- apparently they've decided to get out of the business. I'd recommend looking to other brands.On the positive side, it looks pretty and when it worked, it worked well. Especially liked the blue display lights which ticked off a \\"countdown\\" to toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Unacceptable quality","review":"Having researched 4 slice toasters extensively I was very much looking forward to receiving this new toaster with the long slots which has the cool feature of allowing for larger bread slices too. Odd perhaps but we're real toast lovers in our house.Unfortunately as many others have reported, when it arrived the center coils in both slots did not work. Disappointing but i really wanted this toaster so hoping for better results and thanks to the great customer service process from amazon i easily exchanged it for another one, crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.The second toaster arrived and not only did it have the exact same problem as the first unit, but In addition a terrible odor emitted from the toaster when toasting.I give up and moving on to the t-fal 4slice speed toaster which I have previous great experience with and will just have to forfeit the promise of the nice long slots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Manufacturing","review":"When my first TST240SS' center heating elements (both) didn't work, I returned it to Amazon (who were wonderful).

Wrong.Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns just one side of the toast","review":"The heating elements on either side of the center divider never got more than pale pink.

This arrived safely, in good working order and toastes evenly.

Otherwise it is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy this toaster!","review":"I bought this toaster for my husband this past Christmas 2010. We did not start to use the toaster until February and it is already broken. The elements are burnt out in one of the slots.

When it worked it toasted nicely, the warmer on the top was useful.When it suddenly busted, it wouldn't do anything but make a foul smell. These days consumer goods like this, when they fail, it seems manufacturers just expect you to buy a new one -- as the hoops to jump through for repairs make is a non-cost and non-time effective process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this toaster","review":"Amazon has been a great source for many books I have needed for my sewing classes. I purchsed this toaster thru Amazon on 9/11/10 . Item was shipped from Edison NJ, via Abe's of Maine. We are not happy. Thought this would be a beautiful gift for my daughter's family with two teen agers, BUT we are very unhappy with its performance. Toasts uneven --brown on one end and almost burnt on the other. We are unable to regulate the degree of toasting and its bagel performance is not good. Tried to e-mail Haier/ Abe's of Maine and got no response, phone calls and messages not answered. Customer service very poor. Will never buy from them again. Do not wish to pay return shipping and am stuck with poor product. Want very much to purchase an Oster 6330 to replace bad toaster.

After lite use the toaster just stop working. Followed Haiers instructions for a replacement which includes getting a case number, cutting off & sending in the cord along with $15 and never heard back from them. Have followed up twice and apparently my request got lost in the mail. I did not send it with a signed receipt because that was another $7.50. Haier now has instructed me to send in another check along with proof of purchase and they will honor the warranty. Seems reasonable but I wish I could give them a CC# and get on with it. Pretty losey warrantee if you ask me. I would be hard pressed to purchase Haier again."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Year, four months ....toast!","review":"Nice looking, worked reasonably well, lasted 16 months then died. I expected more from a $60 toaster. Called Haier where the polite customer service seemed to be designed to take so much time that you just go away. After three calls they agreed to send me a credit toward a portion of the purchase price of a new toaster. But they could'nt tell me how much the credit would be, or when it would come. One would think that maybe they would want to make the customer happy or maybe find out what went wrong with their product. No more Haier products of any kind for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"This was my favorite toaster I have owned... until it stopped working. I had it for just over a year before it broke. The problem I have is that it will not stay down. There seems to be an electrical problem. If I wanted to stand by the toaster and hold the lever down, I could still get use out of this, but with young kids, who has the time to stand and hold the lever down on their toaster??? I'm giving it 1 star because, for the price, it should last longer. Also, from all the other negative reviews, I gather that it's not worth wasting my time with their customer service... or lack thereof. It's a great toaster. It's just a bummer that they couldn't make it last. I guess if you like playing Russian Roulette, this one might be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toaster","review":"Great toaster.

Someone else wrote that the preset darkness level of 4/9 was too dark. Or maybe it was 5/9 which is what the preset is on mine. I think it is just perfect for me.

Been given the stall for the return of a replacement...I was told to phone back every week to see if it arrived from \\"China\\". Finally after I asked to speak with the Supervisor, they told me that they couldn't guarantee if they even are still making this model. I asked for my $ back and they agreed but they told me the check would be in my hands in 3 weeks. Today three weeks later, I phoned to see where my check is....they now tell me in 6 weeks.It is not just that it is a piece of junk but the company is obviously unethical and I plan to phone them daily, write a bad review on every site I can find them on, put it on my Twitter and Facebook since that is my only recourse.

It had everything - style, price, performance and the promise of other good reviews.It always seemed a bit flimsy, but it did work fine. That is up until last week. It started jamming moving up and down and now it won't stay down at all. I figured I would take 20 minutes to try to fix it, but it has special screws on the underside that need a special bit that I do not have. So, yet another product in the land fill. I would gladly pay an extra $20-$50 for a toaster that would last me for years. Too bad the majority of America just wants the lowest price, so most manufactures build things as cheap as possible to last through the warranty period, then it is off to the dump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just up and DIED","review":"I purchased this toaster in March 2010 and loved it. It worked well and toasted evenly, until this morning. We made 4 pieces of toast but needed more. Sadly, the lovely thing simply stopped working.

The owners contacted Haier about the issue and were told that \\"yes, there is a danger of electrical malfunction.\\" The owners were instructed to fill out paperwork and return the toaster and they would receive a replacement toaster. However, Haier has no toasters available and instead sent a check for $21 which was less than half of the original price of the toaster. I would think that since they are aware of the electrical danger, they would at least refund the entire purchase price. They were very fortunate that there were no injuries which resulted from the malfunction. Quite a serious problem, I would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"How hard is it to make a decent toaster???","review":"I bought this toaster about 18 months ago based on good reviews and its sleek design, but as other reviewers have noted, if it works at all it won't last you much longer than the 1 year warranty.

It was sleek and the proportions fit in my kitchen. It actually worked well for three months and then the end of October, the lever did not work and the toaster would not go on. After several attempts of looking through the brochure and trouble shooting, I contacted the company and as other reviewers stated, it was a hassle.The cost of sending it back, outweighed the cost of a new toaster.I was hoping to find someone in Philly, like Luis from Sesame Street to fix it.

I do a lot of baking, including baking rustic breads. Because they are rustic loaves, slises usually do not fit in regular length toaster slots. Then I saw this baby. Not only is it a long slot toaster, but it has two of them. I was sold. I ordered one right away. In fact I had to wait because Amazon had not yet relieced them for shipping.Upon arrival, I was not disappointed. It worked just as I had hoped. Not only does it work great for long slices, but it is the best toaster I have ever had period. Once you learn what settings to use for a given type of bread, be it plain old white, wheat, bagels, english muffins, etc., all you have to do is use that setting next time and it turns out perfect. I have not tried the warming rack yet, but I don't see any reason why it would not work great as well.If you love toast. Buy this toaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toaster","review":"My wife bakes bread which tends to be too long for a standard size toaster so I ordered this long slot toaster and am very happy. The browning control adjusts the number of blue lights from 1 to 10 with 5 being the default. The lights count down as toasting progresses so with a glance you can see how much longer before done. It's nice looking and has a pop up warming rack. The only negative is no bagel setting where only one element heats, otherwise it would have been 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Functional","review":"Love this toaster. It looks great- elegant and slim.Very easy to use- love the digital aspect. Just turn the knob to change the settings.I don't think I'll use the bun warmer, but it is a pretty neat feature!Highly Recommended!UPDATE:Had to mention two more things:The small \\"footprint\\" is fantastic. Takes so little room on the counter compared to other four slice/two slot toasters!It works FAST! Adding this because just two days ago, to my surprise, I found myself saying outloud, \\"Wow, that was fast!\\" Watch the settings, though- 2 dots or 3 dots, most, will brown that toast!Oh yeah- my three teenagers all think it's \\"awesome\\" for what that's worth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but...","review":"I was looking for something that I could put bread slices into, choose how dark I want it toasted, push a button and it would make toast. I wanted a simple toaster and the only factor complicating my choice is that I have a large family so I need one that can toast 4 regular slices or 2 large slices. After scouring the internet this seemed to be the one closest to fitting the bill without getting ridiculously expensive - we're talking about a toaster after all. I got and it works - 2 stars so far. It browns one side more than the other - no extra stars for even toasting. It will return to the default browning setting after each toasting - no extra stars for the convenience of being able to leave the toaster on the setting that you like. It will toast the next batch of toast differently from the first even if you set it the same - no extra stars for consistency.

I had it on ONE light, and it burned the waffle black to a crisp. I tried a second waffle, and put it on the two light level, just as a test, and it was pale as a ghost. What the heck! Also, this toaster is VERY hot to the touch. Sadly, I am going back to my hunt for the Holy Grail of toasters. I'll let you know when I find one.

It had the setting to be a special Movie, but I feel it was far below Mel Gibson's standards. I think Mel was fine but the screenplay was below average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Entertaining, Violent, and has Mel Gibson starring.","review":"What else can a girl ask for? I bought this in Blu Ray today and we watched it. It was very enjoyable, but definitely not a family film. Mel Gibson is superb here and looks better than in some of his previous movies. It was well written, well acted and, while the ending was a fairy tale one, it lacked the cheesiness. And for that, I was thankful. Would recommend this in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"Very entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Much of it could be considered a little too far fetched to be true, but that's why we watch movies, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it but didn't.","review":"Gibson. I really like PayBack and read somewhere this was similar or something like that. Well yes and no. Wanted to like it, really did but it was \\"tired\\" and just did not hold my interest. Guess it takes more than just Gibson being Gibson. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"didn't think i would like it......i was totally surprised. loved it!","review":"As a real movie snob, a purist. A fan of the coen bros, kubrick, Polanski, Ridley scott, danny boyle (still in denial he had anything to do with london's opening ceremony...yeesh), peter weir and etc....i hate smarmy heist-type movies. This was great. funny, entertaining every minute. (I usually skip through boring parts...i didnt touch the remote once. This was funny, gritty, charming, satisfying, and original. wow. where'd this come from? i want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"I went into it with low expectations, but it turned out to be a reasonably engaging movie. Its starts a bit predictable, and the situations require a bit of suspended disbelief. In the end, its a bit of a heart warming story. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Payback II","review":"I'm slightly annoyed that I wasn't able to finish this movie because my rental time ran out�?I got about 80% through the movie, and from what I can tell, it's more or less a sequel to Payback. Not literally, but his character in this movie is nearly identical. I loved Payback."},{"rating":"2","title":"T's Get the Gringo Review","review":"This was one of the better Mel Gibson movies that he has made and definitely the best that he has made lately. Mel is going back to his roots in this one in playing the smart, quirky, funny bad/good guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action. Great story. Great acting. Really enjoyed it.","review":"It appears that this movie didn't get any theatrical release in the US , due to Mel's recent history no doubt...And that's too bad. But this movie was pretty awesome! Great story. Great action. Great acting. I've read that the production team spent a lot of time on their research of El Pueblito Prison as well, which I think really shows. Really liked it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel","review":"We just HAD to add this to our DVD collection, we do like Mel, and once again he proved himself as far as we are concerned, quite the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Are Mexican prisons really this way? I guess I don't want to find out. Loved this movie, as a bonus, I believe it was free with Prime membership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This was a funny movie. The kid worked well with Mel. The movie had losts of corruption but still funny over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will NOT be disappointed","review":"Hello! This is a real Mel Gibson movie, as good as \\"Payback\\" and \\"Lethal Weapon\\". This is definitely worth renting and/or buying."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],W={key:0},N={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-e6c2b520"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/31.md","filePath":"people/31.md"}'),H={name:"people/31.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{G as __pageData,P as default};
