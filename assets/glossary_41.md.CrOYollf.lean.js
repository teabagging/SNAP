The most interesting character was over 70 years of age and had had a relationship last in France 1944. The hero-heroine pair didn't work. I had some moments when I wanted to find a baseball bat and hit the heroine. She was so complicated all the time. I gave two stars for Spock for president T-shirt and few good lines, like bat phone. But I had to force myself to finish this book. I like TDD-series but this one was totally different. Perhaps because I didn't like the hero a slighties bit. Well but his uncle... (the over-70-years-of age) that might have been an other story. Somehow this book was a mixup of terrorist, suspense and romances but neither of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rung my heart out","review":"Full of totally believable romance, feelings, plots.

Great book. I will read the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE S. Brockmann","review":"If you have never read any of Ms. Brockmann's books, you MUST try this one. Great story, great characters (esp Mallory and David!), great author. I have read all of Ms. Brockmann's work and she is truly great. When I purchase her books I can't put them down. In this book there are no main characters, all of Ms. Brockmann's characters play center stage. I strongly recommend reading this and catching up on other Suzanne Brockann novels!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jayne","review":"This is a great book as are all of the TS,Inc. books. I could read this book over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"Wow how other peoples perceptions differ from my own. So disappointed, it purports to be an action book, the story line on the rear cover, the macho title and cover picture and yet the majority of the book is how the girl is desparate to bed the hero. Give me a break, its a Mills & Boone two penny rag. Dont buy it, its a total waste fo money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader is the Unsung Hero","review":"If you make it through this book, you will be the unsung hero. The plot was simple and the characters were one dimensional. After seeing the book cover I thought this would be a book about the military...but it was about reunions and relationships. I found the book written at the high school level."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"This may be one of the worst books I have ever half read. It is touted as an action story.

Grocery book shoppers, it's all for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a few stories in the same book","review":"I love Suzanne Brockmann's books - and in The Unsung Hero you got quite a few stories all in the same book. You had two romances, plus another if you count the WWII story, and a possible present-day terrorist plot all going on at the same time. You really had the chance to get to really understand so many of the characters in this book. You really had to stay on your toes. Yes, indeed, you got a lot for your money all in this book. I can't wait to read another book by Ms. Brockmann. I love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Genre","review":"Those who buy this book expecting a typical genre romance will be surprised, and pleasantly so. This is a complicated story, a love story with three heroines and four potential lovers. Though the story is complex, it is handled admirably, and at no point does it strain a reader's credulity. There is the primary heroine, an accomplished modern woman, a secondary heroine who is a complicated teenager, and a flashback heroine. The flashback sections take place during World War II and are set in the French Resistance; these sections are printed in italics. The characterizations are plausible and the threads of the story are fascinating, woven together into a appealing tapestry. There is mystery, there is terror, there is sex. Ms. Brockmann is a masterful writer and poised to move to the head of her genre. This book holds the attention to the very last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This is one of those books that had me laughing and crying with the characters. The way this book was written was excellent. Ms. Brockman's use of a major plot and two subplots to tie the whole book together at the end was beautifully done. The sex was great, it was hot. I have read other books by Ms. Brockman and this is one of the best. Great summer read. Told my mom to read it. Job well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series","review":"I love this Troubleshooters series! Suzanne Brockman is an awssome author, I really enjoy her work.

It started off with a great premise, but quickly got sidetracked by a not-so-softcore porn story.

We just didn't care anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic, slow paced","review":"A person who lived in the Boston area I love reading books about Mass. I found there were no elements or descriptions of the Boston area. But this is minor compared to the poorly developed plot plan. Although the book was about a a Navy Seal, the author showed no understanding of miltary protocol. When I read a romance I look for conflict between the heroine and hero, in this book I found none. I couldn't recommend this book to anyone who wants a good romance to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyers beware","review":"Contact any seller before you buy and ask if they actually have the CD-ROM with the book. Most of the sellers make no mention of the CD-ROM and the one I ordered did not come with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constricting","review":"I purchased the Velocity 7 from Amazon after much searching for a suitable case for my new Canon 300D. I was attracted by the size (big enough to fit a 70-300mm lens attached) and interested by the sling style backpack.When I got it the size and style were very nice but the sling cuts too high across the chest and felt way too restrictive, so I sent it back. I couldn't imagine spending any length of time walking around with it on.For a coupla bucks more I purchased the Lowepro Off Road style belt/shoulder pack on Ebay and am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Velocity it is","review":"This bag will tightly fit a Canon 5D body with attached Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM lens and reversed lens hood, and one Canon Speedlite 580EX in the main compartment. Smaller accessories will then fill the remaining void in the smaller outer compartment.The bag is small enough where it can hang comfortably from my left shoulder. But it's nice that it can function as a sling bag as intended providing quick removal of the camera from the main compartment.This is the bag I use the most for situations requiring one camera and lens combination assignments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I found this bag too clumsy to get in and out of quickly. It needs a zipper along the outside edge to give more unfettered access to the storage compartment. I kept it, but really am not using it. I have been looking for another solution and haven't found one I like yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"The description says it will hold a body with zoom attached, two extra lenses, and a flash. While that's all true, the bag was to be so tightly packed that to change lenses requires removing everything to find the lens you need -- not very convenient for nature hikes. Additionally, the case won't hold the camera with a flash bracket attached (I tend to leave mine on, since it make my camera easier to hold.)This could be a nice unit if you only have one extra lens, though. The padding is also very thick, so if you abuse your equipment, this might be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice everyday pack alternative... 3.5/4 stars","review":"This bag has a nice form factor. It is a bit tight for D-SLRs as it holds the following quite tightly: Nikon D50 w/18-200mm VR and reversed hood attached; Sigma 10-20mm with reversed hood attached; and Nikon SB-600 Speedlight. The additional pockets hold the usual assortment of lens cleaner, grey card, memory, etc. I had to put 2/3 of the included dividers at the bottom of the bag to make it fit my stuff.I have two minor complaints:1. The waist strap is not detachable so when not in use it's either in the way or tucks uncomfortably into it's own pocket. So I guess I'll just wear it loosely.2. The shoulder strap doesn't use quality padding so I'll be buying a pad for it at some point. I guess weight is the penalty for nicer lenses...All told, for the price it's a nice little bag, carries nicely out of the way, and has a non standard look."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tight fit","review":"Everything is great about this bad. It's a very comfortable bag to carry and you can fit quite a bit of equipment. I have the canon eos d20 with the battery grip attached, a full size flash, and 3 total lenses in the bad, and other than a pretty tight fit (due to the battery grip) everything fits just fine. I have a 50mm, 75-300mm, and an 18-105mm lense in the bag and I carry it almost everywhere I go. The accessory pocket fits plenty of extra batteries a host of filters and memory cards. If you are going to attach a battery grip I would probablly recommend the velocity 9 just so it's not such a tight fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"This was a very subjective take on the way people in different cultures have viewed the mother of Jesus. It is written from the author's theological view of the topic, so do not expect a warm, fuzzy devotional read. I think I have only thrown away two books in my life, and this was one of the two. Honestly, I did not even finish reading it. The author, though well respected by some other readers and theologians that I know, was not able to gain my confidence. Two stars is a generous rating. There may be something here for those who want to pick through the chapters to find his sources to use for other research."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT use mest in the same sentence with the movielife","review":"the movielife is an awesome band signed to drive thru now. they are nothing like mest thou, even though they may have opened for them. if you like mest you will probably like the movielife because they are poppy and you probably have no music opinion.

Modern Christianity has turned the Old Testament into a storybook for simple life application. This approach renders most of the Old Testament, e.g., Lev, Num, Deut, et al. void and not applicable today. Such an approach is misguided, and this book will provide a framework of OT law and challenge you to apply it's principles today in modern culture. If you study the Biblical Law, you will find it wonderfully relevant to today's issues, and find yourself saying with the Psalmist, \\"I delight in God's law and meditate on it day and night\\". You will also marvel at God's wisdom, love, mercy, wrath, and sense of justice.

I was not convinced to buy this book by those who wrote positively about it, but rather because I read the numerous inaccuracies by Jill Malter, which is the typical diatribe and deliberate misleading hype that pro-israel propagandists employ to dissuade others from knowing the truth about ongoing israeli land thefts, state-sanctioned torture, destruction of homes, and bonafide war crimes and crimes against humanity.

It is clear early on that the information in this book is not accurate and that the author has bias. The distortions of the truth are so pervasive throughout that it would take a book to refute the garbage in Halliday's book.Much of what is written is filled with bits of truth but mostly inaccurate information that is wordsmithed into 30 second sound bites of disinformation. It seems that Halliday has not ventured out of his classroom much and is stuck in the theoretical world of the London School of Economics. His understanding of Islam and the Muslim culture is limited. His responses to many of the myths are so short that there is no way complete information can be provided. Hence the sound bites that have some truth to at least attempt a defense of accurate information. Mostly, this is not the case.Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short and Miss-information","review":"Mr Halliday states that in 89 Islam does not forbid the consumption of alcohol and for examples he give name of writers and poets who enjoyed their drink, and early verses that did not prohibit alcohol consumption. The reality, the alcohol prohibition was gradual in Islam. First it was permitted than it was prohibited while going to pray. Finally, it was prohibited. The Quran states that alcohol and gambling evil vices that should be avoided.If Ms. Halliday cannot this point accurately which is common knowledge, I cannot assume that anything that he says is accurate"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great title, shame about the content","review":"I expected to learn a lot from this book. Sadly, it is written by an economist and the book is frequently... economical with the truth.Halliday's myth 27 is that \\"The US, backed by the UK, invaded and occupied Iraq in 2003 to gain control of Iraqi oil.\\"The author proceeds to 'debunk' this 'myth' by reasoning that if oil is what Washington wanted it could simply have struck a deal with Saddam Hussein. Thankfully since then, some polititians have been a bit more honest. George Bush recently confessed that the US is 'addicted to oil' and few will have missed Bremner & Co's post invasion haste to privatise Iraq's national assets (ie. Iraq's oil industry).The West's violent addiction to cheap Middle Eastern oil clearly is NO MYTH. So Halliday's decision to gloss over this with 100 words begs the question - how far is the author's intention to reveal the truth about the Middle East and how far to conceal the truth about us?Great title.

Last time I checked we still live in a land where we don't have to pay for what we never got. If you spent as much time working on a good magazine for kids as you do sending out fake bills, you would have enough subscribers you wouldn't have to Shanghai any new ones with your fraudulent billing scam."},{"rating":"2","title":"no problems, nice magazine","review":"We never had any problem with the subscription after we stopped getting the magazine. It could be because we never opened the renewal notices but we ever got any collection agency notices either... It's a beautiful magazine.

It has great content and no advertising. We had a prior subscription to National Geographic Kids Magazine and I was dissapointed to discover the amount of advertising the the magazine contains. My 6yr old son has had the subscription for over a year and he recently has been asking for innapropriate movies, toys and disney cruise trips. When I asked him where he was seeing and learning about these movies, toys, and trips he smiled and said right here in my magazine mommy. As I looked through the issues, I was stunned to also discover that the advertising was inappropriate as well. I immediately cancelled this subscription. It's a shame because the actual literature and pictures are fantastic and educational. Shame on National Geographic for taking a beautiful educational magazine and turning it into a platform for advertising to our children. We now subscribe to ZOObooks, Kids Discover and Ranger Rick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count me in as another receiving nasty subscription notices","review":"We had a subscription to this magazine and it's a pretty good one for the kids, albeit woefully thin. I found it too expensive for the few pages the magazine has and did not renew it. After ignoring the standard renewal pleas, yesterday I found in my mailbox a letter (with subscription invoice attached, of course) stating that my account was \\"seriously past due\\" and that \\"further action is pending\\" on my \\"delinquent\\" account. For those getting similar notices, I found this number to call:1-800-825-2821The lady I spoke with said she cancelled the 'unathorized order'...we shall see if I receive any other notices.It really is a shame that the tactics of the subscription services overshadow the actual product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment!","review":"My 8 yr. old son waited and waited for his first subscription. What a disappointment when it finally arrived. I thought it was a brochure and almost threw it out. It is only 7 pages long. My daughters received subscriptions to American Girl and Discovery Girls and he was expecting his magazine to be comparable, but about Science subjects. On top of that they are telling me that his subscription is up in October when he only received his first one in February. I feel like we have been scammed. >:("},{"rating":"1","title":"They do send to collection agency","review":"I have been dealing with this company for 2 years to have them remove my name from thier collection agency.

There is no telephone number to call and only a p.o. box to correspond with. I suspect many people just pay the bill in order to avoid any trouble. I sent a notice to the Consomer Complaint agency in the states involved in order to get this fraud on record."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: They get pretty nasty on their billing....","review":"After receiving our first issue of this mag..and finding what I consider a brochure NOT a magazine (there are only like 5 pages).I decided it definitely wasn't worth my time or money (national geographic kids is so much better) I ignored my chance to renew. I didn't renew and now nasty letters keep coming to my home saying they are sending the account to credit bureau and threats to take legal action..OVER a magazine worth about 50 cents..hummm..I would NOT order from this company or have anything to do with this..and if they LIKE legal action they are going to get it if they put anything on my credit report!I am surprised this is happening to others and wouldn't have known if I hadn't read all the reviews. BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short, not much content, lots of big pictures.","review":"I had been getting National Geographic Kids and I was looking for something the next level up in terms of age and learning. The example on the website for Discover Kids looked like the right learning level and like it was put together well. I didn't realize that the 10 page example was the WHOLE magazine. I almost threw this out when I received it because it was so thin and looked like a piece of bulk mailing. The magazine is literally 10 pages long (double sided) and much of the space is taken up by large pictures and a full page of credits. Content is very minimal--$26.95 for 10 issues is definitely not worth it. I will be canceling my subscription and trying to get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good For the Money, Despite Thinness....","review":"I like this magazine a lot, although I wish they could bear to put more pages in it. Luckily, unlike the others on here (Those poor people... :( ),I never got any scam-like notices on the mail. (Or I didn't know what they were and threw them out!) For what you pay, you get a pretty good magazine (Definately contains more educational information than NGK!), but, like I mentioned earlier, I wish they put more pages in it...The only annoying thing about your first subscription if you're a girl, you're almost destined to get it, is a subscription request thing for that stupid Discover Girls magazine or whatever it's called; The only other mainly annoying thing is that they send mainly science ones, instead of maybe alternating from science to history. I you can, get it from your library so your not paying a fortune for such a slim magazine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced pamphlet","review":"Maybe I've been out of the loop for awhile, but I hardly think Discover Kids qualifies as a magazine. The paper quality is akin to newspaper, and the magazine content is so dismally thin it would only keep a child occupied for a few minutes. I would recommend this 'magazine' if you need fireplace kindling, but it's not something I would recommend for keeping a child engaged, reading, and learning.I ordered my magazine directly through Discover, and they were very pleasant about refunding the cost of the unused magazines when I requested it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the Journey of a great man","review":"This book follows up where Memory and Identity had left off, through the episcopacy of John Paul II up to his pontificate. Like all his writing it is beautiful. There were only a few passages where the style changed somewhat and it became more of a laundry list (and then I did this, after that I did that, then I did that) rather than a flowing narrative. Overall though this is a beautiful book. It's amazing to see so clearly how God acts in any given life. It is a useful reminder though, that just as freely and clearly as we can see his actions in the life of John Paul, so too must he be acting in our life, it may just be more difficult to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GIFT EVER","review":"MY DAUGHTER IS A HUGE FAN OF WLDFIRE.

It has served me well on trips, and at home for almost three years.The only things I dislike about it are that the DVD lid sometimes reads 'open' when I know it's latched closed. This probably because the sensor switch is worn or out of position. The other is that the player sometimes freezes on scene-select menus, or manual advance to the next scene.Both of these things have only shown up in the last few months.On a plane, on the road, or at home, this little unit has worked well for me.I wouldn't hesitate to buy another of these D1812's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it","review":"Seems like it is getting tougher all the time to find a cordless phone that works really well. I own another panasonic so I felt confident this one would be ok. But I kept getting complaints from people I called that I sounded distant or like I was inside a barrel. Then there were clicks and I was told I kept breaking up. The final problem was the design of the handset... somehow just couldn't get a comfortable fit with my ear. Seems like they design phones without even considering that someone has to hold the thing against an ear for what may be long periods of time. So had to return it and try another."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 3 months - battery degrades and is unusable","review":"This phone started out fine in August when the phone was first purchased. The phone would last a good couple hours off the cradle in an idle mode. However, now a single 5-10 minute phone call , after charging overnight, will inexplicably kill the phone, and the call, leading to an unusable product. Panasonic support wishes to charge me money to have the unit looked at - which I refuse to do , given I think the product should work correctly. Based upon other peoples feedback and experiences - I think this series of phones from Panasonic(2237/2247/2257) have a design issue that needs to be addressed - or better yet Recalled. Do not purchase this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"will not hold charge","review":"This phone has some greate features. The only problem is that you cannot make use of them if the phone does not work. This phone will not hold charge. I leave it in the charger all night, make one 15 minute call and then it either just dies or the battery shows that there is no charge left, and this is with a new battery. The other thing that I noticed while troubleshoting is that if you remove a fully charged battery, and then place it back in to the phone... it shows as almost completely empty.... like I said it would be a great phone, but there is something very wrong with this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if I read the review first...","review":"~I bought this phone when it just came on the market and there was no reviews available back then. I bought it becuase it was a good looking unit and it was Panasonic. I have had it for a year. I have to say..all the negative reviews about the ring, the battery and the charge are 100% true. I experienced them all plus many others... I just put mine back to the charger. I was so fed-up with it and decided to write this reiview (something I've wanted to do for a long time). If you are thinking~~ of buying this phone, please reconsider..unless the apperance is your most important consideration. It IS a sleek looking phone.~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep a charge, Please!","review":"Phone has great features, particularly fond of the speakerphone in the handset. But,could not get more than 30 minutes of talk time before battery would die. Contacted Panasonic customer service, they stated, \\"We recognize a problem with the battery compartment of this phone.\\" The solution was a pair of adhesive backed-felt pads. This was to help the battery make better contact to the positive and negative posts. I gave it 10 days and several charging cycles of the battery, and still no better than when I began."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"Problems I have had with this phone:Display on the phone randomly stops working and I either have to take out and replace the battery (which then results in a drained charge) or keep replacing on the charger until it come back. Either way it's a huge inconvenience.Reception is unpredictable at best. Sometimes it comes in great and sometimes it comes in lousy... kind of something I would expect in a cordless, although with a 2.4ghz I expected better... but really it doesn't seem like the cordless technology has made any leaps and bounds in the last 10+ years.If I place it on the table in speaker mode and don't place extremely gentle the phone shuts off.Features are ok.... it's kind of a pain to delete calls in the caller ID.Not the best phone I coudl have spent the money on.

They refused to provide any help and said if I was still in warrantly I could return it. Otherwise, I was out of luck. Panasonic was certainly aware of the problem with this phone, but clearly refused to publicly accept responsiblity or issue a recall. Thankfully, with a post it note, I have been able to solve the battery problem that has been plaguing me since I purchased this phone.

If you have grown weary with the cutesy cozy stories that pass for American mysteries today, you will be delighted to discover Ms. Tursten's books. She never lets her readers down. Her protagonist, the very competent Inspector Huss, is more than equal to any challenge that comes her way. Huss is a master at judo, which makes her capable of taking care of herself magnificently in tough spots. Inspector Huss does not go cute, naive, or fragile when things get tough, unlike the formula that our American mystery writers frequently follow for their female sleuths. No, the savvy Huss gets in there and takes care of business, no matter how dirty it might be. Get the book! Enjoy a great read! Helene Tursten can't write fast enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it is a terrible translation?","review":"I just bought Torso after finishing (in the last couple years) all of Nesbo's Harry Hole books (Norway), all of Mankell's Wallander books (Sweden), all of the Erlandur/Iceland books, several of Camilla Lackberg's books, and a smattering of other Scandinavian fiction. I was looking forward to a women detective. But I thought this book was so awkwardly written in the English language version, and the ending was abrupt and disappointing. I wonder if it is the translation, because the dialogue is so choppy and awkward, as is the expository writing. I also found it devoid of truly suspenseful moments as the plot thickened. (For example, when they finally realize who the killer is is such an underwhelming scene.)I am really surprised there are so many positive reviews!I may try another before I completely rule this author out, but this was a real letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery/Thriller Enthusiast","review":"Ever since I read \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" I have been a fan of the Scandinavian mystery writers.

Great production quality as well, I might add. The vocals are good( not great) with fantasy elements that have a hint of menace at some points.

No matter what religious faith that you belong to I would hope that you would look past the information in this book and find out for yourself what the LDS church really teaches.

It romanticizes the acts of disobeying parental guidelines and keeping potentially harmful secrets. It just made me sick to my stomach as I read it......I allowed my daughter to check it out from the library in a moment of weakness, but from now on there is a moratorium in our house on any \\"Disney Princess\\" merchandise.

Her father told her humans were dangerous but the \\"look in Eric's eyes told her she was not in danger\\". In my opinion this books teaches children that it is okay to disobey your parents, and keep secrets from them and everything turns out okay in the end. More importantly it suggests that a child is capable of knowing if a person is dangerous by the way they look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work","review":"Works great.

This book is through the eyes of on woman from childhood through adulthood. Just as your earliest childhood memories are confusing, so are hers. I realized when I was a child I took solace and comfort in certain perceptions and beliefs, that were not real. I have VIVID memories and emotional pulls to things, places and people that no longer intrigue me or anyone else. In short, this book is incredible.

I could get behind the actions of this more human version of Jimjoy.The entire novel is about hard choices: freedom vs. subjugation, the loss of control in the face of war, and principles pushing power (and the reverse). A brief romance as side plot, but the majority of the novel are preparations for Accord's independence followed by actual space missions and battles for that independence.

Those who sell online as a \\"hobby\\" are the worst because they do not have to worry about any profit margins, as long as they can re-sell a book for more than they paid for it it is a win for them. Anyone who had been selling books for a living would have spent enough time around them to have done the research and know all the things that are contained within this book. So, all I see this book doing is creating an avenue for people who won't take the time to understand books and book dealing to be able to sell books and steal business from hard working book dealing individuals.

I try to point them to what I think is the problem (seems rather obvious being an electrical engineer) and they keep sending what they think is wrong based on most frequently failed items. They don't much want to hear about actual symptoms. Also they tend to want to send whatever is out of stock, so it takes about a month to get any part.

It presents a fascinating account of important political struggles in the New Deal era. While focused on judicial politics and civil rights, it covers many aspects of American politics in the Roosevelt era. The book refutes the notion that FDR did not advance the cause of civil rights. Through judicial appointments and the creation of the Civil Rights Section of the Justice Department, FDR sought to undermine white supremacy in the South. The author argues convincingly that the Roosevelt administration did much to engender the Brown v. Board of Education decision that changed America forever.This book will be most valuable to those interested in American politics, history, and race relations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"A different take on FDR and race.

Not enough of the older material is here to give a good representation. And the truncated live material is rockus interruptus.Best starting point for this great band is likely the live \\"Cook\\" album. I love the older stuff like Photos of Ghosts, too.If you don't know these guys, think ELP with a violin and an Italian accent.

Did an editor even pretend to look at it? Aside from the anachronisms and inconsistencies, it is a poor book...left in its own time period of the 1980s, it would have been simply awful...cartoonish, one-dimensional characters, undeveloped plot line. Not even worth it as a beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a read","review":"I purchased this book in an airport. Had heard something about \\"Da Vinci Code\\", maybe I was confused with the title. Got about half way through this book before I finally said enough. A poorly written book with non-sensical turns in the plot development. For instance, a female reporter shows up to help the central character in Europe. She saves his life because she is packing a pistol and happens to be a crack shot. Even in 1983 it was not likely anyone packed a pistol in Europe. She could not have brought it from the states and almost impossible to purchase one in Europe. Well, the book goes on and on like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fiction Based on Facts","review":"Work leaves me little time for fun reading, but I picked up Da Vincy legacy on a whim, and read it in my spare time this week. From the first instant I started, I let every thing else drop.Perdue constantly leaves you wondering what's next. The plot twists, turns, begs you to read more and delivers every time!.The characters seemed real, if not always attractive.For a fact-reader, this book was a good draw to me because it was filled with so much history and fact that led me to dig deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, thought provoking","review":"When I first saw Da Vinci Legacy for sale, I thought it was a rip-off of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. However, I was surprised to see that it was first published in 1983 which makes it about the first novel to combine Da Vinci, art and religion into a thriller.I have also read Daughter of God and found the writing style there better than this one, but this was still very good.There were many echoes of \\"Code\\" here, but I suppose that is inevitable when you're writing about the same topic. I think that Perdue and Brown are different types of writers and that one should realize that. I prefer Perdue, but find Brown a good read as well.One thing I found interesting in \\"Legacy\\" is the strange way that the Elect Brothers of St. Peter kept their captives so dependent on them. I saw from the acknowdegements that Perdue credits a couple of Doctors at the UCLA medical school for helping develop this. Fascinating if this could somehow be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Enjoyed","review":"When I was in the Army, I was stationed in Germany, and got a lot of opportunities to travel around Europe on leave. I visited many of the places Perdue writes about in this book and his Daughter one and am struck by how perfectly he captures the feeling and look of these places. This was particularly enjoyable for me because I could visualize the settings of his characters, particulary the scenes in Amsterdam and Lake Como in Italy.I realize this book was one of his first works, but I enjoyed it thoroughly from first page to the last. The prose drew me in and held me there. I suppose there may have been some continuity errors in the update, but I did not notice them, nor did they hurt my enjoyment nearly as much as Dan Brown's did in both Angels & Demons and Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Da Vinci Legacy","review":"The Da Vinci LegacyReview by Centennial BulldogLewis Purdue does a fantastic job of taking the reader on a mysterious treasure hunt for the lost code of God, in his latest novel The Da Vinci Legacy. In the fist chapter of the book you meet the main character Vance Erikson who is an intriguing with a smart and cunning intelligential. He has the vocabulary of a Ph.D. scholar and a certain charm that is equivalent to Casanova. Although the book its self is a bit bias, Purdue has a wit about his writing that excites you to what is on the next page. The Da Vinci Legacy a literary great that will surly be read in classrooms for years to come, and Purdue is a talented writer that could hold his own next to greats such as Steinbeck, King, Twain, and Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I picked this book up at a used book store because I thought it might have a new theories on DaVinci - and I'm always in need of a book to read at the beach. It's obvious this book was re-tooled to capitalize on the success of Dan Brown's DaVinci Code. But the errors in the \\"updating\\" drove me crazy. Things like 'eleven years ago after 9/11' or how the hero applied to Oxford in 1966 after serving in the First Persian Gulf War.There was no action, no suspense. The book was predictable. Halfway through I was rooting for the bad guys to just kill Vance and be done with it. I did not enjoy this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh you must be kidding","review":"Well .... you might enjoy this book if you are willing to suspend all disbelief .... and I mean ALL. To say the plot is incredible (in the literal meaning of that word) is an understatement. It is diverting but the updated paperback has topical references that are both unnecessary and ridiculous (its reference to 9/11 coming to mind).I give it points for being diverting. In other respects it is just plain lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was the editor asleep?","review":"Here's the problem: the book is actually set in two different years at the same time. At one point the book claims to be set in the early 1980s. A hundred pages (and a couple of plot days) later, it claims to be set in 2012. I can believe the former because the book has that cheesy 80s style. 2012: no way. Both at the same time? How could the editor let this kind of mistake through? This completely ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOT to be a movie!","review":"This book has GOT to be a movie!It is creative, visual, fast-moving and so totally non-derivative.I also like the way the main characters change and mature. Both Vance Erikson and Suzanne Storm start out as cocky, brash and self-centered. Erikson needlessly offends people and Suzanne is a total witch.The danger throws them together and forces them to depend on each other. Through the heat of this action, they both mature into characters that end up the book far more likeable than they started.I think I once walked along the same streets and visited the same places in Amsterdam as Erikson. Perdue describes his locations so beautifully that I can visualize them in my mind.This is a very pleasurable read and offers a lot more for the intellect than the average paperback thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Da Vinci\\" In the title does not a classic make....","review":"Note that the reviews posted by the publisher are for \\"Daughter of God\\". Even the publisher couldn't find a good word about this book. It died a miserable death in 1983; and deservedly so. But the success of Dan Brown with the Code has allowed every story with Da Vinci in the title to be dusted off and reprinted. With such riveting dialogue as \\"Let go, you crazy Brit!\\" during a struggle for a gun and \\"Hey, watch it\\" during a chase scene, the book just lacks literary creativity. And the attempts to update it just make it worse. Lire are now Euros (but the conversion factor?), and we now know that the first gulf war took place in the early '60's. The dates have not been changed, so the hero would be about 60 in the updated version. A good friend gave me the book so I suppose I'll slog through the rest of it. It IS a quick read; there's THAT going for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If poor writing annoys you, don't read this book","review":"I do a lot of traveling and often read thriller/adventure novels to pass the time. This was the worst-written book I've read in myseven years of air travel. While I thought the plot was weak, my main issue was with the writing itself. Here are two examples:\\"she...sipped at her drink with a vengeance...\\"\\"Christ, Vance thought, the woman has nerves like a battleship!\\"If the above doesn't bother you, then you might possibly like the book. However, these are just two examples of many and not the worst -- just what I remember. I found the writing so distractingly bad that I couldn't enjoy the book at all. I actually don't know why I bothered to finish it. But I did throw it away afterwards -- something I almost never do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be re-editied","review":"Although the story itself is good enough to keep a reader interested, the countless errors in the novel are distracting. The book was first published in the early 80s, so in an effort to make the book more \\"current,\\" the publishers added lines about 9/11, the Gulf War, etc. However, they don't fit with the timeline and dates given in the book. For instance, one character discusses an event that happened in 1975 as though it were yesterday, then they mention someone as being a Gulf War vet. They talk about being in Beruit, then skip to Gulf War Iraq as though they happened back to back, rather than decades apart. The anachronisms only jumble the story. They probably should have left the origianl novel alone and just republished it (like the Bourne Identity, which - although very dated with phonebooths rather than cellphones - is a very good read). I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DaVinci'sLegacy","review":"I thought this book had great shoot out scenes and great escape scenes but little else. The reader doen't get to the \\"heart of the Matter\\"until page 200, after way too much blood has been spilled. This book was first published in 1985,yet contains references to 9/11. I think Leonardo would flip in his grave if he thought this much death and destruction was his legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Da Vinci Legacy","review":"Great read. Fast paced. Considering that the book was originally copywritten in 1983, the book currently has definite topical interest. I think that the concept of the Legation and the ties and comments regarding the CIA shed light on the current war in Iraq. It seems that the only way to get truth now is through fiction.There were some editing glitches that were a bit disconcerting however, the book is insightful and one that I would recommend for background content.Currently reading Perdue's \\"Daughter of God\\" and can definitely see growth and improvement in writing, plotting, and pace.

The book is fast-paced with a great number of shoot outs. The goal and object of the codex is a partical beam weapon and the object of Reagan's star wars missile defense proposal, so this isn't a claim to religious artifacts. Da Vinci was so prolific in so many fields with a myriad of ideas and inventions that almost anything can be attributed to his works. Pick a subject.This was a good thriller in 1983 and still is. But Legacy is not the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" even if the \\"Daughter of God\\" is determined to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, really bad.","review":"I was interested to read this book after a local bookseller recommended it.All I can say is I have no idea why it was suggested. Honestly the plot isn't so bad - just poorly executed.

If you're looking for Lincoln I suggest you look elsewhere (Abraham and Mary Lincoln; a House Divided). What you find here barely scratches the surface. Topics are raised and then quickly dropped. One subject that was not dropped however was the lengthy interview with George W. Bush who tries to convince the viewer that he, too, like Lincoln had to deal with serious threats to the Nation. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus (so did George) but, to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen in his debate with Dan Quayle -- \\"Mr. President, you're no Lincoln\\".

It's bulky so it's hard to find a place to keep it when you're not using it. This can cause a huge problem if your car is already packed tight. 2. The clasps don't work that great so it's hard to get it to stay attached to the carseat. It works ok for older kids but the little ones have a hard time if it won't stay clasped."},{"rating":"1","title":"DHP-100","review":"I bought a couple of these. One of the two died on me the first hour of attempted use. Amazon was kind enough to send me another, but as it is, I never got them to work for me. And I checked the polarity of my outlets, they were fine. Tech support from D-Link must have taken lessons from David Spade in the credit card commercial. Sure, they try to help you out, but you can forget getting them to take them back. No. No. No. They'll use any excuse they can think of...they went through two or three with me.I advise you to avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unrecognizable to Network--No Plug & Play","review":"I ordered two of these units and they were absolutely inert.

Beautiful illustrations, which employ autumn-ish color schemes, make for a visual treat, while the story conveys a wonderful message of social responsibility. Highly recommended for bedtime as well as discussions about hibernation (all the information about each animal's hibernation behavior is accurate, and obviously researched)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to Sleep","review":"This book is perfect for my preschoolers. We were studying hibernation, and they loved the illustrations and the story line. An adorable book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"My favorite part of all of Denise Fleming's children's books are her very unique illustrations. She uses a very different technique where she basically makes her own paper, that creates very interesting pictures. The story itself gives a very good introduction on the topic of hybernation in a fun way for children. It is simple, yet you stayed interested in the story. You meet a lot of interesting animals throughout the story, and the story even has a fun twist at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"SVSU Teaching Student Review","review":"Time to Sleep by Denise Fleming is a great book for home or for the classroom. It could be an outstanding book to use for a bed time story because each of the animals in the story must find their friend to tell them it is time to sleep for winter. Also this short book could be an excellent book to use in a science classroom to discuss the concept of hibernation and that is why all the animals are going to sleep. The illustrations throughout the book are amazing as well. I would recommend this book for students preschool to second or third grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Great Artist!

I just had to search for the album again. As the last reviewer said, this is an overlooked talent. He deserves so much more popularity and appreciation of talent.

Perhaps it is my own bias, but I do not like such phrases as \\"like he was confronted with an alternate universe\\" when the time period is 14th century. I found Constance portrayed as a modern woman rather than a woman at a time when the women were not considered equal to men. This out of time feeling was unnecessary from my perspective and off-putting...to such an extent that I stopped reading halfway through, something I very rarely do. I will be more wary in future, and will certainly not spend money on this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't this free?","review":"This kind of material should be available on the net for free.

Most of the material is in English. The system is corny and simply ineffective. In fact, after the second disc I simply couldn't bring myself to go on. I would say the most you would get out of this is handful of French words and phrases. You'd do better memorizing out of a phrase book. I know the creators were sincere and really wanted to do something unique, but the system is just a failure in my opinion. Try Behind the Wheel French instead (and of course, Pimsleur)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This was really bad. Dr. Blair tries to teach you French by putting you in an adventure story. I got this on sale for a few dollars and it wasn't even worth that. If you want to learn French using the auditory method then use Pimsleur or Michel Thomas which are so much better than this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Synoptic Performance, Great!","review":"Here is one of those cheapie CDs that is indispensable. Thi performance by Gonnenwein from Ludwigsburg of the Great Mass is much finer than the much-earlier one available from EMI. The reading brings together the diverse stylistic tendencies of the work -- alluded to way back when by Einstein the musicologist -- in a a sort of grand and elegant synopsis. From that perspective it is really is best, to my ears. For utter drama, with some of the same summarizing talent is the old Celibidache document from Italy. But this Ludwgisburg performance really has a sympathetic clarity that helps you not be deterred by the almost terrible monumentality of the work. In such capable hands it is still monumental, but also very human and touching. Simply a wonderful account of the music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting...a must for WW fans!","review":"Boyer, Cherryh, Pierce and Tarr capture WW well in these stories set in Ms. Norton's beloved realm.

I take it home, after 1 day, I am completely dissatisfied with the phone. Here's why:1) The camera quality is disheartening, something I should've expected when buying a VGA camera, although I've seen MUCH nicer quality VGA cameras.2)The flash is incredibly weak. It basically defeats the purpose of having a flash. At night time, it literally wont have any kind of effect unless your subject is less than a foot away.3)The entire set up of the phone and its features are weak and severely lacking.

The old addage that you get what you pay for definitely applies here. Software is okay, but not dazzling. Performance is nominal, but some newer DVDs (with SS 5.1) may have playback problems - sound plays, but video freezes. After about a year or so, the thing starts breaking down - front panel display flickers, sound cutout, disc drawer freeze. I was impressed by the construction - all metal chasis and good ventilation.

I also noticed that the audio output for the central speaker has stopped working, which ruins the surrround sound effect.So if you want an entertainment system that delivers no video and incomplete audio within a year of purchasing it, this is the product for you.

First, although I can access the DWL-810+ via the browser, the wizard that should take you through the set up does not work. If instead I use the manual interface, when you try to enter a WEP key for an encrypted network, it fails to accept it and comes back with an error in accessing the DWL-810+.

What kind of weirdo would write a sentence like \\"....of course, the death of a child is always tragic, even when it is expected\\"?There are a few such pronouncements in the book, but the whole thing is saturated with that strange arrogance that only doctors seem to manage - I think it comes from dealing so much with \\"the sick\\" and \\"suffering\\" family members, that they start thinking that doctors are some higher breed of \\"healthy\\" humans who are on earth to offer hope to poor unfortunates.I would not recommend this book for parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great source of information","review":"This book uses easy to understand language to explain the complexities of this group of disorders.

The author after spending years observing people die on death row and being employed as a chaplan in the Texas criminal system now says he does not believe in capital punishment. I find what the author has to say at times hard to believe and as I was going through the book my interest just fell off the map.

I still believe there are crimes which are so heinous that the death penalty should be used. However, I am troubled that there seems to be no uniform criteria which dictate when it is used.

The premise is truly unique - that Elvis is alive, he's a health nut, and he needs protection from a tabloid journalist who may be on to him. Robert Patrick shows some terrific comedic chops as Elvis - his makeup is impressive - I actually think this is what he'd look like if he were still alive and practiced yoga. Jay Mohr is funny as the sad-sack rube detective he hires and Joe Mantegna sports a pony tail as a sleazy music producer. It's all very tongue-in-cheek, reminiscent of a Barry Sonnenfeld movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebel Comes Home","review":"I'd read the book, the book was pretty good. Then I saw the movie starring Jay, well, it had to be okay. It was better than that. It should have hit the theaters, it's just funny. Robert Patrick going from Terminator to the King? Wow, it was just amazing. Elvis is alive, he's being hunted by the tabloids -what a surprise, he needs a detective and finds a fellow southern boy to do the job. Bubba is kind of a bumbler,but he gets the job done.I couldn't belive the cast - Robert King, Joe Montegna, Katt Williams, Nikki Cox, the make-up guys who reproduced Elvis in his 70's - no jumpsuits in site, excellent! Highly recommend, music is outstanding as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy but funny","review":"I honestly ordered this movie to get free shipping on an item that was a few dollars off from the $25 free shipping - it still turned out to be a better deal that way...although the movie was pretty cheesy, it still had me laughing.

Not only does it lack the power to promote adequate sound quality, after a few months the DVD player will stop recognizing that there is a disc in there. Unfortunately, it most likely will occur in the middle of a movie. Also, when this player gets warm after an hour of continuous use it will cease to play and the disc will begin to skip. This product great in theory, terrible in application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be Better","review":"I purchased this system because of my prior excellent experience with Sony products. I was also influenced by the fact that, unlike Bose systems, proprietary wiring is not required. I had the speakers installed by an experienced electronics technician, and the system initially worked well. I commend the sound quality, but the volume/power needs to be stronger for some DVD/CD selections. After viewing about 12 DVD movies, the sound stopped working entirely, and this was just after the warranty ended. It had no sound for the receiver, DVDs, or CDs. I contacted Sony, and the cost of repair is $[money] For a $[money] system, this seems excessive. I'm still comtemplating these repair costs, but it may be necessary to avoid a [money] debacle. I'm definately taking another look at Sony quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Quality Product","review":"I got this system a couple of months ago and already I've had numerous problems. First, the DVD drawer occasionally gets stuck and sometimes will not work at all. I have to reset the system to get it to work. Even then it will only be good for a few more opens and closes before it jams up again.Second, it will not play some DVDs. It will start them, but once it gets to the main menu, it says \\"Program play of title # (we&#65533;ve seen 4, 10, 20, 33, etc.) prohibited now\\" and stops the disc. I've found a way to get around this on some DVDs, but it still creates great frustration, which is the opposite of what I want when I watch a movie.Quite frankly I would expect higher quality than this from Sony. I am going to take this system in to have it looked at, but I am regretting getting it in the first place.However, I should say that when the system is working the sound is great! Hence, the reason for two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit jams and will not open -- second unit","review":"The DAV-C450 has been pretty good--when it works. The sound is great and there have been no performance issues with the DVD player (except for one major issue--to follow). The remote is probably far more complicated than necessary for the features the unit has. But overall, the unit performs pretty well, when it works.That being said, we had to replace our previous unit after a month because the DVD tray would not open. Our second unit has worked for about nine months and the same issue just began. We cannot get DVDs in or out of the unit.I've read some other reviews here that suggest that others are having similar problems. This defect alone is serious enough to warrant avoiding this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it Back, And go to Best Buy","review":"After recieving this system for my birthday I was expecting it to hold up a lot better than my pioneer home theater, but was sadly mistaken. After a week I managed to blow out the two front channels and the sudwoofer. I took it back to recieve another hoping it was a defect. But it wasn't, soon enough I had blown out the same speakers again. While I still could I took the system back and got my money back. After I recieved my money I went looking for a better system. Best Buy is where I found it. fifty dollers more same wattage and no blowing out. Thank God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice System!!","review":"I have had this system for about a year now. I don't know why some of these people are giving this system a 1 star. Maybe it's the way they treat their system. The installation was simple (except for the wiring, it'd be a lot easier if Sony came up with the idea of wireless speakers, that'd save a lot of time). I do admit that the CD changing is slow. But I don't care, I keep the Lord of the Rings DVD's on slots 1-3. The other 2 are just there. The sound is alright for DVD's, but isn't so good with CD's. Not enough bass. Another problem is when I was watching Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (3.5 hour movie), the system really heated up. Other than that, the system is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK...for a while","review":"I've had this system for about 15 months and it worked great until the last month.

I'd stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This system has a serious problem with the dvd stacker","review":"Its been 7 months since I purchased this unit, One day it refused to open the dvd disc drive, All my rented DVD's were inside the player. I had to open and the cover and manually remove the DVD's to avoid the late fees. Once I removed the dvd'd it started working again. This problem happened thrice. As soon as I remove the disks it works. When it works the sound is good. I never expected Sony to build such a bad product. Looks like many have experienced the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD function sucks","review":"I bought this system about 2 years ago and within an year it had problems with DVD playback. By tweaking it, I could make it work for a while but it stopped working altogether. Luckily I was still in the warranty time period and the repair shop fixed it fine. But now, I am having issues again with the DVD function. The tuner and other inputs work just fine, though. The DVD tray won't open. There's one CD inside and I can't get it out or get it to play. And since I am not in the warranty period, I am not motivated to get it repaired either. I guess I will just use it as a sound system and buy a DVD player separately. I am not impressed with SONY this time. Looks like many other users have/had similar issues with this \\"dream\\" system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"I purchased this unit in 2003 and it has been OK for the first 2 years. Once in awhile a disc would get stuck. Last week I was using the \\"shuffle\\" option and it stopped playing in the middle of a song and I could not get the CDs to come out. I called Sony help line and they told me to ship it to a Sony authorized dealer. It looks like a lot of people have this same problem but the guy at Sony said he never heard of any problems with this unit. I took it to a repair shop and they said a PC board was bad and would cost $295 to replace! They said it was cheaper to just get another system. I'm considering getting a $40 DVD player to plug into the back of this unit so I can still have the AM/FM and surround sound. I am very dissappointed and will probably not buy a Sony product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I purchased this product back in 2003 and it was fine at first. After about a year, I had some problems playing DVD's where it would start up, go to the main menu and then just stop and move on to the next disc. Sony tech support was no help, but I did find a soloution by randomly hitting buttons, trying everything and anything I could think of to make the system work again - I believe it was some sort of a region problem/setting on the unit that I somehow corrected.Then, a couple of months later, I was unable to hear sound through any of the aux ports or radio. All sony can say is to send it in for service. My father in law bought a much cheaper panasonic home theatre system about 6 months before I got mine and his has never had any issues and sounds just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical Product with Poor Documentation","review":"The Polar S625X Heart Rate Monitor is no doubt a technical marvel for serious racers and their coaches. It has many training and record-keeping capabilities that can be shared with your coach.That's not me. I like to run and bike for exercise and keep records of how I do. This unit is way too complicated for me and the documentation is soooo bad that I got to page 60 before I figured out how to run with my time and heart rate displayed.

The 725 worked flawlessly for the most part, with no worries and no problems until the battery died and the watch simply wore out after about 3.5 or 4 years. The 625 simply put, never works. I have finally gotten it to record cycling data, so I will not change any settings. Forget about downloading data, it will not download the data to the Polar software - at all, ever. I contact Polar support and to my surprise, they were of no help. Basically, they told me it does not work. This product must be the one bad egg. But, I will think before I purchase another Polar product. On a positive note, it does keep the time and the alarms work well and I still ware it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great running (or walking) watch","review":"I really like the heart rate monitor and it works great. As has been said, it takes some time learning all it does, but it's worth it in my opinion. The only thing I was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit, but from what I have been told by others and their brands of running watches, they all do this to an extent. Everything else I'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone.

In other words, you are on your own as far as programming this watch for your individual exercise needs. You will have to waste a lot of time on every aspect of this watch from setup to regular usage. Even downloading data to the computer is a hit or miss challenge which works as often as it doesn't. Also, this watch is very inconvenient for everyday usage b/c it has too many parts. It's much more convenient to have a gps watch which eliminates the foot pod and leaves only the heart rate device as the one xtra thing u have to remember to put on. Additionally, it's insanely overpriced for such an old and obsolete model. In fact, it costs more now than when I bought it years ago. Yes, years ago, that's how long this model has been out.

Stokes' writing is very reader-friendly and he has done a good job of including what's actually important and truly helpful while leaving out the hair-splitting.

Flavor is nice and crisp, taste is better than any others I've found, and the price is reasonable (not budget but not gourmet). Also love the texture of the mustard seeds.

I don't think there's one page in this book which doesn't have an unnecessary description about this, that, or the other. In all, the actual story of this book was probably no more than 30 pages, if that, while the rest of the pages were filled with (mostly) needless details, the purpose for which seemed to be the author's desire to wow readers with her extraordinary ability to describe any given thing/situation to death.On the positive side, the book does offer some interesting information/perspectives on gender, class, and race issues during 19th-century (colonized) Jamaica.

There was also too much flowery prose - the constant description drew away from the potentially interesting plot. Furthermore, the main character was not likeable to me. He was selfish, self-absorbed and did not have a desire to connect with others. He was too withdrawn into his own pain and whined too much. Though his life was a hard one - it certainly wasn't as hard as those of his Chinese compatriots who labored on the tobacco plantations. His constant philosophying and dissatisfaction greatly irritated me. Also, Lowe takes credit for the pagoda which others built. He actually does not do anything of use throughout the book.

There's absolutely no pause between lessons. Get ready to pause the dvd throughout the lesson. If you look carefully, you can notice that he is out of breath and excessively sweating. That's how fast he moves through the lesson. This is a typical, low budget guitar instruction. This is also not made in 2006, but rather 2005. I suggest \\"the Fender Presents: getting started on Acoustic guitar\\". Fender took their time making their 300 min dvd. \\"Guitar Lessons:..\\" is a okay video.. But are you kidding me?

Of course I would assume that to be crowned poet laureate, one's work would have to be conventional and non-controversial to the degree that it would be acceptable for the mass market.

As an amateur poet who is learning to fall in love with the medium and all other artistic mediums late in life, I find it hard to be critical of any artist. I think they are all noble in simply pursuing a craft that so few really care about. That, to me, is bold. In a culture addicted to quick fix idiot entertainment, blessed is the man who can get across to the masses through the written word sans pulp. Collins is one of those artists and good for him.Every poem in this book was worth reading IMHO. A range of subjects are covered and Collins is never dark and brooding. He displays sensitivity and uses evocative yet accessible imagery to elucidate common evreyday themes.As to his detractors I believe Collins would respond like this:I want the scissors to be sharpand the table to be perfectly levelwhen you cut me out of my lifeand paste me in that book you always carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is so funny - my partner and I read it out loud to each other, and fall over laughing at many of them.

His astonishment at the Irish cow's \\"cowness,\\" for example, made me want to throw up.I have nothing at all against \\"accessible\\" poetry; but bad poetry masquerading as something profound--that I have a problem with.

The voice that the reader should hear while reading this monstrosity is the voice of a 6th-grader with a college-level vocabulary. There is no spark in Collins' writing. There is no life in this work. And if that is what it takes to become America's Poet Laureate, I will never read nor review another again!If, in fact, you are craving poetry with Outlaw flair and a touch of Hunter Thompson, I suggest you read \\"European Confession\\" by Timothy Edward Jones (ISBN: 1-4137-2867-7)."},{"rating":"1","title":"[child drinking Nestea or maybe ginger ale]","review":"there's a thousand reasons I could cite in support of mycontention thatBilly Collins oughtta be off'd. but heh,someone says, he's the poet laureate of the United States!...yeah.when I see a Lutheran minister amble outta the athenaeum with anarmload of Billy's books, I takea swig of cough syrup and hope thatI can save up enough dough to moveelsewhere (Trinidad & Tobago?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Edition Needs Better Formatting","review":"The poems are fantastic--full of life and humour.

Under ordinary interior lighting conditions, it is impossible to get a clear, naturally colored picture: all you will get is a noisy, muddy mess. Of course the lens quality matches the image sensor: it's awful.This is a real shame, because D-Link almost made a pretty good product here.

This is terribly frustrating and a poor design for a water tank. They need to redesign it for it is not friendly to refill. Probably some Chinese designer doing goofy things?

So, great, now instead of breathing dry clean air you breathe moist air with mold spores.I just cant figure out why the designers did not reverse the air flow, so that humid air goes through fewer parts so that when mold grows you can clean in easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwile product for the price","review":"The product is fine.

When I contacted the manufacturer regarding a warranty claim, I was told that after 1 year's use, it was considered a normal wear and tear issue not covered by the product's 5 year warranty! To purchase a replacement tank, the cost would be $20 + $6.95 s/h. Obviously, not worth it. Just go out and buy an entirely new unit.

It works by wicking water up into a filter that is probably 36 square inches of exposure. The tank doesn't hold a lot of water and is designed so when you're filling it, you have to balance it in the sink instead of having a surface that could just sit upright.A cheap fan completes the poor design and operation of this unit.Maybe that's why it's rated so highly as a 'dehumidifier'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product Hard to Replace","review":"I have used this humidifier everyday for the last 3 months with great success.

The problem would have been caught if they had just plugged it in before packaging.Tech Support was OK, but they were very disorganized and seemed to be working on an extremely slow \\"network\\" - each one asked for the case#, but couldn't find it - and after stating my name and number they would tell me that I am calling regarding\\"DI-514\\" but would not pull-up rest of the info.Bottom Line: My time is way too expensive to deal with D-Link. Never again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good...","review":"Purchased this a few weeks ago and just set it up. The instructions in the box are basically useless - compared to the Netgear, for example, you better know what you're doing. But I basically do and didn't have any real trouble with initial setup: MAC address filtering didn't work right the first time and I had to do a hard reboot, but otherwise ok.Also, a bright spot for customer service. Two of my laptops worked fine out-of-the-box but one could connect but not send or receive packets; I called tech support, and while they slowly read to me off of some manual, they asked enough questions to talk me through configuration steps I've never had to touch before and that worked perfectly - fixed that laptop and kept the others running.

Then they sent me the 514, but it wouldn't let me get on the web when connected wirelessly. I connect via ethernet and no problem, so DHCP is OK. Finally, remembering something I read about using Linux with this router, I went to the Advanced section on the config utility, then selected \\"Performance\\", then set the \\"Preamble Type\\" to \\"Long\\" instead of the default \\"Short\\". Wallah! It worked! Don't know if it was because my neighborhood was crowded with other wireless routers, or if because I set the SSID to not transmit (though this didn't cause a problem with the 614+) but anyway that's something to consider if you're having a problem with this router and an iBook. Otherwise, it seems fine so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I bought the DI-514 because I wanted to have a wi-fi router and it was only $20. What a mistake. First, if WEP (encryption) is turned on, wi-fi simply does not work. I've tested this with three laptops and two Pocket PCs. Wi-fi does work with WEP turned off, but it's painfully slow, and keeps dropping the connection.Second, the router's firewall cannot be configured, even though the documentation says so and there's an area in the \\"advanced\\" configuration that supposedly lets you set specific firewall rules. No luck. I set the rules and tried everything, but the firewall was still blocking my applications. Very frustrating. The website support is just terrible, with lots of errors in their knowledge database.I'll never buy anything from D-Link again.

Upon returning it, the store gave us no trouble and said they had lots of problems with them. The second unit (the same model) can access the config menu but barely connects. I can't believe the speed is so slow and the range is so bad. Basically, if it even connects, you can count on your speed being half of the speed you'd get with a direct connection, and the range is limited to the one room (maybe the next room if you're lucky, but it'll soon disconnect).As I said, I have a linksys and it is so much better than this d-link.

After a session with the tech support line, I received a replacement unit which, out-of-the-box, had a dead power supply.

Yes, I've upgraded to the latest firmware and I understand how to use it. I have had a couple major issues with it. The first is that the wireless just stops working about twice a week and I have to restart the router. The second is that one time for about a day the router stopped working for all the LAN ports (the wireless still worked). All of them, just done. I tried restarting (again, I did it properly), but it was a futile effort. Then, the next day it started working again after nothing had changed. My most recent issue has been setting up a webserver. Despite properly configuring the virtual hosts, it still won't let traffic go to my server. I even put my server in the DMZ and traffic still couldn't get through! I checked to make sure everything was properly configured (firewall, filtering, etc.). This thing is awful, and I'm saying that even though I paid $10 for it.

I put sniffers on both sides, and found that hosts on both sides would do \\"a lot\\" of TCP re-transmits through the hub. Fairly regulary, re-transmits would fail, and it would backout-retry up to 132 seconds before finally getting the data through. As you can imagine, this has a major impact on performance.I've tried every variety of option, especially the ones on the \\"performance\\" tab, to no avail.

FR's character recognition is superior, but the best feature is that it chooses a font size and kerning that really do an excellent job of reproducing the original (not choosing too-small font sizes with giant spaces, like Omni-10).Overall, beats Omni-10 -- which in turn beats everything else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heil Mitler!","review":"This is an incredibly scary and horrifically funny piece of cinema.

For occasional photo printing, it's not too bad. I've seen faster printing, and I don't believe I can say that I've seen slower.

Now the heroine's nasty husband (a pious \\"Christian\\" who was in reality a brutal wife and child beater) has died, and his cousin, whose love for her was thwarted, has inherited his vast estate. Since then, he's also become a wealthy (self-made) man in the Canadian fur trade. Now he's in England looking over his inheritance and wondering if he should be looking for a bride. The cold reception he receives from his former love doesn't deter him. He decides to stay and invite a houseful of Christmas guests. Balogh does star-crossed lovers well, she does children well, and she also does Christmas well (some of her most marvelous stories have been set at that forgiving season of the year). The combination is unbeatable! A warm and winning story to cherish and re-read. True love doesn't die, and Balogh will make you believe in its power all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes... no...","review":"I got so tired of the heroine only responding to the earl in one word answers.

Not the best, but worth picking up for a few days of fun and action.

I've never heard of 2K Games before but if they make anything else in the future I'll avoid picking it up. There are no patches, thier support forums are hardly worth visiting, and when asked to support their game they flat out refuse to do it.So, BUYER BEWARE. When the game works, it is pretty decent. When it doesn't, you are screwed because there is little, if any, recourse especially since the store I bought it from refused to refund the money because it was an open product (I don't blame them, if I ran a computer game store, I'd have the same policy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy portals -- which way is up?","review":"I loved playing this game!

And the violence in the game goes over the top. I've played first-person shooters of all kinds with pretty intense gore. But this is the first time I've seen children as victims of the violence. When I saw that particular scene, I said, that's it. Not for me. Look past it? I could, but I choose not to. I don't feel I need to support a company that goes this far with violence in a video game.

He copied scores from one movie to another. I think a very essential collaboration exists between the director and music director, because the latter can literally bring the movie to its knees. A director who can't understand this relationship, hints at his mediocre abilities. At one extreme is saving private ryan where speilberg kept the music to the min. and let the unfolding events speak for themselves since that's what was required of the scenes.

Perhaps the great Hollywood composers are running out of ideas! Williams, Zimmer, Barry and Goldsmith have all copied themselves in their most recent work.

In 2007, the wire in back snapped loose. This wire runs upward from the center piece between the bottom legs to the center piece between the lower and upper legs. It snapped because the wire is held in place by s small steel barrel, which fits inside a small receptacle incorporated in that lower center piece. Unfortunately this part is ill-designed because it lacks sufficient metal to counteract the force exerted by the wire. In 2007 Ott-Lite replaced the part and I successfully installed it. Now (January 2011) the metal of this new part gave way again and just like the first one, just broke off. You can see where the metal gave way. It is just poorly designed. I called Ott-Lite and they are not sure they have spare parts of which they could send me one. I am waiting!!!!! Very strange because they are still selling the lamps per their web-site. Unless I hear soon I am going to have to look for an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive at half the price","review":"My Ott-Lite crane lamp had an arm and fixture which sagged under its own weight (which is light) when extended. That problem was not fatal as it was possible, though not particularly easy, to adjust. However, the flourescent lamp would not work unless I held it up or pressed it inside the fixture. The fixture came with one page of instructions on how to install the flourescent lamp - but nothing else. Simple on-off switch; no dimming.Most of the fixture was manufactured in Taiwan with the Ott-Lite flourescent lamp itself made in Thailand. The appearance of the fixture is satisfactory, but quality control is obviously a problem. Very flashy box!All in all, a disappointment. Better crane lamps can be had at less than half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The head of lamp sags","review":"I should have read the review first, but as others have mentioned, the head of the lamp sags. This is because the screw is made of plastic and as time pass, the plastic wears out and it no longer do its work as a screw. I tried tightening it several times but even when it is at the tightest, it sags. Now, because I have tightened it several times, the screw head because it is such a poor quality soft plastic, the head is messed up from the screw driver.

The record is more simple than previous Broken Spindles efforts, possibly because Peterson is the only performer involved in this recording.

Even though Emily repeatedly told him no when he made sexual advances he ignored her wishes and forced himself upon her. I agree with a previous reviewer in saying that I can see how appropriate the title really is.Seeing the caliber of writing that Sara Craven produces and Harlequin willing publishes I have no need to read anything else associated with either party.Harlequin should be ashamed for publishing such disgusting and potentially harmful material and passing it off as a \\"love\\" story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Harlequin advocating Rape","review":"This book does not even deserve 1 star.I do like reading hot romance novels, but the novel is only hot if both main characters are sexually excited by one another.The sex scenes (not love scenes) were definitely Rape.

The heroine said No and several occasions to having sex and was still forced. On two occasions, Emily (heroine) consciously resisted and did not willingly participate in having sex with Rafaele (hero). He did not even care if she received satisfaction, but claims he cares for her.

Every song has its own unique feeling, but they are all drawn together through the riffs and vocals. Though a concept album of sorts, the songs contain all themes. The intros by Kurzweil are erily haunting in their truth, and the Molly convo leaves you awed. All in all, an amazing cd, don't pass this one up if you want a great listen all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"I never really liked OLP before I heard this album. Naveed and Clumsy were nothing special to me. Then I heard some songs from Happiness and found them more interesting. That inspired me to go out and buy Spiritual Machines the day it came out. This is an excellent album with great tunes, inspiring lyrics, and an impressive overall feel. I have listened to it over and over and am not tired of it yet. There is not a single song on this album I don't like, and the spoken word tracks by R.K. add an interesting element to the album. My advice, go out and get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have better albums","review":"Great band, but this album is for the diehard fans only. Most reviewers who are OLP fans seem to take jabs/shots at their other albums that had some radio-friendly music like Clumsy, Gravity, and Healthy in Paranoid Times. I disagree. I see those albums as refined- not sell outs, and this album as more raw and unrefined. As an example, while I like all my OLP albums, this one isn't played in general or mixed company unfamiliar with OLP)."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLP's Best?","review":"It is very hard to accept that OLP have made a better cd than Clumsy, however after several listens to Spiritual Machines... I have to. The songs just bring you to a whole new world. Just sitting in the car on a long drive with your headphones on and SM in your cd player can do wonders. The lyrics, though not as top notch as Happiness..., are spectacular. I will never get tired of listening to this cd. There are so many little things in each song that you begin to notice everytime you listen. Best tracks include 'All My Friends' 'In Repair' and 'Everyone's A Junkie'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Unique is about the best description I can do, it is the only word that comes to mind...I was not sure about this CD at first but the more I listened to it the more I loved it. The tracks 'Right Behind You', 'In Repair', 'Life' and 'Made to Heal' are the ones that stick out in my mind as absolutely great but I like the whole thing. It is so different from any CD that is found in popular music section of the music store. Uniquely different, interesting, and I would even go as far to call it an intellectual experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, much more than the single \\"life\\"","review":"Life isn't a bad song, but it is very simple compared to the others here, such as my favorite songs on the album, \\"In Repair\\" and \\"All my Friends\\". The \\"R.K.\\" tracks are interesting and I think are a good transition between songs, especially \\"R.K. on Death\\" is a little freaky. \\"The Wonderful Future\\" is indeed a wonderful ending song to the album (I love the main riff) with a strage but interesting \\"hidden track\\" at the end.However, the instruments on here are mostly unimpressive. If you listen carefully the songs are mostly concentrated on Raine Maida's vocals, usually you won't even notice the guitar riffs, except in \\"All my friends\\" and \\"The wonderful Future \\"which have very catchy riffs. But it still was a good release and I'm looking forward to their next cd \\"Gravity\\" which will be released June 18, 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't take it out of my CD player","review":"Our Lady Peace has put out the most incredible album. Since the first day I bought it, it hasn't left my cd player. With absolutely mind blowing lyrics and riffs the boys have put together a masterpiece. The exerts from the book are a nice change of pace through the album and really make you think. Following up the purchase of this album with seeing OLP in concert really blew my mind, they are awesome in concert and hearing the tracks from the album live was twice as moving. There is no doubt that this album should be in everyone's collection. It rocks from the first track and takes your mind on a journey that leaves you begging for more. WOW!!!! Buy it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away","review":"I am totally amazed at the work of this band. I never thought such songs could exist. Aside from the marvelous tunes each song represents an entire belief, which is why this band is my bible. Personally, my favorite songs on this CD are \\"Are you sad\\" and \\"Middle of yesterday\\". All of the songs are obviously phenomenal, but those just happen to be my favorites. I can't wait for the next one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far!!","review":"Each successive CD just gets better and this is no exception!!!! It's fantastic! It's by far and above their most creative work yet! Some people have said that OLP has ripped off Radiohead and that couldn't be farther from the truth! There are some aspects of the CD that do resemble OK Computer but such examples are few and far in between! This is OLP at their best! If you only buy one of their CD's make it this one! Every song on this CD is just great! When I listen to this CD I don't skip over a single track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS NOT OK COMPUTER 2, but a real masterpeice.","review":"First of all Raine won't act like he is going through a herion withdrawl on Saturday Night Live. Second, Spiritual Machines is not a full concept album like it comes off as. I also don't believe that this album was rushed. Just because it was release barely a year after \\"Happiness\\". Radiohead is going to release Amnesiac only seven months after Kid A and no one will call it a rushed album. A lot of the songs on \\"Happiness\\" were ready to be record seven months before the album was released(see Woodstock 99 setlist). This album starts with \\"Right Behind You(mafia)\\" and never stops kicking *ss until \\"Made to Heal\\". The album after that mellows out but retains it's mark as the best album of 2001 so far. \\"Spiritual Machines\\" is powerhouse in Modern Rock that looks good in anybody's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm a thief, a liar, an angel in the fire...","review":"once again, OLP proves to me that they cannot make a bad, or even mediocre record. spiritual machines is their best to date in writing and musicianship combined. songs that stand out are made to heal, right behind you, life, and are you sad? but all of the songs on the record are nothing short of great. this is an amazing record, the best one i have ever bought. if you like OLP even a little bit, you need to purchase this right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pure magic","review":"I own and love all 3 of Our Lady Peace's previous albums - Naveed, Clumsy, and Happiness... - and I have to say with their newest release, Spiritual Machines, they have really outdone themselves. It's 40+ minutes of pure magic. OLP has been making the most ambitious and compelling music in the industry since they began back in the early 90's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best band out there","review":"I have been a huge Our Lady Peace fan since grade 11, and nothing has changed. I have listened to every song they have released, and some that they haven't. This CD is a great compilation of hits to come.The CD does take a couple of times to listen to, basically because it's not easily written boy band stuff, and takes a little understanding to get into the lyrics.If you have been a fan of their previous hits like One Man Army, Naveed, Starseed, Clumsy, etc. then this CD is the one for you. With future hits like life, big green monkey, and made to heal, you will be up on the hits before they come out, plus the fan club that the CD entitles you to join (you don't need the cd to join but it takes you directly to the site) makes this CD #1 with me.If this wasn't a major seller for you, listen to the demos above and like I said give each song 1 or 2 chances and you'll agree OLP has the stuff to be the best band out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"leaves you less than speechless","review":"This is an amazing cd that really exemplifies what our lady peace is. although definately strange, the humans vs machines aspect makes you think. i like how they take into account how much life can suck, but turn right back around and be so optimistic. life is worth living - through it all. and you're not alone. good cd. and you should check out olp's other cds too."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLP has done it again","review":"OLP has done it again. The cd is amazing. Something I have never heard! The Cd has this weird but cool voice that talks like every 3 or so songs. In the last song called \\"The Wonderful Future\\" the voice talks in between the song.Great CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good","review":"In an age of mindless pop and teeny bubble gum,OLP comes along and proves that music has a heart and a soul.They don't rely on violence and sexiest nonsense like all the other stuff that is on the market.They just craft good music that hits you with emotion and feeling...Remember feeling?... All the songs are awesome,and they are a great live band check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"The latest effort by OLP, \\"Spiritual Machines\\" is the best album yet by this exceptional Canadian band that does not get enough recognition in the US (thus is the fate of many bands not native to this country). It is one of the best albums I have heard, personally. I was taken with it from the first time I listened to it. The first songs to jump out at me was \\"In Repair\\" and \\"Made to Heal\\" (despite the simple, yet somewhat unusual chorus). In true OLP fashion, Raine Maida's lyrics are compelling and thoughtful(as usual) and his unique vocals combined with the forceful but well-balanced music deliver an album that is nothing short of spectacular. And while the narration in it is a little odd, most of it is quite intellectually stimulating (if you don't mind the challenge). In my humble opinion, a must have album for any OLP fan and/or any fan of this music genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the Heap","review":"By far one of the better music releases. Intelligent lyrics, thoughtful melodies, not over-produdced. I love it. Highly recommend tracks \\"Right Behind You', 'Life' and 'In Repair'. The Canadian rock band never ceases to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do I need one?","review":"This is a great record, let me tell you. OLP is a great rock band with positive lyrics, rather then self angst lyrics, that many bands these days abuse (ie Limp Bizkit). My personal favorites are 'Are You Sad' (This song will bring tears to your eyes, trust me), 'Life' (Perfect if your feeling down) and 'Middle of Yesterday' (Reminds me of Smashing Pumpkins in a way), but all the tracks are great and worth listening to. I like the little in between parts, their very insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AMAZING BAND HAS COME OUT WITH AN AMAZING CD!","review":"This CD was great, i loved it, the songs were so exellent, I always try to choose a favorite, but on this Cd you just can't. Some of the songs are so light, like \\"are you sad\\"; while other's are so dinamic like \\"middle of yesterday\\" all of the songs make you think and they always leaving wantig to hear it over and over again because with music like this, you just can't get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Canada!","review":"Un excellent album de la part de cette formation canadienne qui en est déjà à son quatrième. Bien qu'il soit inférieur à Naveed, il en reste que c'est quand mme le deuxième ou troisième meilleur album de cette formation. Il est à discuter à savoir si lui est meilleur que clumsy, mais moi je crois que oui. C'est un album plus mature, plus travailler avec une thématique assez juste et tennu du début à la fin. Raine à travailler sa voix et maintenant il a regler quelque petit problème de non justesse au niveau de sa voix. Cependant, l'album est calme, simple et sans bavure. Le band semblent se diriger vers un style de musique plus différents plus propre à eu et j'aime bien parce qu'il sagit la d'une musique plus abstraite. Encore, le défaut de l'album sera que les tounes sont trop courte, 3, 4 minutes c'est pas assez, monter nous cela a 4 minutes et demi ou 5 sa va etre un pas de plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE","review":"THEY ARE THE BEST BAND OUT RIGHT NOW- THE ONLY BAND WHO COMES CLOSE IN MY OPINION IS THEIR COUNTRYMATES FINGER ELEVEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting a rock album from a rock band","review":"Compared to Clumsy, which is the best album to date, spiritual machines is not a patch of what they are capable of. Their first album Naveed rocked and the follow up Clumsy blew me away. This album is just like the Happiness album, they seem to have lost their way, if your expecting anything like the first two, you will not get it, their music has turned very radio friendly and you will be disapointed. I think they have churned out a rushed, incomplete album which is by far the worst OLP yet. When i was listening to the album, i kept expecting it to kick into a good rock song.....but it didnt. i just hope they will go back to their original style. and thats all ive got to say about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal","review":"I liked this album...four years ago when it was called OK Computer. bad rip-off of Radiohead's concept album about technology. even the video for the single immitates the OK Computer artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"If you liked our lady peaces other albums your going to love this one, and even if you've never heard them before.. GET THE CD... it's worth every penny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"It is amazing to hear a band try something against the expected trend. Solid rock with strong hooks and intelligence that is much to rare in modern music. If you are not a fan, this album will make you want to hear more. If you like OLP, this album will confirm and remind you why. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprising classic ,,,","review":"This is my first and only disc owned by OLP. I discovered it because I'm a fan of Ray Kurzweil and his philosophy regarding technology. So, unlike some reviewers, I found RK's spooky, spoken interludes to enhance the disc. The resulting combination is one of the greatest concept albums of all time (think, Dark Side of the Moon). It's filled with incredibly intelligent lyrics, delivered on the back of wonderfully layered music that never gets in the way of the message. If you're not prepared to be engaged, haunted, and even challenged, ala Paul Bowles or John Coltraine, this album might be too much for you. Since buying the disc, I've played it loud and played it often. Each listen reminds me that should RK's predictions come to fruition that our creations will surpass man intellectually, they never really will achieve the expressiveness, the capriciousness, even the mundane, that makes us human. This is purely beautiful, purely classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really wonderful future..","review":"This is the first OLP CD I've listened to, and I'm surprised they're not more popular and getting more airplay, cos Spiritual Machines is amazing! It's kinda themed, with tha relationships between humans and machines, with interludes by tha author of the book Spiritual Machines. My personal favourite tracks are Made To Heal, Right Behind You, All My Friends, and Life, although its hard to choose cos they're all very good songs. Their sound is well developed, Raine's voice has a pretty versatile range. There are some very nice sections of guitar work, such as tha beginning of Are You Sad. All My Friends is almost chilling, with quietly emotional lyrics. In my opinion, this is an excellent CD from an under-rated band and is definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLP is what other rock bands should be.","review":"Wow this is an amazing peice of work. OLP has done it again with Spirital Machines and in only a short year. Everything they do is great Naveed,Clumsy, and Happieness... Every track excludeing the R.K. tracks are wonderfull in their own way like the current U.S single Life it's a excellently written well performed song. It's catchy and great to listen to. The Canadien single In Repair is one of the best tracks on the c.d. like Life it's great. Raine Maidea is one of the most talented singers out there and brings this c.d. to life making so far the best c.d. of the year. Another great track is Right Behind You(Mafia) which after the 1rst R.K. is the 1rst song and stands out as being different and wonderfull also a excellent tracks Made to Heal, and Standing in the Middle of Yesterday. All the songs including the short R.K.s are neat and deserve their respect. American rock bands take note this is what real rock should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful as Always","review":"Although being a little \\"Radio Ready\\" as people have been criticizing, I still find this album a marvel. Clear voices and great harmonies, Our Lady Peace has continued to mature yet still keep the \\"essence\\" of themselves--NOT borrowing the sounds of any other band. Anyone who mistakes them for another band clearly doesn't listen to ANY music that often. I could never mistake them for anyone but themselves. The tunes are a bit more \\"up beat\\" and hauntingly beautiful--telling a story all it's own that can speak to your very soul. This album is a must have for any OLP fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"true perfection","review":"our lady peace's latest album \\"spiritual machines\\" is truly a piece of art. the guys have done an amazing job. the inspiration for the album is truly evident, as each element of the music is executed in a prestine manner. i would recommend this album to anyone who is ready for more than just a mainstream trip through the usual radio mumbo jumbo. it is truly a work of concept art."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 and One-half Stars.","review":"Well-written. Interesting. One of the better chronicles of the Vietnam Air War. It's a sad book, too.

Two of my favorite actors are included in the set (Fred MacMurray and Rosalind Russell); not even they could save these films. It just seems like the studios dug up some long-forgotten, poorly-made films and threw them into a package to make a little extra cash.

As previously commented, you would understand it more if you have either read User's Manual for the Brain (Bob G. Bodenhamer and L. Michael Hall) or attended an NLP course.There is so much more than you would expect, including information on Meta-Programs, just about every NLP pattern and then some. I use it as a reference and reminder for coaching. And then for self - who can't read about being gloriously fallible or maybe go over the Forgiveness Pattern?On second thoughts, this book would also be useful in business - what a concept!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"If I took the dictionary and put the words in a slightly different order and changed the definitions a little bit (used different words but with synonymous meaning), and then I expected to take credit for my \\"original work,\\" people would think I was both a nut and a sham.I, for one, am tired of the parade of NLP books that simply regurgitate techniques that can be found elsewhere--hopefully in books authored by the creators of said techniques.Do we really need yet another NLP book that teaches, second hand, what the rest of them do? How many authors quoting material from authors quoting material from authors (and hardly ever giving proper credit in the proper place) do we have to endure?I hope everyone involved in creating these techniques are getting royalties from this book. Probably not.My advice, go buy the \\"original\\" books by Bandler, Grindler, Dilts, and the Andreases.

William Broad has truly outdone himself. Performed by just one musician and great vocals by Idol this could be one of the best basement productions you'll ever have.

A perfect stocking stuffer that should be unwrapped early for the recipients enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"The whole album lacks feeling and energy.

He (normally) has such a powerful voice with a nice range, and this CD almost sounded like he was joking around.

My girlfriend is a big Billy Idol fan so I got her this for Christmas. We listened to it on the drive back home and tossed it out of the car on song 5. It's the worst and most cliched christmas music sung by a guy who should stick to sneering and shouting. The best excuse for the existence of this album we could come up with was that he owed a bookie money. The vocals are bad and the music is worse. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's no Bing Crosby, but it's pretty good!","review":"I bought this album as a joke, and out of curiosity. Well, I have to say, I rather like it! It gets off to a rocky start with Frosty the Snowman, which just seems weird. But, then, I think Frosty the Snowman is a pretty lame song to begin with. Then, I think he was a little too hammy on Here Comes Santa Claus. But, the other tunes on the album are quite good. He basically sings them straight, with enthusiasm. He sounds like a guy with a good voice who enjoys singing and wanted to record some Christmas tunes. In other words, there's really nothing to dislike about it, and quite a lot to like. My two-year-old son is very keen on Here Comes Santa Claus, and cries for me to play it again when the song ends.If you like to listen to Christmas music while making cookies or wrapping presents, this will do very nicely. The fact that it's Billy Idol singing it makes it funny, rather than just schmaltzy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be serious Billy, what a joke!","review":"billy idol christmass album... common... what a joke... avoid to hear or buy this... buy the 80s serious albums..."},{"rating":"2","title":"COLD CHISEL AT THE PREMIUM BEST!","review":"BY FAR THE BEST ALBUM BY THE BAND.AFTER THEIR HUGE ALBUM EAST WHICH LAUNCHED THEM INTERNATIONALLY AND PROVED TO THE WORLD HOW GOOD THEY WERE AT PRODUCING PUMPING ROCK AND ROLL.CIRCUS ANIMALS WAS A MORE REFINED ALBUM AND CONTAINED SONGS WHICH WERE NOT ONLY CLOSE TO THE BANDS HEART BUT ALSO SONGS WHICH REMAIN POPULAR ALMOST 20 YEARS AFTER ITS RELEASE.

Put in new battery and film may give you 1-4 shots before it goes into flashing timer mode. The sparse instruction manual tells you to \\"Complete Data Setting Mode\\" but does not tell you how to do this as the only button that works is the ON/OFF. Contacting www.jazzphoto.com is out of service. For $22.50 it can be sent off to NJ address but who knows if they exist either. I can say however that the case is worth about $10 but the camera is 0 cents. Don't buy this faulty unit. Paying $60 for camera to shoot 8 rolls of film and ruin 3 more roll is not worth it.

I was excited to hear what this music \\"should sound like\\" so when it arrived and I played it, I could not have been more shocked. It is the most \\"tinny\\" (high pitched) sounding recording I have ever heard. The quality of this recording is horrible. If you have a good sound system that brings out the essence of the music with presence and warmth you, too, will be disappointed in this CD. (Unless you are one that favor gimmicks, high sounding flavors, and/or cookbook-style sound that strays from the total fidelity of the original source. To you, I say, enjoy.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miklos Rozsa writes heavenly music!","review":"Conducting four of the most beautifully scored films in the history of Hollywood, Rozsa never disappoints in conveying the sounds and spirit of the time periods portrayed in these epic films. From the streets of the Holy Land in the three biblical epics to Spain's ancestral music in El Cid, these scores represent the pinnacle of great music during the Hollywood epic period. Personal favorites include the main themes of Ben Hur and King of Kings as well as the love themes in all four films. These scores could easily have been extended in great modern yet classic scores as Rozsa demonstrates in his Spellbound concerto added as a bonus on this CD. Rozsa, Korngold, Newman and Bernstein were incredibly talented composers/musicians and their music should be treated with the utmost respect in the music world. These are the themes of my life, and I am grateful to have been exposed at a young age to this music, so that I could know what the glory of Heaven will sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRIGHT AND DULL","review":"this may be the only recording that I have not been able to listen to, from beginning to end.

And most authors choose to refer this book, out of all other ones Zig has written for others to read. Instead of focusing on just pure motivation, Zig teaches the art of living a happy, well-balanced life. The books starts off by raising you out of the trench of depression, then by giving you hope, arming you with a positive attitude and then instructing you with the best goal setting program I have ever read. Some parts of the book in opinion were quite dull and could use more follow up information,but just the a good orchestra the final product was beautifully composed. If you're looking for a fun, humorous and simple book, I strongly suggest you take a look at Zig's Success for Dummies first, before buying this one. If you have one you do not need the other. The reason I like SFD better is because it combines his books See you at the Top and this one together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus save me from Zig!","review":"I bought this expecting motivational insights a la Earl Nightingale, but instead I get a sermon I could hear in any fundamentalist church.

'Over the Top' is all about goal setting, performance, and motivation. As with any self-help book, there is plenty of repetition, and a few insightful examples. Personally, it helped me identify several new areas for improvement, as well as, reminded me of several habits which I have forgotten. The only word of warning: there is a heavy dose of messaging on spirituality and religion. If you're new to the self-help section, I would recommend starting with Jack Canfield's 'The Success Principles'."},{"rating":"1","title":"another book review","review":"Cover jacket was scuffed and had a sticky residue that I couldn't get off.

And I'm just obsessive-compulsive enough to have all of their CDs. After listening to \\"New York Town\\", I must say that I've heard it all before. Does Mr. Kirwin EVER change his singing style? I found his voice modulation and practice of forcing way-too-many words into just about every song irritating. Before the first song was over this thought went through my mind: Could I be playing ANY of the other BLACK 47 CDs?I've given considerable thought to this review. I've regarded the progression of other musical artists through their careers and how the evolutionary process either added to or detracted from their quality and attraction. In brief: change is good. BLACK 47 (aka Larry Kirwin) cannot or will not change. Therefore, my collection of BLACK 47 music must now, as of this latest offering, be considered complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke warm at most","review":"This is the first Haunted album that sucks.

This CD is much heavier than their previous 2 efforts although it comes at a cost. The riffs are still great, just harder to hear due to the tone of the guitars and production methods. The vocals have also been adjusted to sound more aggressive. Tracks to check out include Godpuppet, Blootletting and One Kill Wonder. A must for any metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"From the great intro to the very last song, this cd rocks. The Haunted have some very Slayer-esque riffs on this album, in some places, it sounds a lot like seasons of the abyss, but that's NOT a bad thing! This CD is an incredible display of talent and is, well, better than their previous two albums IMO. My favorite songs on this album would be \\"DOA\\" and \\"Sh*thead.\\" This is just a great thrash album, so buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show - but get the newer complete set","review":"Recently, I was clearing my parents house out and found a box of old toys, including a bunch of Fraggle dolls that I had as a kid. When I mentioned this to my sister, she said she heard that Fraggles were making a comeback with a new movie coming out. Sure enough, when I checked Amazon, the complete series was available. It was such a joy to see this again. This is a great show for kids (or nostalgic adults). The puppetry is great. The show is very musical, but the songs (by and large) aren't corny or annoying. Some of them are actually a bit tender. The episodes often deal with themes like prejudice and the environment.That being said, I'd recommend getting the newerFraggle Rock: Complete Series CollectionDVD set. It has the complete series (as opposed to just one season as on this set). For the price, it's a steal.

I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I shipped it back","review":"The music all by itself is all right, but it's ruined by Serrano's lyrics, which are at best, self-absorbed and adolescent, and at worst, just plain sick. Perhaps there are people who don't mind songs about everything from suicide thoughts to pedophilic desires, but as for me, COUNT ME OUT! I removed the CD from the player after the pedophilia song and returned it to Amazon in disgust without even listening to the rest of the CD.

A tour de force in stretching a small amount of aircraft footage into a feature length DVD - don't expect extended sequences of ground or aerial manoeuvres. Frequent interjections by the narrator talking over nothing more that a title page for tens of seconds gives the impression of padding the material out, and I think this would be a correct view since there is precious little information imparted in these padding sequences. The 'which is the best' trump card approach really wouldn't I believe appeal to a true aviation enthusiast - which is the best fighter aircraft for example exercises a rather purile discussion - if you're really into aircraft this DVD set is gloss with no substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"My least Favorite of the 3","review":"Vitalij has to be one of the most technically accomplished pianists of our time. The man can damn shred! i own all 3 of his solo releases and this one, like others have said, is very different than his other ones. This one has much less neoclassical content and a bit more of a progressive feel. Now normally i prefer progressive OVER neoclassical (EG Dream Theater over Yngwie Malmsteen) but the neoclassical work on his two previous albums was just too good! IMHO \\"Exteme Measures\\" and \\"High Definition\\" are the pinnacle of neoclassical shred. I may be alone on this though, i've talked to a lot of people who prefer this one to the others. Oh and one last thing, whoever decided they would post a \\"correction\\" about Vitalij's albums should be sure they actually know what they're talking about before they post so they don't look like a fool. George Bellas DID play on Vitalij's second album, \\"Extreme Measures\\", Greg Howe played on Vitalij's FIRST album, \\"High Definition\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"A compact and cute little book.

I heard other performance of Giulio Cesare to the radio but the countertenors who had the role of Cesare didn't take care to Handel notes. Lynne Dawson (Cleopatra) is the other great protagonist of this cd set: his voice is wonderful and she sings with authentic passion (listen to her in \\"Se pietà di me non senti\\" and in \\"Da tempeste il legno infranto\\"). Guillemette Laurens as Cornelia and Eirian James as Sesto are very suitable (listen to them in the beautiful duet \\"Son nata a lagrimar\\").

By beef is with the fact Cross offers a very limited selection of refill opportunities. If your writing style favors a thick line from your pen, the stock .7 mm black cartridge is perfect for you. If on the other hand, your style favors a neat, precise line for example, recording information in laboratory notebooks, you're out of luck. I purchased this pen because I like its style and wanted something more than the cheapo stick pens the office typically provides. I bought it with full knowledge that it contained the thicker cartridge, but thought it would be an easy matter to find finer lined refills....WRONG. When I started looking for refills, I could not find a single .5 mm rollerball gel ink cartridge. Not one! Even Cross doesn't market such things. What's wrong with this picture?If you need to write fine details, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross Selectip Rolling Ball Pen a Winner","review":"This is a beauty.

It's about on par with the bags that chain music stores have during sales for ten or fifteen bucks.I bought two of these for a couple of classicals I have and they were tight on the upper bout with one guitar and tight on the lower bout with the other. As the zipper on one was already sprung right out of the box, I am hesitant to put much load on it. The zipper pulls are the flimsiest I've seen on anything in a long time. The padding is supposedly 20mm, but it is very low-density and insubstantial.I got these mostly to just insulate the guitars from fluctuations in room temperature and humidity indoors, and I suppose they are adequate for that purpose, but beyond that I have my doubts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than some","review":"this DVD was pretty good, the kids seemed to like it, I would recommend it for any Goosebump lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Biased View of Philosophy","review":"\\"The One Minute Philosopher\\" is marketed as a sort of quick and easy guide to abstract philosophical terms; while this is true, Dr. Brown presents exclusively a Christian view. Large gaps in logic are common in his writing, and he states some ideas as absolute when they are in fact merely speculative. Brown is an obviously partial author, infusing his book with blatantly one-sided judgments. He is not giving the reader in-depth definitions; his rather shallow explanations are overly simplistic. \\"The One Minute Philosopher\\" might be better called \\"One Minute Guide to Catholic Thought\\". In fact, the Sophia Institute Press, which publishes an edition of the book, praised the work's usefulness \\"To get a hearing for Catholic truth and values today\\".

De Botton spins it all with a very light, often comic, touch, and yet manages to raise some fairly deep issues relating to how our perceptions of others are formed and shape our actions. Very good stuff which makes me want to find his other work and read it immediately. Fans of \\"High Fidelity\\" will likely find this a slightly higher-brow, but very enjoyable book.

This big (740 pages) novel tells how one cadre of a U.S. government group plans to eliminate illegal drug addicts and users forever. The fascinating characters and the authentic story line are very unique and creative. The aircraft crash scenario and investigation are enough to make one stay off commercial airlines! Its gory and done through the eyes of crash investigators and leads the reader to a core story line that is one-of-a kind. There is extreme violence (like real life) and much more in this new novel that excites the senses. Moreover, there are far more core-value and American patriotism senses to this novel. It just about covers everything America stands for; both the good and the not-so good. This a teriffic movie in a big book! I most highly recommend this exciting read for non-Sunday School.

In the beginning, I was fascinated. Nasir has some great ideas in regards to science and religion and a very eloquent way of presentation. I really enjoyed how it got me to thinking and the conversations w/ my husband that it inspired. I was sucked in and hooked. Then the last third to half of the book started to lack greatly. I found myself not interested in it at all, but kept plugging away in the hopes Nasir would redeem himself and capture some of the magic from the beginning. I finished this book very disappointed, confused, and angry for wasting my time. To add injury to insult, all of his female characters were very 2 dimensional, weak, and outright cartoonish.

It was locked into the viewfinder mode and would not allow me to see anything through the LCD. Konica Minolta was of no help and simply said I should send it to them for repair - about a four week process for something that I had never used. Intuition told me that there should be some way to reboot the thing - but it was not to be. I bought this despite similar complaints that I had read on the web (one correspondent told of a vacation to Mexico being ruined by the inability to take pictures when this camera locked up). Well, they were right and I was wrong, so I returned it to Amazon.com without any problems and bought a Panasonic LZ2 which seems to be a good compromise between enhanced zoom and size.

Schiff has established a presence in the classical arena in part by playing Bach's keyboard music on the piano. Reaction to his Bach performances ranges from enthusiastic praise to harsh critique. I'm not a specialist in Baroque music, although I do agree with detractors that his more recent CDs on Bach sound mannered. By contrast, this CD, made relatively earlier in Schiff's career (late 70s, I believe) sounds much less idiosyncratic and labored in handling the 3 suites. The music is closely recorded without sounding harsh, resulting in an overal crisp and direct rendition. The program is admirably balanced between the familiar (The Italian Concerto and the 5th French Suite) and the less accessible (The French Overture).

The proper functioning of the quick release mechanism depended on a stamped out piece of thin metal that was clearly not up to the job.

While the scrapbooking theme provides a feasible way to introduce characters and provides insight into this popular craft, the book doled out too much didactic info about Mardi Gras, the different parades, the names and locations of the popular bars and restuarants and the history of the city. If it had been presented in a casual by-the-way style, maybe I could be more tolerant, but 25% of the way through the tour, I began to wonder if the Louisiana Board of Tourism had commissioned the book. There was too much repetition--I remembered the colors of Mardi Gras after the first time I was told. The mystery wasn't engaging and the ending was flat.

The \\"Smart Panel\\" is about as stupid as you can get and crashes frequently in Windows XP, many of the push-button \\"functions\\" just will not work. Even in manual mode the dialogue boxes are difficult to follow and do not function as they should. The software assumes, for instance, that you have an Epson printer and does not provide facilities for any other printer. Quite bizarre.

You can't have it do automatic color corrections with corrected settings.

That problem was resolved when I downloaded a patch from Epson. When scanning paper with white background, setting needs to be \\"text/line drawing,\\" or the background comes out gray. The scan speed is awesome, pictures are nice and clear, and colors remains very close to those in original picture. The negatives are nice and clear when printed out. The only part of this scanner that is not 100% satisfactory for me, is the OCR software. It will do a very nice job on simple text, but if pictures or columns are added, it's disappointing.

The experiments in this book make it really easy to learn how 2000 is organized and apply it to existing programming projects. Learning 2000 from the inside via the debugger is just a great way to do it. No offense to David, but Mark's influence is obvious. If you are a fan of his Internals column, you will like this book even better. The fact that he does it without source code is even more amazing. Wait a minute...why hasn't Microsoft paid these guys whatever they want to build the next version of 2000?If you appreciate a good OS and an even better manual on it...Buy This Book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear and interesting, but some things are left out","review":"This book is interesting for people who want to learn about what goes on under the hood of Windows 2000. The authors' style is clear and easy to understand and there is a good wealth of precious, in depth information.It would have been even better if more details were included: some system mechanisms are mentioned, but the details are left out (particularly on LPCs). Also, the book is not oriented toward experimenting with the system by means of writing kernel mode code: nearly all of the experiments are based on the usage of tools. I think the book could have had room for something more if a number of pages of data structures listing (returned by Kd commands) were left out, particularly since these listings have very few comments and therefore add very little to what everyone can get from the debugger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is filled with more info than I could've hoped for (aside from source code examples). In addition, the correlation between Win32 APIs and OS implementation is quite helpful.Highly recommended for anyone that needs to gain an understanding of how the OS they are using / developing for works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but breaks every 8 months.","review":"I've had these glasses for 1.5 years.Pros:* look great on small faces (like mine)* cover your vision completely (it's basically impossible to look over the top of the glasses when you're biking)* super light-weight (combined with the vision coverage mentioned above), you will not know you're wearing them* hold to the face pretty well, nose bridge is adjustable for a better fitCons:* they have a tendency to fog up if you stop moving after a hard workout* THEY BREAK DOWN THE MIDDLE EVERY 8 MONTHS OR SO... the design is flawed, the screws in the center weaken the structure of the lens, causing it to eventually crack down the middle and split in two. I've had two pairs do this. Rudy Project has been good about replacing the broken glasses under warranty, but it's a pain to have to deal with the issue, and it shouldn't happen.Ultimately, I'd say skip this design until Rudy Project fixes the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skybreaker","review":"SkybreakerI love this book! Sky breaker is the sequel to Airborne. These two books are such an awesome combination between adventure, romance, drama, and Si fi. I loved theses books so much that it was very easy for me to read them twice each. Not only are they a great read for teenagers, but they are also a great read for adults and children because they are interesting and captivating... also they are not too basic or too advanced. All in all I love this book and its prequel, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & energetic","review":"This book had lots of fun thrills, and excitement. It reminds me of 20,000 leagues under the sea.I am looking forward to reading the other books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skybreaker","review":"Matt Cruse, former cabin boy of the airship Aurora, continues his adventures in Skybreaker. Matt and his friend Kate discover the coordinates to a long lost ship, the Hyperion, which may contain gold, inventions, and a taxidermy display among other rumoured riches to be discovered.One of the major obstacles is that the Hyperion is in Skyberia with high altitudes and cold temperatures making the salvage much more difficult. There are also the pirates to deal with...This book was just as entertaining and unputdownable as Airborn. The action was fast and furious with many heartstopping moments. As an adult reader, I enjoyed the relationship between Matt and Kate which was interesting but kept at a level that will not lose younger readers interests. Looking forward to Starclimber!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all ages.","review":"This is one of the most perfectly paced novels I have ever read, and I have read hundreds of books in my life. Like many writers, Oppel can make you care about his characters, but that is just one of the levels on which SKYBREAKER succeeds. His ability to twist a cliche sideways and make it ring true is superb. His tactful descriptions of Matt and Kate's feelings for each other are realistic and enjoyable. The adventure aspects abound, yet never seem rushed or over done. All in all a very entertaining book, and one that I hope is just the second in a long running series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely origonal story.","review":"Skybreaker is probably the most original book I have ever read. From it's flying jelly-fish squids to it's flying spiders. Along with supernatural creatures the book also has some remarkable realism, for example, when the story leads to being 20,000 feet in the air.... the book describes how the air was much thinner then it was at ground level. Matt Cruse, the main character, is around 16 years old and he really enjoys being in the sky on an airship (he was actually born on one). The story is basically about Matt's journey to find another airship, the Hyperion, that mysteriously went missing about 40 years ago. It was said that the Hyperion had treasure on it, but no one new for sure. The author creates very mysterious situations in which I found my self not able to read fast enough to see what would happen next. Overall , if you're looking for a book that will not let you take your eyes away from the page then Skybreaker would be my recommendation to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing Adventure","review":"Having read \\"Skybreaker\\" without having read \\"Airborn\\", I can still enthusiastically recommend this yarn. Too often, sequels depend on the earlier volume and have little integrity as stand-alone titles. And this one stands boldly on its own, head and shoulders above many other YA adventure books. This is a richly detailed alternative-history/light fantasy with interesting characters and intriguing turns of plot, all set in a unique, pseudo-realistic world. Precocious younger readers will enjoy the manageable complexity and scientific elements; older readers will share Matt's desire to assert his independence and prove his worth. Parents and teachers may rest assured that it is uncontroversial, with the possible exception of a scene or social drinking and cigar smooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"This is a really great book for young and old people alike. It's recommended that you read the first book, Airborn, first. Otherwise, you probably wouldn't get many of the different parts. Skybreaker is very well-written, complete with plot twists, cliffhangers, and a very interesting storyline/plot. There's some excellent character plot development, and you actually feel as though you are personally aquainted with Matt Cruse, the main character. This action-packed novel keeps you guessing and wanting to know what's going to happen next: it's nigh impossible to put it down. Supurb for people who like fantasy/action-adventure type books. 4 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!","review":"I researched clock radios for weeks on end and by far, this one is superior!

Wonderful music, great violin playing by Sugar Cane Harris. I have listened to this album since 1970 and have never tired of it. It has been in constant rotation as album, cassette, and now CD. Get it, relax, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Mayall","review":"John Mayall's albums with American musicians are further jewels in an already well encrusted crown and this is one of the best, neck and neck with that other momentous achievement 'Jazz Blues Fusion'. The songs at this time were vehicles for extended musical exploration in the jazz/blues/boogie vein and when you have musicians of the calibre of Harvey Mandel, 'Sugarcane' Harris and Larry Taylor in the band you know those explorations are going to be smoking. Everyone stars here - 'Sugarcane' Harris's violin wraps everything in a blanket of electric funk whilst Harvey Mandel's snaky guitar lays over the top of the fluid bass work of Larry Taylor. This is a timeless and essential old favourite. If you haven't heard it, give it a spin - I'll be surprised if you aren't seduced by its easy charms and find yourself returning again and again to immerse yourself in its unique sound. Brilliant album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fine Performance By Glenn Ford","review":"Glenn Ford was as good as anyone playing an intense psychotic, which he does here in this above-average western.Ford, playing \\"Col.Owen Devereaux,\\" gets elected to the position of \\"judge\\" right after his distinguished career in the Civil War. Unfortunately, he has mental problems and this position carries too much weight for an unstable sort such as him to be carrying. His best buddy, \\"Capt. Del Stewart\\" (William Holden) sees his friend as he is and tries to reason with him and help him out but winds up being alienated, too, by the paranoid judge whose problems escalate as the story goes on.There's not a tremendous amount of action in here, but it still moves pretty fast and looks really nice on DVD. This is one of the few color films of the 1940s.Ellen Drew, Ray Collins and Ed Buchnan provide good supporting help in the story. If you like some of the Anthony Mann-James Stewart westerns of the late '40s/early '50s, you should like this one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I had some free time over the holidays, and picked up \\"Slaver's Challenge\\" for two reasons: I like to relax with sci fi, and it was written by a local author (and therefore available in a local store). It was great entertainment. Intricate and engrossing story with well-drawn characters. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slaver's Challenge","review":"This is an impressive debut from this author. The plotting is intricate and the writing syle engaged me from the very first page. I especially liked the battle scenes. The action is carefully laid out and written so well that I could smell the blood and the sweat. You get a feel for the hero from the very first and he is definitely not a cardboard cut out hero type but more jus a sort of average guy in a series of extaordinarily dangerous situations. There is something in this book for everyone who likes action-adventure type science fiction, even a romance element. The cyber-gaming part if pretty awesome too. A good find if you are looking for something from a yet to be discovered talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like expected.","review":"I've used this pocket reference for a long time now and I love it. It's a great way to refresh your memory when you can't seem to remember a property and/or its value.Although I must say that I refer to it much less now than I did when I first got it. Mostly because I know most of the properties and values by heart at this point and so I can use IDEs \\"IntelliSense\\" features.Consequently, I must add that this is not a teaching aid.

It's not perfect, has some errors, and typos. But the ultimate test for a game is if it's fun, and this game is a blast-it's addicting. Once you start, you can't stop! I play the fantasy draft option, rather than replaying real seasons, as it is a real trip. You enter an alternate universe where some real players never existed, and some fictional ones pop up each season. It takes a while to learn all of the ins and outs of the game, but it is a lot of fun.

I would recommend picking up an old copy of Baseball Mogul 2K if you really wanting to play this game. Or go try OOTP 5 (at www.....com) if you want something more advanced.

I was extremely gentle with it, I was making sure that I wouldn't pull the cord in any way. Still, second set of headphones stopped working exactly like the first one: Apparently the cord was cut again, somewhere in the jack. At that time I was really pissed off, but unfortunately next time I went for a run the only shop around was a Nike, so I ended up with a 3rd set of headphones. Believe it or not, that set broke too, BEFORE the first battery was exhausted. At that time I decided to write this review and make it clear that I'll never buy anything else from Philips (who's responsible for this terrible manufacturing quality)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy cheap, buy twice...","review":"These headphones were great for the first 5 weeks -- lightweight, unobtrusive, and decent sound.

The loop on them is too big and causes the phones to popout of your ears. Even when they don't pop out, they hurt your ears with every slight twist of your head.I ended up taking a sharp utility knife and cutting the loop off, turning them into in the ear buds. Even with this they still fall out because they're just the WRONG shape.Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite portable headphones","review":"These are my new favorite portable headphones. They sound as good as any low-priced micro-sized headphones or earphones I've tried, are very comfortable, and are very unobtrusive. They are also unexpectedly convenient: they are bendy enough to be easy to jam into a jacket pocket or to stick in a crowded computer bag without worry of breakage, and putting them on doesn't involve as much fiddling as the folding types of headphones or individual earphones do. I have two small gripes: first, if you get sweaty then the headband can stick to the back of your neck a little bit and you have to give it a little shake to get it loose. Second, I wish it had one of those micro-sized sliding volume controls like some other small headphones do.

Hell, even if you just walk they slip away. They are NOT a perfect fit (my head is from this earth so they should work on me!). What a waste of money! I had to go back to my regular iPod earphones.

These headphones overcome this problem perfectly with an innovative behind the neck design. The headband has just enough natural flex to keep the earpieces in your ears even if you twist your head a lot, such as you need to when crossing the street while running They are VERY lightweight. As mentioned elsewhere, the cord is not long.. not really long enough to reach into a pants pocket, but perfect length for arm or waistband.If you need lightweight inexpensive headphones for running - these are great.Only real drawback is the audio quality at the bass end of the spectrum - quite lacking, but then thats a consequence of the loose-fitting design and the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Product, Even Worse Customer Support","review":"I agree completely with the other reviewers. They don't fit. But my biggest problem was the urethane earpieces. After 28 days, I found one on the kitchen floor and the other one missing entirely. I tried to put the remaining one back on -- it wouldn't stay. It was as flimsy as a grape peel. (I suspect that, if they even used any, the adhesive behind the earpieces probably failed after a few weeks of heat and sweat.)I was able to return my headphones to the retailer -- on the 30th day of a 30-day return policy. Before that, I called the Philips \\"Consumer Care\\" 800 number. I was told there was NO warranty on the product (unless it was purchased along with an audio product), and they could not supply replacement earpieces. I was given NO options -- and not even an apology.Brilliant people at Philips/Nike, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for athletics","review":"These are advertised as sport headphones, but are a horrible design if you plan to use them for anything athletic (and they're pretty bad even if you don't).The earbuds seem to be of high quality. The problem is that the loop of plastic that connects the two earbuds is way to long for the average user (and I'm a 200 pound guy). Instead of going around the back of the head, the loop hangs halfway down the neck, which means any neck movement you make will cause the ear buds to move inside of your ear canal. First, this makes an annoying, loud, rustling sound with every step you jog. Second, this is going to start iritating your skin at some point. I only got halfway down the block before I gave up and turned around.For those of you already stuck with these pieces of garbage, you might try wearing them upside down (so that they loop over your ears). The ear bud angle isn't quite right, but it sort of works...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"I didn't get a chance to try these out before purchasing - this is a terrible design. Used \\"as directed\\", any head motion shifts the entire device, resulting in noise and loss of connection to the ear.

Also the radio stations fade off the mark and I have to retune. I'm going to try to find someone to fix it down here (they're much better in Mexico at keeping things running than up in the states).

It'll work briefly, but then you'll either have to unplug it (which, doing over and over again gets the stupid tray stuck) or change the stations over and over again, which eventually has no effect.

But the Twain software doesn't do its job properly on scanning diapositives. It cuts borders, decides on its own where to cut a darker zone in a picture (shadows, contrasting colors) with the result that it sometimes splits pictures in half, or cuts away a part of it. Especially pictures taken in the evening or at night are a nightmare to scan.And then, after I reinstalled the software for a third time, it suddenly cancelled the install procedure, and now for some reason it's impossible to install the Twain software again.

Their basic knowledge of the history of Christianity is even flawed as they attribute Acts of the Apostles to St. John the Devine, when Acts is clearly a continuation of the Gospel of Luke.I almost went with one star, but occasionally something they write has the flavor of truth, before they go off on another tangent about the chakras of Mother Earth.There is text of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene in the book, but given what's around it I'm planning on getting another source."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"I was hoping to get some truth out of this book. once again instead of writing the exact litterature found, the author put it in her own words which totally defeats the purpose of trying to figure out what really happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for history, again!!","review":"I have to admit that I have not ever before closed a book before getting to the last page.

Ms. Moran blames all sorts of people for the problems the kids she studies face, but never looks at real accountability. Her suggestion to banish private schools is symptomatic of a larger left-liberal problem: the inability to think about what is real. I'm sure just how stupid this idea is has never occured to her. She probably thinks her book will lead to a law overthrowing a capitalist way of life in America.

I've always wanted to try L'Occitane's products but hesitated because they seem expensive. I was happy to find this mini tin of pure shea butter. I guess I didn't read the size carefully when I ordered as I was surprised at how tiny this tin actually was when it arrived. Still, I know a little shea butter goes a long way so I didn't mind too much. Yet when I opened the tin I was struck by the unpleasant smell. I've used pure, refined shea butter (no scent) and pure, unprocessed shea butter (slightly nutty scent) before, but neither smelled like the L'Occitane mini shea butter tin I received. The shea butter works well but the smell is so unpleasant to me that I'm only using it on my feet when I wear socks and shoes, or at bedtime. It softens my heels well and keeps them looking soft but I will try another brand of pure shea butter next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organic Shea Butter","review":"This stuff is heavenly and I love putting it on my lips, face, sensitive eye area, elbows, feet and any place that needs a little extra TLC.

It's made very similarly to the OEM one, and there were many universal parts that came with it. I used some of the supplied parts, and I used some modified OEM parts from the old antenna. Being a mechanic and very familiar with electrical work, the install was rather easy, but was not by the instructions per se. I gave it four out of five stars due to the universal parts not working for my installation, but it works and looks exactly like the OEM antenna it replaced. The installation may be very difficult to those not experienced with fabrication or electrical work.

The FM reception is fair, the sound is substandard, and the cd mechanism whistles when spinning. The unit is also too light, where pushing firmly against any of the front mounted buttons slides the radio back. The display is way too bright, not adjustable, and hard to read on an angle. I attempted to block some of the brightness with some window tint. It worked well blocking both the shinning light and the ability to see the already dim display.

One of us needs glasses and the display is unreadable without them at more than 6 inches. I myself don't need glasses and can read it ok from a distance. However, I hate the fact that the green background lights up the room enough to see shadows on the walls. Not what I want when going to sleep.

Otherwise it has many features... 30 radio station presets; program the order of songs on cd; choice of radio, cd, or buzzer for both (2) alarms. Most important, the alarm volume comes on low and slowly builds so that you aren't shocked out of bed. Aesthetically, it's very attractive machine. The speakers are substandard... definately not Bose quality, but ok for an alarm.

Don't be fooled by the \\"bright screen\\" product graphic above, though.As a desktop radio/clock/CD player, this unit is a great combination of form and function. I especially like the dynamics that the speakers produce at very low volume - key for not bothering your cube-mate.I take 1 star off for the display not having a two or three mode brightness adjustment, and for the CD player not offering a different array of timers (only shows time elapsed on track).

It connects through a USB 2.0 connector, so you don't need an AC adapter etc, in English, this means no additional guzzling of electricity. The bundled software (ScanGear toolbox) installs easily and you can be scanning in no more than 10 minutes.If you're looking for something equally excellent in quality but with a slightly lower price point, and don't mind somewhat healthier body, try Epson Perfection 1670, but otherwise Canon Lide series is among the best your money can buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this scanner. It's just simple, plain and simple","review":"As noted in one of the reviews. The software is in great, but the fact it is powered by USB is one less chord to worry about. I recommend it to anyone interested in a cheap portable scanner. You'll fall in love with it. Again, don't expect too much and we pleasantly surprised.One thing I love the auto crop feature when I scan a photo it crops it in the final image. Instead of having a big white area where there was no photograph.

I got a LiDE 30 about a year and a half ago, and it has developed a short in the USB port, which causes it to be uncommunicative with the computer unless you hold the cable in the socket JUST right. I am unimpressed with the durability of this scanner. It scans SLOOOOOOOW compared to the SCSI or USB 2 scanners on the market.I would only recommend this for light use home users that do not have any need to move peripherals around, plug and unplug the device, and are amenable to slow scanning speeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Not much to say, just that I love this scanner.

I usually use it for scanning photos, and it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"All around great scanner. It's super thin and small and because it's USB bus powered there's only one cable. Scan quality is quite good, though the scans could be a little faster...speed is only average compared to other scanners I've used in the price range. Drivers work fine with Mac OS X 10.2.The thing I like best, though, is the LED illumination. No bulky flourescent lamp that has to turn on and off and can burn out. Very sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"1. Software installation was easy and straightforward.2. Connecting the scanner to the computer was easy.3. Full color preview took 20 seconds.4. Full color scan took 60 seconds (file size was 18 MB).5. The scanner is extremely light, and thin.I just scanned a color photo I am really impressed with the scan quality. I highly recommend this scanner for any home user or general business user. Since I just hooked it up 15 minutes ago, I gave it 4 stars because I don't know how durable it is. For the [$] I paid I am extremely satisfied with the Canon LiDe 30. My other scanner is a SCSI UMAX 1260, which is a 3 pass color scanner, I bought in 1995 for [$].* I have read reviews from users who said the scanner is extremely slow, and others who said it was fast (as it is on my computer). This difference is caused by the USB version (1.0 or 2.0) that is installed in your motherboard BIOS. To really appreciate this scanner, make sure your computer motherboard BIOS is running USB 2.0!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The LiDE 30 is not a great scanner. I am disappointed with the product. I would return it but Amazon doesn't pay for return shipping costs.The design of the scanner is pretty good. It is slim and does not require a power cord. It has three specific autorun buttons on the scanner. However, it would be better to have only one button that opened the main menu. The scanner can be stood and used on its side. The scanner is slow, but fast enough for occcasional use. Legal size pages do not fit on the scanner. Tech support by phone is very good and accessible. Web based tech support is weak.My main complaint is that the driver for Windows XP is very poor. It is not compatible with the Windows XP built-in scanner wizard. The scanner does not show up as a device in the \\"My Computer\\" menu. The driver does not work well with networked printers. The driver will not accept a networked printer as the default printer.

Anyways, I'm returning this scanner and in the market now for something with more speed and resolution (even if it is a bulkier item)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for Mac OSX","review":"This scanner seems like it would be a good value, but not for Mac OSX users. Mac OSX was an afterthought on this product -- you must download special OSX software from the Canon web site, you must also have Adobe Photoshop 7 and not even the newer version Adobe Photoshop CS, and even then, every time I tried to scan anything Mac classic had to launch. Those are just too many steps and too many restrictions in order to make it a nice experience for Mac OSX users. I recommend avoiding this product if you are a Mac OSX user."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rube Goldberg of driver installations on OS X","review":"This is hands down the worst user experience for software and driver installation under OS X.

Somewhere in the process, one of these installation applications launches Internet Explorer (despite it not being my default browser) and displays a bunch of screenshots on how to complete the install.

Please note same complaint in other reviews.* Any slight bends in the scanned item result in lots of color distortion in this area in the scan. Must be due to use of LED technology.* Once it overdrawn power so Windows had to temporarily shutdown the USB port. It's great it doesn't need the power cord - only if technology was more refined.* Drivers - there are two, one can be used with in-the-box software, and one with Windows scanning software. Here is the kicker - you'll have to choose one of the two, both cannot be installed at the same time.* As many have noted it's slow an anything above standard 150dpi (this is not a USB 2.0 device, the scanner description is a bit deceptive, not everyone knows that USB 2.0 \\"full speed\\" = USB 1.1 speed)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"It's so great.

The handles have changed slightly, and Calphalon has added a polymer to help the exterior resist stains, but this set uses the same materials and finish as the one I had.

I figured if I spent around $500 that this should be a very reliable set. I've had them about three months now and two of the pans have nicks in them already. One has a pretty good sized scratch. Never used metal utensils or heated pans too quickly, so I don't know how this could happen. I suppose when the pans are heated the integrity of the coating suffers. Not good for a $500 set of non-stick. I'm thinking now I should have gone with my original thinking and got stainless steel. Clean up is a bit tougher with stainless but with the right product (Kleen King) you can shine them right back up while washing them. My parents have a set of stainless steel that they've had for 30 years and they still look new.

I always use wooden or plastic cooking utensils and never metal.Do not put these in the dishwasher or your warranty will be void.

These fit the bill.BUT after less than two years now I am shopping for new pots. The ones I use a lot do not lie flat anymore leading to uneven heating, and rattling when cooking and the non stick is scratched in every pan. I dropped my large soup pot on tile floor (empty, no food adding weight) and it warped enopugh I could no longer get lid on. I gave it away.For the price these are not a good deal.

If you have a gas stove the issue of warping is not a big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth half the price!","review":"I bought these pans about a year ago. I was so pleased. I also bought an expensive set of wood utensils and threw my metal ones out. All and all I'd say I spent $700+. At first they were great. Hand washed, wood utensils and never in the oven. My first mistake was trying to cook a pot roast with bone in my Dutch Oven. Big scratch!!! No pan should be so fragile. By the end of the year every pan is scratched and I don't mean one little scratch in the bottom. These pans look worse than my Costco brand after 5 years of wear which they replaced @$150.

His association with Willow Creek Community Church gives him a credible voice.This book has 13 chapters and includes a small group study guide. A companion video series can be purchased, completing the set and thus providing a ready made Sunday School curriculum that is likely to attract a good many people.I personally don't think it is quite as deep as the Renovare books that spawned the craze, but it is a good deal deeper than much of what is purchased over the counter in local Christian bookstores."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of The Life you have always wanted audio","review":"A wonderful book having it available in audio made it very helpful for a mom to actually make it \\"entirely\\" through a book :).

The scanner even scanned to the computer (proving that the communications were working). Not only did the HP not work -- it corrupted the totally unrelated drivers for my NETWORKED Minolta-QMS DeskLaser! I had to reinstall the DeskLaser drivers after I uninstalled the HP drivers & software. HP's support docs had a LONG list of possible problems with Win98SE -- even the USB cable might not work!

And it likes to do self-tests every once in awhile for no apparent reason - that is, if you place it in your bedroom like I did it WILL wake you up at 1:30 in the morning to do its little 30-second cartridge exercises. Very annoying.The included software is amazingly hardware-intensive. It slowed down my 2.4Ghz Dell like you wouldn't believe. And you can't just install the driver - to use the printer you have to install everything from the included ads to the ocr software no one uses.The scanning is really bad quality in Windows XP - I don't know if my scanner was messed up or something, but the scans were really light and grainy, and the software didn't help in my trying to fix them (and I'm good with computers).I recommend going with a Canon or one of those new Epson multifunctions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streaks on inside of glass a big problem","review":"I've had the printer for a year now and the scanning function no longer is useful due to severe streaks and a milky film on the underside of the scanner glass.

I have to get up about an hour early to fight my printer, which is about four months old. First, the cartridge gets stuck and I have to clear it. Usually, if I can get it to print at all, each page causes a jam and I have to remove the paper manually and hit \\"enter.\\" After it prints a page or two, it completely loses power and I have to remove the power cord and push it back in and start the whole process over again.

Could not rely on the printer to work when most needed like printing confirmation notices for bills paid, etc. Print jobs get \\"lost in the ethers\\" and never print. Constantly had to reboot system and plug/unplug the printer to get it to print.

HP claims that software that can handle 48-bit color is too expensive to include with the scanner. If you do have Photoshop, and you turn on 48-bit color processing, you'd better be prepared to wait. It made the image preview time go from a few seconds to a minute or two. And that's just the preview - not even the final scan! If you scan in regular color depth (24-bit), the scans are pretty low quality, with a jpeg-esque fuzziness at all the color edges - and that's scanning as a TIFF. The OCR is useless - I could type it faster than it would take to fix all the problems!Software is really, really bloated. I downloaded the update from the HP website- it was 164MB!

However, I find myself struggling to finish each page. The writing is so juvenile, and Alexandra is possibly the most annoying heroine ever. All she does is complain, and speak \\"coldly\\" to people. What I loved about Joan Wolf's previous novels was her ability to develop relationships between both characters. This novel is not original. I find it hard to belive that Joan Wolf wrote this. The storyline and encounters between Niall and Alexndra are boring. I don't feel the sparks between them. I feel like yawning. For all of you who loved The Gamble, Pretenders etc, do not buy this one.

I agree ... that the character development of the hero and heroine is shallow. The development of their relationship was even worse. It was hard for me to care about either one of them, or to believe that they cared about each other.I'm not sure why she abandoned the first person narrative convention that she used in the other books in this series, but it did not help the character or plot development at all.Also, what does this title have to do with the story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I choose books to read based on two factors: either I like the author and enjoyed his/her previous books, or the storyline looks promising. I've never read a Joan Wolf novel, and I don't think I will after this. I expect a romance to carry me away to another world - a world full of passion, seduction, maybe even a little intrigue. This book fails on all accounts. The passion is promising in the beginning, but completely fades out about half way through the book. There was absolutely no seductive scenes, I could not even tell if they had done anything intimate. And finally the villians were so weak that they weren't even an impact in the storyline. I rarely put a book away without finishing it - but I was sorely tempted to do so with this book. I was deeply disappointed and recommend that you look elsewhere if you want a truly romantic escape. -TEP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as usual but...","review":"I loved this book, I only wish there had been more development of the hero and a little more danger.

And I really don't care about the \\"prestige\\" factor, something in which this author takes an inordinate amount of interest. However, if you want some nice pictures of lawnmowers, go ahead and buy this book.A pet peeve on mine is when illustrations do not match text - as happens a great deal in this book. And speaking of illustrations, you would think there are only three companies that make lawnmowers (sorry, \\"lawn tractors\\") - John Deere, New Holland and Kubota, and only one skidder worth mentioning - Bobcat.

It comes with a stand that holds the scanner upright on its side, if one chooses to use it. Photo scans are vivid and accurate in color. It does not have a transparency adapter or a feeder. I installed the software in Windows XP and the USB scanner in a matter of minutes. It doesn't require an AC power cord. It is powered by the USB port on the computer. The software package includes OCR, and it does pretty well on both photos and documents. I have read other reviews stating that the scanner is noisey and slow but I have not had either of those problems. If your scanning needs are simple, this scanner is the best value on the market.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LIKE SIMPLE TO USE AND INEXPENSIVE GET THIS!","review":"This was my first scanner. It was a snap to set up. The manual is simple to follow. I really like the simplicity of the operation and I especially like the ability to turn scans into a PDF file with the touch of a button. The scans are excellent for my purposes. Whether the dcoument is a photo, newspaper or color magazine article, this does it all. The three buttons in the front work very well too. In a day when when most products are hyped and you are later dissappointed, this is a grand product that anyone can afford! If you were thinking about getting a scanner, think no more.

I loved it, and here's why:1. It is very affordable.2. It doesn't have an AC line, and less wire under the desk is a good thing.3. It scans good pictures. 48bit color, and can go up to 1200dpi. Although for everyday use I find 300 to be plenty.4. Reasonable speed. Since I scan mostly at 300dpi, each scan of a 4x6 photo is no more than 20 seconds. The trick is to preview only once to get the scan area, then just scan away the rest without preview. 9 rolls of film (7x36, 2x24) took us two nights.5. software is easy to use. I mostly use the TWAIN with photoshop.6. light and compact.

It's significantly higher in resolution and faster than our old UMAX Astra 610S at a fraction of the price, is far smaller and thinner, and requires no separate power brick - I love that it's USB-powered and only needs a single connection to the computer. (It's great with a laptop!)The only problem I've had with it is in its software - sometimes its built-in \\"Multi-Crop\\" function doesn't work very well, producing partial or corrupted scans. We rarely do any scanning that would require that, so it's not really a problem.It's not a professional-level scanner by any means, but who would expect one at this price?

Feature set and construction is quite good, but actual operation is unreliable. Caller ID function is sporadic-- most times I have to check my $35 corded phone to see CallerID information since the ATT LCD is blank. Although range is good (I've got a decent signal 10 floors down outside with little obstruction), it now cuts-out quite often, leaving you scrambling for another phone in the middle of a call. No problems with the answering machine. Overall, my suggestion is look elsewhere for a phone.

The phone has been a mixed blessing. While I noticed immediately additional range compared to 900Mhz phones, I was disappointed with the quality and design of several features. First, while Caller ID remembers many numbers, there's no convenient way to erase all the numbers- so your phone will always say ~24 Calls. This may bother you and may not. Also, the microphone built into the answering machine is really horrible. As you record your outgoing message, no one will really be able to tell it's you. For some, this may not be a big deal-- for us, having a garbled outgoing message is truly annoying. Finally, the extra units you may eventually look for as you expand are far too expensive compared to others. Consider Siemens or GE's new models instead if you're looking to watch your wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiss?

The reception inexplicably cuts out, callers occasionally sound far away and the phone emits a loud hissing sound every 25 calls or so that's readily fixed by smacking it with your hand.

I should have been cautious. There must be a catch somewhere. Well, exactly on the last day of third month, the caller ID stopped working. The store won't take it back because they had 40 day return policy. The only hope of repair now is to spend money in sending the unit back to manufacturer. They do not have stores where I can give it for repair. If they decide to replace it, the replacement will be a refurbished phone. How would you like to get a refurbished phone in exchange for a brand new one ? Take my sincere advise, do not buy this phone. I have wasted money and learnt my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying sound quality","review":"I have also noticed the presence of background hiss or static while talking on the handsets -- even when standing next to the base unit.

The one thing better about Mikaila is she's not trying to impress us with her voice, she's just singing and that's what makes this album wonderful. It's like Britney Spears songs with a Christina voice. Filled with uptempo pop jams like So In Love With Two, Playground, and Emotional to lovely ballads like It's All Up to You. Unfortunaletly it's hard to pick Mikaila out of all the other teens but she's still young and very talented. Everyone should check her out.

Somehow, her writing style confuses me easily. This book is no exception, as the stories seem to leap back and forth in time. I'm a casual reader of FR, and certainly did not want to pay too much attention to the chronological order of the stories. This gripe aside, this book is the best work by Elaine. The stories are gripping, and gives alot of information about elven lore in Evermeet. It is one of the best FR books I've read.

Unlike others, I have no issue with removing the finished cubes.The hard part is that initial filling and placing. Each 'pocket' has walls that go the full height of the tray, meaning that water cannot flow between each cube to fill them evenly without also running over the sides and out of the tray. Once it is filled, the flexibility of the tray makes it hard to manipulate onto the shelf of the freezer without flexing the tray and causing water to spill out.I've found the best method is to place the tray on some kind of rigid surface (I use a small cutting board) and then filling each cell individually from a liquid measuring cup that has a spout. I aim for getting them filled to about 1/8\\" below the top of the tray, and then I place the whole assembly--cutting board and all--on the freezer shelf until they've set.A lot of work just to get well-proportioned ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cubes","review":"These trays make wonderful ice cubes.

I've had plastic cube trays shatter in my hand when trying to eject cubes. Used to end up shooting cubes onto the floor, when \\"aiming\\" for a freezer container.NOW - Each tray makes just the right amount/size/shape food (or ice) cubes to fit in my storage containers bought at Ikea (found here http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80098583). These babies are durable as heck, and space-saving for a small kitchen like mine. Getting cubes out one at a time is actually a blessing, as I have more control over where my cubes go (floor vs. container).Plus, the hubby loves the look of these cubes in his glass of rum & coke.I found something similar (i.e. silicon trays) at BBB for $12 per set of 2.

Recently I heated up some cubes by themselves and noticed a funny smell. I tasted the broth and there was a definite chemical flavor.I repeated this twice with a new tray, using plain reverse osmosis water, and still got the funny chemical taste.

I was happy with the product at first, but the trays began to develop a distinctive chemical odor. I tried cleaning the trays in several different ways (dish soap, vinegar, and ultimately bleach), but nothing was able to eliminate the smell, which was very unfortunate because the ice cubes picked up the smell and flavor of the silicone.

These trays are not perfect, but they do work. The square (yes, square) ice cubes come out perfect everytime; so far. They also seem denser, if thats possible. The square shape makes the cube last longer in you beverage. Mostlikely because they melt more evenly than normal cubes. The slight drawback are you have to push out each cube. There is no \\"twist and empty\\" action. But the only real drawback is their soft and flimzy. You need two hands to FILL & TRANSPORT them to a flat surface in your freezer.

Works great, but hard to fill up, hard to take the ice out","review":"Length:: 2:58 MinsAfter using the silicone tray for a while,it started to give a VERY bad smell/taste to the ice. The tray itself smells like chemicals/rubber very bad. I put it through the dishwasher many times, it's not that.

The silicone tray is harder to empty.Next, I'm refilling the trays with water, and conclude that the silicone tray is more trouble to fill up.Conclusion: Although silicone poses no health risks associated with freezing plastics, this tray is a pain to empty and refill.

However, when water freezes, it expands, which tightens the ice against the flexible sides of the tray. It is very difficult to remove the cubes.

Why do I need perfectly cubed ice? Isn't regular ice good enough? Well I must say, these are awesome.

You can push out the exact number you want for each drink with no problem. The cube shape is MUCH better than the typical crescent shape from an icemaker. If you understand what silicone is, and especially that it's flexible, you can decide for yourself whether this item is for you.

I don't know if they stick to the trays or if suction is causing the problem, but you'll need a lot of hand strength to wrestle them out. For me it takes three steps: (1) Twist the trays to break some of the seal, (2) Push the back of each cube section with my thumb to get the cubes part of the way out, (3) Use my fingers and pull the cubes the rest of the way out.After going through all that my finger tips are frozen and I've touched each cube. I suppose I could use gloves or soak the tray in hot water to try to loosen up the cubes, but who wants to go through all that.Each time I use them I'm quickly reminded what an awful pain they are, literally.

Thought it might be my new fridge but then I tested ice cubes made with these trays against the plastic tray that came with the fridge and lo, when the ice had melted, only the silicone cube water tasted AND smelled like a rubber hose.

They work great for my household of four 20-somethings. I love how easy it is to remove just one or two cubes at a time (perfect for when we just want enough ice for one drink), and that I no longer have to deal with an entire tray full of ice splattering all over the place.The trays seem well-made. They're still in perfect condition after several months of constant and somewhat aggressive use, I think they'll last a long time.My only concern with the product is the lack of rigidity when filling up the entire tray. It can be difficult to put in the freezer. But even this isn't much of a problem, because we generally only use 3-4 cubes at a time. One of us just refills the tray when it gets to be about 3/4 empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silicone Ice Trays","review":"I really like the size of these trays (they are smaller than regular trays), and I love the shape of the ice.

You will need to push the cubes out from the bottom instead of just twisting the tray to release, no big deal there. I haven't tasted \\"rubber\\" or anything else since I started using them, maybe those people didn't wash them first? Yes, it is more difficult to move to the freezer without spilling water. But, I found if you refill it while the tray is still cold, the water will form a very small layer of ice on the top, which helps to prevent the water in the tray from sloshing around when you move it. Another easy way to avoid spilling water is to simply not fill it up the entire way, remember that water expands when it freezes, so you will still get square ice cubes after the water freezes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome ice cube tray","review":"This ice cube tray is great!

These came in some sort of creepy anti-mold powder. Not super thick, but after many, many washes it's still there. Product looks clean, but the powder gets into the ice cubes and into drinks.

I like how the cubes can be removed and stored neatly in baggies or other containers. However, it takes FOREVER to get the ice out, and usually I give up because my hands get too cold. Also, they are really wobbley, so you need to take extra care when putting them into your freezer. A rectangular sushi plate works well for that. If you have serious limited freezer space, this might make sense, but for making ice for every day use, stick with the plastic ones that you can just twist to release the ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each Color is a different size","review":"Read the descriptions carefully.

Much better than those plastic ice-cube trays that leave half the ice in the tray... bought 2 sets of 2. perfect..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silicone Ice Cube Tray","review":"This is definitely green! The color on the page is pretty close to what you get. And you get true cubes with this tray, rather than rectangles. I'm not sure why that matters, but I like that ice cubes are actually cubic. I was a bit apprehensive about having a \\"floppy\\" tray full of water, but the sides are actually pretty strong. As long as you don't overfill the tray itself, you are about as likely to spill with this tray as with a plastic tray.The only problem, and the reason for four rather than five stars, is that there are no channels built at the top where excess water can flow from one cube spot to the next. Hence, you have to fill every cube individually, rather than tilt the tray down to let it fill quickly from the faucet. Though this is a bit annoying, we don't often totally empty an ice cube tray and so are usually only filling a few cubes at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good ice trays","review":"I got these ice trays to use when the ice maker went out of my refriderater.

The taste was very powerful, to the extent of making taste of, say, Coca Cola completely unrecognizable.

These, combined with a dedicated freezer, make for amazing ice cubes. They last forever without melting. I went to sleep with a glass full of them and woke up 8 hours later with the cubes still identifiable. I washed my trays in the dishwasher as soon as they were unwrapped and, after using them repeatedly, can say that I did not have the white film problem that a few reviewers have mentioned.

We like to pop a whole tray of cubes out into an ice bin that we keep in the freezer, because we use a lot of ice.

You need to plan on allowing at least a half an hour to get the cubes out. They are far more trouble than they are worth.

It's as if the ice is stuck to the tray with super-glue. No matter how much you may twist and push and pull, the trays will NOT let go of the ice. After only one attempted use of them, I've had it. These ice trays will never again be used in my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky cube maker","review":"My biggest objection is that our less than two year old trays smell terrible.

The ice cubes have no discernible taste yet, but yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for baby food, broth, ice, etc.","review":"I have owned these for 3 years. My husband originally purchased these to store homemade baby food so that we could freeze them into individual sizes. I would make a good amount of baby food, freeze them in here then transfer it to food saver bags or ziplock. Then when feeding time came, I would pull a fruit cube, veggie cube, and meat cube. This allowed for a great variety in their diet. When my children outgrew baby food, we used these for not only ice, but freezing pesto cubes and broth to add to soups or pasta sauces. The ice cubes are great for parties too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor ice cube trays","review":"There was a STRONG flavor in the ice cubes, To me it tasted of rubber.

You have to push and pull strenuously just to release one cube. Want more than one? Get ready for PAIN as your hands begin to frost over. In our house this is often followed by swearing on my part and a refusal to ever use these stupid trays again. Not even slamming them on the counter can speed up the process (oh, how I tried).To summarize, only get these if they won't be your primary source of ice cubes, or you like your vodka tonics with a twist of needless frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone built a better mousetrap, I mean ice cube tray","review":"Ever since I was a child and was tormented by those old aluminum ice cube trays with the lever running down the middle, I have had a deep-seated hatred of ice cube trays. Even some of the more modern versions were disappointing because their longevity was so short. These trays are both versatile and easy to use. Versatile because my wife has found that she can freeze anything in these trays and there is no possibility of sticking (she freezes various stocks, coconut milk, etc, that she uses in small portions). Easy to use because you can remove one cube without disturbing the rest of the tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Could Return...","review":"These trays were okay at first. Then, after a few months the ice cubes began to taste weird and a strange film started appearing in our drinks. The trays smelled so badly of plastic/rubber we had to take them out of the house completely. I thought I could use them for sorting trays at school, but now that same film is started to seep out of the plastic. I feel like they are very hazardous and Amazon should consider banning them from their site. My brother bought the same brand, but a larger cube and his is doing the same thing.DO NOT BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical odor","review":"The trays were fine for a few weeks or so.

No matter what means I have tried, i.e., dishwasher cleaning, vinegar, baking soda, vodka -- nothing works. A powdery white film develops as the cube melts in the glass as well as a disgusting bad taste -- sort of rubbery.I bought 7 of these and they are a disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a hassle","review":"I bought these because I like the shape of cube they make and they are cool looking. Unfortunately, they are not worth the trouble. Getting a cube out is a total pain in the neck. You can't stack them until they are frozen or the cubes freeze funny and they are even MORE difficult to get out. Also, when wrestling with the thing to get cubes out the silicone between the cubes has pulled apart. So now I can't fill up the outside cubes on two of my trays. I guess the only pro with these are the cube it makes. I like the old style, perfect cube that they make but they are a total headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would rather switch","review":"I bought 4 sets of these trays. I have since given up traditional ice trays. I love these and I do not have any problem filling them on the counter and transporting them to the fridge. I usually run some water on the back of the tray before trying to remove the ice but they slip right out. They are really kewl! What seemed like a draw back at first is now working out just fine, I thought they were unusally small when I first got them, that is why I bought four sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non functional","review":"It is next to impossible to remove the ice from these trays. They do make an attractive ice cube, but it is not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"poisonous smell and taste","review":"After a few months these trays smelled so bad I had to throw them away. The smell actually irritated my lungs it was so bad. These trays should be tested for whatever is producing this horrid smell and taste to see whether or not we have been irreversibly poisoned by this product. Do not buy this under any circumstances. Amazon should stop selling this for consumer safety reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much time do you have to get cubes out of a tray?","review":"Crap. Too difficult to get the ice cubes out of the tray. Perfect cubes though. If you are the type to re-arrange your wallet daily and don't mind spending 10 minutes to get perfect little ice cubes out of a soft silicone ice cube tray one perfect cube at a time then these babies are for you. I will go back to imperfect cubes that fall out of a plastic tray in one twist. Or I will invest in an ice machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silicone Ice tray","review":"I thought these would be real easy to use but I was very wrong. OK, they're ice trays. But the simple fact is they are difficult to fill and trying to get the ice out is ridiculous. You have to remove each cube one at a time and they stick to the tray. They do make nice perfect cubes (which is why I gave them 2 stars) but they are more trouble then they are worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it's toxic","review":"I thought the 'food safe' definition would mean it's an alternative to freezing water in plastic trays, which we know can result in the leaching of plasticizers into the frozen water. I boiled these silicone trays to clean them thoroughly and it has resulted in a toxic smell and film on the trays that won't come off. I will not trust that the ice cubes will not pick up these chemicals. Sure, silicone is glass and should be safe, but what kind of chemicals went into this to make it so pliable? I had read on-line baby safe reviews of silicone products.

Not a problem unless you need a ton of cubes for a big party; in that case I've hung onto my old plastic trays. The big downside for me is that the trays spill very easily when maneuvering into a full freezer. I wish the makers had included a firm base for the trays since the silicone is quite flexible and wobbly. Still, if you only go through a few cubes a day at most like I do it is not such a huge problem to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"This is a great product, but it does have one major flaw, in my opinion. It's great because it makes perfectly-shaped ice cubes. Further, they are easy to remove. On the downside, you can't fill the pockets and place the trays in the freezer without spilling water. Impossible. It would be better if the trays were in some sort of rigid structure/frame.I've only used a few ice cubes and I haven't noticed any strange taste, as others have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Cubes can be a bit difficult to pop out, but otherwise this is a great product. Makes perfect cubes of ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Break -- but Hard to get Ice out","review":"We got these ice trays because the plastic ones kept breaking on us. The silicone is certainly break resistant -- you can twist it like crazy and not worry about it tearing/ripping/breaking/etc.However, silicone also holds on to the ice very well -- ice doesn't easily slide out like it does in the plastic ones. So you have to twist/pull back on the tray until the ice cube pokes out a little and then pull the cube out. So you end up basically pulling out the cubes one at a time.All that being said, we still really like these trays and use them exclusively. The \\"perfect cube\\" shape is really fun and we'd rather fight with the cubes a little than keep on buying plastic ones that will break."},{"rating":"1","title":"It make the ice taste like plastic","review":"The ice trays worked well for the first few uses but then started to make the ice taste like plastic.

The trays are now simply unusable. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"silicone, you let me down!","review":"These trays look pretty cool, and silicone is a pretty neat material for kitchen products that were typically made of metal or hard plastic, but in this case they just don't work. A pair of ice cube trays should be able to be emptied in about 20 seconds, I figure. I struggled with these for 8 minutes. Good old plastic would RELEASE the cubes when twisted. With these trays, each square gives birth to a cube after much pushing and prodding. Too much hassle!I'm going back to the old uncool trays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept. Weird film.","review":"I loved the square shape of the ice. I liked that the plastic won't break when I try to get the ice out. My complaint is that they left a film on the ice that ended up in my drink. I've washed the ice trays multiple times and still get that film in my drink. Decided it probably isn't good for me. They make a great organizer for hair clips etc. for my daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"In my impossible search for a tray that makes large, square ice cubes for using in liquor drinks (not as much dilution), I tried this tray.

Every time I have to get ice cubes out of them I think again about how much I hate them. The cubes, while perfect, will NOT COME OUT without a fight. And they take forever to freeze.

However, after a couple of months, the cubes started tasting funny. I blamed the water, I blamed my freezer, but after reading these reviews I've come to the same conclusion as many others: sadly, the ice cube trays are the cause of the bad taste. I've run them through the dishwasher many times and that doesn't fix the problem.I've tried looking on the Tovolo website for care instructions, but to no avail. I think I will need to just toss these like everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"I purchased these trays to replace the Rubbermaid plastic trays that had given me 10 years of satisfaction. While the color and pliability of these trays are a plus, the ice cubes are very difficult to remove. The cubes are perfect squares, and very attractive in a cocktail or glass of iced tea, but I have to push each cube out of its compartment with my fingers, from the bottom of the tray. I expected that a couple of twists would loosen the cubes sufficiently to dump them into my bucket, but instead, I have to pry, push and coax each cube free. It's a pain, and I'm going back to Rubbermaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange film.","review":"When I use the ice cubes from this tray, there always seems to be a strange film in my water. It's like a film came off the ice cuber holder and went into the cubes, becuase it's like flakes in the water.

I love the tray save for this weird flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited about an ice tray?","review":"I see a lot of people complaining about the ice being hard to remove. This completely baffles me. These are the easiest cube trays I've ever used. Never had a problem getting a cube out, spilling or anything. They take up less space and when you only need a few cubes they are so easy to just flip upside down and pop out what you need without the whole tray of ice spilling out. I bought one set to try them out and loved them. I threw out my old rubbermaid trays and bought a couple more. Also how cool is it to make a cocktail with ice cubes that area actually cube shaped?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Tovolo Perfect Cube Ice Tray, Set of 2, Dark BlueI bought these trays because I was sick of the ones that came with my refrigerator breaking up all the ice cubes into pieces when you tried to take them out.I wish I would have read some of these comments.I agree....they are....1. too hard to get out...they come out in nice squares but your fingers are numb from trying to pop them out.2. no matter how many times you use them, or wash them...I seem to keep getting powdery white stuff on them where they come in contact with the plastic.3.

I started making prune puree for my daughter and I bought both silicone trays and standard \\"twist and pop\\" trays to try out. I simply could NOT get the prunes out of the plastic tray, no matter how much I twisted, turned, grunted, and grumbled, but all I had to do with these was bend the tray and poke the back with one finger and out popped the cube. Like most ice cube trays, each opening is 1 oz exactly (I checked with a measuring cup and water), so you can portion the food precisely.I don't know about making ice in these, as I haven't tried it. You WILL need to have a flat surface in your freezer that can accommodate the tray, and you will want to cover with plastic wrap before you stack to avoid freezing one tray to the other, but those are simple requirements to meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Form over function","review":"These things look really slick and create very nice looking ice cubes. But as far as practicality goes - they're a total strikeout.- As the other poster said, there's no easy way to remove the ice cubes. As these trays are soft rubber, a flexible seal is created around each cube and flexing the tray doesn't eject them. You pretty much have to push each cube out through the back.- The top of the tray and cube walls are all the same height, this means filling all the pockets and loading the trays into the fridge without spilling is a challenge.- The trays are a non-slip surface, which means sliding them into the fridge also is annoying.Yes, these are all nit-picky points, but when it comes to something as simple and utilitarian as an ice cube tray, when someone gets it wrong, it's that much more noticeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes nice, square cubes; easy to remove; no odors","review":"I've been using these ice cube trays for several months now and love them. Contrary to some other reviewers' perspectives, I find that removing the ice cubes is simple if you simply push up on the underside of the ice cube tray and then grab that cube with your other hand once it's raised above the surface of the tray. (In other words, it's easy to remove individual cubes by pressing on them one at a time; I haven't tried simply turning the tray over and trying to remove all of the cubes at one time, so I don't know how well that works.) As to odors from either the trays or other items in the freezer, I haven't noticed a problem with this and I have a sensitive sense of smell.All in all, these are a great product. I also really like the way these cubes look in the glass -- square, clear cubes of ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross smell of trays","review":"I agree with the reviews about the trays giving off a bad odor and taste to the ice cubes.

Two printers in 18 months, now they have discontinued, so I can either purchase a refurbished model at a discount, or buy a brand new \\"something\\" I stuck with HP since my first printer which is 10 years old still works. This printer is amazing WHEN it works, but unreliable at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of Junk and bad support","review":"I have had this printer 14 months when it just stopped working. When I turn the machine on, all it does is blink lights. When I called HP support they said it would cost $55 to talk to a technician. They would do nothing at all to help unless I paid more money because the warranty was up (12 months). They did not tell me if the machine was fixable or not. I already paid $300 and do not want to pay any more for this hunk of junk. I will never buy another HP product.

I called hp and they told me to get it fixed, but when I called to get it fixed I was told that it was considered disposable and it would cost more to fix it than it was worth. I called hp 5 more times just to be told that there was nothing they would do to help me since my warranty was up, even though it was only up by two months.

It was the right size, had the right features and the right price. However, after setting it up, I found that it would not scan when attached to my new Dell Dimension 4550 running XP. My first call to HP resulted in this advice: Dell has problems with their USB ports, and, get a powered USB hub. Dell denied a problem. My second call resulted in more honesty. The rep admitted that the printer has problems and that corporate has not addressed them because of their preoccupation with the Compaq merger. Only lately have they taken notice of the complaints. I asked the rep which Officejet he recommended, and he replied unequivocally, the D135. So I returned the 2210 and bought a D135. It cost more, but it has more versatility, is less costly on consumables, and it does scan!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scanner ribbon streaks glass over time, ruining the scanner","review":"In case anyone is considering buying this printer used and finds this review this while doing research, I would like to point out some major flaws: (1) Over time the white ribbon cable for the scanning element under the glass rubs against the glass, creating a series of streaks that will ruin all scans wider than a few inches. The ribbon is offset to the side, so you are left with a few inches of usable space on the flatbed that isn't streaked, except for the second complaint: (2) In addition to the giant streaks in the glass caused by the ribbon cable, this unit also seems to be poorly sealed. There is a great deal of dust and dirt on the back side that can not be cleaned without trying to take the scanner apart (which I have not yet tried to attempt).If you are looking at buying this used, I would look for those problems before making a purchase.-Lewis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to scan a single photo!","review":"With the latest firmware and the latest Hewlett Packard software, all what I get while trying to scan a photo is: \\"the scanner could not be initialized\\".

Not to mention I did not have to use my camera's USB cable and suck all the juice from the camera to conduct a transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good printer, but does not last long","review":"I purchased this printer almost a year to the day that it broke down. It did everything that I needed it to do, however, it jammed and no longer will initialize. Because of the cost of repairing out of warranty, I will probably purchase a different product rather than repair this one. I spent a week trying on my own to repair it,and then discovered my warranty had run out. Hewlett Packard has online help, which was not able to fix my problem either. My last printer was Hewlett Packard and I never had a problem with it. Because they are building everything with cheap plastic now, I am disappointed in my 2210xi printer.

What has struck me is how high a percentage of reviewers have given the 2210 one star out of five - and that seems grudging for many of them!Reliability is the most important consideration for me, and, in my experience, the 2210 is simply not reliable. Given the low expectations we have gotten used to for consumer electronics, that in itself is not shocking. What DOES disturb me is the \\"We've got your money, so we're happy even if you're not\\" attitude that seems to go all the way to the top of the HP customer service organization.

For every 10 page document I print, I have to get at least 3 of them out of a jam, and then go back and reprint those pages. Also, it's the slowest printer on earth! Even when I switch it to black ink only, low ink drying time, etc., it still is like molasses. I have had unbelievably bad luck with HP, so maybe it's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this printer","review":"I'm embarrassed to say how many ink-jet printers I have been through over the years. I even bought a Tektronics (Xerox) Phaser laser color printer since I was so disappointed with my purchases.Browsing through printer depts., I happened to hit the demo button on the PCS 2110 and was very impressed by what I saw. I then placed a glossy brochure on the scan bed of a series of printers and the 2210 was by far the most realistic in reproduction. Then I looked at the price and dropped my jaw.A truly great and inexpensive printer. Glossy photos look like they came from a photo lab. Even small envelops feed without trouble. Insert a memory card and print a proof sheet and you can check what you want printed and the printer reads your choices back in through the scan bed.

It has already saved me in several situations when I needed to send a fax, make a few quick copies, etc. Nevertheless, the damn thing has a problem with its paper feeder. More often than not, it picks up too many sheets of paper, has a paper jam, or spits out slightly to extremely crumpled pieces of paper.

It was a replacement for a 8-year-old MFD, and it has fulfilled all of my goals. No, it's not a top-of-the line printer/copier/scanner/fax, but frankly I didn't need one. I do just 5-10 copies a week and a scan or fax here and there. Every once and awhile, I use it as a backup for my laser printer. For my needs, it's great.

After devouring Dance Upon Air, I could hardly wait for the second book. I expected more of the elements that made the first book so great: good plot, likable characters, a bit of mystery and a lot of romance.Although the plot is fine, the novel fell short of my high expectations. The main character, Ripley Todd, is too obnoxious and difficult for the reader to become attached to (you wonder how a man as wonderful as Dr. Booke can fall for her), and the build-up to the end is a bit confusing.Make sure you read Dance Upon Air before picking up this book, otherwise there will be some loose ends regarding the paranormal story line and secondary characters Nell and Zack Todd.The book is readable and entertaining, but not Nora Roberts at her best. However, I will eagerly await the final installment and hope for more of the magic she spun in the first book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac Booke???","review":"I am a die hard Nora Roberts fan and she is an automatic buy for me, but I was not impressed with this trilogy, least of all the second installment: Heaven and Earth.

As to Heaven and Earth ... how could Nora not have noticed she named her romantic lead after a computer - Mac Booke????

Roberts couldn't seem to make up her mind. Was it the crazy x-husband? Looked like it until you realize he was possessed by something. Was it the fame hungry reporter?

I justcould not get to the point that I liked Ripley, and couldn't understand why anyone else would either, least of all Mac. She came off like a cartoon charactor that just was annoying. I think Nora could have found a better way to portray a main character without making her look like a clown.

Plus, knowing that the sisters have to ultimately succeed in overcoming their hurtles, it left little to the imagination. You know that basically what the challenge they have to overcome is.

Ms.Roberts manages to bring the characters alive with such clarity that one might wonder if there isn't a little magic in us all. She has mastered the art of relating reader to character and exemplified her ability to do so in this novel!This book's release was timed perfectly; it is made for a cold snowy night spent inside curled up in a comfy chair with a hot drink and a softly glowing fire!

Good non-traditional approach managed by a great non-traditional director, Jack Shoulder (The Hidden).And for a film that did not go to theatres, this one has a strong cast: Powers Booth teams with Rebecca DeMornay to fly the nuclear bomber.

Granted the movie (and subject matter) are dated but I found the acting to be only average, at times almost mechanical - not very realistic. Not very good chemistry between De Mornay & Boothe. The special effects could have been done better. This movie probably had a low budget.Sadly, I bought the movie based on the reviews posted here. Do yourself a favor and rent it (if you can find it). Had I rented it first I would have saved a few bucks.Don't get me wrong, the movie will keep your attention but I found it to be fairly predictable.

This deserved the Emmies they won, it's a bad script and dumb story, but EXCEPTIONAL visual effects. And I'd love to have Ms. De Mornay in my right-seat ANY DAY!

This scenario if not resolved would result in a global nuclear war. The movie is well-done; it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It makes you think about the stress that current-day bomber and strategic missile commanders, both land and sea, go through all the time they are on alert duty. James Earl Jones also starred in another Fail Safe scenario movie in the early 1960's, Doctor Strangelove.

Nicely done personal angles between De Mornay and Boothe.As a government employee with some knowledge of how things work in these doomsday scenarios, I suspect the movie is not even dated as regards what technology and \\"what ifs\\" matter as the plot moves along.

As the world cowered in the threat of a Y2K crisis with fears of lights going off and subsequent anarchy, I was looking out the window and noticing that lights were still shining everywhere. Lee's book is just like that in this great intellectual debate about Jesus Christ. Yes, it is a faith statement, but it's all based on evidence. This book is a truthful demonstration that even when the world is dark, God sent Jesus Christ, the Light of the World, to give it light and life and salvation.

Praise God.Edit 1/18/11: My boyfriend and I got married in 2009. To be perfectly honest, my husband and I were able to personally accept Jesus as our savior BECAUSE of Case for Christ. Lee Strobel's intellectual, scientific and psychological approach to the gospel story opened our eyes to the miraculous and merciful love of God. Without Case for Christ, my husband would not have accepted Jesus into his heart; and would not have encouraged and prodded me to have a personal relationship with our Savior in return. Case for Christ is the \\"friend\\" that introduced us to each others' souls. Thank you, God, for using Lee Strobel's writings to change our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but not thought provoking","review":"As many posts have pointed out, this book was very biased and used weak arguments to support its positions. Remember guys, Lee Stobel is an evangelical Christian now and when he wrote the book. Whether he was as strong of a skeptic at one time is hard to imagine, as he does not ask tough questions. Many of my friends liked the book, because it affirmed their faith. I didn't find the book very convincing at all. I kept saying to myself, \\"but what about...?\\" I wanted him to dig deeper. My friends and family are Christians...and at one time I was one too. I had invested interest in finally finding a book that will reconnect me to my prior faith. It would be great to believe and feel a part of it. However, my brain tells me otherwise. This book, like many others on the subject, disappointed me.I gave it two stars because it is one of the better books of Christian apologetics out there. That tells you how low I rate other books of Christian apologetics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every \\"seeker\\"","review":"THE best father's day present I've ever received. Wonderfully done. Lee Strobel asks the hard questions of world class experts and delivers a compelling case for my God and Savior, Jesus Christ.I loved McDowell's \\"Evidence that Demands a Verdict\\", but this is so much more readable. His mix of present day law cases to introduce and illustrate each segment drew me in and his personal interviews with the people who know the real facts about Jesus and the New Testament was entertaining as well as informative. It was like being in on the best conversations about Jesus you could hear.I'm grateful for this author and this faith strengthening book. Christians: Buy it, read it and give it to others.Non-Christians: This is a wonderful close-up of the facts about the life of Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does God need a \\"case\\"?","review":"I read this book out of mere curiosity. It was given to me by a friend. My first of many complaints for this book is in the title itself. It should be titled, \\"The Case for Jesus as the Christ.\\" The name \\"Christ\\" is merely a title representing the person it is bestowed upon. After that, the book just gets worse. This is hardly the work of exhaustive journalism, a handful of biased and shallow interviews. However, the most annoying aspect of this book, and others like it -- even M. Martin's counterpart --- is Strobels sense that this \\"case\\" is needed, or essential to the promulgation of his new found faith. Since when did Jesus, the Christ, God incarnate, need our evidence to prove or justify him anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulation for the Gullible","review":"Here is the quick review you need to read: This book is like hearing only one side of a debate without the benefit of hearing the counterpoints. Strobel has manipulated the reader into believing he is objective and fair-minded. Yet he never interviews any experts who promote a viewpoint which contradict the gospels! He has a wolf's agenda masquerading in sheep's clothing. Beware! His search for truth takes him only to the experts who \\"believe\\", and ignores any experts who may suggest to the reader a different point of view. Very dangerous in the lap of the unwary."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Case For Christ","review":"The book was a diasppointment. The use of modern day case historys at the beginning of each chapter is irrelevant and boring. Mr Strobel uses apparent fulfillment of Old Testament prophesys as proof of the New Testament Christ, when the Hebrew Canon itself is suspect. I'm afraid those looking for an historical Christ will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"First, let me state that I'm not a skeptic, so my rating of this book has nothing to do with my personal view of Christ.I really was genuinely interest when I read the introduction, but a short while after, I had to force myself to read the next five chapters before I completely gave up. Maybe it's only a matter of taste, but the style of this book is too painful to read. The historical facts and other evidence are interesting enough, but they are lost between irrelevant thoughts and actions (\\"He uncrossed his leg.\\" \\"He sat up.\\" \\"Blah blah blah.\\") Oh, those are all very fascinating details and deeply affect my view on Christ.I'll admit I know nothing about journalism, but I think it would be better if Stroble would just eliminate the anecdotes and say what he'd learned straight to the point instead of beating around the bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where in the World is my Book?","review":"Ordered two of the same books to be delivered to two different addresses.

I share it with those in doubt or those that want more about Christ. Combined with a thorough discussion, Lee makes a great case for belief in Christ. This book mayl not convince the hard hearted but will encourage those that have a seed already planted by the Holy Spirit. I read it again whenever I give one away and always find it rewarding. It will always be a part of my small library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Lacking in Persuasion-- Only for The Uncritical","review":"Strobel sets up a number of straw men in this book, and then knocks them down: \\"Critics say that Jesus was such and such-- but Expert X says diferent!!!\\" This is his method, and it gets tiresome quickly, for many reasons. First, he does little to lay out reputable criticisms, picking and choosing those arguments he wishes to refute. Then he goes to his experts, all of whom are (surprise!) Christian professors who destroy the straw argument, leaving us little choice but to agree that, indeed, Christ actually did this or that miracle. As an example of rational argumentation, the book gets zero stars, though it's at times entertaining. There's an excellent book waiting to be written on this topic. This ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible 'objective' research","review":"He only interviews believers, he barely puts up fights against outrageous claims, and accepts historical examples as reason to believe in the Christian doctrine.The book even says religion can't be accepted from facts, only from faith (aka blind acceptance) of a holy book. So why did he spend a whole book trying to prove it when he says himself that it can't be proven? Because this book is made for people on the fence of faith to push them over to the Christian side, it's not written to inform a reader about historical events during the first century. It's an absolutely horrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"books","review":"Great read, delivered before Christmas (great) and my son is really enjoying the way the story is told. I recommend this for anyone who is interested in different points of view about Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating reading","review":"Books by apologists frustrate me because as I read, counter-arguments enter my head and the authors just ignore them! I could barely get through Lee Strobel's \\"The Case for Christ\\" because of his infuriating tendency to pretend he was getting at all the facts. He claimed he was being impartial but he never challenged the \\"experts\\" he questioned; he just accepted all they had to say. Is this the new journalism?Anyone honestly interested in the truth won't read apologists' books without also searching for skeptical rebuttal. Lucky for us, Earl Doherty's \\"Challenging the Verdict\\" is a comprehensive response to Strobel's book highlighting all the arguments Strobel conveniently left out or glossed over.Don't read one without reading the other!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"The Case For Christ\\"","review":"I had already read the book and wanted to buy several more to give away to friends. \\"The Case For Christ\\" is a wonderful, thought-provoking, intelligently written book by Lee Strobel, who is an investigative reporter, and decided to build a case for becoming a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. It's very readable and well researched from many different angles. I would recommend it for anyone who is seeking the answers to life's important questions about Jesus, The Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reasoning","review":"\\"The Case for Christianity\\" is a terrible book, and the only way the conclusions could be reached would be if Lee Strobel WASN'T an atheist, but already a Christian. The reasoning was awful - 'I can't explain this, it must be God. And if it's God, it can't be a general God, it MUST be Christ!' Or... \\"This New Testament researcher who's a Christian SEEMS to be using flawed and biased knowledge, therefore he MUST be correct! There's surely no need to talk to someone less biased who would know about the New Testament.\\"I read this book AS a Christian, and I recognized it for what it truly is: tripe for fundies that are so convinced already, that this sort of reasoning is allowed to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic, dishonest, and very disappointing","review":"In a time when \\"source criticism\\" has provided new insights into the period, and equally well-intentioned people are reaching sometimes provocative conclusions about the reality and the identity of Jesus, this book is profoundly disappointing. I would adopt the description of an earlier reviewer, that Mr. Strobel is \\"preaching to the choir\\". The questions posed to advocates ( a better description than 'scholars' ), are softballs that make a Larry King interview look incisive. The failure to acknowledge the possible illegitimacy of helpful passages in ancient writings is dishonest and unforgiveable. I will blame myself for not investigating the author before purchasing the book. I regret supporting this work, and strongly advise the inquisitive, open-minded reader to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"All in the family.","review":"The evidence for Mr. Strobels arguments are based on his interviews with like minded, conservative, funde oriented believers.Coming to the truth on ANY subject matter following that method of investigation would be like interviewing Rush Limbagh, Michael Medved, and Lou Dobbs on the subject of Liberal politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for anyone with questions","review":"This book answered the questions I had in the back of my head, and the author (Strobel) takes his Q&A sessions with experts to the next level to help the read really trust the answers they are getting. If you have any questions or doubt, this book is surely a great read for you. Also a great book for Christians who need help defending their faith to non-believers. This book is ammo-packed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with my purchase","review":"The book arrived within the promised time frame and was in excellent condition. I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD and Study Guide","review":"Lee Stroble does a great job making his case for Christ. We are currently doing this study in our Sunday School and it has been very well received. It leads to great discussions and makes great points based on extrabiblical evidence. Very useful for seekers and Christians who want to know how to better share their faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Case for Truth","review":"Lee Strobel presents this book as a scholarly investigation into the evidence for Christ as he is depicted in the Gospels. Strobel sets himself up as the skeptic as he interviews a number of scholars and experts, asking them hard questions and putting their evidence to the test. Yet, in each case the experts are able to rebut Strobel's skepticism with strong evidence for Christ as the Son of God.The truth is that most of the experts Strobel interviews have more merits in Christian Evangelism than in Academia. Additionally in his pursuit to \\"chase down the facts\\", Strobel somehow neglects to interview one skeptic throughout the course of the book.Strobel's pursuit for evidence is an exercise in rhetoric, telling one side of the story in an attempt to persuade non-believers. The result is not a scholarly investigation into the facts, but a piece of well constructed [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Popular Introduction to Apologetics","review":"Despite some of the criticisms of Strobel's book, this is a very good popular introduction to apologetics, written by a man who was at one time a non-Christian, but being persuaded by the overwhelming weight of evidence, became an Evangelical Christian.Strobel is one-sided in his choice of interviews, in that he does not interview any serious opponents to the Christian position. But that does not mean the scholarship is one-sided. The Jesus Seminar is representative of New Testament scholarship in the same way that The National Enquirer is representative of professional journalism! Strobel knows this and did not bother. I, for one, do not blame him.For people interested in an even more detailed (though less popularly written) presentation of the objective evidence for Christianity, see Josh McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This is a book that all Christians should read. It will give you the answers to many of those tough questions that non-believers ask (as well as some you may have had yourself). It really helped a friend of mine come to truly believe. The best book of its type. Fast paced, easy to read and engaging. Not just a bunch of boring Theology, but an exciting look at one man's quest for the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarassment to Christians. There are better pro-theist books.","review":"I read this book twice. The first time I was a Christian seeking reinforcement for my faith, and I found it in this book. The second time was a few years later after I had left Christianity and began considering myself an atheist. I hoped to be convinced again of the truth of Christianity, but this book sorely disappointed me. The point is that certain mainstream apologists like Lee Strobel and Josh McDowell don't know what they are talking about and are only convincing to people who are already convinced. If you want a book that presents evidence for God's existence, C.S. Lewis and J.P. Moreland do a better job but are still severlely lacking. The most convincing pro-God books I have read areThe Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheismby Edward Feser andThe Case for Godby Karen Armstrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for All","review":"For the seeker, this book provides evidence as to how the Bible can be determined as historically true. The description of the crucifixion was a clincher for me. For anyone who wonders why this is important, there are plenty of opposing views in this book. The author started out an atheist wanting to prove his view was correct, not a Christian out to prove a point. Mr. Strobel also recommends that those who still have questions to research and find your own answers. I recommend this not only to seekers, but also to those already mature in the faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalism? Has anyone seen the journalism?","review":"This book reads like a Bush Town hall meeting; you only get in if you agree.I am so disappointed in this book. Not one dissenter in the group. Not one! How on earth do you build a case like this without doing comparative research? Even Penn and Teller do that!Also he intentionally misleads the audience by insinuating that the scientific community believes in the historicity and Godhood of this particular Christ, named Jesus. That is FALSE!!!! The overwhelming majority of the scientific community is made up of atheists, agnostics and skeptics. If Strobel were honest he would have picked the ten top anthropologists in the country and queried them on the historicity of Jesus.Two stars because he has a nice writing style. His investigative Journalism leaves a lot to be desired however....Honestly, what will his new book be about? Querying members of the Heritage foundation about whether or not conservatism is important for America?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing book from a man who was hard to convince!","review":"The Case for Christ is an interesting account of a man who didn't know Christ, and because of his wife's conversion and this own curiosity decided to take his newspaper reporter nose and check out all the claims to Christ. You can see in each chapter how Mr. Strobel is piecing information together. A facinating account of someone who didn't believe and who came out believing. Christians should read this book because it will revitalize your life in Christ, and others should read it and let his words point the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Biased","review":"Although well written, this book is completely biased. The author portends to launch an open-minded, unbiased, and investigative look at the issue. However, \\"The Case\\" has been resolved in this author's mind, and he clearly presents his biased view throughout the book. A true journalist comes into an investigation with a totally open-mind, and gathers and presents evidence for the reader, who then forms their own conclusion. His conclusion is woven so completely through the contents that I consider it to be useless as part of a true \\"investigation\\" into the issues. I am not anti-Christ - I am not anti-religion, I am just against the concept of offering an unbiased opinion with forgone conclusions,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Case for what?","review":"History and science never provided proof that Christ even existed and I see people arguing here whether he resurrected!?I do not think Jesus existed to begin with, we have lot's of proves of Pharaohs, Persians, many Mediterranean civilizations, Hindu kingdoms all of them thousands of years before Christ and still, absolutely no evidence of Christ's existence.Please, just do not tell me Bible proves something, it's just a funny religious book as any other.That being said, I am not some aggressive atheist, I just love the truth more than brainwashing & dogma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Apologetics at its finest!","review":"I have never come across a more lucid, gripping and convincing book on Christian apologetics in my entire life. A must read for believer, searcher and skeptic alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely One-Sided","review":"Yes, he asks some really great questions. But if he's such a great investigative journalist, why didn't he investigate the other side of the argument. And how can all these \\"experts\\" testify on behalf of someone they never actually met? A psychologist in the book offers evidence that Jesus was not actually insane based on nothing more than stories written about him. That's not evidence!I seriously doubt Lee Strobel was an atheist before he wrote this because he believed these other people so easily. One theologist claims that there is absolutely no dis-agreement on who wrote the Bible, and Strobel just believes him!!!I think people like him, all these other born-again christians, decided to say they used to be an atheist to sell more books.If you can read this book, do yourself a favor and keep asking questions, ask the questions Lee apparently couldn't ask or didn't want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses its audience","review":"Read these reviews, folks. The arguments in this book only seem to make sense to \\"believers\\". The cases made in this book are actually highly illogical--even to me, a Christian. A few reviewers wrote off the people who gave this book one star as \\"atheists\\". But these so-called atheists wouldn't waste their time reading a book like this if they weren't interested in who Christ is. (Would a believer read a book on atheism just for fun?) These so-called atheists are supposedly the audience this book is directed to....and it seems to fail miserably with them. What a missed opportunity!If these are the best arguments Christianity has to offer, we're in trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel misled...","review":"I don't know if it was the cover of the book or what the person giving it to me said about the book, but I was led to believe this was supposed to be an objective account of one person's search for the truth and investigating the evidence supporting Christ.What I got was a series of interviews by a guy who'd been a pastor for 10+ years. And the interviews were strictly of individuals with deep convictions themselves.It is ironic that he keeps referring back to court cases in each chapter, because in court cases, there's both a prosecution and a defense. No such balance exists within the pages of this book.All in all, some of the information provided was interesting, but providing only the barest of commentary from the opposing viewpoint left me wondering what Strobel was trying to hide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah... worth the read...","review":"Strobel does a great job bringing his journalistic background to the table and interviewing various scholars in their respective areas of expertise to nail down the Truth of the Cross of Christ. This book was refreshing in that it takes you a bit deeper than many popular apologetic books, yet, at the same time gives you personal insight into the character of the scholars and Strobel himself. Very personal style of writing...It's odd in that it reads much like a story... a story of exploration (an introspective Lewis and Clark tale, perhaps). At the same time, though, it will take some time to wade through the arguments and presentations (which are helped along by the fact that you do feel like you're reading a conversation rather than a dissertation)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I love this book. It is one of my favorites. I have even recommended it to my non-believing friend who is very much into science. This breaks everything down from an investigative journalist perspective. Lee Strobel is phenomenal. He touches upon all of the questions a non-believer and believer have or will ask. Everything is handled like a court case, where all of the evidence is presented. He gives the readers the options on looking at the evidence presented to decide their own conclusion. This book can help a believer have more confidence in sharing their faith and in understanding their faith. At the same time, this book could help someone who is seeking to grasp some truth about Jesus. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I've been recommending it to people who are seeking and have so many questions. It certainly helps. One person is starting to have a change of heart after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirrored my own journey","review":"Like a lot of young Americans I grew up with only a superficial knowledge of Christianity.

I only give it two stars as it is fiction pretending to be fact.Now to be fair, I'm sure the author believes what he has written to be true and certainly Mr. Strobel felt his questions and the answers provided by those he interviewed were meant to discover the facts in an investigation for evidence of Jesus. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he let his current personal bias belief in the correctness of Christianity to color his words and limit the depth of the investigation as presented. Mr. Strobel too readily accepts answers of the self-proclaimed experts on the New Testament and therefore forfeits the claim of unbiased investigative reporting.Still all-in-all it is a good read, worth a look for those who understand it as the work of a Christian preacher spreading his own particular view of religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely lacking in crediblity","review":"The best the author can do in this book is to tell us \\"It's true because the bible says it's true.\\" All of his sources are Christians.

I read the first part, on the accuracy of the gospels, then skimmed the rest to see if it got any better. It did not.I was hoping this would be an objective look at the claims of Christianity. It was not. Strobel interviewed no one on the opposite side of the Christian viewpoint, and his own questions I found rather lacking. While reading the section on the accuracy of the gospels, I was thinking up in my head dozens of questions I wanted to ask and challenge on. But Strobel asked few tough questions, and when he did he let the interviewees off very easily.If you are not already a Christian who agrees with Strobel's point of view that Christianity is true, then I do not recommend this book for you. If you are a Christian who wants an apology for Christianity which affirms what you already believe, then you might like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrement","review":"This book was given to me by a friend and it's a great example of Christian \\"junk truth\\".

There are many books like this, where the \\"researcher\\" gathers only those facts which support his predetermined conclusion, carefully filters the data, and asks leading questions of his hand-picked experts, not like a scientist searching for the truth, but like an attorney trying to win a case. UFO enthusiasts, conspiracy theorists, creationists, and other crackpots try to hijack science to bolster the case for their various obsessions.

To dissect it as though it is subject to the material claims of everyday reality reduces the divine to the commonplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavily biased.","review":"I found this book to be heavily biased toward the orthodox or fundamentalist point of view. He only interviews conservative scholars. He doesn't speak to or interview scholars who offer an opposing point of view.

I was presented with this book by a family member, and was told that it was the story of a sceptical investigative reporter who set out to research Jesus, and ended up a believer himself. This is also the claim that Strobel seems to be making, but which his book does correlate.Throughout the book, Stobel merely presents the most eloquent and well-reasoned arguments for Jesus; he neglects to give ANY arguments against Christianity. This eliminates the pretence of impartiality, and shows the book to be what it is, Christian propaganda, meant to reinforce believers' faith, not convert anyone to Christianity.I gave it 2 stars because Bible study groups will likely enjoy discussing this book, since they will (wrongly) interpret it as proof for their religion.For us sceptics, it's a highly annoying and unpersuasive waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's all the evidence?","review":"This book is portrayed as asking all the hard questions an atheist would bring to Christian scholars. But Lee Strobel's heavy bias in this book makes me doubt his proficiency as a skeptic. He admits to being a committed Christian for years when he wrote this book and therefore fails to bring any objectivity to his subject. I also think a simple presentation of his evidence would have been more readable than the rather elaborate investigative journey plot.Although portrayed as a persuasive argument for unbelievers, I felt this book was written for:Christians; to help bolster any wavering faith in this age of apostasy.Fence sitters; because \\"your future and eternity hinge on how you respond to Christ.\\" p.271I felt Strobel failed in his attempt to provide reasonable evidence for Christ.

Any arguments against the \\"case\\" are facile and designed to fold under the slightest criticism. There is no real scholarship that proves his \\"case\\" because all of the \\"experts\\" are believers who do not subject their predetermined views to any real scrutiny.Strobel's \\"case\\" can be analogized to a trial of Hitler with Josef Goebbels as the presiding judge, i.e., no real evidence against him will be admitted for consideration.

He was an atheist, but after his wife became a Christian he decided to review the evidence for and against Jesus Christ being the Son of God and for the resurrection of Christ.

Suitable for both Christian and non-Christian readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeniable","review":"As one who long ago set out to disprove the story of Christ's resurrection, like the author, I was ultimately convinced, by sheer reason, that the story of Jesus' bodily resurrection is fact and not simply wishful thinking or delusion.To those who insist that faith and reason are incompatible, this book should quickly dispel that notion. Strobel is a premier Christian apologist. This book makes the case to any open mind that Jesus Christ did indeed die on the Cross and was resurrected bodily, conspiracy theories notwithstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"The case is not made, the logic is circular.","review":"Though well written. Mr Strobel's 'Case for Christ' cannot be logically concluded since all of his sources come either from the Bible itself, which indirectly Strobel is also making a case for, and people who are unabashedly Christian. It is like attempting to prove the existence of god by saying that the bible says he exists. Then when questioned on the validity of the bible we say it is valid because it is the word of god. Strobel tries to make a case by stating biblical sources when in essence that is the very thing he is trying to make a case for. Including other secular non-christian sources that provided validity for his claims would have helped his case tremendously. As it was it didn't prove anything to me other than Mr. Strobel is a believer. Good for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not objective, and evidence is too selective","review":"Strobel is hardly objective, having only interviewed those who already agree with him. He criticizes the Jesus Seminar, and Michael Martin, and yet he neglected to interview Martin or anyone from the Seminar. The choice of \\"evidences\\" is quite selective in this book. The more obvious and damaging contradictions in the New Testament are not even mentioned (such as how Judas died). I gave the book two stars simply because it is an easy read and because it provided the ideas and opinions (regardless of how ridiculous) of many of the \\"top\\" conservative New Testament scholars of today.

Its pathetically weak arguments almost shamed me out of believing that Jesus was the son of God, or that the God of the Bible even exists.If you want your religious belief reinforced, do NOT read this book.

It is obvious that the author's training is in journalism because the book is written using a conversational style that is appropriate for those with a six grade education. Anyone who made it to seventh grade and learned critical thinking will see through the weak aguments the book presents.I have never seen a \\"case\\" with so many holes. The author claims at the outset to present a fair impartial case in this book; however, he only uses witnesses (interviewees) that make positive claims that support his case.

The inescapable conclusion is that Lee Strobel is falsely portraying himself as a skeptic in order to push his personal agenda. Most of his \\"scientists\\" are actually theologians or philosophers, and it seems that literally all of them are advocates of the \\"Intelligent Design\\" version of creationism.

Strobel ably applies the strategies of a gifted defense attorney to show that Jesus is indeed portrayed accurately in the Bible, and that Jesus is in fact the Son of God, just as Scripture and Christian tradition has always claimed. Strobel writes in a way that is both engaging and informational.

And that formula doesn't work in book form. Do I care what the experts' offices and clothes look like? Do I care about his every thought as the interviews progressed. This timeline approach to his research was clunky and boring.Beyond the inappropriate yet easily skippable writing style, he does pose some good questions and covered some interesting topics. The debate is engaging, but this book is one sided and despite the title, this is NOT written by an idependent thinker on the topic. The book leaves all counter arguments to Strobel who simply isn't up to the task of debating the heavy theologic thinkers.Instead of \\"Judge\\" Stroble falls into a bit of the bumbling prosecuter on his thesis that the New Testament is factually accurate beyond a reasonable doubt. Unfortunately this case comes without a proper defense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for those looking to get into Christian Apologetics.","review":"I realize that all Christians aren't into apologetics. But, I'd recommend that ALL Christians read this book. I think it's necessary that Christians become educated.This book is a very easy read. It's readable by the layman, and that's what's go great about Lee Strobel. I'm a slow reader, but I couldn't get away from this book. Lee Strobel really keeps your eyes on the pages.It's a good presentation of the evidence for the Jesus of the Gospels. I'd recommend this to be a great entry level book into studies on Jesus Christ.

It is very genial and reassuring to the person of faith, serving to highlight the basic theology of traditional christianity.I believe it is a good complement to any work of C.S.

His findings are very logical and convincing. This is a really good book to read if you are as confused and skeptical as I have recently become. The methodical way that Strobel presents the evidence in this book argues very very strongly for the truth of the Bible. The only shortcoming as far as I'm concerned is his neglecting to really give the full arguments for the liberals and atheists (or if he did, they sure don't have very solid cases).

And the book is doubtless a \\"must have\\" for all Christian apologists. Still it causes me concern as a fledgling follower of Christ. It alludes to the fact that the authors search for the truth led him to his current belief in Christ. Though it is possible, I find it difficult to believe that a skeptic and self proclaimed atheist would depend solely on thirteen \\"Christian scholars\\" to base his supposed skeptical investigation on. To represent the truth of Christ to a doubting world it would behoove \\"Christian\\" authors to stay clear of such obvious gray areas.Still, I found the book fascinating and would recommend it without hesitation.

As a reporter it should be obligation to seek the strongest of both sides and give a fair debate...anything less is just stacking the deck in your favor.If you are Christian you will probably like this and think it is remarkable. That is how it was marketed to me. I found the material amateurish at best. No real meat to the debate. If you are seeking answers I doubt this will give them to you. The comments here are more relevant than the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, yet comprehensive and solid","review":"This book contains a concise yet comprehensive report, full of solid arguments against some, if not most objections to the New Testament and Jesus Christ; his life, death and resurrection . There are indeed compelling reasons why the New Testament is trustworthy and Jesus Christ is God. I particularly enjoy Strobel's interviews with Profs. Blomberg, Habermas, Collins, and Craig, as well as with Dr. Metherel. This is what fat brains are for, to love God with all our mind. These scholars, coming from a garden variety of disciplines; Blomberg, Craig and Habermas in New Testament Study, Philosophy, and Divinity, respectively, Metherel in Medicine, Collins in Psychology, have done well in their endeavor to defend the Christian faith with the blessing of acute intellect God gave them. Let every Christian be trained to do the same and may many skeptics be drawn to a saving faith through the gospel of Jesus Christ as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthy effort but not good enough","review":"as a christian who often has to defend my faith, i was looking for more supporting materials when i approached this book. what i found is really just a well-intended collection of chit-chats w/ scholars across the country. serious non-Christians seeking the truth have genuine, well-thought-out and deep-rooted concerns, and the book just glazed over too many details to address the lost ones satisfactorily. my opinion is that the author tried to cover too much ground in too few pages. if you want a sweep of the typical questions out there, this might be a good start. but if you want answers beyond half-page summaries, you should look elsewhere.note 1: a minor point, but i don't like to be reminded the author is an \\"investigative reporter w/ a legal background\\" 20 times.note 2: for deep and proven apologetics, try literature by C.S. Lewis and Francis Scheaffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky Case --> Shaky Faith","review":"Lee Strobel's \\"Case\\" for faith in Christianity's founder is hardly impressive. It is clearly written for a Christian audience, as it would not convert any skeptic who truly lives up to the name \\"skeptic.\\" Its evidence is dubious, when it even exists, and its representatives, while well-spoken, provide little in the way of solid argumentation. But this is just fine for \\"skeptical\\" Strobel, whose questions seem strangely geared toward the strong points of Christianity. When weak spots in the \\"Case\\" seem so apparent, it doesn't even occur to Strobel to pop the question. While The Case For Christ may help reassure already \\"born again\\" believers that their faith is well-grounded, I doubt if any atheist or agnostic would be as convinced. If you are looking for a solid case for Christianity, look somewhere else. If you are just looking for a good laugh, be my guest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christ is For real","review":"This is a true story of an atheist Yale Law School attorney/journalist who investigates all known evidence of Christ.A must read for anybody who wants hard core evidence about the life and miniistry of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does no one see through this?","review":"This book is so obviously a Christian book, that I can't believe no one has heavily criticized it. All of the scholars Strobel interviews are die-hard Christians (and attest to that at the end of each chapter), and the author never quite asks the important questions. It also follows the Christian book traditions of using trite modern-day parallels, attacking liberal thinkers,and talking like a 3rd grader. Reading this book gave me the same duel sensations of laughter and shock that I experience when watching Triumph of the Will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another book with lots of \\"evidence\\"","review":"How much can you really provide in the way of evidence based upon stories passed down for a few hundred years before being written down? Religion is faith based, not fact based. If you want an entertaining read, this book is for you. If you're already religious, this book will help you feel better about your faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"A typical one-sided account","review":"This book is the epitome of circular-reasoning. Many Christians who read this book find it \\"logical.\\" However, this is one of the most collectively illogical arguments for Christianity I have ever read. I suggest people read the book, but understand there is really no debate going on within its pages. One final note: Strobel likes to portray himself as an attorney. The problem is... a Master of Studies in Law (Strobel's degree) and a Juris Doctorate (which practicing attorneys must possess) are two totally different things."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I think\\" is not a proof!","review":"This book takes a lot of things in blind faith. There is little actual evidence besides other Christians saying \\"I think this\\". The only thing that Strobel truly proves is that Jesus was truly killed during the crucifixion! Not exactly mind blowing ideas there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly Structured","review":"I am sorry but this book was so transparantly crafted with an end agenda in mind that it bears absolutely no resemblance to the most elementary scholarship. This book reads like a session in a fundamentalist Sunday school meeting, so shallow is it. I was actually embarassed for the writer while reading it. Not one original thought, not one contradictory view point, and no knowledge of how the scriptures have been didacted over the years was displayed whatsoever. The writer obviously has no training whatsoever in the scientific method, nor is he a competent investigative journalist. Horrible, just horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"the case for christ","review":"Lee Strobel's \\"The Case for Christ\\" is a readable presentation of the apologetics in favor of the orthodox Christian faith as held by Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant communions worldwide since the earliest days of the church. Though the subject matter is somewhat technical at times, it is as understandable as any work of this genre probably can be. Strobel does not explore beyond orthodoxy in his interviews, but then, that was not his purpose in writing this book. It is a defense of the foundational beliefs of the Christian faith, and a successful one at that, in my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"An objective view to Christianity","review":"Wow. I was a Christian before reading this educated, elegant work and found the evidence and \\"arguments\\" Strobel presents throughout an affirmation of my faith.I read this book immediately after finishing Holy Blood Holy Grail; although Lee Strobel doesn't refer to that controversial bestseller many of his questions seemed to refute the theories contained in it.The Case For Christ is an enlightening book written honestly and imaginitively. By drawing parallels to court cases Strobel not only brings an immediacy to his own investigation, but also draws the reader in as evidence for the Christian faith is presented in a logistical logically sound manner. An excellent book for Christians or those searching for a faith yet unsure if there's anything beyond myth and dogma to Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A play by play analysis of the Gospels","review":"I enjoyed the book. The overall analysis and facts were fascinating. Beware, you just might become a believer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed beyond belief","review":"This has to be some of the most flawed reasoning I have ever read in a book on this kind, particularly from someone hiding behind a facade of journalistic objectivity and Yale Law School.I'd suggest that Strobel take a logic class in his community college before ever being allowed to talk about this subject again. A lot of \\"A is true therefore B is true reasoning\\" coupled with page upon page of pseudo scientific conjecture, rumors and hearsay all \\"validated\\" by carefully selected \\"experts\\".Shame on you Lee. I liked you better as an Atheist, at least you could reason then. Oh yeah, and before you embark on proving that Jesus is the Son of God, you'll have to work on the small matter of proving the existence of God for him/her/it to even have a son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"If you are gullible and are looking for reinforcement in your belief of Christianity, you'll probably like this book. However, if you have any sense of logic or realism, you'll see right through this subjective drivel. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us a break!","review":"I couldn't believe my eyes! Investigative journalist? Come on. With an uninformed, skewed version of the facts, the author has perverted history to show his shallow, \\"one-way - right way\\" theology. This book would have been much better if it included the TRUTH and then had the journalist actually debate (as we all have to) in his mind what really occurred 2000 yrs. ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for...","review":"This book was recommended to me by a Christian friend, but sadly it was not what I was hoping for. I have a a strong faith in God, but no real feelings about Jesus, and the book was presented to me as an unbiased examination of the historical proof about Jesus' life and divinity from a questioner like myself. What I got was a book written by a convert looking to support his views about Jesus while pretending to be objective and investigative. Not only do I still have questions, but I am LESS likely to pursue answers from Christians than before I got the book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starting off point","review":"This book is a good starting off point for those who want to know the historical accuracy of the Bible. The early chapters, about the reliability of the New Testament are very sound. Now, this is not to say that I agree with all his arguments. In fact, I find a few of them lacking, but overall this is an excellent book. I recomend reading the other books as presented in the Bibliography, as I don't think this book is anything more than an introduction.Ignore most of the one-star reviews. They apparently, from what I have read, hate Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided, one-dimensional","review":"Lee Strobel pretends to be a skeptical journalist reviewing the evidence for the divinity of Jesus, but its funny how he only consults born-again style Christian experts, most of whom have a personal anecdote about how important Jesus is in their lives, which should immediately set off warning bells if you thought it was unbiased testimony. If you are looking for a serious discussion of the historical Jesus, this is not it. If you are already a myopic devout follower of Christianity and you want further confirmation of the conclusions you have already made, you will enjoy this book. I was really hoping for more meat and thought provoking logic. Alas, none to be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like Mainstream Journalism...BIASED!!!!","review":"I was hoping for a \\"fair and balanced\\" look at this topic despite the author's advocacy of his faith. Instead, Strobel chooses to interview conservative Christians to help \\"make the case\\" for Christ. Strobel serves up such softball questions during his interviews that the appearance of partisanship is apparent from the outset. If you're a skeptic looking for answers to the hard questions, don't expect Strobel's work here to provide anything beyond a sleeping aid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if I could give this book less than one star, I would","review":"This book is presented in the guise of addressed serious questions of the Christian faith in an objective, thorough manner; as a lawyer would defend a case. Listen, if Lee Strobel was defending Christ in a court of law, Christ would be in trouble. No offense. This book may work well for the naive, but is doesn't answer any serious questions regarding the validity of Christianity. Also, notice how everyone he interviews is a \\"Dr.\\" Something. That's to help him prop up his side of the argument. He's hoping that the reader will see the \\"Dr.\\" and not question the evidence. It's downright insulting. If he had good evidence to answer the questions posed, he would need someone with a \\"Dr.\\" in front of their name. He could just use the evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Strobel Helped Make Me An Atheist","review":"As a father of two young children I decided that if religion were actually true I had an obligation to find out. So I picked up a copy of this book \\"The Case For Christ\\" and started in. While reading it I kept wondering \\"When is he going to get to the actual evidence?\\" The answer is, HE NEVER DID. It's just full of special pleading, anecdotal evidence and very fuzzy logic. Shortly after reading this book I picked up \\"The End of Faith\\" by Sam Harris where I found clarity and every word rang true. Religion is chock full of apologists like Strobel hoping that nobody will critically review their work. While reading this book, continue to ask yourself \\"What evidence does ha have for any of this?\\" The answer is NONE. After that go online and study just the basic principles of radioactive dating and you'll realize exactly what actual scientific evidence really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Strobel - Fake Skeptic","review":"Lee Strobel has been accurately described as a \\"fake skeptic\\", in that he portrays himself as an open-minded person with an inquisitive mind who is willing to follow the evidence wherever it leads, when books like his \\"The Case for Christ\\" show him to be anything but.While his book would have been more complete with some thoughts from actual atheists, I did not expect to find any in a book of apologetics. This book does not even dare attempt to dismantle dissenting ideas - they are simply left out entirely. Yet it is quite clear to anyone aware of the opposing arguments that the \\"evidences\\" laid out in Strobel's case are inaccurate at best, and often deliberately misleading.Only someone with either a) a pre-existing belief in Christ, or b) no knowledge of the counter arguments, will find this book at all compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atheist Review","review":"I was given this to read by a Christian. There's no science or history to support the writers \\"case for christ\\", its just other christians who lend their support for his views. There are no non-christians used in support of his arguments.If you believe only Christians can provide truth, then this is your book. If you want a real case for Christ from a skeptic point of view, this is going to leave you hungry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While Strobel attempts to present this book as a trial, we only hear from the defense, and virtually nothing from the prosecution. Strobel did not set out to clearly look at the issue but rather to reinforce his own views with leading Christian proponents. If you read this book as a Christian, you will still be one. If you don't believe, this will not be a convincing case. If you straddle the line and are not too discriminating in your logic, you may find it plausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but misses some opportunities","review":"The book deals very directly with some of the alleged weaknesses of the Christian faith. However, there are points at which the author fails to deal with some of the most controversial issues. He presents arguments against the faith and then knocks them down--the only problem is that he doesn't present the toughest arguments.I would not recommend this book to a skeptic, it won't deal with all his issues. It is good material for a Christian to read to arm himself with ammunition to knock down many of the arguments against the faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy to find this CD","review":"I was so happy to find this CD.

She said this song expressed her feelings toward me better than anything else, which of course blew my young, impressionable mind. Well, I guess the tropic sands turned cold and this young world grew old because she dumped me after about three years. Still, when I listen to this tune, I remember the happy, care-free times we shared, oblivious to the burdens of reality as we were so much in love. I wish life could have been that simple!I bought the album lately to reminisce about 'Til, but was delighted to hear and remember several other nice tunes from that era including \\"A Moment Ago\\" and \\"Cry, Baby Cry\\".

This is only my second time using the lamp. The first time, all settings worked. :-/Also, in case you were thinking of purchasing this as a bedside lamp, it is not bright enough to read by, even when I remove the lampshade. It's great if you want just a little bit of light (maybe you don't like sleeping in the dark).I do like that there is a clock on the lamp. If you have really bad eyesight, it might be too small for you.

This covers lot of basic Data Structures and Algorithms written in Java with generics. I have read lot of data structure and algorithm books, but this one especially is for java programmers. Most of the algorithm books, only cover the basic pseudo code and leave the implementation, but this one gives a complete implementation of most of the famous algorithms. One more thing, I like particularly about the book is the supporting website, which has lot of test data and the author has provided test cases for each of the programs given in the book.This is not all, every chapter comes with lot of interesting compilation of exercises and creative problem, which will make your fundamentals clear.

My original newly-bought HP Scanjet 2300c couldn't slide the moving device under the glass all the way after less than a year. A year after that, the refurbished HP Scanjet 2300c replacement, sent by HP to replace the original, had a lamp failure, causing heavily faded images with green tint.

The software has infuriating problems such as refusing to scan an image of standard dimensions unless I preview every scan. As a result this scanner is very hard and very slow to use for scanning printed documents intended to send to an OCR package. I was expecting it to be slow but it is unspeakably slow because the software is VERY slow to laod and initialize and many of the software features can't be used and workarounds are needed at every turn. I was trying to use it on an 800MHz Windows 98 computer. The updated drivers on the HP web site are in some ways worse than the older ones.

I was much impressed with the accurate description of the physical surroundings and people of the 1860s. The reader can almost smell the aromas and visualize the countryside of the rural South. That, along with the factual presentation of the Yankee raid so well-known in Eastern Carolina, and the fictional romance that symbolically began a healing process between the two sides, makes it a good period piece. The author's easy, uncomplicated writing style results in a good book to relax with on a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who edited this book?","review":"Although Mr. Everett weaves a good story, I found his characters one dimensional and his style of writing annoying. His use of punctuation, particularly exclamation marks, made me wonder if he had an editor at all. At one point I counted 53 exclamation marks in three pages. I felt like the characters were constantly yelling. Although this may seem appropriate at some times, as in battle scenes, it hardly seems necessary in everyday conversation. I never felt like I got to know his characters, and could not tell one army officer from the other. They were not developed at all. His heroine, Julia, was an annoying, bratty teenager with few redeeming qualities.

I should have just skipped the book.But---the book is beautifully done and photographed.

And many of them are pretty advanced patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful photos of knitting projects","review":"The book is a good mix of moderate to advanced knitting projects that would make good gifts for any occasion. Some of the patterns focus on holidays, such as Christmas Stockings to hang at the fireplace, while others are all-purpose items such as afghans or mittens.

The help section in the back doesn't have many pictures, so you may have to consult another reference if you need help.

Unfortunately, Office XP is a lot slower and just doesn't have such a polished feel to it like 2000 does. It feels overly bogged down with unnecessary graphics (especially on the menus) and is a lot slower than 2000.Sure, its still a good product and I only give it 2 stars by comparison to 2000.

Worse news is that it wouldn't uninstall nor reinstall/fix (something got corrupted). A Msoft A+ beat on it a long time then finally reinstalled XP (unfortunately an all too common occurance, for lots of reasons) and all was well until I installed Office XP again. The problem recurred but this time, a system restore cleaned it up. Still using Office 2000. Now using Office XP as a gold coaster.

Scenarios ranging from the exquisitely beautiful (Hong Kong) to the terrifying (Paris underground) Has a map editor and a brilliant community following. I did not encounter a single bug or lock-up playing this game, and in case you were wondering, you can save anywhere.The game play is open and the maps are large, moody, and interesting. Choices you make during the game can effect outcomes, thus it's interesting to play through again making different choices along the way. You also get to update your own nano technologies, so you have to choose carefully which qualities you want to choose and update. The graphics are excellent.I already have a copy, but had to pick up the GOTY edition. If you are a PC gamer and haven't picked this one up yet, I wholly recommend it. You can't go wrong with a game of the calibre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest game of all time","review":"Deus Ex was the funnest, most realistic video game I've ever played.

I planned on playing it for just a couple of hours, but I got hooked, and have been unable to stop. DE is an excellent mix of FPS, roleplay, and adventure that gives you the freedom to play however you want. Do you want to waste anything that moves? Load up on everything from the mini-crossbow to a LAW, and pick up/purchase weapon upgrades. Or would you rather just sneak around and hack into computers and security networks? Just stock up on the right tools and focus on the appropriate skills. The game's plot is something of a mix of the X-Files and Matrix. There is never a dull moment from the time the game starts.

Released in 2001!!!!","review":"I bought this without looking at the release date (2001). This game may have really something 8 years ago but it sucks by todays standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully intricate","review":"As an avid player of RPGs and first person shooters, I really like this game. The story, plot, and action are easily on par with a game like Half-Life but what really sets this game apart is the breath of detail in how main characters and NPCs interact with the main character as the game progresses based upon decisions made throughout the game. This makes for exceptional replay value.The only thing that seemed rather odd to me when I first played it, is that for a cybernetically enhanced individual, his jumping ability is pretty feeble. It doesn't hurt the game, it just seemed odd. But after thinking about it (and playing the game again), I think games like Quake, Half-Life, and Unreal have more forgiving physics.Anyway a really fantastic game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Mozart","review":"This is a really great album. The enthusiasm and understanding that the Mosaiques bring to this music are phenomenal. It's not so much the period instruments but the conception of Mozart's quartets as conversations among four players that makes this a collection to be listened to over and over again. It's closest rival in that interpretative direction is the Talich Quartet who play on modern instruments (unfortunately currently unavailable except for a few isolated quartets). The sound is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest recording of these masterpieces","review":"Period instruments or not, this is the greatest recording of these quartets ever made. The Mosaiques have the most gorgeous string sound of our time, they easily match the Quartetto Italiano in their best days, and for sheer understanding of the Classical Quartet they are matchless. Auvidis sound is exquisite, so ignore all others and buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I ever used","review":"This razor is the best I have ever shaved with. It copes with every length of hair and angle of growth whether I shave every day, every other day, or even every third day. Perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as good as a foil razor gets - But not good enough","review":"It's well built. Trimmer works great. Easy to clean, just pop off the head and rinse under a tap. The shave is very comfortable.It is loud but no louder than the average foil razor. For shaving the sides of your face it does a great job provided the hairs aren't too long however... as with all foil razors that I've used it does an unacceptable job on the neck area and below the jaw. The foil design is the limiting factor here and this is why rotary razors are vastly superior to foils overall. Rotaries can be irritating to SOME so they are not for everybody.Its time companies like Braun too overhaul the whole foil design concept and come up with a new design.My recommendation - Try a rotary razor first. If you can't take the irritation then this one is probably your best bet. Just be prepared for the horrible shave it gives anywhere below the jaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backwards for Braun","review":"I've been using Braun foil shavers for 10 years, and although they haven't always been extremely reliable, at least I've always been happy with the features and performance. Not so with this product. The actual shaving performance is not nearly as good as my Flex Integral that just bit the dust. Also, several good features of my previous Braun shavers have inexplicably been omitted or changed. The new trimmer design (straight instead of the old right-angle design) is particularly disappointing; it really doesn't work at all. There is no lock to keep the shaver from turning on accidentally in your luggage. The charging cord is heavy and bulky; mine kept falling out of the electrical outlet because it was so heavy. I'm going to send this back to Braun to see if they will honor their 30-day satisfaction guarantee. I guess it's time to try another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best shaver for your money","review":"I've owned this shaver for 15 months. It's not the worst I ever had, but other than great battery life there's not much to recommend it. As others have pointed out, it takes a lot longer to shave with, due I think to the relatively small size of the cutter. I have to go over the same area many times. It doesn't travel well, due to the large AC adapter, with no storage in the hard case. No problem if you're only going away for a week or two, but make sure you remember to charge it first. I had to replace the foil & cutter after about 12 months -- it was completely useless by then. This time I'm not washing it with water (even though they say you can), because I suspect it may ruin the foil faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just had a close shave.","review":"I am very pleased with my new Braun 5614 Flex XP electric razor.It gives me very close and clean shaves, but never irritates the skin.

Yes, indeed.Paul Arvin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes a looooong time to shave.","review":"I have been using a Norelco for a long time - and so got the Barun 5614 for a change. The shaving is smooth with the 5614 in that my skin does not get irritated at all. But the problem is that after 20 minutes of shaving, I still do not have a clean shave - especially around the chin. So I repeat the shave in those areas and it starts to get irritating. I tried many differnt ways and directions, but the result is pretty much the same. So all in all, it works if you have ample time to stand in front of the mirror till the job gets done - but I dont - so I returned it. I guess you get what you pay for - so now looking for a higher end model.To be fair - I really liked the battery as it kept on running after two weeks of shaving with the initial charge. The case is good and so is the convenience of being able to clean it under water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Contour Solo 5775","review":"I have used Braun razors for 20+ years and have always liked them better than other electric razors. I just got the Contour Solo 5775, which was the direct replacement for my prior razor that I loved. Unfortunately, I dropped my old one accidentally and it broke.I have to say I am disappointed in the razor. It just does not shave very well. What used to take 5 minutes or so to shave, now takes at least twice as long.I would not recommend this razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster of a shaver","review":"I've had many electric shavers over the years (Norelco, Braun) and this is by far the worst. Had to replace the heads four times in two years; not only did they get dull, but individual blades started falling out. Braun Customer Service blew me off when I questioned this durability as being a lot worse than they claim. It's also noisy and vibrates some. I've always maintained shavers per mfr.'s instructions. Finally shaver started turning itself on at unpredictable times, including the wee hours, and since it's noisy this was annoying. I went back to Norelco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Different Shaver!!!","review":"I have tried many different brands, including Norelco, Panasonic, Remington and Braun.Of all brands, the worst shave so far has come from this Braun.

However if you've bought these you should be aware that the cable is held in place within the RCA plug only by a crimped, toothed band attached to a copper connector strip. This can readily be seen because the rear of the RCA plug easily unscrews and slides back from the gold plated front. The cable itself is otherwise unsecured where it enters the plug (as in a molded plug) and is free to wiggle about a bit. The soldering appears to be quite good in itself, but I would caution against using the cable where it may be frequently jostled or pulled upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible -- and I'm not alone","review":"I purchased this phone recently at a retail store.The setup was simple, the directions were clear, and the design is sleek and comfortable.However, the phone itself is horrible.

Like Narnia, it focuses on another world that is linked to our own. Instead of talking animals, The Realm is populated with Glimpses, each of whom mirrors someone in our own world.

I liked The Door Within better than this one, but it is still a good read. One of the things that I disliked about the book was the character Antoinette. Others may like her, I didn't because she seemed nothing like her glimpse (her \\"twin\\"), Gwenne. I did like that Aiden (the main character from The Door Within) was still in this book. The story would go back to him every now and then and that made the book a lot more exciting. I also liked how, even though they were in different worlds, Aiden and Antoinette were working together to help their friend Robby come over to the side of King Eliam.Overall, the book is very good and you should read it even if you didn't like The Door Within! In the end, it is all the pieces together that make the pie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"Antoinette, after believing that Alleble exists all her life meets Aidan who knows how to get there.

I like how faith is presented in this fantasy. \\"Even were the hordes of darkness to assail you in hopeless demand of your life--even then do you swear devotion forever to the King?\\" -pg. 121. There are detailed descriptions about the scenery and action sequences that make you laugh and gasp. Fantasy fans will continue the journey with Aiden and his new friend Antoinette. They find themselves in many twists and turns as Aiden and Antoinette tell others about the King and Alleble in the Mirror (real) World. In Alleble, they are hard pressed to try to rescue a friend and prepare for the rise of the Wyrm Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book!","review":"The second in The Door Within Trilogy is even better than the first. Instead of Aiden as the main protagonist, Antoinette (Gwenne's glimpse) is the heroine. In direct contrast to Aiden, at the beginning of this story Antoinette is looking for a way to enter the door within to help the kingdom of Alleble in their time of need. Paragor's armies are amassing with the Wyrm Lord in their head. When she meets Aiden in an art class, Wayne Thomas Batson' story is lifted out of the boundaries of mere words. With his trademark action packed, lightning-paced writing takes you to a place you won't want to leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"return to the Realm...","review":"In the last book, Aidan Thomas travelled through The Realm as a knight.

Along the way, they discover an ancient evil that is awakening from their sepulchers. And to make things worse, Aidan's friend from earth is on the enemy's side!

The print quality wasn't what I was used to on my previous fax machine. I couldn't be sure of the smaller type on the documents received (maybe anything 10-point or less). Furthermore, the film cartridges were hard to install--it was really a learning curve. If you are copying something small like a business card, the machine can't tell that it doesn't need to use a whole sheet of film, and it advances the film cartridge a whole sheet. So you waste that much film. I would never want another machine that uses film. If the film isn't in exactly right, it wrinkles and you see that in the printout.

Compared to other routers made my D-link, Linksys, and Netgear, this one is priced to sell at around $...less. It works great, despite its sparse set-up instructions. The set-up is internet based - requiring the user to enter a specific address into a web browser. This brings up a set-up wizard which is very basic and probably isn't very helpful for people who are new to setting up networks. Still, it's not hard to get the right set-up going (reading the included CD-ROM manual maybe advisable). In my case, I run some firewall software in addition to the router, so I had to adjust a few more things before I got this router to work. I play a MMORPG on one PC and surf the net on the other using this router. I've had no problems whatsoever. If you're looking for a basic router with a print server as well, the SS2604 is a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This router ...","review":"though it is easy to install but it has problem with major online messenger programs.

The characters, dialogue, even her descriptions of the sounds, aromas, and atmosphere allow us to almost live the story.And yet, the romantic tale filled me with the characters' hopes and disappointments and held me through to the end.Pamela Hayes' style is fresh and unique, and often hilariously funny.Constance comes from a poor family who hates her, and she wishes for a far better life. She almost has it, yet she tells \\"the lie\\" that threatens to undo it all. With friends, such as the lively Sharon, she learns self-confidence, which was much needed in her neglected life.Ms. Hayes portrayal of Sharon, a transsexual, is also welcome-we see her as a real human who successfully deals with the discrimination that transsexuals often endure, and becomes the successful woman that she deserves. Indeed, a theme in this book seems to be self-esteem.\\"The Lie\\" is my favorite Romance novel. I look forward to her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit!","review":"This item was at least 1/2 inch to long to fit over the original equipment mirror.

For starters, there is a massive amount of unskippable dialogue, much of which makes no sense. You speak of characters you've never heard of leaving you scratching your head in wonder. There is also a dialogue with a character in the hotel (as stated by another review) which forces you to end task the game since there is no way to terminate the conversation. Did anyone play/test this game before it was released?In addition, there aren't many puzzles, and the larger ones are not difficult, clever, or challenging, just tedious. I don't consider \\"trial and error\\" a puzzle, just annoying and a waste of time.The only redeeming aspect of the game are the decent graphics.

Also, when talking to one character in the hotel, I wasn't able to terminate the conversation because I hadn't completed some obtuse task; had to ctrl+alt+del the game.

No matter how much or how little you use this it is not worth even $5 (and I only paid $20 originally for brand new after rebate). I would pay them hundreds to take back the frustration. I actually smashed the replacement finally - I hate this machine and others have had the same experience, now that I've looked into the reviews (which for $20 and how little I use a fax I didn't bother with when I made my regretable purchase).

The mathematics were very hard to penetrate - dozens of pages to even get to basing control charts on standard deviations. I've got a minor in mathematics, so I was suprised by the difficulty. It was near impossible to derive quality lessons from the book.In deference to the author, I'll make a lot of excuses for him:- It was written a long time ago.- The book was aimed at statisticians, not managers.- A compilation of Shewart's ideas would be more effective than lecture notes.My end recommendation - browse before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the non statistician","review":"I picked up this book because I've been recently delving into the works of W.

Maybe a little picky, but when you want them soft to medium and still eat it as a sandwich, you gotta have the yolk in the middle.Finally, we couldn't get it to cook eggs or toast either one consistently with the same setting/amount of water.

Anyone considering purchasing this product should definately buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the smell!!","review":"I should have listened to the other reviews about the smell, but I thought, \\"Everybody loves it, and how bad can the smell be anyway?\\" It was bad. It really made me sick. I couldn't finish my egg and toast. I had to send the toaster back. Maybe it would have gone away eventually, but even a tinge of that initial bad smell would have ruined the eggs for me. By the way, I don't consider myself extremely fussy or sensitive, but to me smell is a very important part of food. Two other notes: It takes up a lot of space and also, even though I sprayed Pam, the eggs stuck a little in their pans. The concept is great, and the Amazon return was very easy. Maybe I will try the other brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"At first I gave this a product a bad review. Please, I take it all back. I'm blind as a mole.

For the first week it seemed pretty good. One side of the toaster didn't brown as dark as I wanted, but I could live with it. After about a week the difference in the two sides of the toaster grew greater and the egg cooker didn't cook my eggs. I unplugged and tried again and it worked. By the end of the second week the egg cooker stopped working all together and one side of the toaster barely toasted. Returned this product thanks to Amazon's fantastic return policy. I did not exchange as it just wasn't worth it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned the single for years, bought the double","review":"I've owned the single home \\"egg mcmuffin\\" for a couple of years.

This is a big hit with our family and my children can use the machine by themselves to make a sandwich when the get home from school."},{"rating":"1","title":"toasts terribly, failed after 2 years of occasional use","review":"this toaster toasts soo slow that it dries the bread rather than toasting it... resulting in inedible toast. the poacher is really finicky -- and forget toasting and poaching at the same time - you end up w/ insipid under cooked toast (no matter what darkness setting you use), and over cooked eggs. the toast only toasts on one side unless you crank it up to black -- leading a person to believe its permanently stuck in bagel mode. speaking of bagel mode - it requires you to put them in backwards to every other toaster on the market. its a waste of money. good idea - bad execution. after 2 years of using maybe 1 time every 2 weeks - if not less - its now no longer letting me select egg only - and consistently over cooking eggs no matter how much / little water you use.don't buy this if you LIKE your toast and eggs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and performance","review":"The egg part works good.

A+++++","review":"Wow....this toaster really does what it says. It's so simple to operate, and you get the same great results each and every time. Breakfast just became so much easier and tastier! It's so easy that my younger daughter can use it! You can cook up to 8 hard boiled eggs at a time, or 2 poached eggs plus sausage,etc. I love the fact that the toast finishes at the same time as the eggs.Easy set up and easy clean up. It even has a defrost setting in case your bagels are frozen. Praise God for technology and innovation! Hints from my usage of product:Before you use it for the first time, wash down the plastic parts, then run the toaster for a couple cycles (add water and run toast/egg function) to burn off the new toaster smell and oils. Use Pam or other butter flavored spray oils and the eggs slide right off and on to your eagerly awaiting toast!

It worked decently at first. I travel during the week and usually only use it on the weekends. Figure about 2 eggs and 2 bagels every other week for 6 months. I am not really taxing the machine (or shouldn't be). Now, one of the toast setting knobs does not affect how the toast comes out. I guess this would only be frustrating if I wanted to cook toast at different settings. The \\"bagel\\" setting no longer works and the \\"egg only\\" setting no longer works. In order to poach eggs, I have to press the \\"toast and egg\\" button, even if I have no toast.I initially really liked this product (tho the \\"meat warming tray\\" is about worthless. Now I am frustrated and feel like I got ripped off. I live by myself and it broke in 6 months. I am sure someone with multiple uses would break it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"broken","review":"I have had one of these breakfast factories before. It was the best thing. Easy use, quality breakfast, and easy cleanup. Then it broke 8 months later. I order another from amazon and the egg tray would only heat slightly. I sent it back and ordered another and this time the egg tray would not heat at all. Overall, I have to say this was the best part of waking up, until it broke. And now it seems as though they are not even testing them at the factory for quality control. So I'm going to wait before ordering another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toaster with Bonus Features","review":"This toaster is fantastic.

We were disappointed when it arrived and the egg cooker didn't work. I called the company and then sent another one, no questions asked, without having to sent the first in.Now we use it everyday to make delicious and healthy sandwiches. The only complaint is that the toaster doesn't make toast very dark, even on the highest setting, but it isn't bad, and you can put the toast in twice if it really bothers you.

Then the toaster stopped working. The toaster was not a good one to begin with, as it toasted very unevenly and dried the bread out way too much. I did like the egg cooker though. But $60 for an egg poacher is way too steep, and that's all I now have for the money--an egg poacher and a pre-cooked meat warmer. I don't even have the heart to tell my husband how much money I threw away on this lemon. It's a shame too because we really enjoy Egg McMuffins and looked forward to making more of them. The 4-slot appliance takes up a lot of room on the counter. I really wanted to love this item. Save yourself money and counter space--use your microwave and buy a cheap toaster. Cheap toasters seem to last forever, and I'm quite certain they could make it past a measly 5 uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this toaster","review":"I'm not a huge toast fan, but I love Eggs Benedict and this does the trick.Put your English muffins in the slots, eggs in the poaching pans and sausage or pre-cooked bacon on the top rack. A fwe minutes later, everything is cooked just fine! Wish that there were a place to do the sauce as well, but that'd be awkward.Keep in mind that the amount of water than you put in the poacher will determine how done your eggs will be. It only takes a few tablespoons to get them to a slightly-runny yellow state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ours Didn't Work Either","review":"On our four slot toaster the two left slots are window dressing and don't cook a thing but only give the bread a little ride. The eggs come out great but, as others have said, the two slots that do work dry everything out. I tend to like things on the crunchy side but it's beyond crunchy and more like the texture of left over sandwich bread you'd find in your car months after your children left it uneaten there. Not that I've eaten in mind you - just the stiff, crumbly, rock like feel. I gave it 2 stars because I also purchased this for my sister and she loves hers. Based on the \\"love it\\" vs. \\"hate it\\" reviews I can only assume they have some serious quality control issues. I feel like Eeyore saying it, but if there's any kind of lemon electronic, we'll end up with it at our house. This one's going back and I'm too afraid to replace it with another. Too bad.

Called Jan 3 and spoke to CS (which is a feat in itself) since when you call, there are usually people ahead of you and it is difficult to talk with a rep. After two times of hearing the voice mail message, the system hangs up on you. - Nice customer service!2.

However, I can fry breakfast in a small pan for 3 people before this toaster is done cooking eggs. The bread is cold when it's toasted along with the egg. Toast is only cooked right on one side of it and it is set on toast. Not bagel. This is the second toaster within 5 months to short out on the left side.

I mean you set it to something and the first four toasts are more or less what you want but the second series are much darker.Every 10 to 20 times that you run the thing you get completely burned toast.Over all if I was to buy again, and I wanted to spend the same price I WOULD BUT IT AGAIN FOR THE PRICE, it is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing gave me wood!","review":"I was more excited to try this thing out than the first time I saw a naked woman!

I have also reheated Ham and sausage patties on the steamer tray.I have no negative comments to make at all!

Eggs are perfectly cooked every time and turn out just right according to how much water you put in. Makes a very delicious breakfast sandwich or Eggs Benedict with very little work.Two minor cons are that sometimes the eggs overflow their holders a little bit and you have to scrub the metal boiler plate. This isn't a big deal but if you don't stay on top of it, it would get harder and harder to clean. Also, as other reviews has mentioned, the toast & egg setting tends to leave the toast a little less toasted than I like. I usually throw it down for 20 seconds or so after it's finished just to toast the toast a little more. The bagel setting only toasts one side which is nice, but even on the highest setting i find it still needs a bit longer.All in all, very happy with product and would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Easy to use, little bulky but what else could you expect from such an awesome machine!

I am in love with this item! You can cook eggs a number of different ways -hard boiled, scrambled, over easy, warm breakfast meat such as ham, and toast your bagel all at the same time. It won't even pop up the toast or whatever until the eggs are done, leaving you with the perfect sandwich! I use this item almost daily so far. It's nice with the 4 slots as I can make toaster pastries on one side for the kids, and my egg sandwiches on the other.-ETA After having this item for awhile now, I've noticed that one side consistently burns my toast, even on the lowest setting. I have had this item now for two years and have used it quite a bit (2-3xweek) so it has probably seen it's life but I would have hoped it would have lasted longer. Just something to consider as this could be a defect as it started about 1 year in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says it does, and well.","review":"This was one of the best breakfast ideas I have seen.

This is fast\\". Well, that's because it hadn't toasted the bread.No matter how how dark a setting I use, one time doesn't do it, Twice and sometimes 3 times is required to get more than soft warm bread.The darkness selection knob is useless.

Called the company and was told I had to give them the model number and 'date code' from the bottom of the toaster so set off to do that. In spite of almost microscopic raised letters on a black matte background found the model number, but no date code. Told them I could email them the Amazon invoice to show date of shipment, but no. I have to ship them the toaster at my cost to prove it's in warranty. Even though it's quite pricey, it's by my standards a piece of junk, and I guess I don't want go through the return process to get a replacement that will just break down again anyway.

On the day after the Amazon returns policy expired on it, it broke. Doesn't toast, doesn't poach. Just takes up counter space. Waste of money.

The product works as described and would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius invention","review":"This is a terrific unit. It does exactly what it says, and does so reasonably well. Here's what I do and don't like about it. Do like: capacity to toast four slices, ability to have two slots toast lightly and the other two toast longer at the same time, the bagel feature - puts most of the heat on one side of the toasting slot, accurate egg cooking, ease of cleaning. Don't like: water tray gets dirty when warming sausage, toast and eggs start cooking at same time which means toast isn't as warm as I would like when eggs are done, build quality seems good.Even though I don't like that the water tray gets dirty, it is still very easy to clean. Note too that I still rate this unit with five stars. Given that I tend to be a harsh reviewer this would mean that the demerits are of minimal irritation.In short, I love this toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toaster that can't toast ( or won't )","review":"Frankly, I don't get all the good reviews unless I got a lemon.After 4 push-down toast cycles my English muffins where always dried out but still not toasted.There are no visible heating coils inside, they must be behind metal walls.That means it's not a radiant toaster but some sort of convection toaster.As a retired Electrical Engineer let me point out that doesn't work for making toast.I sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Appliance","review":"This is a great kitchen tool! It toasts evenly, is contollable, works very well. The egg poacher is sweet! Put eggs and toast in, and they come out just right and at the same time.

The first product I received did not work right. On the toaster side: 2 of them only toasted one side of the bread while the other 2 burned the bread. The eggs cooked perfectly though. I exchanged the item and Amazon was fast in replacing it. I got the replacement and after the second use, one of the handles (where you put the meat in) broke off!! Although it was poorly made I decided to keep it because it does the job perfectly. I just didn't want to go through all the trouble again of shipping it back.

As this volume makes clear she was an outstanding photographer . The story of her relationship with Picasso, the part she played as inspiration and model for his work, her special role in regard to Guernica, her being the weeping woman of the famous painting, his abandoning her when he sensed ( or so he claimed) her impending madness, her passionate clinging to his memory, her breakdown, her turning to a reclusive life and one of deep religious devotion- are all presented in this excellent and clearly written volume.There are also representations of much of her work, and of Picasso's in which she is subject.Maar was clearly a considerable personality and artist in her own right, and not simply the inspiration for another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical collections","review":"Of some of Dora's photographs, and self portraits are a must have for any Dora fan.

What good has all her Bible Study done? All she can say is God has been there to pick up her pieces. It appears she takes the grace of God as a liscense to sin. Harsh words?

She took herself away for \\"healing time\\" to her parents', to Florida, to the ocean, to visit friends, and all through it her attitude was \\"poor me, look at my suffering.\\" She took no responsibility for her kids' suffering, just said that they made their own bad decisions.

Before signing the adoption papers Windsor said,\\"Please, Mom let me keep her.\\" When Ruth Graham would not relent her daughter reluctantly signed the papers. Ruth Gramham wrote about how sad her Windsor's eyes were while holding her baby on the drive to give her to the adoptive parents. After the adoptive parents left with the baby Windsor sobbed and wailed. Then Ruth Graham related how difficult the next year was for Windsor, but Ruth Graham maintained that she still thought that she had done the right thing. Perhaps Ruth Graham needs to read I Timothy 5:8. She speaks of \\"my broken heart\\" but never considers how she has damaged other people. How could this be \\"Hope for the Hurting\\"?

I would recommend this book to everyone, but especially to someone who is going through physical and spiritual trials."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a shame about the music...","review":"Great show, but just not the same without the music. Wish they could've at least afforded a COVER of Paint It Black for the theme song. All the same, worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tour of Duty without original Sound Track Sucks","review":"I never thought I would ever write a review of anything, however I was so disappointed with the first season of Tour of Duty whch was one of my most favorite programs (I don't think I ever missed an episode) when it was first released. I guess I never realized how much the soundtrack added to the series. I served in Nam for 18 months 1966-1968 and found when viewing the season one release, that the music, like the theme song \\"Paint it Black\\" added a lot to the overall feeling of the period. The insipid sound track that has replaced the original driving 60's rock music has made this release more like a soap opera than a window on the Vietnam experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show without original Music also.","review":"Yes, I too miss the original music, but that is not the heart of the show. It took me about 5 seconds of getting in to the first show in the DVD set (the pilot) to get over the lack of \\"Paint It Black\\" and the other music. If the music is the only reason that you like this show, then you are truly missing the point. You are missing the depth of one of the best shows ever made. And if your boycott succeeds and the rest of the series never come out on DVD then we all suffer. If you have to have the music, drag our your 8-tracks and your koss headphones and play it in the background while you watch. For the rest of the world, your gotta watch this show. The next 2 seasons get even better, the characters get deeper and more intense. This is also a show for the kids since it was on American TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"CBS GET A GRIP!","review":"so sorry to review this product but it really had me crying!

I saw this at Best Buy and grabbed it immediately. Poped in the first disc and low and behold the Rolling Stones were not there to get me pumped up. So yes I was that poor sap who got taken.It's very unfortunate that the original music is not there. If I can \\"steal\\" all these songs off the net in mp3 format, why the heck can't studios secure the rights for the original music? Seems so backwards to me. A job done poorly.Season two doesnt have the orignal music either. There are too many of these TV shows on DVD that have not been done correctly. It's really a shame if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Representation of DVD Set","review":"This DVD set is labelled as \\"The Complete First Season\\" which is a lie; all the music has been replaced.

After getting about half way through the 3rd episode, I had heard enough of the artificial electronic muzak that sounds out-of-place with the era. If you watched this series when it came out and enjoyed the mood it set, this will make you feel that something is now missing. I have ordered Season 2 but it has not arrived and I will throw both out if Season 2 is the same. I hope the DVD producer can work out whatever problem they have with the music or copyright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it, still awsome, but not the same!!!","review":"I loved this order, and looked forward to getting it every day..

Things about it bring back memories of when I watched the series the first time. I like the variety of the shows. Good first season. Some of the video is hazy, but its just fine by me.

I have greatly enjoyed the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tour of Duty - Definite in my collection","review":"I love war movies and tv shows about all the wars America has been involved in. This is one of my favorite tv episodes of all time. I remember watching it each and every week when I was younger. I was so excited when I got the set that I watched the entire set within a two week period. That was about 2 months ago, I'm starting over again.It's not a dvd that I would let my 3 and 6 year olds watch, but it's definitely one that I will enjoy for years to come. I can't wait until the next season comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Music--No Buy","review":"As a Vietnam vet, I loved the show. It's Hollywood, but still relevant. I could relate to a couple of the characters having known similar people in the real world. I, too, join those who refuse to buy until they restore the original soundtrack, music and all. If they do that, they can sell many more copies of this soon to be forgotten classic. I have heard several reasons as to why the original music was replaced and they all come down to the mighty buck. Sad! Oh well, I remember the original--guess that will have to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did they do?","review":"The original score was replaced with the most blan music possible.

I found the series bland with the music change."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Very Disappointed - Where's The Music?","review":"I WISH I had read the reviews on Amazon about the removal of the original music score, before I bought all three seasons of this great TV series. I struggled through the pilot episode of Season One last night. Without the original music score, Tour Of Duty has no ambiance, and it's going to be very difficult to watch all three seasons listening to that really atrocious generic music score that Sony substituted in place of the original music.Can I curse, pull out my hair and rend my garments now? What a huge disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sea of Corn","review":"Forget the music. Season 1 is a compilation of every stereotypical and cliche'd \\"bad scene\\" from every war movie or series you've seen since the beginning of time, but on a special effects deprived budget. A sea of cheap corn with the occasional cheese thrown in. Sorry folks, but I would not recommend.Second star is for the 1000 minutes of DVD time which is a bit more entertaining than commercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTRAGE!!!","review":"OMG I've waited YEARS AND YEARS for a (complete) video or dvd release, and now the show comes without the original period music. I can't believe it! Instead, it's generic sixtyish, umh, music---even when the characters are actually TALKING about what's playing on the radio in a scene! Utter outrage. Do they believe a score has nothing to do with atmosphere, emotions, historicity, zeitgeist, or, say, coolness?!?! Not to speak of goose bumps, reminiscences, memories? Why not change the lines while we're at it. Or the actors! How about that. Brave new licensed world. Know what? Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I also was a huge fan watching this every saturday night back in the late 80's.

I know this, because one of those reviews was mine.Why have they all disappeared?? Did Sony get to you? Was it affecting sales?Don't be fooled people - I would NOT have pre-ordered this and been stuck with it if I'd known not one track of the original period music survived this edition.

Bad enough all the \\"period music\\" which was integral to the setting is gone. But the THEME SONG?!?Imagine Miami Vice without the 80s music. Would be a joke right? Now imagine Miami Vice or Magnum PI without their original theme songs.I'm damn glad I checked this one out on Netflix BEFORE buying it. Saved me some money. Hopefully I will be able to DVR reruns and have all the original music including the theme song.Those folks in power who decided to save some money by not purchasing the rights to Paint it Black for the DVD just lost another sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Complete Season 1","review":"Well, well, well. The excitement at seeing the release of this great show was shattered by the news that the original soundtrack would not be included. Good thing I was able to cancel my order before the release date. Why would the studio put this show out with re-dubbed music? I am fully aware that there are royalty issues and what-not, but how can the creators of the show and all parties involved allow this show to be desecrated in this manner? Do they not have any pride? This cannot be accurately described as the complete season one, if a part of the original product is missing. Maybe this version will cause enough outrage that in the future a truly \\"complete\\" issue will be released. Until then, I will have to rely on the fond memories I have of the original show I saw as a kid in the late eighties. This DVD release gets one star for now until the music is rectified."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!! THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN!!!","review":"Can't wait untill June!

With a seasoned veteran sergeant and a \\"BOOT\\" LT, leading their men in and out of dangerous situations. The cast had remarkable chemsistry for a bunch of relatiely unknown actors, the scripts were well preapred and the technical advisors (Army Retired Officers) really put the polish on some of the soldiering for the series.

As much as I had looked forward to owning \\"Tour of Duty\\" on DVD I refuse to buy it unless it features the original soundtrack. It just wouldn't be the real thing.

Ok, without the music, the feel is a bit different, however, i feel they've done a great job trying to recreate the music feel. The generic music imitates the original music (in for ex ep 2 or 3, where they should play Voodoo Chile Slight return from Jimi, they play a tune which closely resembles voodoo chile).

From a biblical perspective, boundaries are inconsistent with forming \\"one flesh\\" (Mt 19: 5-6). Practically, one spouse actively attempting to change the other is contrary to a fulfulling relationship. While the authors \\"say\\" (Ch 3 I think) that they agree with this, their techniques reflect spousal manipulation (one spouse should take away the other's credit card, one spouse should refuse to provide meals, etc.).The Biblical references are ALL incidental to the book's main theme, which has no real foundation in scripture.

As one reviewer pointed out, it helps to be grounded Biblically when reading it (puts you in less danger of misapplying it). But this book is almost revolutionary in some Christian circles, where love and praying are synonymous with hoping and enabling.

Just as the title says, for bedtime indeed. It's the kind of book that you'd want to read before you go to sleep.

I'm sorry, if I want to read a story with a moral I will head for the children's section. This left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the stories when it became obvious that they were a couple pretending their fantasies.I like to write erotica myself and I have read some extremely hot amateur stories.

This book gave advice straight from the Bible and the saints on how to share our faith. The descriptions about fallen-away Catholics were just like MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. The book not only told me what aspects of a person's background to take into consideration, but it also helped me examine my own motives.

This is the WORST tracking litter I have ever used. Most people are complaining about the smell, which is kind of yucky, but my biggest problem is there is litter all over my house. My dark hardwoods are covered, I have to sweep/vacuum and mop several times per day. It's in the sofa, it's even in my bed! GROSS! And I don't just mean a little dust or a few stray pieces. I mean their paws are completely coated with the stuff every time they exit the box. I also clean the box several times per day. I don't know what the problem is here but I'm revolted by this one. But like I said, maybe it's somehow my cats because I don't see anyone else complaining about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing ever!","review":"I was using Tidy cats immediate odor control in my bedroom, which worked well to stop pet odors. However, the litter itself stunk up my room so bad that I questioned the intelligence of bringing a cat into an apartment.

It works well to keep his smells down, too. I love this litter."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIDY CATS SMALL SPACES GETS THE JOB DONE","review":"I love this litter. It does a great job.

It's scented!","review":"As soon as I poured this stuff in the litterbox, my nose was assaulted by a very strong perfumey odor. There was nothing on the outside of the package to indicate that this was scented litter. I called the company and was told that all their cat litter is scented with a \\"cucumber-melon\\" fragrance.My nasal pasages felt like they were burning, so I ran right out and bought another brand. This was the first time I tried Tidy-Cat and it will definitely be the last. If it smelled that strong to me, imagine how the cat must have felt. However, just to be fair I will also say that I am somewhat sensitive to perfumed products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible smelling litter","review":"I agree that the cucumber-melon scent is horrible. It smells like rotting cantaloupe. It was in the back bathroom, but the smell permeated the whole house, especially after the litter was just used. I could barely go into the bathroom. I've used other Tidy Cat litters and they have been fine, and I'm not sure exactly what variety this particular one was, but the smell was really revolting. The cat litter smell would have been better. Honestly, I've never smelled anything quite like it short of rotting garbage. It's like a chemical cantaloupe smell. It's coming out ASAP in favor of unscented litter or another type.In fact, the smell was so bad that I took time out of my busy day to google \\"Tidy Cat\\" and \\"melon\\" to see if anyone else had had problems with it. As if I had nothing else to do. Really, who has time to sit around Googling cat litter brands? That should tell you all that it was pretty bad. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful chemical smell","review":"This cat litter smells ok right out of the container, but as soon as my cat actually uses the litter, something about the combination of urine and whatever is in the litter produces an overpowering chemical smell that saturates the entire room. This smell is worse than plain cat urine (if that's possible) and I nearly threw up when I scooped the litter box. I immediately switched back to my other brand of cat litter, cat-attract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay litter, horrible scent","review":"I just adopted a new cat, and this was the only litter available to buy in the shelter. Considering I live in a tiny apartment, I figured this would be a good buy. It's not as good as it seems:Pros:* My cat seems to enjoy the feel of it on her paws* It does what it claims - kitty waste is clumped up for easy removable with very little breakage.Cons:* It tracks all over the house. Everywhere.* It's scented, and it's not even scented WELL. It smells somewhat like a rotting orange, especially when cat urine hits it. No amount of kitty digging seems to get rid of the smell. When you clean out the litter box, it gets a bit better, but it never fully goes away.* Dusty.Because of the smell, I dumped this litter for the World's Best Cat Litter brand. I dunno if that brand is much better, but at the very least the smell is a lot better. Avoid this brand if you're sensitive to smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"It deserves 10 Stars!!!

My older Sawzall is 11 amp and it seems to have much more power than this one. Besides this one being weak, it has a really crappy stamped metal foot that I expect will be bent in a couple of weeks work. The cord is short, and not replacable.For the $40 difference between this and the \\"Super\\" Sawzall, which is 13amp and has the better adjustable foot and longer, replacable cord, I would recommend going with the more powerful one, even if you only use it once in a while.

I purchased it during a cedar fence construction project and have found dozens of other uses since. My only complaint is related to my own selection decision. I looked at both the 11 and 13 amp versions and decided to save a few bucks by buying the lower powered saw.

I seriously considered getting the Milwaukee 6523-21 Super Sawzall 13 Amp Reciprocating Saw with Rotating Handle. However, I am a weekend warrior and the 13Amp tool seem like a bit too much tool for the job to justify the extra expense.Overall I would recommend this tool, however for a few extra bucks I could have gotten the 13 Amp version, the rotating feature would have come in very handy in some of the tight spaces I was working in.PROsGood power for most jobsLight weightHigh quality constructionQuik-Lok blade clamp makes blade changes very simple/easy even with gloves onComes with its own caseCONsNo Quik-Lok cable replacement feature"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one w/ 5 year warranty","review":"I bought this at Lowes for 99.00 plus it came with free blades and a 10.00 gift card during the holiday season. I agree with he other reviewer that it is better to purchase quality tools for a few more bucks that will last and the manufacturer will honor their warranty. My power tool journey has gone from Craftsman and Black & Decker, to Makita (still love the color) to DeWalt, who all only have a one year warranty. I burned up the Sears and B&D poducts. Although the Makita and Dewalt have still held up, as they die, I will switch to this brand.

Time lines in the book corresponded exactly with his muster rolls from the MS Dept. of Archives which allowed me to know that he had been present at Champion's Hill, Shiloh, and Vicksburg, to name a few.

If a particular performance is to stand out nowadays, it needs a claim to fame. Such is the case here: Savall's performance is the most vinegary of them all.This is period practice with a vengeance: the strings are completely devoid of lustre. Savall must subscribe to the 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' School of string playing: it's exercrable. Alternatives such as Gardiner, Spering, Harnoncourt, Neumann, Norrington and many others are 'Karajan Soup' by comparison. As a consequence, the woodwind and timpany are to the fore, which makes for a very exciting performance . . . . . on a superficial level.The Masonic Funeral March is one of Mozart's most profound compositions but you would never know it if Savall was your sole reference.

There are Karaoke machines that use DVD's, that are a better choice.But, I think the best system is the Leadsinger microphone that contains hundreds of songs in a single, portable microphone.

Written largely as stream of consciousness, with bits of narration thrown in to tie the story together, it is very hard to follow. Adding to the difficulty are freely impressionistic and allegorical elements that have highly ambiguous links to the story, and feel instead like the author's own stream of consciousness.

The headstock pivots and slides which is verry helpful.I'm always a tough sell, so there are some drawbacks people should know about. When turning a bowl that is juat about 14\\" diameter, the motor can (since it's behind the headstock) get in the way of the tool rest when roughing out a piece. Usually it can be avoided, but a motor opposite the headstock or underneath the headstock would be great. I guess they need something to differentiate this lathe from the Powermatic. Also, don't count on using the tool rest extension very effectively. No matter how tight you lock it down, it will move with vibration.

Music is melody, harmony, rhythm--yes?--all of which are virtually absent here.The ensemble's most dynamic work, I think, is 13 compositions around the Stevens poem \\"thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird\\".

This is not a common grinder but is a sharpener and requires patience and some skill. It makes an excellent hollow grind as described in another review. It does not cut quickly. The tool posts could be sturdier. The allen wrench fits the screw heads rather sloppily. These two points are why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

Amazon sent me a replacement. The same happened again. I asked for them to call the manufacture to do a make good on my purchase. To find me a decent dub of the movie.Yes, Amazon refunded my money. But do you think the customer service department would even listen to me. I wanted to buy this movie. So why can't a manager from Amazon, call the distributor of the movie. Tell them the problem and I try to get me this movie.I rate the movie as good. Amazon's customer service as very poor. Even trying to hear me out to make good my purchase. Yes, the refund is fine.

Neat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Orbital","review":"The Makita BO5012K 5\\" Variable Speed Random Orbit Sanderis worth the extra five to ten dollars (price comparison to most competitors in the 5\\" orbital range) for two simple reasons. First is the minimal vibration. If you have used a palm orbital for an extended period of time you know the vibration can make you hand numb. Over time the numbness leads to nerve damage. The Makita BO5012K has a minimal amount of vibration compared to the Porter Cable and Dewalt orbitals. Secondly is the dust collection on the sander. Whether using hook and loop discs or sticky disks the Makita BO5012K traps a majority of the fine dust which makes for happy lungs. Also, in my furniture production shop I find the variable speed option very useful when training new people. It allows the user to get comfortable using the sander and the slower speed keeps them from removing too much material. Buy one and try it out, it is the only way to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok but needs improvement","review":"Contrary to what the description says, my sander spun at full speed upon startup making it difficult to set on the workpiece without marring it. I had to place it on the piece before turning it on. It was also a little difficult to control as it seemed to jump around while sanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Sander!","review":"I was looking for a small random orbit sander that could be used in the house. This one is great! The dust collection works excellent, it is fairly quiet and has very little vibration. It is comfortable in the hand, so it can be used for quite a while without any hand fatigue. On the small project I used it on, the sanded surface was nice and smooth & ready for finishing. This is going to be a joy to use for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reliable Sander","review":"I bought this sander back in 2004 and it is still going strong. I do have a couple of other sanders including a Festool sander, but I find myself coming back to this Makita every time. The handle holds well in my hand, the switch is conveniently placed, and it is well balanced. I find the variable speed feature very handy for different applications.I would have to agree with the other reviewers who mention the dust bag could be better. The dust on mine tended to leak out at a couple of stitches where the bag met the plastic connection, but I solved it by just putting tape over that section. If you hook the sander up to a dust collector/shop vac, this problem is eliminated.I would highly recommend this particular Makita BO5012K model and would definitely purchase again if, knock on wood, needed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another too narrow MIA!","review":"In addition to this shoe, I ordered the Maris slide and both of them are just far too narrow in the straps--the footbed is the right size and width but way too tight on the top.

There's a one-paragraph word-bite about each project, and then a picture (or pictures (1 project)) that moves, or pops up in 3-D. Very limited, and rather disappointing.

My wife insisted on butcher block and I wasn't about to take out a second mortgage for a Boos top; Lumber Liquidators tops were too large, and Ikea was out of stock; so I tried this item for its solidity and thickness, and for its reasonable cost and shipping charges. I was fortunate that the top I received is very satisfactory in appearance for kitchen use and is heavy and sturdily constructed. Due to its rigidity, I was able to mount this solidly on a cantilever with only the last ten or twelve inches supported, doing away entirely with supports I had planned for the far side, leaving plenty of leg room for two chairs. Since these are sold for workshop use I cannot guess whether all the stock will be attractive enough for kitchen use, but the construction is certainly of good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent purchase","review":"Excellent value.It is large and solid as described.

It is also a wonderful book to use with students of all ages when studying science. Children are naturally curious and the crisp colorful photos of bugs, nests, and wildflowers will surely spark many scientific questions. The photos complement the brief poetic text. I think that the text describing the number 10 (\\"Ten trees whose innumerable leaves / clean the air/ for everything / that breathes\\") will heighten even the youngest readers' interest in trees and their role in preserving our environment. This book will be enjoyed by readers of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when it works.","review":"I use this unit in a Comcast Cablecard setup.

I have no problem with the system of menus or the TVG. For no reason I can discover, the system fails to perform about one out of ten scheduled recordings. I can discern no pattern. It will record a given show on a given channel at a given time correctly upon one occasion but not on another. When I observe such a failure, and attempt to record the program manually, the machine will not accept the 'record' command. Maybe it's the machine. Maybe it's the Cablecard.

The TIVO user interface & capabilities are far superior, we would rather pay the monthly fee & get something highly usable than use the no fee SONY. I am a big SONY fan but this time I found out they cannot compete. On the SONY you cannot put in a keyword & have it record any show that contains that keyword, called WISH LIST in TIVO. If you record a repeating show week to week you cannot tell it to only save the last so many shows. TIVO has all of this & then some. The Internet connection makes upgrades easy for TIVO, no can do with SONY. So with TIVO it's either the old fashion fone line connection or an Internet connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Recommend","review":"I wanted to really like this DVR. I really did. But after spending a week trying to get the TV Guide listings to ever populate (never did), and dealing with very poor Sony support, I gave up and returned it to the store. I could overlook the single tuner, but without the Guide, the DVR is useless. I was trying to use this with Comcast Cable with a Cable Card...and the TV Guide never populated. From reading user forums, the TV Guide appears to be the very weak point of the unit. I'm extremely disappointed that Sony put their name on this $1000 boat anchor. I'm sorry, but from my experience, I can't recommend this unit to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice start, but...","review":"While this is just what I was hoping to see when CableCard availability was announced, it has it's limitations. The current version of CableCard is only one way and doesn't support ordering of pay per view or video on demand. The installation process is a little clunky and takes a visit from the cable company.The next version of CableCard that is being spec'ed out by the cable and consumer electronics folks will support two-way services including program guide, video on demand, and the other services you get with a cable subscription.The price is a little high but you can't typically buy a cable compatible DVR yet. Subscribing to DVR service from your cable company will cost you in the range of $10 -$15 per month.

He read parts of it to us in class. I heard about his public readings at the University on this book and I didn't go because of what he had read to us in class.

It doesn't work like a novel-- doesn't give the novel reader what the novel reader expects. It is foolish to understand this fact as an indication of the book's being deficient. Its value is more like the value of a book of poems-- a book one can look into, quite at random, again and again, and in which each Soul will surely have her favorites.

This work allows me to imagine myself prone on \\"the meaty bed of royalty,\\" lying there until I am arrested. _Letters to Wendy's_ is not in fact poetry but a short novel: an invention in both subject and form.

As previous reviewers have mentioned, this does crumble, and it stings. Some moisturizers do sting a little at first, so I continued using it. However, when my eyes began burning and watering, I thought perhaps I was allergic to this formula (I never apply it near my eyes or eyelids), although I don't normally have sensitive skin. Then I realized that it was flaking and peeling, so must have been making it's way into my eyes. The consistency is thin, my face feels dry when I use it, and the peeling makes it difficult to apply foundation. I will stick with the other L'Oreal moisturizing creams, I trust the brand, but did not have a good experience with this lotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as advertised","review":"This is a terrific product at an even more terrific price. I shopped around for a workbench top like this on and off for several months in preperation for my garage remodel and the cheapest price I found before this one was at least $100 more. The only issue I had was with the first shipment. The company did a poor job of packaging the item and it was damaged in transit. But they were great about working with me to have another one sent out immediately when I refused delivery of the first one. The second one was packaged much better and it came pretty quickly.

A pyrotechnic effect also malfunctioned, which briefly set a portion of the stage on fire.A track omitted on the prior releases - Lay Down, Stay Down - is included, with the sound quality as clean as possible.

However, it's difficult to actually learn from. It's very equation-based, which is good, but the equations are often simply presented without any discussion. The ambiguity of units is frustrating, and it's difficult to tell whether an equation has a typo or not. I really think it could be better organised. For my course, I ended up getting other textbooks on hydrology from the library and generally avoiding \\"Physical Hydrology.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information, not so great layout","review":"There is a lot of good information packed into this book but as a student, I have found it a very frustrating textbook to use. The reader is bombarded with equations without a good general overview first. A glossary would also be helpful. The units of many equations are left out. This is confusing since for many empirical equations, the units cannot be derived from dimensional analysis. Finally, like many hydrology textbooks, there are literally hundreds of Greek symbols used throughout. Without any glossary or table of symbols used in each chapter, it is very difficult to go back and find the original definition and derivation, should I forget what one of the symbols stands for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A steaming pile of scatterbrained presentation","review":"I'm currently a student using this book in a 400-level hydrology course. This is quite possibly the worst textbook I have encountered in my academic career. It somehow manages to make even simple material that I already kind of know very difficult to understand. The writing style is very pompous and generally otherwise inaccessible. Variables used in equations are either not well-defined or used inconsistently. Examples, for lack of a better word, suck. Figures are confusing rendered.

Whatever type of business venture you have, you must take charge of your income.Nevertheless, I must admit that as I live in Australia I had never heard of Wyonna Judd as country and western music was not so popular here.My tastes tend towards opera and classical music and I bought this book to understand America during that period.I was very surprised to read of the poverty this star singer had in her childhood, and sounded like the days of the Great Depression, rather than the current times.The book could have been better if more information was written about her triumphs and successes in her musical career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I would have quit reading at two chapters but since I paid for it I'm forcing myself to read it.

I truly enjoyed those first chapters. At the halfway mark I was bored to tears. Shortly after, I could not find any reason to go on reading. I still don't know what she was so pained over.

A lot had been invested in this novel, and kudos for that since the woman definitely has all the makings of a best-selling author. But despite DESTINY's many powerful moments told with warmth and flair (like the outcome of the heroine's childhood friend, for instance), the novel lacks strength. Predictability wins over substance. Beauman's destined to be together characters H'l'ne and Edouard are a likeable duo, and karma sure does wonders for both of them, yet without much of originality to boost up its sagging plot, Sally Beauman's first major outer since penning a few Harlequins (as Vanessa James) leaves much to be desired.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Collisions badly handled, too little variety, but solid game","review":"1) Be forewarned that the graphics are a little \\"lazy\\" - the collisions are handled fairly poorly, so that fabric, hands, legs, etc all overlap and slide into each other pretty much all the time.

Since I prefer uplifting melodic trance that can be found on \\"Boundaries of Imagination,\\" \\"001: State of Trance,\\" \\"002: Basic Instinct,\\" and \\"004: Tranceparance,\\" these CD's just didn't do it for me.The first disc is as boring as \\"002: Basic Instinct's\\" first disc with only one good song being the last one (Vincent de Moor's \\"Flowtation 2001.\\" The second disc reminded me of Tiesto's Spage Age 2.0 with a lighter touch. It did contain more good tracks though.All in all, buy this CD if you're into Progressive and/or dark techno-ish Trance. If you expect Armin's usual uplifting melodic Trance, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return To Form","review":"After the somewhat disappointing first disc of AVB002, where he got a little \\"progressive\\" (read: boring) on us, Armin returns with another wonderful set of melodic, mellowish trance. AVB generally keeps the tempos a little lower than DJ's like Tiesto and Ferry Corsten, and the first track on the set, the sublime \\"Janeiro\\" should prepare you for his unique selection of tunes. Many of these tracks (e.g. \\"A Taste Of Summer\\" and Ralphie B.'s massive \\"Massive\\") have become dancefloor hits since the release of this set, showing you just how much of a tastemaker Armin is.A great mix by a great DJ. Check out his radio show on the Dutch ID&T station for further excursions into trance."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 good cd in one...","review":"well its my first one from armin and this cd makes him my favorite dj ever... firt cd is more house relax chilling and second one harder and strong melodies really orignial after listening about 50 time the albums I still love all tracks... peace!!! enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Armin's best by any stretch of the word...","review":"Having listened to 67 of Armin's Ibiza sets, and his very first 001 State of Trance set, I have to say he really let me down on this one.I know that people have different tastes in music, but the progressive style that made AVB so distinctive in my mind seems to have been lost on this set: I began to see it in his second one, but this one really broke the camel's back.Most of these songs aren't progrossive at all. For me, this disc was definitely not as enjoyable as the first album--namely the first disc: There's not a single bad song on that disc. It's the kind of CD you can pop into the stereo and listen to from start to finish. Not so with this one, though. I spent most of my time listening to this CD by flipping tracks; and only listening to about 5 seconds of each song to boot.All in all, if you want really good AVB, go for his first. The songs actually have a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"this product does not work","review":"used semi perm hair color. purchased this product at a Beauty supply, used it.

I was immediately intrigued by the cover, and by the picture on the backside of the cd case. My initial impression was that this was a celtic band so being a fan of celtic music, I checked out the cd. I wasn't too far off that this band played celtic music however I was quite surprised (in a good way) by the heavy metal riffs. THE MORRIGAN'S CALL is definitely not something I was used to hearing in terms of metal. The fusion of celtic folk and black metal music took some time to grow on me but eventually I grew to enjoy the album. I particularly enjoyed listening to Karen Gilligan sing but could have lived without hearing Keith Fay growl or bark. Keith's vocals kinda ruins the beauty of the band's music for me. I enjoyed most of the songs except for when I hear Keith's singing. Overall THE MORRIGAN'S CALL is a solid folk metal album worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not released yet","review":"Cruachan recently changed labels, which seems to have delayed the release of their new album.

We used it in a small office. We like the pods because there is no leftover stale coffee. Everyone can have their style of coffee from the different flavors, styles and brands of coffee we purchase. The problem is the plastic lever assembly. It breaks all too often. We were lucky to have purchased it from a retailer that has an easy open return policy. But we are tired of going back and forth to the store. The store owner recommend that we try the SENSEO brand machine. Problems solved!I originally purchased Black & Decker because it is a brand that I grew up with and learn to trust. I do not work for Senseo or Black& Decker. I just want a machine that works If you decide on a Senseo, I suggest that you try SAMS club, because their machines has features that other retailers lack.I also don't work for Sams, either.

Called customer service and was told yes they knew there was a problem and there engineers were working on it, took my name and number and said they would get back to me when they had it fixed. That's been over a year ago. My question, why sell the pods online or even the coffeemaker if they knew there was a problem??? Now all my coffeemaker does is leak all over the place.

The concept of the machine is great and the Milstone coffee pods make the best cup. However this machine needs to be recalled because water comes out the bottom of the machine and where the cord exits the machine after every 3 cup in a row you make. I am not talking about a little water we are talking alot and this is an electric shock danger.

The Senseo is much better- wonderful coffee!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The coffee maker is flimsy and the coffee tastes lousy","review":"The idea behind this machine is great, but this black and decker coffee maker is cheaply made. It's often very difficult to get the lid over the pod holder to close correctly, and I think the handle is going to break off any minute. The water leaks out the front of the lid while the coffee is brewing. I've never had a problem with the water not being hot, but then again I run a cup of plain water through before I add the coffee pod.The coffee tastes pretty awful. It has a burnt or chemical taste to it, and when you look at the top of it in the cup, you see little oily looking bubbles on top. I have no idea what that is. I would like to try mochas, lattes, or cappuchinos, but they aren't available in the stores yet. Maybe they will taste better.Unless they improve this machine, you are better off just making coffee in a regular coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoided a fire thanks to the customer reviews","review":"Shame on Black and Decker!

Immediately upon starting the recommended preuse \\"water run thorough\\" the machine started spewing out white smoke and emitted a smell of melting plastic.

When the Home Cafe was introduced, I thought, this is great! Boy, was I wrong. The coffee is wonderful, after you put it in the microwave to make it hot enough. The product, however, is another story. While taking it out of the box, I was afraid of breaking it. When I started brewing it vibrated so loudly that I woke up my wife -- she thought I had my electric sander going. The pod holder snaps broke off after the third cup so I took it back to the store where I bought it and got another one. This one lasted longer. By the end of the week the pod holder broke in two from top to bottom. I have decided that it is just not worth the trouble or the cost since I can still use my stainless steel perk pot.My suggestion -- If this plastic toy is going to be kept on the market, the pod holder and lock should be of stainless steel and some how get more heat in the brew.Note: I am taking mine back to the store to get my money back!Ron, the coffee lover"},{"rating":"1","title":"junk, junk, junk - Stay away from this product!!!!!!!!","review":"This piece of junk fell apart within 3 months with light usage.

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I have owned single serve coffee machines made by Mr. Coffee and Melitta, so I have actual basis for comparison. First, the flavor of coffee produced by this machine is unsatisfactory in comparison with that of other machines; I suspect that either the water is either not being pressurized sufficiently or is not heated sufficiently. Secondly, the machine is slightly awkward to use in relation to the other brands. Apart from these issues, however, the machine has an excellent form factor, price and brewing time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Investment","review":"The System is far from what I expected.

Then the pod clamshell catches and won't open and close correctly. It always feels like YOU're breaking something.

Well, any coffee house that made the awful coffee this thing makes would go out of business pretty quickly. It uses \\"pods\\" and a few free ones come with it. I tried making a cup with one pod and the result was practically water with a horrible plastic aftertaste. So I tried to use two pods and that was a little better in that it at least tasted someting like coffee although it was still weaker than I'm used to and lukewarm with the plastic aftertaste and I still find my cheap drip coffee maker makes a better cup. Since the pods retail for about 20 cents each; for 40 cents per cup I would expect a much better coffee than this produces.And since most of it is plastic and it gets pretty hot and steamy while brewing I'm not surprised other reviews have mentioned problems with durability.

Guess I won't be using this early while others are still sleeping.Well I tried a few cups. The taste was okay but not as good as a drip maker. The clean up was decent I suppose. The one thing that disappointed me the most was the temperature. It was luke warm right out of the machine. I could actually drink the cup right down like water if I wanted to.

That one would not brew any coffee. I called Black and Decker and was told that I could send it in for an exchange or just go back to the retailer. So I went back and got ANOTHER one. This one was making about half a cup within just a couple weeks also. I use filtered water, so that is certainly not the problem.

It leaks and makes terrible tasting coffee. This is by no means a small leak...water goes all over the counter. The replacement unit I got leaked worse than the first. Don't waste your time or money on this product. Senseo makes a much better single serve coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I HAD one, empasis on HAD. The thing just fell apart, the coffee was very good, and the idea was good (on cup at a time) But the machine is not sturdy enough for everyday use and to get a nice big cup I ended up brewing twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a Year","review":"I used this appliance on the weekends for the first 6 months. After that, I began using it for 2 cups a day, seven days a week. It's been a year and the pod holder and casing around the pod holder have completely cracked. It costs $16 (w/shipping) to order the replacement part. My recommendation is to put your money into something that will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee?","review":"I haven't had a good cup of coffee since I bought this thing.It's like drinking flavored water even when I use 2 pods for a 7oz cup.You can't buy decent pods for it. No Starbucks!I'm going to pitch it and go back to making a pot of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy piece of junk","review":"This is the worst coffee machine!! Very cheaply made, hard to closecorrectly, noisy!!! I should have stuck to my old leaky coffee pot!! WASTE OF MONEY, EVEN WITH COUPON!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine is Junk","review":"After only two packs of pods, the pod holder cracked apart. The coffee is OK, but the machine no longer works properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fought a battle for Black and Decker and lost...","review":"My name is Holly and when I saw the commercial for this I had to have it. My husband put up a fight b/c at the time it was $60.00, but I convinced him we would save money on the single serving pods(we didn't). Four months later this stupid thing has gone bonkers. The coffee maker would not turn off it kept running continualy, until I unplugged it. The plastic tray the holds the pods did not stand up to the heat of the water and became so brittel that it broke into 6 or 7 pieces. And finally the machine that wouldn't stop running stopped running completely. All this in four months!!! No wonder the stupid thing is only $20.00 now!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Black and Decker Home Cafe","review":"I was so excited to finally get my Black and Decker Home Cafe machine. I chose one that I recognized the name for.What a disappointment. I cleaned the machine initally like instructed. Again and Again. IT TASTED LIKE PLASTIC. EVERY CUP! Or is it possisble that it can scald the water so badly that it tastes like that?The handle seems as if it will break each time I put a pod in it.I probably only used this machine, testing it out, about 10 times, and was disappointed each time. I even tried the different flavors to no avail. Still a very bad taste to it. Luckily I did not have the trouble with the water leakage. But I probably had not used it enough.Mine is in the Goodwill box but may just go into the trash can.Terrible waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, good price, poor product","review":"Black and Decker usually sells good stuff, but this BD is just BaD. The pods are great and one can also buy a Presto (TM) mypod refillable coffee holder wherein we can use our own coffee. But the constuction is poor. It pees all over the counter on every use - so there is not as much time saved skipping the Coffee Store run as originally hoped - but at least it keeps the counter cleaner, as I have to stop and sop it up and clean it up after every use.Note to those who are already \\"stuck\\" with this product: I have found, through trial and error, that if you keep a needle handy, and thoroughly clean out the tiny hole through which the liquid runs into the cup AFTER EACH AND EVERY USE, it does work better - not best, but at least better./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three days and broken, no customer support.","review":"I took advantage of Target's \\"special\\" price of $45.00 for this B&D; brewer. I thought that the Black & Decker heritage on this would ensure a fool-proof, trouble-free product. After three days of okay brewing (although the unit produces an annoying buzzy noise while brewing) the various choices of 7 ounce, 9 ounce and 14 ounce no longer put out the right amount of water. Instead of a hearty 9-ounce cup of joe, I got about a two-ounce shot of thick expresso-looking liquid. Yes, the water tank is filled with water. Yes, I am using filtered water. Yes, the coffee pod was put in properly and the unit was closed and sealed properly.I dropped Black & Decker an email four days ago to see if there is some water metering adjustment that would fix this thing, but apparently all their customer service reps in New Delhi are too busy with tsunami duties to give me an email reply.VERY disappointed in this product and B&D;'s NON-customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try Santa Clause....","review":"I received the B&D HCC100 for Christmas and being the only coffee drinker in my family, was excited about having a convienient way to make a single cup. Unfortunately this cheaply built maker produces marginal tasting coffee at a temperature you could take a bath in. I am going to exchange it for Halo 2 (Santa should have known I needed that game for my new xbox):)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product!","review":"I got this for Christmas and it was broken when i got it out of the box. The water would not cycle through. It was very flimsy and cheap too. I took it back and got the Panasonic Sensio which is a lot better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This coffee maker is crap. It makes horrible coffee and the actuall coffee maker is junk too. it spits and sputters the whole time you make the coffee, after you are done making the coffee it drips for over an hour. when watching it make the coffee it pours out mostly water. this coffee make is a POS- Piece of S**t"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke before I could make the first cup of coffee...","review":"I purchased this last night. I should have read the reviews here first.When I got home, I first ran it through a cycle with only water and no coffee like the instructions said. Then I added a pod to make the first cup, and when I was closing the lid, the coffee machine broke in two. When pulling the lever forward to lock the pod in place (which is very hard due to the flimsy construction), a piece of plastic broke at the back of the base breaking the machine into 2 pieces and exposing the guts of the machine.I took it back this morning for a refund and purchased the Senseo. The Senseo is definitely built better and it's much easier to work the pod door.Black & Decker needs to go back to the drawing board on their machine. The concept is good, but it's unbelievable they would put a product this bad on the market. It's not only bad for them, but it's bad for the coffee makers (Foldgers, etc) that support this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy & Yucky","review":"In a perfect world this seems great but in reality it is a huge waste of money. I wanted to like it, I really did but it was very disappointing. My 1st disappointment was the mess. If you put a regular coffee cup under it waiting for your coffee to drip in...it will drip in but splatter all over your countertop. Before adding cream to my coffee it looked like mud. I'm glad I don't take my coffee black but the taste was less than smooth. I found it tolerable but still not what I wanted. After a short time the flimsy plastic cracked and leaked water all over the place. Do more research before buying this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"You would think B&D would put out a better product. The Home Cafe is cheaply made. The handle feels like it will break when you put in a pod (it's only a matter of time before it does..) Once your cup is brewed you'll need to wait a good few minutes before you remove your cup as the unit likes to drip for a while after your cup is full. Not very handy when you really want that first cup of morning coffee. You can remove the cup, but be prepared to wipe up the drips...<br />"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This was purcahsed for me as a gift and after one week I have had it. Coffee is luke warm and weak. I have tried several different pods hoping for different results with no success. I would not recommend any buy this product. I wouldn't even give it away. There isn't a zero star rating so I guess one will have to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home Cafe HCC100","review":"I called the company because the coffee wasn't hot enough (only 140 degrees). They said it should be 160-170 degrees, and I must have gotten one with a bad thermostat. Stood in Christmas exchange lines and got a new one. What a coincidence...this one also brews at 140 degrees. I then e-mailed Black & Decker, and they said it was designed to brew at 175 degrees, and it appeared that I had received TWO defective units. After reading the other reviews on this website, it appears there are an awful lot of defective units that are being sold in the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time With This One","review":"I just got this thing home and ran the first brew as the instructions recommended and it leaked water all over the counter. I thought that maybe I wasn't putting the unit together correctly but it leaked in 3 out of 4 tries! So, the convenience of Pod coffee is seriously compromised if you have to clean the counter after each brew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept ... poor performance!","review":"I bought the Home Cafe about 2 months ago. For the first two weeks, it performed flawlessly ... great coffee ... fast ... easy to clean! After that I noticed that the brewing cycles on all three settings would periodically deliver 1/2 to 1/3 to the serving size. I followed the manufacturers recommendations for descaling the unit using a combination of vinegar and distilled water. That improved functionality for three days and then the same problem returned. I cleaned the unit two more times ... each time without any improvement. The manufacturer has NOT been responsive in attempting to resolve the problem. I'm now looking for an alternative machine. When it comes to the Black and Decker Home Cafe unit, wait until they come out with a new and improved design, because this one doesn't pass the test of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought two. Both burned out after less than two weeks.","review":"This has got to be a defective design. It often feels like you are going to break the handle to get it locked. Both of the units I bought worked fine for short period of time and them literly burned themselves out. They started smoking and them would not work afterward. Too bad, it makes very good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work!","review":"Even after reading all the negative reviews, I decided to purchase the unit hoping I wouldn't have the same problems. Well I didn't have the same problem (at least I didn't find one similar to my own). I prepped the unit as the directions described however my machine made a horrible noise. I don't know what it was doing but it was making a buzzing noise that was really loud but continued to pour water into my mug. After the cycle finished I tried the unit with a coffee pod. Nothing. Nothing happens. I've unplugged the unit and replugged it in. I have removed and reinserted the water container. I have unlocked and relocked the pod unit. When I press any of the buttons, nothing happens. It's like it's dead. I called their customer service number and he basically told me to do everything I've already tried. So I guess I will be returning it today and will give it another try. If I have issues with that one I'll just get my money back and wait until a new and improved unit comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for instant hot water","review":"As a coffeemaker it is pretty disappointing but it could be that it's the pods. The coffee is weak and tastes like instant coffee. We have actually used it more as an instant hot water dispenser for tea and hot chocolate.The construction worries me. Every time I lock the lever in place I think it's going to break because the plastic is pretty flimsy. I don't see it lasting too long with regular use. It also very loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed, feels cheap","review":"I only give this coffee machine 1 star because it is able to do as advertised - make one cup of coffee. However it does this badly. Here's my list of \\"cons\\", in no particular order:1) Feels cheap - too much plastic and moveable parts that feel like they will break if dropped, and that's bound to happen.2) It's loud - I got this to replaced my old method of boiling water and using Folgers singles coffee bags. That method was WAY quieter than this!3) The \\"pod\\" system - what? why? It does not make the process any easier.4) Coffee taste - My old method tasted much better. I am not sure why because it's still Folger's, but even at the 7 oz. setting, the coffee tastes watery. (#1 reason NOT to buy this!!)5) Coffee not hot enough!!!With so many choices, look for one with better reviews, and pay for the one you actually want. Don't settle. For coffee lovers, our java is nectar of the gods!!! Unless you like really bad coffee, stay away from this inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Mine worked really well for about 6 months. One day it started spewing hot water all over the place. That was the end of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks!!!!","review":"Yes, like may other customers my machine also leaked. It seems it's a design flaw. They used just plastic for areas of high pressure. It also splash coffee out of the cup, you has to clean the machine after every use ( I had a white one). Finally, the cofee is not hot. I like my coffee hot!.I changed my machine. I got a Keurig single cofee maker. works GREAT!!!. It's expensive, but you dont have problems making real good coffee, no splashing and a BIG!! variety of coffee and tea flavors."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},M={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-8d110a11"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/41.md","filePath":"glossary/41.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/41.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
