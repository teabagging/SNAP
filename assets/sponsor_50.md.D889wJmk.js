The majority of the integrated circuits fabricated nowadays are based on the MOS transistor (CMOS Integrated Circuits). This device has evolved enormously in the 40 years of its existence, now measuring a few hundred nanometers, thus making the integration of very complex electronic systems possible. This book is written by three scientists who have devoted their life to the study of the MOSFET.

But what is presented as a marvelous \\"new\\" method of healing one's body has some inherent problems not noted in this book: chelation will eliminate not only those minerals that are causing trouble but also all the others as well! You are then faced with replacing the lost minerals in some way without causing even further difficulties. That may sound fairly simple, but in fact it is not. That is the primary reason for going slowly rather than hitting your body with all the stops out.I do thoroughly recommend using chelation in those cases where it is clearly necessary, but again, go slowly and remember that replacement is absolutely required.

A well-written and courageous review of the hottest and most contested TV network on earth, this book leaves no stone unturned. I commend the authors particularly for their critique of the \\"Clash of Civilization\\" which seems to have taken over all our debates on the Middle East.

I read the book and applied its theories and techniques only to be disappointed in the end when it does not remove homosexual desires it only gives advice on repressing and hideing those desires for other people's sake. All those desires and feelings are still there. It did not create an attraction to women, or remove or reduce my attraction to men. The author even states this at the end that you will be struggling to fight your homosexual attraction for the rest of your life. It is not a \\"cure\\" only advice on hideing your thoughts and feelings so other people won't be offended by your existence. It is not a cure at all, so don't buy it if that is what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for self loathing","review":"Arguments about homosexuality being 'unnatural' are rubbish. It occurs across all human societies, and throughout the animal kingdom. Read Bruce Bagemihl's book 'Biological Exuberance' for more info on homosexuality and transgenderism, also transexuality, in the wild. As well as a thought provoking discussion as to why it is so poorly recorded by so many scientists. Joan Roughgardens excellent book 'Evolutions Rainbow' looks at trans behaviour in human societies and nature.But 'The battle for Normality' was given to a friend of mine at the age of 17 by his parents, and it gave him years of hell. He's over it now, and happy with his (non straight) sexuality. It should be a crime to give someone such a hard time because their sexuality isn't what you want it to be. If you don't like gay sex, then don't have gay sex. Just don't tell other people what they can and cannot do with another consenting adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaging Literature","review":"This book is a perfect example of the antiquated ideals of Freud. We no longer live in a repressive, 19th century culture where gender is prescribed into the social role one must play. This book is incredibly damaging when it comes to viewing \\"homosexuality\\" as a disorder.The main diagnosis of homosexuality as a \\"neurotic disorder\\" is itself flawed. Neurosis is a medical diagnosis that has fallen out of the medical lexicon because it is vague, often baseless and almost impossible to support scientifically. This book is largely filled with empty, pseudo-Christian rhetorical doctrine that is unfortunately self-reinforcing. I can't wait until this falls out of publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Information that Unhappy Gays will want to know.","review":"This book provides real practical help to those who are unhappy with their homosexual desires. The first part is the theory of homosexuality (which boils down to the fact that it is a neurosis involving a gender inferiority complex, coupled with a strong tendency to self-pity), the second gives many practical suggestions about how to overcome unwanted homosexual impulses. A reader whose conscience tells him that homosexuality is not for him will find moral support and help, rather than simply being told that he has to accept himself the way he is and there is nothing he can do about it. It is written for Christians and certain references to spiritual matters might irritate some readers. Doubtless this book will have its critics, but the suggestions it gives work. This reader knows from experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Content...","review":"This book was thorough in its content. In addition, the author is a psychologist. He has done serious studies. He presented secondary studies that were all common to the homosexual role(s).However, this book may start off offensive and/or appear homophobic. The writer has strong beliefs and presents a dominant writing style. Moreover, he illustrates possible causes and effects with great content from real homosexual persons whom identify with the homosexual lifestyle. He strongly suggests the lifestyle is not genetic, birth defect or a mental disorder. He suggests that it is a learned behavior. He also suggests that one could reverse un-normality thoughts concerning their sexuality.This is a \\"must read book\\" for researchers. It was very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a collossally destructive, myopic, and inhumane","review":"Two things this books seems to overlook: First, homosexuality is genetic and biological in origin. Second, there's nothing actually wrong with homosexuals. From a religious perspective, note that most mainline churches are now increasingly accepting of homosexuals, including Congregational, Anglican, Lutheran, among others. So if you are encountering religious difficulties with homosexuality: change your denomination.

If you read books like this and follow their advice, your life will be monstrously painful and in all likelihood you'll contemplate suicide more than you ever have. It's easy, isn't it, to want to be \\"normal,\\" i.e. to be straight. But if you're gay, you just can't be. You'll be happier in the long run to stay clear of this kind of garbage--take it from the voice of experience. Other people who reviewed this book have noted \\"Outing Yourself\\" as a good resource--buy that book and start there, instead. There is no reason why you can't have a fulfilling, meaningful life as an out gay person--and religion can be a part of that, too, if need be.

Therefore it is especially sad that someone who has a \\"Ph.D.\\" in his title is hiding his true religious prejudice before a mask of science. There is no cure for it, because it is not a disorder - any Christian who personally knows gays or lesbians AND uses his brain to think about it recognizes that. Please don't buy this book ! It is a threat to young gay people who are still unsure about their own being homosexual. By the way: To be gay and to believe in God is no contradiction. I live with it very well and thousands of other gays too - just think of all the homosexual priests ! Jesus is fun, but love, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"The book is too oriented to domestic US soils, and the aproach is superficial and over-simplified.

There hasn't been anything like the first Moonlighting series--and I don't think there ever will be again. Bruce Willis is just perfect as David Addison and he and Cybill (no matter what was going on behind the scenes) are perfection together. I remember waiting and waiting for them to just kiss already! The dialog just doesn't get any better than this either. Watching 15 min of this show is like digesting 60 minutes of standard fare. The give and take and the screw-ball antics are done to perfect timing. Agnes DePesto as the secretary is a treasure; no other side-kick like this gal! I can't recommend this DVD set enough.On a more fun note, the styles are pure '80's and I remember actually buying wine coolers just because Willis was in the commercials. THAT'S how much I loved this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the closed captions?","review":"I am hard of hearing, so I like to have subtitles or closed captions on when I watch DVDs. On the Moonlighting box, the CC label is shown, so I bought the set and tried to find the menu screen for captions on or off, and I found that there isn't any such menu screen. Needless to say, I was disappointed. When I started playing the DVD, no closed captions are shown. I wouldnt have bought the DVD set if I knew closed-captions weren't included. I don't understand why the creators of the set labeled it as CC enabled. Unless there is a different area of the DVD needed to go to to put the captions on, but I sure can't find it.

Moonlighting became famous for that, as well as other bizarre but interesting and amusing behaviors from the leads and the agency staff.At its worst, in the last couple of seasons, Moonlighting became brooding and somewhat depressing. Of course, as with many shows like this, the never released sexual tension between the male and female leads (David and Maddie) was what drove the show. The show \\"Jumped the Shark\\" at the same time the writers made the mistake of letting David jump Maddie. It was all downhill from there.But the first seasons were glorious and inventive, some of the best TV series entertainment ever.Gobble them up when you have the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time has not been kind to this show.","review":"A wonderful show in the 1980's is not as funny in 2005.

She is what makes this work--for me, at least. Mr. Willis isn't bad (pardon the litotes), but the writers made him just a bit too smart-mouthed with the wisecracks. That wasn't the actor's fault.The stories are full of action, which sometimes or often takes the place of genuine drama. Unfortunately, moviemakers frequently do this, and perhaps that is what many viewers want. Real drama takes place behind the eyes and countenance of good actors, not in gun duels or fistfights.

Originally during that scene, the music being played is \\"The William Tell Overture\\" ( otherwise known as the Hopalong Cassidy theme ). Perfectly timed, the scene was hilarious. They had some other music playing and I know it sounds stupid, but it wasn't as funny. I watched the episode I had taped on VHS and what a difference. I cannot understand why they felt the need to tamper with perfection.The rest of the DVD is good. I didn't care for the disc holders, they are kind of cheap looking, and the discs are not clearly marked. You need a magnifying glass to read them. The extras are great and of course the episodes are wonderful. I will forgive them there errors, the show is as funny as ever.

It also has a safety to prevent accidental discharge. I have read some reviews that stated there was no safety on the rifle. This is a Chinese made pellet rifle. It is a bit tight loading a pellet into the breach, if you have large hands. A company called American Camper is attaching their name to it even though the rifle is produced in China.

I own another high power rifle which I paid over 5 times the price of this one, and find myself reaching for this one 90% of the time.

Very detailed materials that help the reader understand how to see the parts of the bird beyond quick impressions in order to make identifications. But I also gained a new insight into an animal that I took for granted just seeing every day. Sibley is an incredible artist and liberally demonstrates his concepts with sketches and drawings of a wide variety of birds.

A thoroughly enjoyabe read -- I highly recommend this book to anyone with an imagination and a good sense of humor.The book is delightfully droll ( the touch of British and perhaps Asian Indian irony are very evident) and the pages turn aas quicly as if you were viewing a film....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out interesting then turns disgusting","review":"I am not one who can't handle any sort of violence or sexual deviance.

Finally, I thought I had, but it was only a spider crawling across the page. I could not finish this book. The character development was well done for finding the evil within. However, there was no balance in the characters, no one who steps outside of their own needs and desires. Accepting that there are many persons who surpress any twinges of conscience which gives rise to the discomfort of doing evil for completely hedonistic reasons, there was no balance of those persons who had any but the most selfish motivations.

His first adventure is a truly tedious period in a minor political squabble. A great deal of this is devoted to sending up the ruling English class, all or which has been done better in a few hundred places, both in literature and on film.I haven't read anything lately that's been as big a waste of time and money as The Impressionist was."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about sex than identity","review":"I found the parts of the book about the flexbility of identity and race interesting. The boy liquidly moves through the novel adapting to new classes, races and environments. He demonstrates the poignant struggle to be oneself and part of one's culture and the simultaneous desire to be \\"other\\". However, this book/narrator/author is fixated on sex. The boy's life seems to revolve around sex more than the aforementioned issues, and the discussions about sex have absolutely no reason to be in the novel. In fact, it draws away from the momentum. There are parts where the narrator is describing a person in an insightful and interesting way, but then throws in a comment about the man's \\"pulsating bulge\\" or something equally ridiculous. I don't have problems with sexuality or sexual novels, but it had absolutely no point in this book and drew away from the central issues of class and race. And you'll notice to book is heavily discounted... Hm..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"Can't remember when I have been so captivated by a novel. The reviewers who complain that the main character hasn't much depth are right--but they don't really get that this is the whole point. Kunzru is making a comment on the flexibility of identity. Pran's initial identity is a lie (although he doesn't know it), subsequent identities are forced upon him by necessity and others' needs and expectations, and he eventually learns that he can manipulate his own identity to his advantage. An absolutely stunning, yet playful, story that demonstrates the ways in which we perceive ourselves and others and how we shape personal and cultural values.

Willie is one of the foremost singer/songwriters and blues guitarists of our time. This album is a nice collection of rather relaxing, mellow blues but is somewhat poorly produced. Willie has always shined and his masterful guitar playing has long gone unappreciated. If you like Willie's style, and some good mellow blues, then get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willie plays blues with a twinkle in his eye","review":"This album not only sounds good, it feels good. The mood is one of easy contentment, with the songs sounding well-traveled and the lyrics, while true Blues, having just enough humor for a fun, upbeat listen. The solo guitar and keyboard work, of which there's plenty here to savor, is mature and satisfying. Not one note of it sounded like less than the real Blues thing and I'll be keeping this album and listening to it a lot.I'd really rather give it 4 1/2 stars if I could though, because of the inclusion of Susan Tedeschi, who sounds positively amateurish alternating verses with Willie on \\"Crazy.\\" (Of course, I really don't like her singing, so if you do, discount that last point.) A couple of the other guests could maybe have had a little more than one verse to sing too. But B.B.

It completely blasts the conventional (low fat, high carb) lifestyle that we have been taught is so \\"healthy\\" - when, infact it may be what is causing us to be so fat, so diabetic and so riddled with heart disease.One of the authors, Wolfgang Lutz, is a German Doctor who shares his 40+ years of treating more that 10,000 patients with a low carb high protein high fat diet.A technical book as well as a \\"diet\\" book - not just to lose weight, but how low carb/high protein eating just might be able to prevent and possibly cure heart disease, diabetes and digestive troubles.I know I will LIVE LONGER AND HEALTHIER for having read this book!Update: 10/9/2003: Since reading this book, I have followed the tenents, and: 1) Lost 52 lbs 2) My blood sugar has returned to normal.I feel better, eat well, am never hungry - and still believe I will live longer because of this book.Buy - read - learn - live LONGER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Late Than Never","review":"When I read what Allen And Lutz had to say I was stunned.

Intrigued, I got Atkins, and then I read Perricone's book, and then the clincher, Eat 4 Your Type by D'Adamo.Of all of them, Life without Bread is the clearest, the best science, and the most forthright.

Unless you have an affinity for the sciences you may end up completely lost and in a fog. If you want to know in depth the science behind low carbing this is it. No doubt about it. However I will have to read the book probably 3 more times to \\"get it\\". If you want to know more than a little bit but not as much as God himself then I recommend instead going with Protein Power or Carbohydrate Addicts or even Atkins. All those books explain the same thing. Not in as much detail but unless you have a degree in chemistry you may not even understand what these authors are talking about.

However, in this book the authors make conclusionary remarks without really any significant analysis. They will cite a study and then come up with a conclusion without really describing the details of the study or how and why they reached the conclusion that they did. Many places, their proof will be \\"as already proven in this book.\\" Maybe they did this to make the book simple to read, but after reading the book BAD CALORIES AND GOOD CALORIES the book appears simplistic and hollow. They talk about all the diseases that are controlled by reducing carbohydrates and by extension insulin.

Anyway, all of this is to point out not only do I have a girlfriend(!) but this book is great if you're into politics and also have a sense of humor. I'm glad to see there are others here who liked it.

The judge it by what is funny in todays politically correct time is to due it a great injustice. Rickles has always been great and this shows him at his prime. The humor is a little insensitive but perhaps we as an audience have just become too sensitive. Judge it as a record of it's time and not as Rickles today.

Now after having listened to it, I can't wait to sell it as fast as I can.Most of the humour is hopelessly dated--it's funny but not up to Don's usual standards, and only the die-hardest die-hard could possibly love this album. If I were to rate the comedian, he'd get beyond five stars (if only that were possible), but this album sure wouldn't.He picks up steam near the end, but not enough to save the entire performance. Which, I might add, is thrown onto one track--something he could get away with (a la \\"Live From Hell\\") if the material was up to snuff, but it truly isn't.Sorry Don...

Times have changed, of course, but besides the political incorrectness - picking on \\"the Mexican\\" and \\"the queer\\" in the audience - (very weak, unfunny jibes )- it just isn't good Don Rickles. I agree with someone else's comment that there must be much better Rickles material than this, available in the vaults. I have now heard this CD, and have just thrown it in the trash.

A little crude at times but not significantly so considering these times. And he ribs just about everyone in the audience who respond in good humor regardess of religous or ethnic background.

This makes the non-fiction book read somewhat like a good adventure novel, and I found it to be pretty exciting. There is a lot more to it than tales of adventure though. The author makes observations on politics and medicine that, while you may or may not agree with, will probably make you do a little bit of critical thinking. Any book that can do all that, is in my opinion worth reading.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Rogue","review":"As I read this book my husband kept asking, \\"What's so funny?\\". I did laugh out loud quite a bit during this book. I liked that James knew Georgina's secret from the start. It gave an opening for some funny scenes. I wouldn't say that this book was very romantic. The dialogue was witty but the hero and heroine's thoughts never really turned to romance. Mostly just lust. The Anderson family seemed to resemble the Malory's a little too much. All the skirmishes and arguing felt a little repetitive. This was a very cute book. The Malory books just keep getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous! Must read for Marlory lovers","review":"The 1st Malory book I read was Love Only Once. I got hooked on the Malorys! They were so funny and entertaining. I read every Malory book I could get, but I couldn't find Gentle Rogue. So I bought it and it was worth it. George and James were funny together especially in the beginning where George is in a little \\"disguise\\". You just have to read it to know what I'm talking about. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked this one","review":"James is not a typical Malory hero. Ok, he is handsome etc, but he is a man that made his own way in life. And Georgina is not a typical Malory heroine. She is American - and all that it brings with it. The way they are together is a joy to read. I really liked them both. And the story was swift-paced and entertaining. Well, the one thing the Malory brothers (and the heroes of this series in general) really should learn is that not everything can be solved by beating someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Gentleman Pirate","review":"This is my favorite of the Malory Series. Johanna Lindsey creates romance between the handsome Englishman James Malory and the beautiful American Georgina Anderson. Not only is James Malory a \\"gentleman pirate\\" but he is also a \\"connoiseur of women.\\" Georgina has no intention of falling for the reprehensible rake, but she can't resist his bold, sultry advances. The plot takes the reader to England, the Caribbean and the New England shores. It is full of interesting characters, witty banter and steamy scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerogie has a lot of brothers...so does James","review":"I enjoyed this book. This book follows the typical romance formula, and you romance readers know what I mean. But it was enjoyable to read of a female character that was strong and resourceful. Yes, she did live in a time where she was subservient to the males in her life, but she also managed to stand up to them when it was important to her. The book is part of a series, though I don't know much about the others. But I enjoyed reading about the family members, They had enough personality that I plan to read more of this author in hopes of getting to know Georgie's brothers a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love it--\\"You may depend on it\\"","review":"There are no words to praise this book highly enough. If you're thinking about buying it, just let me point out that EVERY reviewer on this page has given this book 5 stars. James Malory is not only gorgeous and sensual, but the funniest character ever. And Georgina Anderson has so much spunk and fire without being annoying. I have read this book countless times, and it is funnier every time I read it. My favorite scene? When Georgie calls James \\"a member of the mule family, a brainless ox, and a brick wall\\" to his crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book of great love","review":"i love this book. this is only my fifth book i have read by JL and i love this the best. in all the other books i read by her, the woman are kidnapped and either rapped or drugged into sleeping with man (by chance, im sure all her books arent like that, as this just proved) and i loved it. i never read a malory novel but i am planning to read it after this novel. my favorite part is when they are in the cabin the first time on the way to the west indies. it took awhile to get the plot, but it made it a more interesting book. i thought her brother warren anderson was alittle too controlling, but her other brothers were absolutly adorable. i highly recommed this book. the love between james and \\"george\\" is up thier with romoe and juliette. i don't know how Jl does it, making such adorable, charming people, but she is truly a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOSH!!","review":"Okay, i am not a kid but i dont want a account but i had to rate this book.I have read alot of johanna lindsey's books and i thought they were really good, when i bought this one i was really excited and then i read it.

The first few r brill"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!!!!!","review":"I can't say enough about this book! I completely fell in love with James (who wouldn't?). I have never laughed so much while reading a book. I think I have read it at least 50 times! Two of my favorite scenes is when Tony finds out that James and George are married and when they are having breakfast with Tony and his wife. Also, any scene with James and Tony going at it with each other is guaranteed to be hilarious!!! I loved the relationship Johanna Lindsey created between those two Malory men. I definitely recommend this book to everyone!!! If you haven't read it yet, you don't know what you are missing. I also loved all of the other Malory novels, but this one is the best. I CANNOT wait until Jeremy has his own story!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Couldn't put it down! GENTLE ROGUE is definitely one of the best romance novels that I've ever read! It's fantastic. I absolutely love James and Georgie. They are such endearing characters. Their passion and humor is a wonderful mix. The story contains fast-paced action, engaging characters, witty dialogue, but most of all, excellent romance! Love scenes are erotic and tastefully done. There are plenty of memorable moments here (e.g., the bathing scene and risque bedtime story!! What a hoot!). The repartee between James and his 'George' is hilarious. This is such a fun and entertaining read. Although I've read few other Lindsey novels, I believe most don't compare to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The third book in the series was not a disappointment.","review":"I like how this book is set up by the one before it and the one after it. I have to admit that my favorite character in the book was Thomas Anderson- he's a laugh a minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really mislead by previous reviews on this story","review":"I've read all of Kathleen Woodiwiss' books and most of Rosemary Rogers' books. Johanna Lindsey is about 2 levels below these two authors as far as originality, adventure and steammy, sexy love scenes. I did laugh out loud during the cabin bath scene, but that was about it. James was an English aristocratic snob along with the rest of his family of whom I found hard to warm to. Georgina was predictable along with all of her brothers. The ending was a complete let down. It really didn't make much sense and seemed like the author's time was up and had to deliver to the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there no end to these Malory brothers?","review":"I HATE the Malory family books. All the brothers are all so arrogant and rude! I have nothing against Lindsey; usually her books are very entertaining and sharp. In this book the hero treats the heroine like she's a common tramp! He wants her as his mistress but not his wife; when she leaves him he follows her home and announces to her entire family that she slept with him! Of all the nerve! I certainly hope we've seen the last of the Malory family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT.. LOVE THE MALLORY\\"S, NEED MORE OF THE MALLORY\\"S","review":"Iloved this book.I love the Mallory s. We need to have more books about the Mallory s. This book was exciting, and funny ,and it feels as if your right there with the people in the book. I'll keep reading any books about tthe Mallory s. MORE..MORE .. MORE... This is the best series of books I have ever read. JOHANNA YOU GO GIRL!!!!!!! All of Lindsey s books are great ,but you feel you know this whole family as if you were in the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Case of TSTL","review":"I do love sea faring historicals so I thought this one would be for me. It wasn't. I can forgive a lot when reading historical romance, but the prose has to be adequate and the dialog should sound like dialog and not just awkward.The prose and dialog are terrible here and don't get me started on the execrable Scottish phonetic dialog. But my real issues are with the characters. All the men are immature babies with 2mm fuses that send them into tantrums. The heroine? Georgina? IS TOO STUPID TO LIVE. If she were a real person natural selection would weed her right out of the gene pool before you could say Watson and Crick.This is book is badly written, badly plotted, and contains characters I'd like to drown. But if you're looking for something that's so terrible it's almost hilarious? Try this. You can make a drinking game out every time the Hero calls someone \\"Dear boy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love James!","review":"This is my favourite of the Malory novels. It shows the characters with all their flaws but you'll love them regardless. It also subtly introduces us to the lovers in the next story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love James!","review":"And I've re-read this book several times over the years--which is quite unusual for me!

Forced to find her way back home to America any way she can, Georginia Anderson disguises herself as a cabin boy. But her strong personality and wit can't be contained in this submissive roll for long! When the captain discovers the ruse, he decides to teach her a lesson, but it soon becomes one that he will never forget! Things really become complicated when Georginia's five older and protective brothers become involed. Great dialogue and wonderful characters that jump off the page. You simply must read this book, the third about the Mallory clan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook not so good","review":"Actual reading was better than the audio version.

I misplaced the one I was using, (gave the others away I bought and didn't like) so decided to read the reviews here on Amazon before buying something else. Based on those reviews, I bought this brush. I was amazed at the hair and knots it took out on the first brushing, and the best part is my dogs seem to like it. That's the major selling point for me.

I'm not too sure why it was listed under her, but she is the reason I bought this album. Most of the songs are a bit mainstream, but this is an over all good mix of style, with a good message behind it. I personally have a liking to female vocals, and Kristian Hersh and the Waterlillys fill that hole well. Doubleplusgood is very interesting, and it took a while, but I've really gotten into their fun style.

But.......I purchased this to just leave in the car to use during an emergency. Today I had to use it:The bad things about it is that the attachment that goes on the tire is hard to get off and on.

It works so well, I bought another for my second vehicle and gave one to my brother in-law for Christmas. Slime has improved the air gauge on my latest purchases too, albeit none of the gauges are calibrated correctly. They're only off by 2-4 pounds though, so nothing major there.

It's compact size can fit below my trunk's floor, in the spare tire compartment. It is good for keeping the car's tires properly inflated (adding a few psi each time). I would imagine it is not for heavy duty use since it needed to cool down after 8 minutes of continuous use. The only think I would like to see is that it has a longer cord. It is okay for my compact car, connecting the power from the center console's plug and reaching to the four tires, but I would think the cord length would be a problem for SUVs or larger cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"The meter is not accurate!When you double check the pressure, you'll find the pressure is different from the one that you just finished inflating.Though it is cheap, the inflator without accuracy is still useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew up my Car DC Adapter","review":"I bought this air compressor thinking that it would save me money and time when I need to fill up air in my cars.

Car or SUV tires were done after 5 - 8 minutes, although it was a little tricky to keep flat and stable b/c the hose was not that long, but it was fine. Never tried the ball nozzles. Used it 9x and the inflation feature just stopped after filling one mountain bike tire. the light still worked though, so i know it's compressor related. for the cost, it inflated well, but it's not acceptable to not last even a dozen fills. 1.50 in quarters is enough for 4 car tires and 1-2 bike tires.

I'd skip it if I were you... don't even start the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book waas kick-arse!","review":"coming from the mouth of a true elminster af shadowdale fan, i believe that this was maybe a bit below the average that the other books have set, i still think it was awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS BOOK WAS SO-SO AT BEST","review":"I'VE READ THE OTHER ELMINSTER BOOKS AND THOUGHT THEY WERE A PRETTY GOOD READ. THIS LATEST ONE HOWEVER, WAS VERY CONFUSING AT TIMES. ELMINSTER SEEMED ONLY A SHADE TO BE SPOTTED HERE AND THERE, THE VILLANS IN MY OPINION SEEMED COMPLIMENTARY. THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES OF THE STORY WERE NOT CLEARLY EXPLAINED. THE PASSAGE OF TIME OF THE STORY WAS ALSO CONFUSING. THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AND IT LEAVES ONE ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF YA GOTTA KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO ELMINSTER IN HIS PRE-SHADOWDALE DAYS BY ALL MEANS READ THIS BOOK,BUT.....

Mr. Greenwood's first two Elminster novels were excellent but in this last book I felt as if the story was very confused. While the other books had an interesting plot this last novel seemed to be about a cast of characters just thrown in with witty dialogue. I had the impression that Mr. Greenwood wanted to show off many aspects of the Forgotten Realms through Elminster's eyes but it gave the effect of a tour rather than a coherent story. I certainly hope that Mr. Greenwood will write another Elminster novel but return to the same magic he used to write the 1st two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"If you're a 50 something looking for a great book to curl up with - try this one.

Great summer (or winter) read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk read","review":"Marton's effort doesn't rate as very good journalism or gossip. No historian, and not much of a pseudo intellectual, Marton offers simply a round up of some Presidential marriages without particularly keen psychological insights other than the fact that either one or other ( in the case of the Clintons, both) partners is hung up on the quest for power, and what that obsession means for the marriage. Marton should know, since she's the former wife of ABC anchor Peter Jennings and currently Richard Holbrook, what it's like to stand subordinate to a bigger presence and the subject of this book - as well as the shallow depth of the analysis and lack of original reporting - certainly (albeit poorly) reflects on her own life experience. Save for the paperback, this is definitely summer beach reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOSSIP--NOTHING BUT GOSSIP","review":"Hidden Power is a misnomer. I mean after all if the power, or the subject of the book, was really hidden how was the author able to write about it?? The book is a tease and much of the information has been reported before in various tabliods. For example, the closenest of the Carters and the isolation of Richard Nixon is old hat, so when I was reading it I fealt as if I were listening to a broken record. There is an old saying: \\"Where is the beef?\\", but with this book I have to ask: \\"Where is the new?\\". Answer: I can't tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Bible - Lousy Leather","review":"Excellent bible and print.ConsThe leather binding quality is highly questionable.

I decided to get this Large Print edition, and have found that the larger type really makes a difference. I must admit that I do miss having the words of Christ in red, and noticed that they didn't include the actual Hebrew letters to mark off the paragraphs in Psalm 119, but neither of these features was a deal-breaker for me. I'll be curious to see how the book itself holds up over time, since it was printed (and I would assume bound together) in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for my 2nd NASB","review":"Having read other reviews regarding this particular edition, I was a little concerned that it might be too hefty, but was pleasantly surprised. No, it isn't a mini-Bible, but it's very useable, feels good in the hand, exactly the type size I wanted, and with a surprisingly better concordance. Margins adequate for making (small) notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but doesn't survive shipping","review":"Hobbytron sent us one broken truck, then a replacement which was also broken.

But I expected better welding and at least a clean part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average information, not very good recipes","review":"The information in this book is OK for the beginner, but out of date, and the recipes are not very good. Many call for the use of several cups of corn sugar in the fermentation and nowhere near enough hops during the boil. The resulting beer tasted like alcoholic, carbonated syrup. You can get all of this beginner information for free on the internet. There are so many other good books out there on brewing that I would avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Round","review":"Hell's Kitchen Season 1 is a nice start to the show. It's not crazy but that allows the cast to grow on you. However there is a clear divide between chef's who have no hope, chef's who start fine but are on a sinking ship, and the chef's that demonstrate potential to stay in the game longer. But even that last group has strong/weak division. I enjoyed this season but it is slower then other seasons.For me it worked as I enjoyed this cast but for some it won't for many understandable reasons. I like this season but it's one of the lower seasons I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can't take the heat...","review":"I didn't know anything about this show until I started watching the current season (fifth or sixth, I think?) and got hooked. This first season is very good, not AS good, but very good. While the most recent season used people who are already chefs, this season used a few people who were professional chefs but most had other occupations. This kind of led me to believe that the pros would have an advantage but don't count on it. This season set is not censored, so if you watch it on TV with the kids be aware that nothing is bleeped out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell's Kitchen season 1","review":"This was a very good show and it arrived in good shape and on time.I was very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronnie Rocks","review":"a very good friend of mine turned me on to this album for which i am eternally grateful for, because this is without a doubt the best album of ronnie wood's spectacular solo career. with such standout tracks like \\"I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN\\" and \\"BREATHE ON ME\\" ronnie wood shows us how talented he actually is. but then with the the tracks \\"BIG BAYOU\\" and \\"SWEET BABY MINE\\" he turns a great album into a piece of rock n' roll heaven. you may have heard ronnie wood but \\"NOW LOOK\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"This is not a \\"dim copy\\" of anything. The movie might be in black and white, but its psychological analysis is expertly done with many shades of grey. One of the best winter movies ever.

Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DIM COPY OF AMERICAN NOIR MYSTERIES","review":"They got the look right. In fact, it's a explicit lift of the the film noir of the 40's and 50's.

The best!","review":"This CD is Kabah's best yet. In it the group shows a new level of maturity and growth in their music. It hasn't lost its dance style but is more mellow and downbeat than the rest. The six kids also show a new mellowness in their style. The hair color is still there, but the bright colors in their clothing are not as exaggerated. Still, this new CD promises to open new doors for Kabah and make them one of the best pop groups in Spanish music, and perhaps set a new trend and a new style in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo mejor que he oido!","review":"This CD is the best I have heard.

The reactions of the heroine are unbelievable, going against social mores of the time--she far too willingly goes to bed with a \\"pirate!\\" I also have an issue with her \\"best friend\\" being a slave who will be sold off. The most interesting parts of the novel were the references to the War of 1812, a part of American history that tends to be ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start, Great End... The Middle? Not So Much.","review":"The first chapter of this book had me captivated. The story really went down hill from there. Don't get me wrong, there were a few good parts, but the characters kept having the same conversations over and over again. The last few chapters were as good as the first, but everything leading up to that point just really weren't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Prize","review":"This is the worst piece of junk she's ever written and over the years, thestyle and quality of her books has deteriorated tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Definitely not the high standard of writing that you would expect from Brenda Joyce. The heroine Virginia was quit simpy ridiculous, whiny, and a doormat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I am a huge Brenda Joyce fan, and I've read everything she's published (including out-of-print novels), however, I was very disappointed in The Prize. The hero, Devlin, is great. I love alpha male heros. BUT, I hated, HATED the heroine, Virginia. She was a DOORMAT!!! This is a pet peeve of mine. I love Brenda's historicals, and was disappointed that this one was not up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Giant Step Backward","review":"Brenda Joyce seems very excited about returning to writing 'the kind of stories my fans love'. I'm very unexcited. This is a return to the bewildering cliche-ridden sex fests of her early works and a total abandonment of the emotionally compelling work she's been doing the Cahill series and her more recent books.As softcore it holds up but as a romance novel it's lacking. The racism of the heroine is period appropriate, but completely distasteful. (Her 'best' friend is being sold but for five months that doesn't worry her). The motivation of all characters is inexplicable and motivated by plot demands, not logic. The heroine is lacking the smallest amount of self respect, while the hero views women as something akin to Kleenex.I'm hoping this return to bodice ripping for the sake of same won't infect the Cahill novels, which have been my favorite series in some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Effort","review":"This book was poorly written, in every way. The spelling was atrocious, some sentences were so grammatically incorrect, it was more like something one would expect from a Jr. highschooler. So if you can get past that, you then have to contend with an often unbelieveable story. The male lead, Devlin, is a cold, heartless s.o.b. His female counterpart, Virginia(from Virginia)totally lacks for self-respect. The story was way too long. I had to make myself read the whole thing. The author just keeps rehashing the same old things page after page till I found myself skipping paragraphs. It almost seemed to me that the author was just trying to fill pages rather than write an interesting story. I was greatly disappointed in this book. It had such a promising premise, but she let the story get away from her. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway through and I don't think I'll finish","review":"Omigosh, what a boring disappointment. I've read other Brenda Joyce novels and bought \\"The Prize\\" based on past good experiences. But this book just plods along with repetitious dialog, unsympathetic characters and truly dull plotting.What we have is another tale of the girl hating the guy but wanting to have sex with him. The guy hates the girl too but wants to have sex with her as well. In my neighborhood we call that dysfunction, not romance.I'm halfway through the book and not much has happened other than they hate each other, they have sex, then they hate each other some more, they have sex again and then they think about it for four chapters before they start all over again.I don't think I can stick with this drivel. I think I'll re-read \\"A Lady at Last\\" (also by Brenda Joyce)a true romance novel with characters you can actually like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong female character turns into a wimp.","review":"I liked this book at first, because the main character, Virginia, was a strong spunky woman. Somewhere along the way she turns into a wimp, and starts taking tons of abuse from the man she loves. She is intent on \\"saving\\" him but it's hard to feel any support for her when she keeps taking his rotten behavior toward her. Not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed to go on FOREVER....","review":"This book was very tedious and several times I thought it should have ended! It almost seemed like Ms. Joyce had all these ideas from the time period and wanted to jampack them into one book! Also, the main character seemed spunky and a total tomboy (can shoot, survey fields, etc.), but once she's on the boat and in England, she's almost totally helpless once she puts on a dress. Also, after she runs away from the boarding school, it's never mentioned again? Seriously. Plus the boat rides across the Atlantic I'm sure took longer than how it was written. Half the time I was reading this book, I wanted to put it away because I was so bored and wanting it to progress! The beginning made it out to be somewhat interesting, but it never lived up to it. Ms. Joyce's other books are so much better. I wouldn't read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossed the book in the trash half way through","review":"From the description on the back of the book, I thought this might be an interesting read. I guess the saying dont judge a book by the description should come into play. The logic is missing. Here is a young women, kidnapped at sea, an innocent, and next thing you know she is all too willing to crawl into bed with the very man she vowed to hate. I have to be honest, I got half way through this book and tossed in the trash. It was that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuke Tales Rock","review":"Want to know what its like to be a Navy Nuclear Operator? Read this book! It details some very real seeming exploits from Westpac 2001 aboard the USS Carl Vinson and will tell you exactly what being a Nuke is all about. The screw jobs, the bad treatment, the thankless hours and hours spent toiling in the Machinery Room, and how much Nukes give up to do their job as opposed to otheer Naval PersonneL.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book..horrible editing","review":"This book is pretty accurate about life as a Nuke. Dead on about the working hours and crappy working conditions and constant long underways that kind of make you feel like a stranger in your own country. New Rock and Rap groups spring up while you're gone and unless your Home front is keeping you informed, you're out of the loop. And the stuff about the officers is true, too. More pay for less time on the ship that they stay, is how I like to put it.It's good. Just wish this guy had gotten it edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like someone needs to let go of some anger.","review":"While some of the accounts in this book are fairly accurate, some are greatly skewed. Having also been on the boat at this time, I can tell you that this is someone who is truly bitter toward alot of people. Only someone who knows that he is skewing events would not put his real name. So, if you want to read a book about the navy that should be classified as fiction, you would be better served going to your local recruiting station and asking them for some info. As for this 'book of actual events', don't bother. Rather ask someone who was actually there and had enough work to do that they didn't have time to write books."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Reading this book is like reading a 1st graders homework. His accounts of nuke life are extremely off base and his recolection of actual events in the MMR are extremely biased. This is a horrible book, which is just a reminder why this \\"author\\" was never successful in the US NAVY. Also, I \\"Dimkade\\" remember consoling this guy for over an hour more than once while he cried because he couldn't figure out how to fit in."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"It just didn't hold up to the excellent standard of music coming from Cross Movement Records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and readable advice.","review":"I read this book, followed the advice, and got published.

It focuses on the low-tech approach of mailing out queries and manuscripts - I suppose some people do it all online now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing late effort for this Fela fan","review":"TEACHER DON'T TEACH ME NONSENSE was released in 1986, a time when Fela Kuti's output was slowing considerably. Performed with his band Egypt 80, the album continues his Afrobeat style and love of long, slowly developing songs. We have only two tracks here, \\"Teacher Don't Teach Me Nonsense\\" and \\"Look and Laugh\\", each around 30 minutes long.Compared to the classic achievements of the 1970s and early 1980s, TEACHER DON'T TEACH ME NONSENSE feels like a minor effort. The production is far too smooth, and the pace lacks fire and is downright lethargic. Fela's vocals sound bored, and the songwriting of the track, another defense of African values, retreads old ground to much reduced effect. The strong horns and exotic drumming that were a staple of Afrobeat are largely absent here. The result strips Fela's music of that wild passion that he made his name with. If you want to start with Fela, better get ZOMBIE, J.J.D. or UNKNOWN SOLDIER."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great selection","review":"David Thomas Roberts is an outstanding ragtime piano player, but the best thing about this CD is the selection of rags.

Only the first half actually covers Guadalcanal. As such, the title is quite misleading. With respect to the Guadalcanal portion, much of the \\"footage\\" is actually taken from the documentary \\"With the Marines at Tarawa\\" and is clearly not Guadalcanal. The maps are very general in nature and little mention is made of the 6 sea battles surrounding Guadalcanal. (The DVD erroneously claims that there were 4 sea battles.) While the USMC did most of the fighting on Guadalcanal, the US Army also had a significant presence and almost no mention whatsoever is given.

I wouldn't want to use this as a daily supplement (and I have read that is not actually recommended) but for occasional use I can't dispute the results.Oct 3 2012 Edit: welp, I passed a pigment gallstone today.

A stent was placed at the location of the 5mm, so we did not expect the Stone Breaker to help very much on that side. So when she had a scan done, both were exactly the same size. So she will be having surgery to remove the larger of the two. At this point I do not know if both will be removed, I am praying that they do, or that the Stone Breaker has done its job and broke down at least the smaller one without the stent.That being said, I cannot give this product a high marking because as far as I know at this point, it has not done anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy","review":"The product did not do anything for my small kidney stone.

But there are gems here, like \\"10 Degrees and Getting Colder\\" and \\"Go My Way,\\" both of which have been covered by other artists; \\"Cotton Jenny,\\" a fan favorite at his live shows; and the strange but haunting \\"Cabaret,\\" which sounds like two songs that meld into one effortless whole. However, the record's narrative masterstroke is \\"Miguel,\\" which, without preaching or politicizing, encapsulates the terrible dilemma of an illegal alien who finds himself in trouble with the law. \\"Summer Side of Life\\" is the work of a mature and gifted songwriter, and if you are a Lightfoot fan and have never heard it, you are missing a small gem in your CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favourite Gordon Lightfoot Album","review":"Gordon Lightfoot does not write bad songs.

Just as oblivious as always, Steve Carell's character anchors the show as he did the last two.

There is little more annoying than getting half way through an episode that you are really into and having it freeze because the DVD is scratched. I realize in the grand scheme of things this is minor but I am not rich and cannot afford to replace these. Luckily I have Netflix so I can get this season on instant viewing but it doesn't have the extra's that I bought the DVD for. My recommendation if you buy these, put them into a DVD book and don't leave them in their original packaging. This goes for Season 2 and 3.

This Season, like Season Two keeps moving forward, with all the characters developing further. This Season has multiple classic episodes and some great new characters added into the mix of this near perfect comedy series.The only problem is, I didn't want it to end and have to wait another year for the next Season to be available.Along with My Name is Earl, The Office is flying the flag showing that American comedy is still No.1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Set","review":"If you are an office fan you will love all the extra deleted scenes.

I have Seasons 1, 2, 3 and have had \\"Office marathons,\\" watching successive episodes for several hours at a time.The funny thing is that at one time, I did work in an office which definitely qualified for zaniness of personnel.

And what comes next is definitely worth it.Although every episode of a comedy show does not necessarily have to be connected with previous episodes (this is not a soap), some things about the characters can only be understood if you paid careful attention to passages over the first two seasons. So if you are considering to follow the show from now on, the purchase of the first two seasons is recommended.

Otherwise, these small gems are doled out with his foremost creations, which are already in most collections, often in several versions.My delight here is that while I bought the 2 CD package for the Concierto Serenade, with its featured harp performance, I also got a handful of other small wonders. And, although I was in a sense coerced into paying for yet another reading of the Concierto de Aranjuez and Fantasia para un Gentilhombre, the extra cost was virtually nil...and these renderings were, in fact, among the premiere interpretations to be found.Overall, this is a wonderful package that I recommend without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concierto de Arajuez.","review":"No creo que haya mucho que decir sobre esta magnifica obra, quien ame la guitarra y en especial la guitarra clasica esta obligado a tener este Concierto en su coleccion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, relevant historical background","review":"This book is particularly fascinating for those of us living in Colorado.

Because I can't remove it I can only use it for dry goods and not wet foods.I love how powerful it is and how great a job it does grinding grains.

They're not that great.First, the 'stuff' does not retain heat for very long. These shoes are much better at warming up your feet than they are at keeping them warm.Second, you can't walk with these slippers on, because you will crush the 'stuff'.Third, if you do buy them, make sure you get the right size. If your feet are size 8 or bigger, get a large. If they're too small, you'll heat either your toes or your heel, but not both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Product never came.

After cutting with a paper trimmer, they were perfect size. Although after VERY careful and slow application, rolling on just a cm at a time, air bubbles would form. I tried rolling the protector on as slow as possible while rubbing from center out with a microfiber cloth. After application, and only rubbing the protector with microfiber, it was scratched past the point of no return. I cannot imagine what this screen protector would look like after a few days of use.Although this product may protect the screen, after a couple of days use you probably won't be able to see the screen with all the accumulated scratches. The users guide says for best results to replace monthly. After initial application I removed it and threw it away.Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"use on 2cameras and cell phone. The cutting is fairly straight forward, but the pre-cut edge that is supposed to help with seperating the backing from the protector is not cut well so i've wasted one sheet as it ripped easily while taking off the backing. material not durable at all.

You will find hard plastic covers to protect your screens but this is all you need. They are easily removable once they get old. They apply easily and completely protect the screen on any device. I even purchased large ones for my GPS in my car. The only negative is the size needs to be cut to fit perfectly.

This one is stiff, which would seem to make is tougher but somehow doesn't. In addition, it's more difficult, not less difficult, to position.

The most expensive ones are custom-cut for your device. But if you are willing to do the cutting yourself, you can get away very cheaply with these Fellowes WriteRight Universal Screen protectors. They work great and are the cheapest around. Nice and glossy/slippery on the outward side, nice adhesion on the inside, with a nice stiff feel that seems to ensure they will last for a long time on your device.

One pass with the pasteboard applicator and you have a full path of scratches.I managed to use a microcloth to put the next two protectors on but there is no way to get out all of the bubbles. The edges also will not stick down. These are brand new phones and I cleaned them very well.I would not recommend this cover to anyone. I have purchased many custom covers and never had so much trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"I purchased this item to use on my blackberry curve.

There was no room for our legs (they just hang out of the boat for 5 hours during our river trip). The divider in the middle of the boat was kinda nice, because I sat in the front and leaned my back on it, while my friend sat in the back, not knowing where to put his legs, because there was no room for them. It was kinda a funny, yet uncomfortable situation. I strongly suggest buying a BIGGER boat (maybe a 4-person) for two people.

Because it deals honestly with both the good and the bad in that history it will not appeal to those who have a particular axe to grind. It will not appeal to fundamentalist Protestants who want to demonize the Pope, nor will it appeal to modern obscurantist Roman Catholics who tend to gloss over significant historical details in their ongoing historical revisionism. La Due has done the Roman Catholic Church a favor by being honest with the historical evidence.In an irenic and scholarly manner, La Due examines the development of the papacy from the first century up to today. He places the Popes in their historical context and reveals how quite often the development of the papacy was more the result of political and economic factors than any theological or ecclesiastical concerns.An excellent piece of historical research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Papal follies","review":"This is a caricature of papal history, clearly tilted to fit the author's stange view that Vatican II overturned the traditional Catholic view of papal authority.

The doctor said he couldn't eat wheat, egg, peanuts, milk, and several other foods, but never gave me practical advice on how to cope with this new lifestyle. This book really helped us figure out how to start introducing new foods, and how to shop for acceptable foods in the grocery store. The best feature is that there is a separate chapter on all the common food allergies. Each chapter starts with a list of all items you could see on a food label that would be dangerous if you have that allergy. For example, the chapter on milk lists things like casein, ghee, hydrolysates as well as about two dozen other things milk-allergic people should avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better resources are available.","review":"I wasn't very happy with this book.

The stories are poor and the writing is woefully inadequate. The plots were flatter than a pancake.If the folks at the Warner Archives had any intention of resurrecting Warren William in a respectful way all they needed to do was a set with three strong entries that are representative of his work. Where are EMPLOYEES ENTRANCE, THE MATCH KING, UPPERWORLD and SKYSCRAPER SOULS?

The fourth edition of the Rough Guide (May 2003) is even less expensive! And where Lonely Planet usually wins, in color photographs and maps, the Rough Guide has at least caught up.

There is a dreariness throughout this album that is partly the result of the murky, echoey arrangements, but mostly the result of weak material. The remake of \\"The Circle Small\\" suggests that Lightfoot was in a songwriting drought, especially considering that this new version, when compared to the original, has nothing new to offer emotionally. The title track, despite being the best song on the album, conveys an almost unbearable feeling of paranoia, while songs like \\"Daylight Katy\\" and \\"Sweet Guinevere\\" merely sound flat. I suggest avoiding \\"Endless Wire\\" unless you already own all of Lightfoot's earlier albums and are in desperate need of something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Whining","review":"Seem cruel? Please do not take it in the harshest way. I would like to agree with a reviewer 'music fan from USA' and would like to point out 'in general' I am reviewing the remaining Lightfoot cd's with this review on each following cd. Lightfoot had struck such a thunderous stride on Summertime Dream and the ride all the way was just relentless, churning out such rich vivid landscapes, songs like 'Miguel' come to mind... and then there are albums like this. Passionless. Mixed with the hammiest recording fumblings imaginable. Vocals that seem monotone and obsolete, void of any longing. seem cruel? Well, that's how I feel. Sure there were some goodies. Shadows (3.5 stars) for instance was quite good, but even that suffered a tremendously passionless production. From Endless Wire on out Lightfoot has truly lost his way. These remaining cd's need something they never had, nuturing. Folk and music of this type cannot be manufactured on an assembly line and Endless Wire highlights that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"As I've said on other reviews of Gordon Lightfoot's work, I bought several CD's together in anticipation of seeing him in concert, wanting to familiarize myself with more of his work. The only other CD I'd owned had been \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\", so I have always associated him mostly as a ballad & folk singer. Listening to these several new purchases, I was surprised at the many different directions his music took. This one, however, was not my cup of tea. Very distinctly country, which is not my genre, I did not find it the pleasant listening experience I'd hoped for. With the exception of the first track, \\"Daylight Katy\\", which has a bit of a catchy tune, which I believe was the only song he did from this album in concert, I found the rest repetitive & way too country for my taste.

That's not, however, the reason why I'm giving it a bad rating. I agree with another reviewer here who wrote \\"the starch flows out from the cooker spoiling the cooking platform\\". This rice cooker made a mess every time we used it. I realized that if I leave the lid half open the starch wouldn't flood the platform, but I didn't like the way rice was being cooked with a half open lid.

But Kaminer's facts are irrelevant to her argument: what we need to know are the conditional probabilities of commiting violent crime while high on these three drugs (for all the evidence Kaminer cites, it could be that .001% of alcohol abusing events lead to violent crime vs 10% for cocaine and 50% for heroin, figures that would contradict her argument).This kind of superficial argument arises in several places and reduces the value of what could have been a much more interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal with little substance","review":"The books promises to be an examination of irrationalism in modern pop culture, but the book's subtitle, \\"The Perils of Piety,\\" give away its real agenda - attacking major religions.

Like virtually every single other so-called rationalist skeptic, the author fails to take a look at her own assumptions about the world and be skeptical of them. Rather, she dogmatically asserts her own world view as superior to everyone else's and then decides that because of this everyone else has been deceived and it's time to bring them to the light. (I need not even say what kind of self-righteous arrogance this requires on her part.) She's not a skeptic at all really. Rather, she is skeptical of some things and not skeptical of others. This is fine, but she should at least have enough respect to recognize that other views may have some validity. No. But, the worst part about this book is that it's utterly dull and boring.

I thought she would at least present both sides of the picture, but I found her to be very judgemental: in fact she smacks of one who is angry with unconventional experiences because she herself is wrestling with one;not unlike a gay-basher who is secretly gay. I am not saying she doesn't have a few points, however the book would have been more effective had she shown the tiniest interest in not making her subject matter appear not only foolish, but degrading.

It's awkward, baddly planned, and honestly, a MAJOR step back in the Hoyle Casino series. I had such high expectations for this game, and with it being months late from the \\"release date\\" I thought they would of worked out the bugs and the game play.. I was wrong. It's sad, I throughly liked this series, but will think twice before purchasing another title in this series. If you have the 2003/2004 version of Hoyle Casino, stick with it. This will be a major dissapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this garbage","review":"There is no question about it. This is the worst casino video game on the market. The reason stems from the change in ownership of the Hoyle Franchise from Sierra to Encore. Anyone who has ever bought an Encore Software casino game can testify to the fact that they are ALWAYS riddled with mathematical errors and unplayable bugs. This version is no different than anything Encore produced in the past. It is my understanding that Sierra began development of this game but Encore finished it. I bought it in the hopes that Sierra had put enough of their programming expertise into the game, but unfortunately, the game is trash. There are terrible unplayable bugs throughout the game and the game plays out in such poor quality. I tried to remedy the problem with the downloadable patch, but when that didn't work properly I uninstalled the game and threw it in the trash! Avoid this game and avoid all Encore casino products. Buy the versions of Hoyle under the name \\"Sierra\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it 0 stars","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLY WORTHLESS SOFTWARE. Nothing but problems with it. I just wasted my money. Good luck trying to get any assistance from their customer service. If you try and run this on a widescreen monitor, the cursor does not line up properly so you have to place your cursor off to the left and below of where you actually want it to press a button on the games. This makes some games totally unplayable and causes you to make errors on other games. The games are rather boring and the 3D effect really adds nothing to game play. This also looks and feels like something you would have played in the early 80's on your Atari. The players say and do repetitive things and after just a few minutes, you want to turn it off. This game is just outright dissapointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ENCORE GARBAGE AFTER SIERRA QUALITY","review":"A mess to try to install. Tried on 2 different computers.

I've used it to review for all three of the USMLE Step exams as well as the Internal Medicine Boards, and have found the book to be a quick, easy, helpful reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great No. 3; an Okay No. 2","review":"The performance of the Third Symphony on this disc and the First Symphony on the other are the better half of the Brahms symphonic cycle that George Szell recorded with the Cleveland Orchestra. To me, his approach to these works seems to be to treat them as extensions of the Classical period, ignoring the intervening years of the early Romantics such as Schumann -- there is structure and scaffolding, with emotions present but in a restrained and almost self-conscious manner. That works for me in the Nos. 1 and 2, a bit less in the No. 2 -- also on this release -- and even less so in the No. 4. Though my favorite Brahms symphonic set is Bernstein's on Sony, this rendition of the No. 3 is an excellent alternative for that particular work. Finely drawn, having weight but remaining agile, it in fact is arguably better than the Bernstein. With an okay performance of the No. 2 and a budget price, this album is recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best Work...But Still VERY Strong","review":"While this is not Julian's best album, it certainly does contain a couple of his best songs, \\"Don't Call Me Mark Chapman\\" and \\"Ain't But the One Way\\". Copey is starting to get cranky on this record and he's got a lot to venting to do. In a lot of ways Autogeddon is like his newer Citizen Cain'd release, Julian picks his targest and guns them down. The only problem that I have with Autogeddon is it's inconsistency. While I can appreciate songs like \\"STARCAR\\" and \\"Ain't No Gettin Round Getting Round\\" they don't quite fit in with the intensity of the other tracks.If you are new to Julian Cope's music I wouldn't start with Autogeddon. Try St Julian or Fried and then move into the more dangerous teritory. And be sure to bring your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I really like Julian Cope, both solo and with The Teardrop Explodes, but this is unlistenable. There is absolutely nothing to recommend it. The lyrics are frighteningly bad and frightening. The tunes and arrangements are unmemorable.

He apparently does not understand that the symbol he refers to is a single path labyrinth rather than a multipath maze. He misses much of the richness of this symbol and does not understand its potential as a profound spiritual tool. The use of the labyrinth can be very helpful as Christians prepare themselves spiritually during Lent. Sadly, this book does little to elucidate the use of the labyrinth in Lenten spiritual preparation. I would recommend Walking a Sacred Path by Rev. Lauren Artress as a much more useful book in the use of the labyrinth as a tool to support spiritual growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new set of eyes for Lent","review":"An inspiring positive approach to a daily lenten experience.

I have two small problems with it that take away the fifth star. Firstly, although it's generally a smooth recording, as with many Telarc jazz productions, it lacks definition in the treble range. For example, the drummer's cymbals are virtually inaudible. Secondly, Mr. Shearing succumbs to the temptation to sing (croak, really) on the last track, which causes the program to end funereally.My advice would be: Buy a copy. Turn up the treble. Program out the last tune. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Sour","review":"It seems off key in many places. Not what one wants in Christmasmusic.

I think this CD along with Head Hunters, Man Child, and Secrets is the best funk Herbie Hancock has to offer. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"First off, this is a great bargain, containing 3 previously-rare Hancock albums at one moderate price. My summary of each album hereon :Fat Albert Rotunda - an impressive progression from \\"Speak Like A Child\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\", with some great tracks and compositions on it.Mwandishi - starts with the brilliant, Miles-like \\"Ostinato\\" which anticipates the brilliant \\"Sextant\\" sound. The other tracks move towards a strange airy ambience not unlike the music later popularized as \\"ambient\\". It's interesting stuff and pretty moody.Crossings - The more difficult listening of the 3 records. Alternates between more airy, slightly haunting ambience and wilder fusion-styled playing.

Good grungy power pop with some of the raddest and most melodic soloing I've ever heard. One of the best guitar albums of the nineties, I'd venture to say. Aside from the incredible \\"Feel The Pain\\" and the slowed down \\"Out of Hand\\", nothing particularly stands out, but every song has a nice hook and is genius in its simplicity.

And why they added the new character Bumble Bee I have no clue, but it makes the show all the worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"....They actually publich trash.","review":"I'm sorry to all of you Teen Titans fans out there but Teen Titans is a terrible show. It lacks creativity. I Think it gives anime a bad name and I am ticked that whoever made this is trashing anime. Sorry, but this is not bad, do not get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good one to add to your collection","review":"This DVD contains the first five episodes of the Teen Titans TV show. There is no bonus footage and no added or deleted scenes. While I am not a big fan of those first five episodes, what swayed me into purchasing the DVD was the interview with Marv Wolfman and George Perez, the two individuals who created the Titans. I found it interesting to hear how they went about re-developing the comic, what goals they had for it, etc.If you are a fan of the Titans TV show, then this is probably a good DVD to add to your collection. However if you are just out surfing for a good cartoon to watch over and over again, and have no interest in the Titans or their creators, then you may wish to pass on this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen Titans, go!","review":"Teen Titans is the best show ever! But I was wondering...are they going to come out with more of these DVDs? There are 39 episodes, and I just wanted to know if they were going to make six DVDs. I hope they do! If anybody knows, please tell me!!!Well anyways, this looks like an awsome DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half the size, half the episodes","review":"This mini-dvd is based off the already released 'normal' DVD of the same name, only instead of packing 6 episodes like the original did you'll only get three. Included are 'Final Exam', 'Sisters', and 'Divide and Conquer', but missing are 'Forces of Nature', 'Sum of His Parts' and 'Nevermore'. It's disappointing since these were the better episodes from this collection as well.Only recommended for the novelty value of owning a mini-disc (which as these things become more common, won't be novel for long). Completists should skip this release and grab the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality entertainment","review":"My wife and I have been watching Teen Titans on cable for several weeks. As other reviews confirm, it has a strong anime-attitude influence combined with the 'Batman animated series' style of animation. There is a good deal of character development and old-school fans of the Teen Titans comics of the 80's (like my wife and I) will be pleased to know that the show is reasonably true to the old comics. It's also nice to see Robin dominating in combat instead of playing sidekick to Batman. All in all, Teen Titans gives good story, action and characters you will care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teen Titans......NOT!!!!!!","review":"I normally don't write reviews on items so trust me if I take the time to write about how absolutely bad this DVD is it means something. If you are expecting some great animation and stories similar to the George Perez Titan days FORGET IT. The target audience is for kids 6 and younger. The characters are far too silly for this to be good story telling. This is by far the worst animated series ever made based on comic characters. DC and Warner get a big, fat \\"F\\" for this! Go back and try again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only comes as ONE and NOT a set...less than decent condition!","review":"I was disappointed that it didn't come as a set but rather one at a time. So, it cost me over fifty bucks to get a set of 12 lbs dumbells (including shipping). That's hardly a deal. If anything, it's a straight rip off. Plus one of my dumbells has this very sharp pointy thing coming out of the part that where the handle meets the bulk portion of the dumbell. It's sharp enough to rip open my finger. I guess I'll have to buy a heavy duty metal file to file it down or something because it's definitely a trip to the hospital and 4 stitches in the making. I'm guessing the seller of this item is selling \\"seconds\\" or less than perfect items he/she/it picked up from a manufacturer that decided these units can't be sold in a regular store."},{"rating":"2","title":"witty and imaginative","review":"This is a witty and imaginative retelling of the classic story. We have owned this book for almost a year now, and among scores of other books, it continues to be the favorite among both my 1-1/2 year old and my 3 year old boys. It is exciting without being too frightening, and can be used as the basis for a lot of imaginative play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great updated look for an old favorite","review":"I love Walker's modern retelling of the Jack tale, and I'm especially in love with Sharkey's bright, colorful, funky illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Illustrations","review":"The strength of this book is the illustrations.

Works Great.","review":"Just bought this as a chanukkah gift.Ran it on my XP with sp2, Works great for the price that I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homespun Hero","review":"Raymon Grace, dowser and former Silva Method instructor, embodies old school values, honesty, independence, self-reliance and optimism. In this book he exhorts readers to take back control of their lives and make the future great for everyone. He shares his own story and some techniques.The writing is simple and direct. He dispenses with the mollycoddling and faux political correctness and calls it as he sees it. Either you take responsibility for your life and the world or you don't. If you do he will guide you.I lked this book. I thought it was refreshing and easy to read. I wish there had been more instruction and I could have lived without the appendix featuring a long winded and dated brainwashing essay by Dick Stuphen. But overall, it is a success and I recommend it not only for those interested in dowsing but for anyone seeking to reclaim their power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating: where's the meat?","review":"Maybe I missed it because my head was spinning from the disjointed narritive but I never actually found where Raymon spells out technique. It's just one success story after another. Even the chapters \\"How it's done\\" and \\"An Introduction to Dowsing\\" don;t say how to do it - just more stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fantasy book","review":"This is a strange, disjointed and irrational book. It starts out making sense but the farther you read into it, the more fantastic it becomes. It is a big fantasy and should be read as fiction. The guy is a mix of dowser and magician. He claims to be able to control people a world away. If you want to believe that stuff be my guest. But it strikes me as the worst sort of nonsense that appeals to people who want life to be something other than what it actually is. If you live in a dream land then you can join Raymon in his but don't be surprised when reality bites you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read","review":"Raymon Grace has a down to earth way of explaining his vast experiences and pratical methods of helping many many people. He has a real and powerful connection with the divine and he does not abuse that gift. This book empowers us to make positive changes in our lives and the world. You understand that you can do anything that you set your mind to. Raymon's greatest gift is in sharing his knowledge and encouraging others to do good in the world. This book is a great blessing to those who read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"died quickly","review":"didn't expect it last long, but died long before I expected and not because of wear.

Where it's battery powered, it worked well in the pressboard costume. I got two which is good as the first one didn't really work that well. The \\"lightning\\" didn't really show up that well. Sort of fuzzy. The second box contained the unit that is well represented by the photos showing clear lightning bolts. When there is noise, the lightning activates. It is very cool especially among 5 year old males. Ok, ALL males. Amazon was outstanding in accepting the return of the improperly functioning unit. Perhaps it's wise to buy two at a time but I only did it due to a time crunch on the costume and needed to be certain I'd have a functional device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un regalo maravilloso para el ser querido!","review":"Compré este libro a mi pareja, está encantada.

He's made over 60 albums, most of them for Telarc, an American record company that makes the best sounding cd's available today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply marvelous!","review":"Garner in excellent toe tapping form. This is actually a compilation of two different albums, Campus Concert was recorded live and Feeling Is Believing was recorded on a different date in the studio. I consider Feeling Is Believing to be one of Garner's finest albums ever and do not think it suffers in any way from the tunes being pop hits from the 60's rather than pop hits form the previous decades. Garner's make these tune so compelling, his versions are among the most grooving renditions I have ever heard of these famous tunes, simply marvelous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Iron, Great for the price.","review":"This is a low cost iron with a few things found on higher priced irons. If you are planning on using this for hobby work, this will more than fit your needs. Feels sturdy and well built. I like the control that you have over the heat. It's a dial so you have a lot of different setting you could use, not just an on off button. The station hold is nice and sturdy. Again, for the price you are getting a nice tool. I don't know how it would hold up if you were to use it every day, but that is not what I bought it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay far away from this","review":"Velleman 50W Soldering StationIn a lifetime of soldering pc boards, first amateur radio and stereo systems (Heathkits, etc.) and later (1970's to today) all sorts of computers, this is the worst soldering iron I have ever owned. It barely gets hot enough to melt the new tin/antimony solder and has very little heat left to heat whatever it is you're trying to solder. The result is globs of solder all over the place, and the connections not really soldered. It does a good job of melting the soldering iron holder which is made of easily melted plastic (a genius design). It is just a pos, so stay very far away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad Item no heat","review":"Received the item looked very nice in person. Plugged it in turned it up to max heat let it heat up and it will not even melt very small diameter flux core solder. Let it sit for another 10 min on high still wont melt the solder.

Now there's a CD that's worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry for the last review","review":"The last review I made on here I admit was dumb because I didn't even listen to the whole CD. I just listened to a few songs and didn't like it. But I did give it 2 stars because there were a few I liked. But now that I have heard the whole CD, i lower the previous rating a star. It sounds like the exact same pop-punk garbage that is out there today (New Found Glory, Blink 182, Sum41, need I go on??) And come on people, you all know Sweetness .... Hell I'm 15 and I can make better and even MORE lyrics to a song. They just don't have the talent to write lyrics so they fill it all in with long \\"Whoooaaahhhh\\" parts and then repeat the other lyrics throughout the song.

CAN YOU SAY CRAP!!!","review":"A lot of friends of mine said that I should get with the times and check out Jimmy Eat World. I did, and it was a painful and frankly boring expierence. I had finally realized that the standards for music had gone down dramatically. I would say that they need to spend longer that 30 seconds on their lyrics and then possibly put away the guitars, drums, and that silent bass, and go chant their songs at a monestary far far away. However that would be polluting the listening ears of god, so I guess they are screwed. \\"Sweetness\\" is very unimaginative and that was about where I started getting embarassed for them. These guys were so pitiful I started thinking about buying the William Hung CD. So for the sake of every man, women, and child do not purchase this corruption of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Is Good","review":"The album is cool. I like most of the songs on the album and that is really rare. \\"The Middle\\" is cool. It has a catchy tune and a good chorus. I kept listening to the song on the radio for weeks until I decided to buy the CD. \\"Sweetness\\" is a fairly good song. I think its too pop for me though. \\"A Praise Chorus\\" truly shows Jimmy Eat World's goodness though. After I bought the album, I couldn't get this song out of my head. It's super good. You should buy this album, it's worth the money. There are lots of other good songs than the singles though. Like \\"If You Don't Don't\\" and \\"Get It Faster.\\" Even though \\"Get It Faster\\" has a slow intro, it's still good. So buy the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good album but...","review":"where's the heat and substance i became so fond of on clarity? remember For me this is heaven? that was beautiful stuff. i'm not sure what to make of this new one. i'll have to go back to my shins and new death show records until jimmy puts out a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I only like the sweetness","review":"I am real picky with what I listen to, but the sweetness is one of the most addictive songs I have ever listened to. It was days before I removed it from my mp3 player's playlist.

From increadibly catchy up-tempo songs, to mellow, softer songs, this is an amazing record. I would reccomend this album to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised Me","review":"Here's what I expected going in: tuneful pop, a bit of street spunk and a whole lot of navelgazing, just the CD -- in other words -- where the appeal pales to anyone past a certain age. Well, I'm past most ages, but this CD -- by either name, its current eponymous one or its pre-9/11 unfortunate Bleed American -- has legs, with every one of its 11 cuts highly listenable, very hook-y indeed, and, here was the surprise, often with literate and sympathetic lyrics. I think the CD flags a bit toward the end with just two of the last four cuts, Cautioners and The Authority Song, standing up to the best of the earlier songs. But a solid five of those seven --A Praise Chorus, The Middle, If You Don't, Don't and my two personal favorites, Your House and Hear You Me -- will stay high on all my media playlists for a good while to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly shocked","review":"I first heard of JEW from their video of women walking around in their undies.

One of the best CD's I have bought this year. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD IF NOT GREAT","review":"I bought this CD solely on the recommendation from a friend, which I never do. But I wasn't disappointed by Bleed American. Although a few of the songs seem to break up the momentum of the album, other songs stand out like \\"Bleed American\\", \\"The Sweetness\\", and \\"Get It Faster.\\" I hate to admit it, but even the MTV TRL-ish \\"The Middle\\" is pretty catchy. If you like good, solid rock/punk/pop CDs, then Jimmy Eat World's Bleed American is definately a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a 4.5 star","review":"personally i think this is a good cd but thats just me. the thing that i dont like about this cd is the song sweetness. it gets very old and very annoying very fast. my friend calls it his \\"pump-up\\" song but i think its [junk] basically. any lyrics fit into the song \\"i was tippin cows wahoaoaoaoao\\" that is the only flaw in the cd but whatever its a great cd so go buy it! its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I thought because this was Mark Hoppus's favorite band that it would sound just like blink. however, this band mixes punk, rock, and they add a couple of cool slow songs in the mix too. they really put a lot of effort into their lyrics and the vocals sound great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay instruments!","review":"I didn't get into Jimmy Eat World until their self-titled album \\"Jimmy Eat World\\" came out. I \\"discovered\\" them through a friend's recommendation. (NOT from hearing \\"The Middle\\" on MTV or radio! Yay!)I...love this album. Jim has...the most unique, beautiful voice. It really amazes me. \\"Hear You Me\\" almost made me cry...sniff! Listening to \\"Sweetness\\" really got me addicted. I appreciate a band who can actually sing, not just play guitar.The lyrics are great, really. I haven't listened to \\"Clarity,\\" so I don't know if they've become more...shallow, but what's here is very deep.Alright, I'm horrible at writing reviews, but Jimmy Eat World is a very talented band, and I do hope they continue to stay true to themselves and not get caught up in the hype of being \\"famous.\\"Yay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a really good CD, definatly worth buying.

Although they didnt put on a great show, I really enjoyed the music. I went out and bought the CD as sooon as I got a chance, and I wasn't dissapointed. This CD has quality. To say it's a great CD would be a lie, but it definantly deserves recognition. The guys from JEW love making music, and it's very evident. I can listen to this CD over and over and not get tired of it. There are a couple songs that are lacking in my opinion, but for the most part, this CD really rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Eat World just can't be beat.","review":"I've been listening to this (and the other [Jimmy Eat World] albums) nearly nonstop all year.They are certainly one of a handful of bands who have launched a crusade to save rock from itself.Overall I'd say Bleed American is up there with the wonderful Clarity. Not as tight, maybe, but harder rockin' throughout.Get it ASAP if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of its cohort","review":"This album just blew everything else out of the water the year it released. It's got driving rhythms, a variety of sounds, and it wears well. It's the album Weezer wished they had put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Eats Five Stars","review":"Jimmy Eat World, besides producing technically sound music, also writes all of their own inspiring songs. The lyrics are neither vulgar nor negative but, instead, throught-provoking and easy to listen to. This album is a perfect compilation of hard rock and softer tunes. Each and every of the eleven songs are worthy of being released as a single. If you appreciate good music and a variety of styles, \\"[Bleed] American\\" is unquestionably the album for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop at its finest","review":"I wasn't a big fan of Jimmy Eat World before this album came out, but now they're one of my top bands. Bleed American is the power pop CD that the world needed after Weezer's green album fell short of everyone's expectations. The greater portion of these songs are upbeat, simple, catchy rock songs. Nothing too deep or complex, just fun, well-written rock. The slower songs aren't quite as good, but they still aren't bad. I find it ridiculous that people consider this emo. This this has more in common with The Cars than Sunny Day Real Estate. Get this if you like power pop that won't get old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe in What You Want","review":"This was the first Jimmy Eat World album that I ever bought, and it did get me to be a fan. However, even though the music on this album is good, I think that it's the worst album they've released. Out of all of their albums, this one is my least favorite.I'd recommend getting this album, but do check out the rest of their music. It's all uphill from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is full of sweetness","review":"I recently fell in love with Jimmy Eat World's music when I first saw the video for their latest single \\"The Middle\\". I couldn't get the infectious melodies out of my head since then. I wasn't too impressed when I first heard the title track \\"Bleed American\\" on a compilation disc but after \\"The Middle\\" my mind was changed and I thought I would check out what the fuss is about Jimmy Eat World. I still think the title track isn't all that great. Not bad but just not keen on it. Other than \\"The Middle\\", I totally dug \\"A Praise Chorus\\", \\"Your House\\", and \\"Hear You Me\\" in particular. Overall the album is chockful of crunchy guitar riffs with irresistable melodies that reminded me of Weezer's self-titled album that was released this year. \\"Bleed American\\" is a fun album to crank up the volume to."},{"rating":"2","title":"!PRIMA!","review":"Jimmy Eat World is sooooo great! Bleed American is an incredebly beautiful cd and i can't stop listening to it. I listen to this cd every night and its on repeat all night. I became so obsessed that it makes me sad when i don't listen to it. They are second only to one (nirvana because its nirvana) although Jimmy Eat World has the most beautiful songs i have ever heard any one who doesn't have this cd is really missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Im not into rock but this is good","review":"I generally only listen to rap music, but I was turned on to Jimmy Eat World but some friends. I was hesitant to listen, but after 1 hearing I was hooked. This CD and band are head and shoulders over 99% of the bands and songs you hear on the radio or see on ... nowadays. This is rock music..not c r a p like Staind, Alien Ant Farm, and whatever else M T V is shoving down our throats. Stand out tracks on this album are \\"A Praise Chorus\\", \\"Sweetness\\", \\"If You Don't, Don't\\", and \\"Get It Faster\\". There isn't one bad song on this CD, which is not common in the rock genre. This CD is definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bottom Line","review":"It's really easy to get into this album right from the start. Bleed American (as it was originally titled) touts the right combination of melodic rock and slower ballads for a terrific rock and roll record. The album has a very poppy feel pretty much the whole way through, and Jimmy Eat World proves that this doesn't necessarily have to be a negative aspect. This translates into an album which could theoretically find its way on a movie or television soundtrack because of the type of easily digested superbly written songs that exist throughout. (Tell me that \\"The Middle\\" wouldn't fit perfectly into an 1980's John Cusak flick about overcoming the high school odds and getting the girl!) Anyway, if you're looking for something completely new in uncharted territory; you might need to pick up one of their earlier records. If your looking for a simply great rock and roll record, pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"uptempo cuts are perfect for hiking/walking/driving","review":"the guy below me, Mike from Chicago, presumes to give a rundown of each song........he's just wrong about the album in general. Authority Song is awesome, so is Get It Faster, so is Sweetness. JEW's (heh) best songs are the UP-tempo ones, not the slightly corny ballads. Mike, get some cajones man! Anyways the harder stuff on this album is what makes it a very good albumn, make no mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky, Loveable, Awesome!","review":"This CD consists of 11 great songs- energetic, melodic, and catchy. This CD doesn't \\"grow\\" on you...you love it immediately.

I would highly recomend this to any punk/pop/rock lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3 <3 love it!","review":"this cd is the best, i absolutely loved it. but i must tell you, i haven't listened to their other cds.. they're on my 'to buy list' but keep that in mind. nontheless i became an instant fan and just this one cd puts jimmy eat world in my top 3 bands. the song Middle got a bit overplayed.. but compared to the other fantastic songs on the cd it's no big deal -- you've gotta get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Expected","review":"Before listening to this album I had heard \\"The Middle\\" way too much and one other song from the band and was not impressed. Even as I began to listen to the album my impression fro the early songs (the ones before \\"The Middle\\") was that this is an indie/garage band that got lucky. Once you get past \\"The Middle\\" though the album really picks it up in quality dhowing the band's quality and depth that I think is vastly unknown and underserved. Even if you're not a huge fan of their big single from this album it is still a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"hahaha what was i on when i bought this","review":"give me a break, bleed american is the only good song, if they wrote more like that i would like them alot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth The Price!","review":"I just feel bad giving out 0 stars for simply the effort to produce an album.

But they rest is just horrible. besides the first 3 songs there's no trace of punk rock through out the whole CD if you like punk rock dont get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A STINKING PILE","review":"This is rediculous, the album isnt that bad --- but they changed the name of it! So WHAT if it was called Bleed American, we cant let the unfortunate tragedies of our past change the way music is. This shows that Jimmy Eat World cares more about record sales than they do about their music, and that just dissappoints me. I've liked them less and less ever since they went on tour with Weezer and made MTV, teeny-bopper popularity is ruining them and their music. WHY?!??!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Praise Chorus for Jimmy Eat World","review":"Despite the teeny-bop bubble-gum rock tag that has unfairly been placed on the band, Jimmy Eat World's first release is definitely worth a listen. Not far from the original mid-90's Weezer sound, the tracklist bounces around from up-tempo, catchy rock songs (\\"A Praise Chorus\\", \\"If You Don't, Don't\\") to melodious, darker ones (\\"Hear You Me\\", \\"My Sundown\\"). \\"Your House\\", an uptempo acoustically-driven track, is one of the highlights, and \\"Authority Song\\" is a clever and harmonious throw-back to rock songs of yore. Where teenage girls may become frustrated that the album isn't chock full of \\"The Middle\\" clones, alternative rock fans will be pleasantly surprised by the band's range and depth. Don't let MTV's TRL fool you...Jimmy Eat World isn't out to sell records to the Backstreet crowd, they're out to make good rock music. So far, so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I received the vinyl yesterday, and I just have to say that I'm absolutely amazed. They've definitely outdone themself. I thought that the album was a lot like Clarity in that it was great from start to finish. \\"A Praise Chorus\\" (with Davey vonBohlen (TPR)) is probably my favorite so far -- a very motivating emotional song that makes you feel like getting up and living ...-- although Davey is hard to pick out). \\"Sweetness\\" is definitely sweet, as it always has been (although the rhythm of one part of the lyrics changed slightly from a version I've heard). \\"My Sundown\\" is a perfect way to end the album, but I said to myself -- they have to go out rockin'. Sure enough, \\"Splash, Turn, Twist\\" (vinyl/import only) is definitely that to round out this great work. For any Jimmy fan who liked Clarity and (to a certain extent) Static Prevails, I definitely recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge step backwards","review":"Absolutely not as good as Clarity, this album sounds like it was designed to get play on TRL and corporate rock radio. Look at the video for The Middle - teenagers in their underwear. I wonder what market-savy executive decided on that motif!

When John plays, it's an exploration of the instrument, he's riding it and seeing where it goes. Dave Navarro has a more disciplined style, so instead of riding, he drives his guitar exactly where he wants it to go. The music in this album is more precise, more calculated, and just as good as any other Pepper's album, if not a bit better be being a breath of fresh air. There's less freaking out and more rocking out, if that makes sense. In summary, and diehard fans should really relax and just go with the flow.

This Cd is so much different from BSSM, but the Red Hot chili Peppers sure made the right choise of hiring Dave Navarro.

This album has some great songs; like Aeroplane, My Friends, Warped(good heavy song), Terjerker and Coffee Shop. Like every other album, this cd has also some bad songs, and this is why I gave the CD four stars instead of two.I'm not saying that this Cd is better than Blood Sugar Sex magic, but is worth buying it just to listen to a different kind of Red Hot chili Peppers."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I am a huge chillipepers fan and this CD was no more than decent.

The music has a pleasant funk edge, but its simplicity quickly makes the CD grow tiresome...As musicians, these guys have a long way to go in both the composing and the performing aspect- guitar solos are repetitive and lack talent and the lead vocals are pretty flat and void of emotion.... Worst of all is the lyrics of most of the song, which pretty much equates to garbage. Often, in the world of alternative rock, muddy unfocused lyrics take on the feeling of dark, dreamlike poetry (Take Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins for instance.) Not so here, the writing is as blunt and dead as a brick...hmm...thats a pretty good analogy. This CD, outside of the radio tracks, is as interesting as a brick....avoid it unless you have a fetish for fireplaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different!","review":"Although its no BSSM its still one of my favoutite albums.

Next would be \\"Pea\\" as it makes me laugh. \\"Transcending\\", which was dedicated to River Pheonix, who was one of Flea's best friends, is also a good song.

Knowing what I do now after having bought and viewed the set I would order it again.Two minor quibbles kept me from giving it 5 stars. First, since the set is boxed why does each individual DVD have to be sealed with 3 tape strips and then sealed in a plastic wrapper? It makes it a bit hard to get to the DVD's.

It gets recognition merely because it aired during the stone age of television. If this show came along at any other time it would barely register as a blip on the television radar. There is no excuse for its production of consistently crummy episodes with annoying lead characters.Lucy was irritating as $%#$@ with her incessant whiny rants. And husband Ricky leads the list as the single worst \\"actor\\" -- I use that term VERY loosely -- in sitcom history (and a horrifically lousy singer to boot.)

There is no excuse for releasing any half-hour series on DVD with only four episodes per disc.

It's still too high and should be the same price as Gilligan's Island so it loses a star. But My Favorite Husband is a great easter egg.

It is a plethora of Spanish vocabulary that you won't find in a regular dictionary because some of the words might be indigenous to a certain region or area.

I maintain a dose of around 3000mg per day. This has had no ill effects and has prevented any cold sores from developing. I use two other brands of L-Lysine (NOW and Source Naturals), and they both seem to perform equally. I expected Twinlab lysine to be similarly effective, but since I began using it, I have had constant prodromal symptoms (tingling, warmth, redness, small bumps forming)--it is a daily occurrence. Nothing else about my diet has changed, and the prodromes began just a day or two after beginning Twinlab L-Lysine. I've successfully treated the prodromes with Abreva, but this shouldn't even be necessary if I'm taking such a large maintenance dose of L-Lysine.

It literally is a story and each page has a game along with it. (Which aren't very fun) You can't skip to the page you want you have to go thru each page.

This is a tale of strong women. These women held the fabric of life together during disaster, disease, childbirth, civil war and a devastating national depression. The colorful story is knit together with the strands of yarn in a remarkable shawl, that moves from the hands of mother to daughter-in-law, many times over, and then to a daughter. Begun as a simple memorial to Katy's four lost children, the shawl becomes a mantle of strength and a codex for the long succession of valiant women in the George family. I loved this book! Not only is KATY'S SHAWL a \\"good read\\", any woman can relate to it on some level, for who among us has not some \\"memories lock'd\\" within us? Walter Wood does an excellent job of bringing to life the historical account of his family, and creating a fitting memorial to his own mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katy's Shawl","review":"Walter's book is captivating. From the moment I picked it up I could not put it down. Accounts of marriages, births, deaths, as well as honest descriptopns of the life of an American family from the early frontier days to the great modern days kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was next. I shared the life they lived, smelled the food they ate, and felt the pain they suffered. Katy's Shawl is a vivid description of frontier life that helps us appreciate our comfortable life today. As an immigrant I did not experience life growing up in America and did not feel a connection to its history. I feel like I now understand the struggles and challenges that the people here endured and how those experiences shaped their values and beliefs. I have gained a new respect for this country by reading Katy's Shawl and am proud to be a citizen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firm support for nursing success","review":"I bought the My Brest Friend pillow because it was recommended in the book \\"The Nursing Mother's Companion\\" and by the Lactation Center at Piedmont Hospital. The pillow offers a lot of support for my baby and allows me to nurse hands-free when I need to. Like another reviewer, I've been able to walk around the house while nursing (one hand on the baby, one hand on the pillow), which I don't think you can do with a Boppy. My one complaint is that the cover is so hard to get back on the pillow after a washing. It can be quite a wrestling match. I'm very happy with the purchase, though, and will make it a shower gift for my pregnant friends who plan on nursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Boppy","review":"Unfortunately, I have the Boppy instead of the Best Friend. I got to try this pillow at a recent visit with the lactation consultant at our hospital and definitely like it better than the Boppy. What I like most is that it stays very close to the body (the Boppy is rounded so the baby kinda slips down), it can be used with any seat (the Boppy is best with an arm chair and does not work well with seats without arms). I highly recommend using this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product!","review":"I received this as a shower gift and at first wasn't sure if I would use it.

One mom had mentioned My Brestfriend but I didn't listen. I tried the boppy and it wasn't working... of course I didn't know that because the whole breastfeeding thing wasn't working. After seeing a lactation specialist she recommended this pillow and it beats the boppy! The boppy is awkward, doesn't feel secure and it too round. The Brestfriend is snug against your body, stays on if you need to stand up and has a flat top where your baby won't feel like she's rolling off. I guess all is not lost, my husband uses the boppy as a sleeping pillow... like one of those inflatable neck pillows you use on the airplane. Skip the boppy and buy this awesome nursing pillow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nursing Pillow EVER","review":"This pillow could put Boppy out of business. It supports your back, keps baby at the right height and stays in place.

If I had to buy only one, it would be the Boppy because my son can use it for playtime. The Brest Friend is good for sitting in chairs but not good for sitting up in bed. Although if in bed you could probably nurse lying down. I don't know in I have an older verison, but the cover is really hard to take off and clean since the cover opens to a foam pad. Nursing pillows need to be cleaned often and I was very disappointed. That's why I can't give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I bought this becaue I really did not like the look of the boopy. This nurser is very supportive and comfortable to wear. I have wash the cover many times and it has not shrunk on me. I have the valcrow one and it is true you have to be carful when taking it off or little one will be disturbed. I first put my daughter to bed then walked out of the room and take it off. On both ends of the nurser there is a little slope to lift up your babies head. I would buy another one if this is to get loss in our next move. I found mine on ebay for cheaper. hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great pillow!","review":"I went to a nursing store and tried several different pillows and this was the only one that was truly comfortable and not awkward to use. My only complaint is that you cannot take it off in the same room in which your baby has fallen asleep... the velcro is LOUD! LOL! Otherwise, I can't imagine bf-ing without this pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money","review":"I bought this to nurse my first baby and used it until I realized a sofa pillow works just as well. MBF works great in bed and even in really wide chairs, but it is big (nearly two feet) and bulky. You need two hands to put it on, so you need to do some baby juggling to make it work, or thinking ahead of time (but I seldom do that in the middle of the night - baby cries, I pick him up - oh I forgot the !@#$ pillow again). The HUGE velcrow strip is almost a foot long and very loud when taking off. The rriippp sound woke my baby (and husband) every time I pulled it to remove the pillow. Also, because of its size, there is no easy way to store it between feedings. Feels kind of like wearing an inner tube to the beach..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good for petites","review":"I used this pillow for only 2 weeks. If you are petite, dont get it. The pillow is soo thick that your baby wont be comftable because your brest will be right on top of his/her head. Your wrist will end up hurting.. I am now using my arms, and my legs crossed, and baby latches and looks more comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO much better than my Boppy Luxe ever was","review":"Had, and used, a Boppy Luxe with my first child. It seemed fine, as I didn't know anything else.Now with my second child, I KNOW there's something better out there - the My Brest Friend! It's firmer, and has more shape (no rolling off the back or into me, like with the rounded and flattened Boppy). It's wider and deeper, so it allows for much better positioning and more options for different holds. It secures, so I can move with it (including standing, if I have to!). It supports my back, so I'm more comfortable as well. And, it even has a handy pocket to hold a burp cloth, water bottle, and/or cordless phone - things I never seemed to have in reach before.By FAR, the best nursing pillow out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best - worth the money!","review":"Own this and the Boppy. Used the Boppy for my 1st baby. Decided to try this for my 2nd and have not regretted the purchase. I am a bigger/tall mom and this fits me so much better than the Boppy. Also the large, flat surface is really nice. I also really like the pocket in the front - I used that a lot in the first few weeks when we were feeding every 2-3 hrs to hold the Lanisoh (another must have), the gas drops, a small clock, nail clipper and a pen/paper to track feedings. That way you can take the pillow, the baby and all the paraphenalia anywhere in the house to feed. Haven't used the Boppy this time around except to put the baby in it to hang out occasionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST PRODUCT EVER FOR BREASTFEEDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The breast friend is THE BEST PRODUCT EVER INVENTED FOR BREASTFEEDING.If it was not for this product I would not be able to breastfeed. My daughter is now 7 months and still uses it.I have used this since she was 1 month old. If you are like me, had trouble getting the hand of breastfeeding, YOU HAVE GOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.I am so confident with the breastfriend that if they had a commercial for it, I would be the first person to sign up to endorse it. I give this product 100 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to know something's \\"Got my back!\\"","review":"What a relief it is to sit down and nurse without an aching back. My daughter is just an itty bitty thing right now, but she can sure nurse for a good long while. This pillow helps me to keep her close without straining my back. My husband brought this to me in the hospital and the lactation consultant was impressed when she saw how it helped with latch on difficulties. The handy little pocket is great for keeping accessories like a nipple shield or a tube of lanolin. I love this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this pillow for nursing","review":"this is the best nursing pillow i've found. love that it wraps all the way around, has a large surface area for me to rest my arm w/baby and that it has a mechanism for securing it around me and tightening/loosening it as needed. a must have for us long waisted nursing moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Boppy","review":"I have both the boppy and this pillow. This pillow keeps a baby positioned better than the boppy.

Even though it's homely, the fabric print is pretty ugly, this thing is the best thing since sliced bread. I thought the back support sounded gimmicky, but it's one of my favorite features. It actually makes it comfortable to nurse. I don't end up leaning over, the back support is in just the rght place, baby loves the firm surface, and if she falls asleep nursing, I can leave it on and easily transfer her to her crib without disturbing her by moving her around too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats the Boppy -- no contest!!","review":"This product was recommended to me in breastfeeding class, after we already had purchased a boppy. I tried the boppy and it was a failure for me. It was not firm or flat enough. This product was perfect and has allowed me to succesfully and comfortably nurse our son for 10 months (so far). One word of caution -- beware of buying the inflatable travel pillow. I had one of those which popped within weeks before I realized that I had not bought the correct pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breastfeeding Made Easier","review":"The three things that I like about this the most:1) It stays in place because of the fastener, and it is very easy to get on and off, as well as adjusting it.2) The pocket that is attached is great for holding things you might need...I use it for extra nursing pads, my lanolin, baby nail clippers, etc.3) My baby can latch on much easier using this nursing pillow than any other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than a boppy","review":"if you can get over the lame name you've got to buy this pillow! For my first baby I bought a boppy and It didn't give me anywhere near the support I've gotten from My Brest Friend.

Perhaps it is b/c I used a boppy three years ago with my first child. I purchased this one thinking it would be helpful to be attached to me while I cared for my three year old and infant. I kept knocking into my three year old with the pillow! My infant couldn't get comfy at all on this pillow while nursing. The one thing I did like about it is the storage compartment (pocket) for different things.I bought this b/c my boppy seemed to be a little saggy and had seen better days. But in the end, I returned this and bought a new cover (which I know it doesn't really matter, but personally I think the covers are much nicer (pattern wise, etc.) for the boppy) for my original boppy and it is working great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schalk Edition - Subdued Bruckner","review":"This recording of the 1894 Schalk Edition did not initially sound to me like quintessential Bruckner. The orchestration is slightly subdued, perhaps more polished, maybe more sophisticated. Schalk withholds the Bruckner brass stampede until the very end. It lacks the shock value of rude interruption that I generally love about Bruckner symphonies. This symphony does, however, contain some of Bruckner's best thematic material. You will not be disappointed in the structure as the themes develop from whisper to climax. Botstein gives a highly romanticized reading and Telarc's sound is definitely lush, both of which I admire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what its supposed to be","review":"I ordered this from Adorama through Amazon. Service was very quick, I received my order the next day, even though I only selected ground.The filter itself is exactly as it should be. The threading is smooth and the filter is easy to screw onto my lenses without any hassle. Having had no other experience with IR filters, I am giving this a 5 stars. The filter came in good condition and works well. I have used it a little, but need to experiment more with IR photography.I currently own a Canon Digital Rebel XT, and for digital IR, it works as well as it should. (search around the internet for reviews on how your camera will perform with IR)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as expected for an infrared filter","review":"This filter performs excellent in bright light. It is what I would call a fair weather filter. On a recent shoot in the Oregon mountains where there was lots of Mist and rain as well as water splash from the trees, it quickly got water spots on it. The coating of these lenses does not repel water very well and when cleaned with a microfiber cloth alone left streaking. The streaking resolves when using the proper alcohol lens cleaner.That is probably an unfair complaint against the filter. However certain other filters by other manufacturers handle the wet weather conditions a bit better. As far as the infrared performance of the Filter, it performs flawlessly. I am particularly pleased with the construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I have used this for about 4 months and i love it. Works great no problems at all. Only way to do infared without modifying your camera. Loads of cool pictures can be taken with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"IR Filter that works","review":"i do not really know the difference because i haven't used any other cheaper or more expensive ones, but this seems like to fit right in the majority of amateur photographers so i got it. and it works. what more can i say very satisfied when it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This filter comes in a wonderful plastic protective case, and I cannot tell you how much I love it already. It is truly made with excellent quality and I highly recommend this filter to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge dynamic range in Pathetique","review":"Perhaps more of a music expert would not find this a drawback, but I find the enormous dynamic range of this recording a bit distracting -- it starts out incredibly quiet, so I have to turn the stereo way up to even know it's playing, and then of course as it gets going it's blasting me out of the living room. I'm sure this would be very exciting to hear live, but it is a small drawback for a living room listener. That said, it's a lovely recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but not overly accurate","review":"I am interested in comparative religions and scholarship of religions. This book caught my eye as an amusing and informative read. It is amusing, but it shouldn't be taken as a definitive source without fact-checking. (I'm afraid I am unyielding on the importance of fact-checking, and not by quoting Wikipedia!) I found several mistakes, which I fact-checked to be sure. All-in-all, this is a light read if you don't care over-much for accuracy. Just know what you are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting adaptation","review":"An interesting adaptation of H.P.

I love Tony best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacques Pepin's Complete Techniques","review":"I actually purchased this copy for my brother as a house warming gift because he, like me, loves to cook. I love the instructions and the pictures that accompany each step so you can look to see if your creation looks how it is supposed to look each step of the way instead of getting to the end and finding out you screwed-up somewhere. I've been cooking for years and was very happy when I got this book for myself as it has helped me to branch out and make things I've always wanted to but was unsure of the process. I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants to expand their cooking skills and dazzle friends and family with delicious and beautiful food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Awful","review":"The quality of the black and white pictures is terrible throughout.

I'm also eager to learn everything I can. I'm hardly a snob when it comes to food and preparation. I also read a lot of cooking non-fiction.I love Jacques Pepin. I think he's the name man and am currently reading his biography. So, it pains me to give this review, but I gotta be honest, this book sucks. The descriptions are way too brief and half the techniques in here are completely useless with today's cooking. Tremendously disappointing.Want a real complete technique book?

Don't suggest to use it if you have a metal connector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after two months","review":"Early on I thought this was a great nozzle. The spray patterns and pressure were all good and the trigger didn't seem as fragile as the other Melnor models. After only a couple month however water started coming out around the outside of the black ring instead of the nozzle. It's completely useless now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky and has weak return spring","review":"The saying \\"You get what you pay for\\" applies here. This nozzle *looks* good & beefy, but the appearance has nothing to do with the engineering. It quickly becomes leaky thus lessening the pressure and accuracy of pattern. My biggest problem with it though is that the return spring is too weak. When you squeeze the trigger it stays in the on position. I have to pull it back with my other hand to turn off the water. Many times I've used this thing, sometimes just turning the faucet, and accidentally sprayed myself or hit something I didn't want wet because the trigger handle was stuck in the on position. I hate this thing. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky and will become a permanent part of your hose","review":"I've had two of these and I had the same problem with both. I bought them from a local Home Depot, and after just now having to replace my perfectly good hose for the second time in 2 years, I figured I'd look online to see what others are saying about this product. I found what I expected - similar issues as mine. The adjustable-pattern nozzle will work for a short time before starting to leak and spray water uncontrollably every which way. When you decide to remove the malfunctioning nozzle, you will find that you cannot, even if you use tools, WD40, what have you. You will have to buy a new hose (or cut it and go old-school by squeezing and kinking the hose to control the flow). DO NOT BUY this nozzle, unless you like giving away money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $$$$","review":"These nozzles are complete garbage!

The materials are VERY cheap. It was $[...] so I am upset. For $[...], I'd say it might be OK. This is a waste of money.

So a few days before christmas I order two for my two sons and they have not put them down yet. THere is no longer any fighting to use mine. THe vacuum does pick up things but not where you have to worry they are going to vacuum a sock up or anything its suction isn't that powerful and shouldn't be for a childs play toy, When reading others reviews they mentioned the front keeps falling off, well it does occasionally but not enough to bother me, when you recive this item this is one of the parts that you have to put together it takes all of a second to put back on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but horrible construction, cheap weak brittle plastic.","review":"My 20 month old son loves playing with our Dyson vacuum so I thought this would be toy for him, especially as we were bringing home a newborn.

The front section comes off every time he uses it and it is only a matter of time till it completely breaks and will be useless.

By the by I decided to purchase this heater based on its price and the virtues extolled by the maker. I must say I was not impressed, it has done little to heat the interiour of my study, this foolish device just sits in the middle of the floor and buzzes.

The lesson is the art of being generous and giving away something you truly treasure, so you may be rewarded later. There are plenty of whimsical, darling illustrations with easy to read text. It is nice to read a book of a different time with period costumes. It is also a way to teach a little history lesson, of the way it used to be with kings & queens getting whatever they wanted. The book teaches in simple terms the joy of giving can be better than receiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mousse","review":"Certainly cheaper than buying locally at salons. A very good mousse with firmness which gives your hair body and has no odor."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPRESSIVE!!","review":"Ok, this is lo-o-o-ng overdue (almost 9 years). First of all, Clapton never claimed that he was up there with the blues greats nor tries to. Clapton is in a class by himself. The tracks he cut are his personal favorites and I can tell that he poured his heart and soul into every one of them. Clapton never tried to alter the way the songs were supposed to be heard. Listening to the CD numerous times, it grew on me. Personally, I think Clapton is better at the guitar than Elmore James and yes, even Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters and other blues greats. This CD is a classic. Clapton should have another blues CD made in a similiar fashion as this one. Maybe he should call it \\"Deeper Into The Cradle.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"overlooked gem!","review":"The whole who has the right to be called a bluesman is tiring. This CD is spectacular and Clapton's music is genuine and sincere so yeh he is a bluesman regardless of where he came from. The blues has evolved and we have to embrace that. Gary Clark Jr, Tedeschi Trucks, etc are taking it in a new direction.I love this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"back to his roots","review":"audiophiles say his music from this genre got better after he produced this cd. While he toured it was noticable.

Despite that fact, he had never released a proper blues album in his solo works until 1994's From The Cradle. The album contains sixteen blues numbers that Mr. Clapton faithfully and reverentially recorded adding his own special touches. \\"I'm Tore Down\\" is a rollicking number with a quick and biting guitar line, \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" has a dark sound and \\"Driftin'\\" has shuffling riff. The album's best song is the inspired \\"Motherless Child\\" that has a ringing guitar and perfectly captures the Delta essence of blues music. Capitalizing on the success of Unplugged, this decidedly uncommercial album became the first, and so far, only album of his career to debut at number one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great guitar, but what's with that voice?","review":"Clapton displays his guitar virtuosity on this album, but his singing leaves a lot to be desired. All and all, it seems like he's trying too hard, and the growling of his voice seems faked. In fact, any emotion shown on this album seems faked to me. To hear good blues, or good Clapton, or both, there are plenty of better choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Blues in the hands of a master","review":"Eric Clapton goes back to his roots: The blues. This is where he should stay. All sixteen cuts on this album are covers of blues greats. Only Eric adds his precise technical flash to them. I listen to a lot of electric blues. There is no one, except the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, that can play electric blues so perfectly. Eric doesn't miss a note. He feels his way through each song, as blues was supposed to be played. All of these cuts, (except one), were live studio sessions. What you hear on this album is how it was played without all the mixing. I wish all of his music were this powerful and uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton's finest guitar ever","review":"This is, hands down, Clapton's best guitar playing. It's all there. The phrasing is immaculate and tasteful. In terms of timing he's playing ahead of the beat, behind it, and everywhere around it. This is a development in his technique. Overall, he just sounds like he's on the blues war path. He had just quit smoking which could explain the burst of energy. Otis Rush claims this is one of the top ten all time blues guitar albums. The only thing holding this album back is that it's all covers. This is a minor criticism to an otherwise masterpiece of guitar work by \\"God.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"To Its Grave","review":"This album is awful. Sell it at a used CD store-- you'll probably get enough cash for a bargain John Lee Hooker or Robert Johnson tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR ERIC's FANS ONLY","review":"If you like/love the blues like I do, it's hard to get enthused about this effort. It is not bad, but is still a long way short of other releases.( DAVID GOGO,COLIN JAMES,MARK MAY,GERRY MOORE,VINCE CONVERSE,JOE BONAMASSA,RORY GALLAGHER,ROBIN TROWER to name a few) White boys can play the blues as long as they don't try to rip of the originals, and add a bit of originality.Originality seems to have left Eric after the CREAM years and his mediocre blues output keeps him fed while he feeds of his legend status. This is a case of legeng status being kept alive by a good PR machine and record companies that are milking a golden cow.(how many best of's can you produce)In the face of so many superior CD's why would you buy this????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Soul","review":"This, like many EC Cds after 1978, lacks a soul...I think that Backless was that last great EC CD (excluding Journeyman) and Eric should focus back on his passion more than his speed....Get either \\"Blues\\", \\"Crossroads 2\\", or \\"EC WAS HERE\\" for some great EC blues stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sham. What a shame...","review":"E'C's love off the blues is obvious. And his willingness to \\"tribute\\" the originators is commendable. But these \\"faithful\\" renditions do not offer anything new aside from modern production. What is most troubling is that middle american \\"white\\" folks are treating this as though it's a work of genius. Does E.C. make blues \\"safe for white people?\\" It's a sad commentary on Clapton's audience. If you go to the source(s) you will discover that there is no substitute for the real thing. E.C. has no soul. His versions are stiff, stuffy and tight sphincter by comparison. If you must have your blues served up by a white guy. Try Robben Ford, Ronnie Earl or Paul Rishell. Or better yet, If you like the old classics go to the originals. E.C. is a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Going Through the Motions Blues","review":"Have to say that I have been a huge Clapton fan since the Cream days...He has just gone soft, it's time to face the facts...It has way more to do with inspiration than his getting on in years...I really had my hopes up that this would be an inspired effort, but nothing could be further than the truth!!! If this is \\"soul\\" then you are probably someone who thinks that Michael Bolton is a soul singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes A Step Up","review":"After having listened to this album in short spurts I haven't found a song that I didn't enjoy. Clapton's playing is good as always. You can really feel what he's trying to express through his guitar playing. He takes control when he steps up for a solo, and keeps you captivated if not blown away many times. One thing you find about Eric Clapton is that he excels at vibrato like no one else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"I expected great things from this album as I am a Clapton fan, but the result to me is rather dull. The tracks are too perfect copies and sterile. Not a single solo he plays stands out, apart from 'I'm torn down' and that is so similar to the original Freddie King version. I found the whole thing to be rather soporific. There is just no comparison with his incandescent playing with the Bluesbreakers back in 1966, or for that matter from 1975 (EC was here) or even 1980 (Just one Night). I would much rather have the originals. If he wanted to do these tracks again, why not put a bit of himself into it? At the moment it sounds just like \\"Clapton plays blues greats\\" and sounds all the worse for it.I enjoyed his live versions of these songs when he was incredible, but on CD they just sound overproduced and dull. What a hyped recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"COUNT ME IN WITH THE GUY FROM GEORGIA","review":"I read the review from the music fan in Geogia dated July 27,2000 and have to agree on all points. Eric can play the blues and this a very well played \\"tribute\\" album meant to pay homage to the man's influences. It's an excellent introduction to the blues or a great addition to your collection if you are already a fan of the music as I was when I bought my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purists Hate It, But I Love It","review":"While Clapton's tone has changed for the worse (compare to the killer tone on the Beano album), his playing is a bit more sterile, and his vocal style has remained weak over the years, I still find him to be authentic and passionate about blues. The critics and blues purists hated this release. I ususally have no tolerance for white blues either, however Clapton is loyal to the blues and approaches it with great reverence which I admire. This is a very good set of classic blues cuts where EC does his best to pay tribute to a few blues masters. The fact is this was a lose/lose proposition because blues ain't a popular form of music and blues fans are never satisfied. I for one am glad he did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yeah,","review":"Mushman again. Saw some more of my bretherns comments and just remembered, forget the singing Eric was never a blues singer but a \\"bluesy\\" singer. Ya dig? The man practically invented the blues/rock genre and he'll always be stuck with that a little. Relatively obscure, unique artists active today like R.L. Burnside are truer to the Blues than old EC. But then again maybe not--who the hell am I to say. The man loves the music and that shows here and he plays his a** off. Maybe he's not Jimmie Rodgers with Muddy or Hubert Sumlin with Wolf but hey, that's life. And if you don't know the cats I'm talking about and only know EC then you do make me feel bad for defending him and you shouldn't be reading these reviews or listening to this music.

I absolutely love baroque trumpet, and have loved it since playing violin in a chamber orchestra in school, where we had a trumpet player from the local symphony come to perform with us. We played Torelli, and from that moment, I was hooked. It's very difficult to find good collections of high quality recordings featuring the composers like Telemann and Torelli and this set is not stingy with either composer. The sound quality is clear and bright, as it should be when featuring this gorgeous and confident-sounding instrument. Highly recommended, on sale or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money but not for fine conneissures","review":"From the financial side this cd, at $6.00 - $7.00, is an excellent bargain for its price.

The book describes Rickover as dominating, selfish, obsessed, power-hungry, dictatorial - but of immense value to our country because of the way he directed his ambitions. Interesting: How he exploited Congressmen to support him; how his superiors and peers despised him, yet envied his brilliance, how he interviewed and selected staff. Not interesting: Endless details on appropriations; differences between various sub propulsion designs. The book is solid and well-written, but unless you are interested in this arcane area, you can find more interesting biographies. And beware: Because this was unauthorized, Rickover and his staff did not participate and many of the inputs from others are of the vicious, jealous type, so the whole man does not come through in this book very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"This was the book that made me love reading.

That's why I've got to tell you to get any other CD of theirs before this one. \\"A\\" is about the only song I can listen to over and over. The others drag on. Typical of sophomore efforts this album is full of tired songs that didn't make the cut on the first album or else songs that were written before the band got a chance to get used to their new stardom. Maroon and Gordon are the best ones for sheer number of good songs. There is a reason this album doesn't sell as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get much better than this.","review":"I also wrote a little something for Stunt, but since this one is my favorite of BNL, I just couldn't keep my mouth shut. The lyrics are breathtakingly clever and you can't possibly sit still while listening to it. If you thought they began their career with One Week, you're missing out. And if you love One Week, check out the song \\"A\\" on this album. Wrong Man Was Convicted is one of my favorite songs, period (as if the rest of them aren't). It's beautiful and clever. If I started going through the songs I love I'd name the whole album, so I'll stop here. The album is suberbly executed fun. EVERYONE should have this album, and EVERYONE should be a BNL fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot DAMN!","review":"Though no one seems to realize this album exists, it is one of the best CDs I own.

Although it's hard to top \\"Gordon\\", this album did a pretty nice job of it. \\"A\\" wittily shows a relationship gone haywire through a surprisingly peppy, rhyming set of words, while \\"These Apples\\" shows a dire case of miscommunication between two people who are desperately trying to be close. \\"Great Provider\\" is a wonderful song, very thoughtful and serious, but moving. \\"Jane\\" is a song of the \\"perfect\\" girl-- an indecisive, beguiling, beautiful one.

For a long time this book together with Eagleton's Literary Theory served as basic introductions to undergraduates (and slow graduate students) into what was then current critical debate and the history leading up to it. How many must have been shocked to go on and later actually read the work of the critics Lentricchia caricatures only to find out how much richer and more nuanced their work was than Lentricchia had described it. And, alas, how many never went back to the originals because, so misled, they thought they now didn't need to. The disappointing intellectual life of late 90's criticism can in part be laid at the feet of Lentricchia and polemicists like him who reduced scholarly life and serious intellectual debate to comic book polemics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible introduction","review":"What \\"a reader\\" said, and then some.

But for heaven's sake, if you want to know what de Man thought, read \\"The Resistance to Theory\\" (the essay not the book), or something else BY the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky R&B influenced rock.","review":"I originally got this album in 1972 I believe. It was great music then and is still. My original album sounded a bit thin and now, thanks to years of use, scratchy too. Those sound problems have been corrected in this remastered cd re-issue. This one is definitely worth the trouble. The energy literally jumps from the speakers. Make no mistake, this is funky and pure-without any unnecessary commercialism. Jimmy Hall's \\"pretty fly for a white guy\\" soulful vocals combine with Ricky Hirsch's guitar that melds B.B. King's rhythmic style & Clapton's fire power to create a mini-masterpiece within the genre. Also on board is a great rhythm section and one of the tastiest piano players I have ever heard-and I'd just as soon most of the time to have no keyboardist at all. These guys were great and your first listen to this cd is all the proof you'll need to believe it.

However the studio was not this bands natural environment, the stage is where this band really shone. However, this set provides the song base for the incendiary shows that were to follow. It established Jimmy Hall as one of the greatest white soul shouters and Wet Willlie as a band to be reconed with.The disc is a mix of covers and originals. IMHO the highlight is the cover of Elmore James It Hurts Me Too. The structure is completely reworked to make it a soul classic, and when Jimmy sings \\"When things go wrong, Oh SUGAR! It hurts me too\\" it just doesn't get any better. Also a great version of Grits Ain't Groceries.If you love southern bands and great rockin' blues music you need this one in the collection.

Moreover, if you plan to use the headphones while working out, walking, etc... forget it! I need to adjust the fit every minute when in the gym. To be very clear, the sound quality when the fit is just off is very, very mediocre -- you need a perfect fit to hear the full frequency range especially the bass.I strongly recommend that anyone who buys these try them first.

The next step up were the E3's so I thought I'd give them a chance.They sound really great for what I need them for.

The E3C-n does a great job at providing excellent sound reproduction. Bass and volume are both excellent. I don't have to drive my device's volume level as high which means longer battery life. That's great on long flights. I've used the Bose headphones for years and the Shure product is superior. The major downfall is the fit. You definitely have to play around with the different tips to get the best fit. Keeping the earphones in my ears has been a challenge. Simply turning my head to look out the airplane window has resulted in one earbud dislodging or popping out.When fitted properly, outside noises are reduced significantly and the sound is great. I highly recommend them if you can get the fit right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, great support","review":"Bought these to replace a misplaced pair.

I thought I would be uncomfortable having to wear them that long but they were not. I would buy them again if I ever needed to. Also, the ambient sound around me is very minimal letting me enjoy just the sound of my music. If you want artifical sound buy another brand.

They really do cancel 90% of all outside noises. The sound is very high quality. I had trouble getting good bass response at first then I read the instruction manual. It said to try a different size plug (various sizes and types are included). When I tried a smaller size the fit was better and the seal between my ear and the plug was better and the bass really improved.

Not a good purchase for rotations.","review":"This book tries to do way too much for a 'Blueprints' book - I have used 'Blueprints' Pediatrics, Ob/Gyn, Psychiatry, and Neurology (with the first three being the best) and have liked them and found them useful. However, blueprints EM is absurdly laid out with 100+ chapters on everything from Ludwig's angina to intussusception, most of which are about 2 pages. Because of this, there is absolutely no continuity to the book and no overall sense of organization that could possibly impart any long lasting recall onto its reader. I read about a quarter of the book and gave up, finding it incredibly low yield. If you want a quick overview of EM, try 'Emergency Medicine Pearls' instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book buy it now!","review":"This is an easy to use, easy to understand book and has really helped me plan my landscaping to help plan my future planting....

It had a lot of great info for any gardener that suffers from pollen allergies (or cares about family and friends who may be suffering). I just wish that the index of plants was more extensive but I understand this would be very hard to do without getting huge and cumbersome. It does, however, give you tips on how to make smarter choices when selecting plants that was very helpful!

What a joke. This book is good is not for beginners or amateurs. Only buy it if you're running a greenhouse or something. I tried to sell it at a used book store and they didn't even want it cause they had copies. So if you're looking for this book go to used book stores. That way you can thumb through it and see if it's relevant to you or not.

It has the largest section yet written on plants that cause skin rashes, a section on how to tell \\"boy plants\\" from \\"girl plants\\", a huge chapter on poisonous plants and poisonous pollen, an extensive chapter on allergies that animals get, and also one on reducing stress. And just in time for gardening season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly below average","review":"EMI has put out some really fine recording as part of their \\"Red Line\\" series. This isn't one of the better ones. While Gavrilov has all the talent to pull these works off, he isn't helped by poor sound quality. The orchestra sounds unclear and some of the piano passages are muffled. The opening movement is taken at a quick pace (about the same as Rachmaninov himself on RCA), but the second movement really slows to a crawl and Gavrilov almost seems too deliberate. The sense of flow is lost. I don't get the sense that Muti and the Philadelphians are really that involved or that they even care a great deal. The Rhapsody comes off better, more together, but it is almost a consolation prize. On the other hand, perhaps you get what you pay for in this case. There are other excellent Rach 2's at mid price including Ashkenazy/Previn on Decca, Van Cliburn/Reiner on RCA, and Richter/Wistocki on DG, and for a budget price there is a fine performance by Rubinstein/Reiner on RCA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Loving This Game After All These Years","review":"I've owned and played this game for over five (5) years, I still love it and I forgive it the glitches.

This book would prove to be very helpful to those who are coming from a non-technical perspective. It occasionally offers some valuable insights into Microsoft's strategies but it is quite dry for the most part even for a person who has plenty experiences in software development. The Microsoft 'secrets' are not exactly impressive. It would be impossible to know the true secret in a book, otherwise every software company would become a Microsoft (then again, not every company wants to). The book is a bit dated, but nevertheless offers the curious reader some insights into the development and marketing of Microsoft's past successful (and unsuccessful) moves.

In ways, it was different than others I have read on the subject of what is on the other side of life, but I believe it only gives a broader, clearer view. Excellent book for anyone interested in mediumship, or in simply understanding where we go when we leave this life. But one must remember that this is one soul's experience according to how he lived his earthly life, not something that will be everyone's experience. The more you seek to fulfill your individual purpose for being here, and further your own soul growth the more you grow spiritually, surely avoiding the lower spheres alltogether.

THe principles set forth in this book hinder comunication and any sort of theological or philosophical fine-tuning by reducing meaning to application and providing mulitiple perspectives of looking at everything. Rather than a step in the right direction of greater precision in understanding, it is two steps backwards toward theological confusion in the cloak of philosphical sophistication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Treatment of Christian Epistemology","review":"Overall, I felt this was a very strong book from Frame. He addresses the epistemological issues of theology very well in a clear, precise, and cogent manner. Frame promotes his perspectivalism throughout the book as he emphasizes the unity and diversity we encounter in epistemology. I suppose I was expecting a more technical or philosophical treatment of the subject when I picked up the book and felt the book wasn't as technical as I had desired being that I have read much Van Til. Notwithstanding, this book is an excellent read and I would go so far as to say required reading for Christians seeking to get a better grasp of a Biblical worldview and hence its epistemology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had him as a Professor","review":"His theology is a little off.

You never know what happens to Micheal, and you feel so upset. Why don't we find out what happened? The book leaves you with a powerful feeling for days. I would prefer closure.

I normally enjoy all of Leigh Michaels' books; this one is one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, fun, and lighthearted romance","review":"This has been my favorite romance novel for probably 10 years or so. It is such a sweet novel about two people whose friendship turns into something more. It is sweet with nothing raunchy... just a very touching lighthearted romance that leaves your heart happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start and a Great Finish!","review":"The Harlequin romance book, Strictly Business by Leigh Michaels is a wonderful book, I read it a few years ago when I bought it from a used book store and I think it is such a sweet story, it's about a young woman named Gianna West and a young man named Blake Whittaker and they have been best friends since childhood and are now senior partners in the cosmetics company that both their fathers started and when Gianna suggests naming one of their new perfume after a famous model it seemed like a good idea at the time but that was until Blake started dating the beautiful model named Meghan, but really both Gianna and Blake like each other but are both to stubborn to admit it. This book is a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of an evening","review":"For the life of me, I can't understand where these good reviews are coming from. For a thriller, the pace was unbelievably slow, the characters were two-dimensional, the interaction between the husband and wife didn't ring true, and it was filled with \\"idiot moments\\" -- as in, \\"Jeez, only an idiot would do that.\\" The memory loss and the incident on the bridge were never tied to the plot, the ending was predictable, and his constant over-thinking was just plain annoying. I kept reading, hoping it would get better, but I should have followed my impulse to stop after 50 pages of going nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzled","review":"This was a well written book but I have to confess that I don't get it! I found the end very puzzling and I am not sure if he did it or not. I feel rather thick as I usually understand books that I have read. Can anyone explain the end of the story to me? I would appreciate your help as it is driving me crazy! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Change From Normal Mysteries","review":"This book will take you in at the very beginning! George Harrar's attention to detail is astounding and each of the minute aspects will cause your mind to toss and turn throughout the entire novel. One moment you may believe that Evan Birch, the man accused of murdering a 16-year-old cheerleader, is innocent, and then, in the next paragraph, you aren't so sure. At first, I was skeptical about the ending, but, after taking Harrar's reasons and intentions into perspective, I understand where he is coming from and how much better The Spinning Man is because of its unique ending. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spinning Man-Riveting Reading Experience","review":"My book club read The Spinning Man as one of our monthly selections. All of us loved the book for different reasons. It is in some ways a mystery, but not for the reader who wants to know \\"who dunnit?\\" The reader is allowed to wander through the mind of Evan, a philosopher. While the plot SEEMS to be a search for the murderer of a young girl, it is really something else. I don't want to tell too much because the book is so much fun to read. In addition to being what the publicists like to call a \\"page-turner\\", The Spinning Man is a really well-written book. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative","review":"This is a well written \\"did-he-do-it.\\" It centers on a philosophy faculty member in a small college coming to grips with his being implicated in a kidnapping case. The author keeps you guessing as the clues mount up. Did he do it? Is it a case of repressed memory, calculating deception, or unlikely coincidence? Against this, the characters of the detective and the wife wrestle with trying to determine the truth. In fact, this was the dynamic I found most engaging--their determination bumping against his detachment relative to the crime. Don't expect a grand denouement. Rather, prepare to find yourself returning to earlier sections of the book to double check clues to help you decide his guilt or innocence. In fact, it is the very ambiguity of the ending that creates the lasting impression. George Harrar has written a thought provoking book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"The book just wasn't a thriller in any sense of the word. I was unimpressed and was hoping for a thrill at the end and it just fizzled out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery - excellent narrative","review":"The mystery? 50-year old philosophy professor may or may not have murdered a teenager -- a high school cheerleader. If he didn't, why does so much minor evidence, added up, all point to him? He has her lipstick in his car (he gave a ride to a group of kids earlier in the summer), he was spotted near where she works, etc, etc. That is all interesting, well presented. But what really makes this story so good is the interior monolog that he keeps going. And his conversation with his wife. His concern about language/philosophy -- exactness in an era of inexact living. This is a well written book. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Weasel has forgotten why he makes music","review":"Boring, uncatchy, forgettable songs. Where are the hummable melodies and catchy choruses? Where are the hooks that sink into the heart and wont let go? I think Ben has finally succeeded in killing SW. I you want to hear a great punk band listen to older SW. If you want to be sad, listen to this trainwreck of a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Weasel Jumps on the Band Wagon","review":"This album is NOT the Screeching Weasel we know and love. Ben Weasel basically formed an entirely new band prior to writing this album, and then rehashed his sound. Don't be fooled, though: This rehash is more vomit than metamorphosis. Like many other \\"punk\\" bands in the modern era, Ben Weasel attempted to turn his efforts toward softer, gentler, quasi-poetic, quasi-emotional music. The result: An entire mistake. Like \\"Bark Like A Dog,\\" this album lacks the catchiness. It is sadly devoid of the raw sound that made Screeching Weasel good. Watch out for anything that is self-described as \\"Emo,\\" especially when it comes from one of the foremost punkers of the old school. Reattach your balls, Ben."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprisingly average SW release","review":"This will no doubt go down as big disappointment. After the awesome Television City Dream, this CD is very weak. I've listened to it over and over again, and I just can't get myself to like it. Sure there are a couple of good songs (Acknowledge, Last Night), but the majority of the songs just aren't catchy or melodic. The cover of the Cranberries song \\"Linger\\" is also pretty weak. Overall, I've heard worse music in my life... but not by this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"I love this album. Its always in my head. Its the best album, by the best band, ever. You must buy it, and learn every word, and live your life based on what Ben is telling you. Its motivational, real, passionate, and basically just speaks to me on a different level than anything else Ive ever heard. So, buy it now, and dont forget to read the inside cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Emo is a Punk Rock classic. The lyrics are heartfelt and thought provoking while the music is raw and mid-paced pop punk that compliment each other perfectly. If you don't have this record get it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"i would give it a higher rating if i could","review":"i was disapointed by TCD i thought that it was a rushed album, and it had very little to say. Emo proved that Ben was just saving up for the masterpiece. very rarely does an album come along that lets the listener truly connect with the artist and in this case writer. you can feel what Ben has been through and how his life has changed through realizations (Let Go!) He put all of himself out there for us on this one, and the album as a whole reminds me of the writing in Every Night, from Anthem. for those moaning that it is not fast enough, go back and listen to Boogada again.......i'll listen to Emo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the beginning","review":"So, alot of the details have yet to be worked out by cast and crew, the acting can be a little forced, but all these are problems of the first episodes of any tv show. Overall, these eps are a must see as to understand ST:TNG, you gotta get Encounter at Farpoint. It is interesting to learn how all the characters relate to eachother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Q Episode Ever","review":"This episode is the epitome of what the Q should be characterized as. In it, Q (John De Lancie)is a god-like judge presiding over the trial of the human race--the ultimate authority figure! Q is seen as a very menacing figure, first appearing as a fireball that relentlessly chases the Enterprise, then appearing as a threatening judge, ready to exterminate the human species if the verdict is guilty. I think if the creators had stuck with this original notion of a menacing god-like figure instead of a sort of supernatural comic relief as characterized in later episodes, they would've had a much more powerful and appealing character in Q. Unfortunately throughout later episodes Q is made to look like a fool, and his respectability as a true villian is severely compromised. Berman should bring back the Q as a true evil menace in future Star Trek endeavors. If you're like me and want to see Q as a powerful malignant force rather than a court jester, then get this episode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read...not only was it based it my hometown and I know some of these people, but it gives you the kind of compassion not ordinarily given to someone you've never met.

I reccomend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enormous disappoinment","review":"I read the glowing reviews and purchased the book - it is a shame that no one mentioned the fact that 75% of the images used to illustrate the book are black and white photos. The book concerns gardens of the 20th century, and was published in the 21st century - someone needs to let the author know that photographic techniques have advanced quite a bit. At the very least it would have been nice to know that the book I was purchasing with over \\"200 superb photographs\\" were mostly low contrast black and white images. I suppose I should have paid more attention to the \\"printed on thick, glossy paper\\" part of the review as a warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone thinking of going into advertising.","review":"Peter Mayle has a hilarious style all his own.

Even though he is from an older genre of ad people, his ideas and experiences are still valid. He identifies ad people as a special race with special traits and funny habbits that anthropologists should investigate. I especially reccomend this book to beginners who whould like know what to expect from their carriers and to veterans who need a mirror or a good laugh. He is witty and his language is easy going.

At first it seems a bit predictable-but somehow I didn't care because I liked the characters of Jo and Alex so much.

In the pages of this book is a great romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could NOT put down!","review":"I can not say enough about this book! I made the mistake of starting to read it at 4 in the morning. It was so great that I didn't even notice that the sun had come up and the birds were chirping. Luckily... I didn't have to go to work that day because I never got to sleep until 9 a.m. after I read the whole thing in one sitting. This is very rare for me as I usually get bored after 20 minutes of reading.

Montserrat Caballe is the ultimate superstar of Opera, and she demonstrates all that is beautiful in singing,on ever track. Her ave maria from othello is included here. It is one of the best performed arias by Caballe ever, and she ends it with the most heavenly pianissimo you could every imagine. Also included is her magical casta diva from norma. Caballe sings all these arias with her legendary golden sound and extraordinary breath control. In this stunning compilation there is a plethora of examples of long sustained notes, seemless legato, glorious high notes, and magically floated soft piano notes. The cover is also very lovely, with some beautiful photos of Caballe. These cds have great sound, and also play for over two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a pass...","review":"Definitely not up to typical Cuisinart standards.

I just received mine today, and it is a 19.99 quality pan (if that). The bottom does NOT have a enclosed aluminum disk as stated in the Amazon product description, rather a very very thin stainless steel bottom. Anything you might get at WalMart or Target for 20 dollars would be supperior to this roaster. It is not worth the postage to return to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEFS STAY AWAY!","review":"DO NOT buy this roaster if you are at all serious about cooking. It warped immediately in my 500 degree oven, the high temperature I used to start my Thanksgiving turkey.

It's a very nice looking pan that stays nice looking.My only criticism of it is the lack of a non-stick interior. You either will want to line the pan with foil before cooking anything that will generate a mess or where juices might burn, or you'll have to let it soak with a dryer sheet for a while afterwards. The stainless doesn't retain messes so much as it just takes a bit of effort to get it completely clean. But it's worth the effort - the pan cooks evenly, the rack is very sturdy.Worth the money.Watch out for the handles when they're hot - they don't fold down and it's easy to burn the underside of your arm or hands on them when you're moving it around while hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF !!!!!!

I wasn't willing to pay the full price of $140 but found them on Amazon for only $35 and thought I was certainly willing to risk that amount of money. Loved these shoes so much I ended up buying a SECOND pair in one of the other styles from another vendor, and paid almost full price! These mules are like walking in slippers - from the very moment I put them on. They do run large, and my only complaint would be that they are not made in my size of 35 (US size 5). The 36 in this shoe is more like a 6.5. So, I am wearing them every day and ignoring the fact that they are too big - they are that comfortable and cute!

At times flashingly groaning out powerful emotion and with the folsky and talented \\"lost-love\\" feel of NAME, the Goo Goo Dolls have awakened a lost retro dance-club hybernate to the power and feel of alternative rock once it got over its hangover from the dead-over Led Zeppelin-like grunge era.

With such powerful songs, like the Twister soundtrack favorite \\"Long Way Down\\", to the snazzy \\"Only One\\", to even the mildly popular \\"Naked\\", this album is not only one of the Goo's best, but rock's best as well.

Until then the only radio station that really played their music was Buffalo's New Rock 103.3 the Edge. This album contains both punk and softer sounds. Before this album, they usually just played awesome punk music. After this album, they played more soft and boring music. Eventually their music became worst and worst although it gave more radio play on bad radio stations like soft rock stations or pop stations that suck. This album isn't their best (their earlier music is better) but has some really good songs like \\"Long Way Down,\\" \\"Somethin' Bad,\\" \\"Disconnected,\\" and \\"Slave Girl.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"One \\"Name\\" + 12 lame","review":"How about a cross between the Hooters and Guns and Roses at their worst? Bought the album because of the catchy and thoughtful \\"Name\\". The rest of the album is all over the place. Some of the songs sound identical, some are trying to be punk, some are trying to be GNR (why?), sounds like a different vocalist on every song. The lyrics and guitar riffs seem generic and recycled. A major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....................","review":"Ugh. This music is for the same people who can find 3EB or Matchbox 20 talented. Incredibly boring.

Their music has been done before.There are so many artists who do that type of stuff.Even in the first place I don't think that style is all that great;alot of guitars and instruments all cluttered together plus an off-pitch scratchy voice on top of it.Even though its not really loud I consider it alot of boring noise.BOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Just about the most generic pop rock CD ever. The GGD aren't the worst band (Dizzy Up the Girl isn't too bad) but geez this one is horrible; don't buy it unless you're a die hard GGD fan who isn't happy without everything the guys have recorded. Anyone who has heard and appreciated Smashing Pumpkins' genius \\"Siamese Dream\\" ( a VERY different album ) knows that pop doesn't have to be all cheesy, generic and adult-contemporary like the GGD's halfhearted efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful mediocre 90s junk!","review":"I think i watched the lead singer trash some 80s bands or something on vh1. maybe it was matchbox 20 i dont know it doesnt matter. this music sounds like a mild hell. its not as bad as grunge but reeks a little of the same. the lead singer was trashing bands with keyboards. Because like most 90s groups didnt use anything but noisy horrid sounding guitars.im sorry groups like berlin duran duran the go gos could sing and the music had originality and catch beats and backgrounds. actually people still remember those great songs from the 80s. what song is remembered from the poo poo halls? they all sound the same with no hooks and a chainsaw chorus. this music falls under barbaric redneck white trash with no intelligence or taste music. those 80s songs that used other instuments like pianos and violins and keyboards is in the same category as patsy cline or bach. this music is infinite crud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too General","review":"I picked up this book because of Lonely Planet's good name.

I only visited one island and there weren't enough listings to make purchasing this book worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too General to be of Help","review":"It begins with a long trail-less intro with info about Hawaii that can be found in other sources. This is followed by descriptions of a few trails on each island.Only a few trails are covered, so unless you plan a specific trail, the book is not much help. If you use the book to choose a trail one \\"advantage\\" is that you will not have many to choose from (and the number choices in Hawaii is staggering).Knowing a bit about the Oahu trails, not necessarily the best are covered and the ones included are not fully representive.The bus directions are good addition, because not all the trails are loops making the logistics for tourists difficult. I would advise anyone relying on this information for to check the schedules which can be found on the internet (search for The Bus Hawaii)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assumes you are using public transportation??","review":"Maybe I haven't looked up enough hikes, but it seems to assume you will be taking the bus to all the hikes, and says nothing about driving directions or where to park. For instance, on p. 79 for the Maunawili Demonstration Trail, it says how you should start walking from town. It says nothing about parking. Then from the end of the trail, it says how to take a bus back to town. Although it would be handy for those who ARE stuck with public transportation, I feel they should include enough info for drivers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"expressive watercolor painting","review":"Watercolor Bold and Free is a unique book as it offers inspiration and examples for painters trying to break free from inhibiting or standard regulations in watercolor. This is one of the rare books about watercolor that lead to expressive painting. This book gives the painter many outlooks such as abstract compositions and a myriad of techniques including pourings and dreamscapes.Most watercolor books claim to help free the painter but usually they are within strict confines and often want the reader to copy step by step the thoughts of the author.The great thing that Lawrence Goldsmith does is to offer many options and ideas and examples with different views . All the pages are full of new directions that allow each painter to find their own expression.What a great and refreshing and helpful book! Thank you Lawrence Goldsmith for this great teaching guide!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Randy's lyrics direct from God's word.","review":"Shining down from the Father of lights is one song everyone must hear.

Then this is the album for you!

The language is a little rough, but most people talk that way anyhow, when they aren't in church.

I strongly recommend reading \\"Standing at the Scratch Line\\" first. King Tremain is a person I looked up to. I feel as if I know him. I also cried like a baby at the end of the book.

Frankly it is a complete waste of time and money as it DOES NOT deliver on the claims made about it.

Anyway, after having used the book so much I went ahead and purchased a copy. Love how it's a small book and the ideas (games/rhymes, etc) are sectioned out by age. Some of the rhymes or activities seem a little odd and ancient, and I wonder about their origin, but I've used enough of the material to make it a worthwhile and recommended purchase for new parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Games we'd play anyway and some NEVER","review":"So I'm flipping through the book and thinking \\"Did I actually pay money for this?\\". So many of the activities were things that I (and many other parents) are already doing with our babies. Like playing with rattles, talking to your baby while looking in the mirror, kicking at toys, pointing to objects and saying the sounds they make, peek-a-boo, waving bye-bye... you get the idea. But the moment I knew I wanted to get my refund was when in the 0-3 months section, the author suggested going to the hardware store to buy a blank set of keys to put on a strong ring to \\"make great noise and be cool teethers\\". The thought of my infant's delicate gums knawing away at the sharp edges of metal keys--YIKES!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book with Suggestions","review":"I am now raising my 3 year old granddaughter who is disabled.

This put me in a difficult position because I've never been around babies before. So, I put away my pride but kept searching for ideas on my own too. That's how I found this book. Lansky has included a lot of great ideas for helping you interact with your baby in creative ways. I agree that it is not perfect (and am not sure that any book really is), but this can be easily overlooked due to the other very redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent primer of natural history","review":"In a nutshell, this book shaped me like no other as a child. I received it on my fifth birthday and was spellbound by the detailed art. Being an animal and dinosaur fanatic as a child, I spent years poring over this book, time and again, learning about the history of the planet and the evolution of flora and fauna. It also turned me into an avid reader, as I was propelled to decipher words like \\"Devonian\\" at 7 years old (which in turn made me an A+ student in every subject in every grade; reading is the key folks...).Anyway, I loved this book as no other and am now enjoying sharing it with my children. While it is not a children's book, per se, kids will be fascinated by the artwork and drawn to read more about the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fostering a Scientific Imagination","review":"I am actually looking at the 1952 edition of this book as I write this. Like the previous reviewer, I was given this book as a child & devoured it. It helped make me a lifelong reader & gave me a life-long interest in the natural world. I cannot think of a better way to prime a child's imagination. The illustratons opened worlds to me & the text explained those worlds. Even this old edition is refreshingly free from religious qualifications of Darwin: you get the straight stuff here.

An estimated 40000 Chinese died in Singapore alone due to these massacres. Were these fabricated by the Chinese government also?

Alisha's Attic are one of Britain's best-kept musical secrets. This, their 3rd album is an album overflowing with ace tunes & incisive musical & lyircal capability, that it's tragic that these 2 sisters are not recognised further. From the infectiously catchy first single, which chronicles their relationship as sisters (Push It All Aside) to the Venetian mood of the tragically gorgeous Pretender Got My Heart, this album mesmerises me with its tunes. My personal fave is Perfectly Happy which rolls between a jaunty verse & a power-chorus. If you like you music to be accessible & are unafraid to take the road less travelled, you could do MUCH worse than purchase this album.

I also liked Rose of Tibet by the same author. Under Plum Lake is pretty strange - it's the classic tale of the Garden of Eden, or Shangri-La, the protagonist is shown paradise and then shown the door, cast back into his normal life. However, it has a tragic effect on him - he can't function in his real world anymore because he longs to go back to the underwater paradise, it's all he can think about. Well-written, very colorful, sad and even stressful - also it seemed a lot like an LSD trip. By the way, one of my favorite books as a kid that I found again as an adult is Tom's Midnight Garden, although it is meant for a younger reader it is just as engrossing and evocative as Under Plum Lake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare and haunting beauty","review":"I first read this wonderful book years ago, and it has remained with me ever since, like a vivid and rich dream. It's not merely the intensely colorful images, one after another, but the tone of the story itself: awed, and yet afraid that it might indeed be just a dream, and even more afraid that it might be lost forever. As previous reviewers can testify, this is a book that stays with you, lingering with a melancholy, yearning glow. Urgently in need of reprinting!

A movie is a way to pass the time, and this one sure delievers.

In the making of this movie the producers even trashed the film by using the Hildago flag which was way back around 1800 and nothing to do with Alamo ,but confuse things a bit more. The REAL FLAG of the ALAMO for 176 years remains in MEXICO CITY on display for all the world to see in THE NATIONAL MUSEUM of MEXICO. It's a shamefull thing to not only hide HISTORY but to CHANGE history for a purpose of personnal gain... well that's just a crime.

It is more factual than the other Alamo movies but it is too drawn out at times and still failed to get all of the facts straight. For its length, the characters are not developed too well. Another problem is that the Hispanic soldiers at the Alamo are not represented well. There were many Tejano soldiers at the battle yet Juan Seguin and Gregorio Esparza are the only two with much screen time. The final battle sequence was not too bad but if you look close enough, there are too many single shot guns being fired more than once without them being reloaded. The movie could have been better considering some of the talent found in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A low budget, made-for-TV film.","review":"It was filmed on the same set as John Wayne's \\"The Alamo,\\" it uses stock footage from \\"The Last Command,\\" and it reshows the same action scenes over and over again to flesh out the rather weak looking battle. There was not much of a budget for this movie.Yes, this movie is more historically accurate than virtually all the other cinematic Alamo versions. (Is that really saying much?) But artistically it is at the bottom of the barrel. Acting wise, the only real bright spot of the movie is young Alec Baldwin's Travis.Watch for Ethan Wayne, the Duke's youngest son, in a bit role as an Alamo defender. (He is wearing a coonskin cap that is identical to the one his father wore in his Alamo movie.) Also James Arness, who plays Bowie, was the Duke's first choice to play that same role in \\"The Alamo.\\" Arness had to pass due to prior commitments."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliched","review":"I found this to be an overall disappointing movie despite some added historical accuracy towards the subject than earlier efforts (eg, the attack began before dark, etc) and also more from the Mexican point of view.

That's how I feel about Monster. I think if this album existed in a vacuum, without any of R.E.M's history and context to shade people's reactions, it would be regarded as a masterpiece. Every song has an original, exciting melody that fits surprisingly well in the gigantic swamp of guitars that frames each song (I know it's R.E.M. heresy but I believe these melodies are on par with those found on Murmur). It's actually quite surprising Stipe's voice is so clear and up front in these songs. That's a testament to the recording and mixing quality. The lyrics reach a perfect crossroads of Slogans & Poetry here on Monster. It's a beautiful album that vibrates you into bliss with distortion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushing the Creativity Envelope","review":"Creating a \\"Monster\\" like this was a bold move on R.E.M.'s part in late 1994. They had just created two \\"Monster\\"ous successes with the quiet \\"Out of Time\\" and \\"Automatic For The People\\" in 1990 and 1992, respectively. But that is what makes R.E.M. a \\"Monster\\" of a rock and roll band. They are always pushing the creativity envelope further. \\"What's the Frequency Kenneth?,\\" \\"Bang and Blame,\\" \\"Crush With Eyeliner,\\" and \\"Star 69.\\" are all \\"Monster\\"- sized, heavy metal- tinged hits. Overall, this LP is a rock \\"Monster,\\" showing that you can still purchase a rock and roll album today without turning into a \\"Monster.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"More growl than roar with Monster","review":"REM turns the amps to 11,chuck the mandolins,and sing about sex,fame,& power.Ziggy Stipe-dust you say?Monster may be the REM CD that fills their used CD section,but it's a brave piece of work that continue to amaze,yet puzzle some.Those who jumped on the Losing My Religion-bandwagon,will jump right off(I must admit I'm one of those,but it made me check out their earlier albums,and I've been a devoted fan ever since).What's The Frequency,Kenneth kicks it into high gear,while Crush With Eyeliner take the Aladdin Sane-esque route.Bang & Blame,King of Comedy,Let Me In and You makes this album a worthwhile collection.Although with all the overdrive in the guitars,the rhythm section sounds kind of flabby in the middle,especially compared to Pearl Jam & Nirvana.But you know its REM ,always doing it their way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster ~ R.E.M.","review":"This is indeed not the most consistent album REM has ever made but this is a daring and creative experiment.

I think it's brilliant. In fact it's my favorite R.E.M. album. Most people don't like it because it's loud and distorted, but thats the point! Their last couple of albums were mostly acoustic and they felt they took that as far as they could. So the right thing to do was to go the opposite way and make an album like Monster. I kind of think of it as their version of The Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat (but better). If you are a fan of bands like Nirvana and The Smashing Pumpkins this should be your first R.E.M. album."},{"rating":"2","title":"REM's last Rock & Roll album","review":"This is one of my favorite REM albums. It has some bite to it that few others of theirs do. Although not as much bite as unbridled Punk Rock, but you get the idea (if you've heard this album in relation to the rest of REM's catalogue). \\"What's The Frequency\\", \\"Bang the Blame\\", and \\"Let Me In\\" are songs I really like. Ironically \\"Let Me In\\" is dedicated to Kurt Cobain (a selfish little imp I could never stand), but musically it's a great song. It has some fan-tabulous distortion provided by a guitar that was actually owned by Cobain that Stipe acquired. I know. I'm torn.Anyway, this is a great album overall. Buy it along with Automatic for the People. Use your discretion if buying anything after Monster. There's some dull sh*t to be found in the \\"new\\" REM."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think they regret this one","review":"Clearly the worst R.E.M. album, \\"Monster\\" probably deserves 2.5 stars or even three, but it's been overpraised here, so there you go. I don't mind a band trying new things -- in fact, I encourage it -- but they also must play to their strengths at least a little, and this album does anything but. Most of the songs, drenched in a fuzzy crunch of sound, just sit there, absolutely grooveless. The first three songs --\\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\", \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\" and \\"King of Comedy\\" felt like a bad dream when I first heard them. The album gets better, and familiar R.E.M. attributes do crop up. \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream\\" is nice, the countryish lilt of \\"Strange Currencies\\" work surprisingly well, \\"Bang and Blame\\" is flat-out great, and \\"Let Me In\\" is subtly harrowing. I do like the pummeling \\"Circus Envy\\" too -- one of the few fuzzed-up bashers here that works. All in all, disappointing, but there are flashes of brilliance here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the frequency, Michael?","review":"Let me start off by saying I am not an \\"R.E.M. snob\\" who thinks the band's last good album was released in say 1985 or so. In fact, \\"Monster\\" was the band's first album that I truly did not like. It starts off with the fantastic single and Dan Rather diss \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" and then its straight downhill from there. One problem, I think, is that this was R.E.M.'s long promised return to their rockin' roots. By this point, they were simply no longer capable of creating interesting harder edged songs.

I'm an REM fan, and I own nearly all of their CDs and this one is far and away my least favorite. There are a couple of decent tracks on here. I actually think \\"What's Your Frequency, Kenneth?\\" is a bit OVERrated, but it's not bad. \\"Bang and Blame\\" is pretty good, but it's not worth suffering through the rest of the album to get there.

As if grunge needed another contributor to its sorry genre. If you want to hear R.E.M. rock hard, get Dead Letter Office and hear their version of Toys In The Attic.

For want of less stars, I put down 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"Okay, Amazon, thanks for telling me how to feel. \\"Strange Currencies\\" better than \\"Everybody Hurts\\"? I don't think so. As many people have pointed out, there are only two goods songs on here (and both are classics): \\"What's the Frequency\\" and \\"Bang the Blame\\". It's so dissapointing that REM can't put out a totally solid album. With this band, it seems their hits are all classics (rightfully), and everything else is just mediocre or worse.

People were shocked and have ragged on this CD more than any other REM CD. But REM wanted to lock the mandolins and keyboards so prominent on those two CDs in the closet and make a rock and roll record. And they did a very good job. What's the Frequency Kenneth is one of their catchiest rockers, while I Took Your Name and Let Me In are great car radio songs. I will say that REM's worst song ever is on Monster (Bang and Blame - give me Shiny Happy People any day) which knocks this down to 4 stars instead of 5.

Probably works fine, but I don't use that feature.What makes these guys my favorite is that they have a truly tight seal.

Johnston has not attempted to ape Waugh's style, so it is as if Waugh was one friend of Charles Ryder, and Michael Johnston another! Johnston writes in a more female-friendly way than Waugh, making it a bit more accessible perhaps.

Obviously,not as good as their eariler works like their self-titled lp or 'MacBeth' (see my reviews of both). But for the asking price, 'Brain Waves' would be worth checking out for yourself. Most semi-impressive tracks here are \\"Dance With Dolphins\\", the very English folk-sounding ten-minute \\"Water Into Wine\\" and the tribal \\"Psychedelic Trance Dance\\". Line-up: (seems that a few of these members play OTHER instruments on other TEB discs) Mick Carter-guitar, Glen Sweeney-percussion, Neil Black-violin and Lyn Dobson-synthesizer,flute&vocal. Some interesting sounds, no doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too $$ for the Kindle","review":"I just had to express frustration on how the publisher is over charging Kindle owners. I would love to read this. Its clear the book has been out for a while. Why is it 16.99 for the Kindle, while its 11 something for a paperback? It should be cheaper for the Kindle edition. I am seeing this on quite a number of books and its clear publishers are not being fair towards Kindle owners. So I won't be reading this book. Get back to me when you decide to offer a fair price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Version Originale","review":"There are some great songs on this album. I enjoyed Car Tape (2002) which was an album of covers but Miller's vocals and music superbly blend on Version Originale. The opening duet 'I can't tell' with Tim Rogers provides a lovely opening song with further highlights throughout. Excellent backing vocals and musicians including Shane O'Mara who produced the album, Jen Anderson and others. Richly interwoven songs (all written by Miller) that I've been playing over and over. A terrific collection by a very talented artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective battery","review":"Windows showed the battery charged 89%, but disconnection of AC shut down the notebook.Checked by HP instruction and after 30 min of battery charging the notebook did not turn on.Very disappointed with this product and by Amazon.com, selling it to loyal customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff","review":"This is one of Ronson's earliest books but it's still relevant today. Great read, especially while on vacation because it's sure to spark fun conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"What makes conspiracy theorists tick?","review":"Them takes us on tour of the world's extreme conspiracy theorists, to see what they have in common.As an armchair conspiracy theorist myself (who wishes the REALLY crazy ones would stop ruining the credibility of real conspiracies), I found this a fun look at some really wacky people.The author takes us to David Icke, who believes the world is being run by giant green lizards. We go to the Jewish Anti-Defamation League, who thinks David Icke is anti-semitic (giant lizard is code for Jew). We go to a branch of the KKK who sees itself as the kinder, gentler KKK. We follow the author as (himself Jewish) almost gets killed in an Aryan camp. We follow him as he sneaks into the world-dominating Builderberg Groups secret camp and video tapes a ritual.This book neither contributed nor detracted from my belief that conspiracies may exist. It did give me a better understanding of conspiracy theories and the kooks behind them. It was also very fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant, Amusing and Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a light, easy read and it was quite funny. I like Jon Ronson and I admire him for his courage.I'm not sure how much of the book I believe. I think that in a general sense it is probably all true-to-life but some of the specifics must have been embellished, if only to make them funnier. The occasional lack of believability doesn't make the book less enjoyable.Mr. Ronson showed a great deal of the human side of the extremists he studied. His exploration of the events behind the Ruby Ridge incident was particularly poignant.I'd like to see a followup story that describes the reactions of the people he interviewed for this book at having their stories published, having fun poked at them, etc. I wonder which of them (if any) were flattered/angry/pleased, etc. by it.This book was one of my favorite reads of the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes creepy, mostly silly","review":"Jon's account of visiting with extremists of various sorts is engaging in the sense that he makes you wish you had the time to do what he did in writing the book. His style is glib and easy to read, which keeps the book flowing along. While the book seems to be written for humor, Jon also manages to make the folks he meet seem less scary because of how silly they all are. In a strangely comforting way, you find that many bullies really are cowards - and that's not a bad thing. Overall, a fun, easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this for real??","review":"As one who has done a lot of research on extremists and has met and investigated many of them, I find this a very shallow book. I can't believe he had not heard of the Bilderbergers before he started the book. It just fell flat with me. I find it hard to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance is Bliss","review":"Jon Ronson makes an attempt to get you \\"sympethetic\\" about so-called extremists, that they're just trapped in their own minds, when he really has no evidence that they're wrong in their theories. He tries to get us to see the ridiculosness of David Ickes lizard theory when in reality, David Icke has the most comprehensive and on the mark evidence of the world leader's to date. Jon Ronson like's to make himself look good and make himself look like the most intelligent in each situation, when he really is the ignorant one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, stupid stupid!","review":"Too much garbage clouds the facts, if there are any.

Its certainly not for everyone but it is really interesting and at times quite humorous. Worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Them: Adventures with Extremists","review":"Truth truly is stranger than fiction. Jon Ronson's _Them_ is a *must read*. Ronson exhibits an uncommon journalistic integrity by not only reporting objectively and evenly, but also by communicating the humanity of each individual he encounters, whether central or pivotal to the plot(s), and regardless of their views or slant on the world-abilities sadly lacking in today's frequently biased, branded, market-segmented, fickle and sensationalist [particularly U.S.] media by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, yes, yes!","review":"Another \\"Daily Show\\" guest author that I enjoy time and time again.The height of absurd, chilling, and just unbelievable situations Mr Ronson finds himself in is worth the read. It is not a merely satirical piece on hate groups or conspiracy theorists, but there are some really thought provoking chapters, especially about the Ruby Ridge Siege.HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't appreciate the study of group paranoia, although its there","review":"I didn't appreciate the study of group paranoia, although it's there.

It also helped me explain the crazy politics of extremists in the U.S. to my European friends who are always asking, \\"how did that guy get elected?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Faux naif not always good idea","review":"It is interesting that Jon Ronson comes out on top in all of these encounters. This is the problem with the faux naif style. The book is full of episodes where Ronson says things lilke: 'But Omar, I thought we were becoming friends?' Why is it necessary that he become friends with these people? It begs the question of does he like them really in the first place? I think he was being a little dishonest about his motives in this book. He claims to be genuinely interested in understanding their point of view but ends up giving them enough rope to hang themselves. This is what he does in all his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope *you* discover this writer!","review":"The publishing of Gerald Shapiro's book Little Men is a built-in pro-argument for university publishing houses (in this case: Ohio State University). Will this book comprised of a couple of novellas as well as short stories make money? Who knows? First principles first: Publish!As hilarious as the opening novella A Box Of Ashes, is with a laugh-a-minute (you can time yourself on this) pacing; it is the closing novella Spivak in Babylon that hit this reader with especial poignancy. In the story's closing pages, Mr. Shapiro doesn't tie-up in a neat bow, the dirty deeds chronicled about Leo Spivak. Instead he opts for a utterly realistic 'how-it-is'and 'how-it-it'will-be' when you go down that road to perdition and betrayal of everything/anything dear to your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Petty - 'Wildflowers' (Warner Brothers)","review":"Tom Petty had apparenty put out a second solo effort,the follow-up to his honey of an lp 'Full Moon Fever'.'Wildflowers' has fifteen cuts,most of which carry their weight on the disc rather well.Tunes I found myself sort of tapping my toes to were the Petty-esque \\"You Don't Know How It Feels\\",\\"Time To Move On\\",the Dylan-like \\"Honey Bee\\",\\"To Find A Friend\\" and \\"Wake Up Time\\".Don't just assume this CD isn't going to be any good beacause the Heartbreakers aren't mentioned in the artist's name;this release rocks!In fact,I could see Petty including several of these songs in his live sets.Ever see Tom Petty&The Heartbreakers play live?They're not to be missed.Old fashioned well-written rock&roll,as with most Petty albums.A nice find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but good.","review":"This collection is much different than Tom's work with the Heart breakers. This is probably more mature than any Heart breakers CD. Still highly recommended for the ultimate Tom Petty fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My niece wrecked my cd so she had t obuy me another one. I looked at Wal Mart, Target, Meijer, K Mart, FYE, Best Buy & no one had this cd. I went to every store in my city that sells music but I was unable t ofind it. I decided to order it from Amazon & sure enough they had it. I am happy with my cd & with my order from Amazon too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this record now","review":"Pay no attention to Mr. Himes' scathing review, this in my opinion, is simply one of the best rock and roll records of all-time.Petty abandoned his familiar three-chord format on Wildflowers and seemingly set out to make an *album* in the same sense as Sgt. Pepper or Pet Sounds. His songwriting took a huge leap on this record and there's simply not a throw-away cut.Petty-esque rock and roll, great ballads and a hint of psychedelia. It's all here. EASILY one the best records of the last 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mild and Wild","review":"While it would be helpful to like Tom Petty to appreciate \\"Wildflowers,\\" I think this is an excellent album regardless, with a good balance of slow and fast, soft and loud songs. It suprised me that just the more mellow songs made it on the Top 40 list, so anyone buying this album might be surprised when they get to some of the heavier songs such as \\"Honey Bee.\\" Overall, this is probably one of Petty's best albums in the last few years better than Echo and what I've heard of \\"The Last DJ.\\" I would recommend the soundtrack to a forgettable movie, \\"She's the One\\" because Petty did all the music for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildflowers","review":"As a huge Tom Petty fan, I find the statement for this album, \\"Tom Petty is like a Beatle immitating Bob Dylan,\\" a huge understatement and insult to Petty's maturing music repetoire. After all, this album did win a Grammy the year it was released. The album is beautiful, especially with the use of a full orchestra on certain tracks. It is naive to assume that the music of a true artist will stay stagnant through time, or that without the Heartbreakers' accompanyment, Petty will not come up with something completely original and unique from their sound. This is my favorite Petty album produced so far. It is absolutely flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"completely awesome","review":"This is one of the greatest rock and roll records of the nineties, hands down. Tom Petty has created an album that can be listened to in any mood your in, (sad,happy,depressed,partying) whatever. its awesome. there is not a bad song on here, from the acoustic(wildflowers) to the all out rocking (you wreck me), its all good. if you are in need of a solid rock album and have not yet heard tom petty, this is the album to get. also, \\"you dont know how it feels\\" is in my opinion one of the greatest smoking anthems of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Petty","review":"While one could make the argument that all Tom Petty songs have a certain tone to the story or music, I would contend that all of the \\"greats\\" have a specific \\"sound\\" and it is the subtlety in the songs that make the journey interesting. Here Tom Petty brings things to a very intimate level, the subject of these songs is in part dealing with his recent divorce at the time (if I recall correctly). The music though is a more stripped down \\"summer\\" or \\"innocence\\" sound. Not the kind of naive innocence that we have as kids, but a weathered innocence; the refusal to be corrupted by the tragedies in life, rather to persevere and hope to find oneself in calm waters again with the sun on the face and feet in the water. This album is still rocking, in touch with Petty's persistent rebel spirit. Great album though all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vibes coming through my stereo","review":"I listen to this when I write, and come up with the best stories. I listen to this while I work on my headphones,and the day goes by so fast, I listen to this when I am blue and it heals me.Some of the songs are serious rock n' roll, but others are little pieces of philosophy. from \\" you don't know how it feels \\" - people come, people go , some grow young some grow cold. And \\"from time to move on\\" - broken skyline which way to Love Land ? Which way to forgiveness ? Which way do I go ? The guitar riffs in between the lyrics of 'don't fade on me ' are right up there with pink floyd's master guitar solos.Also my one friend who is this tough cynical person, heard wildflowers and sang along in this childlike voice ,like it took her back to a happy place before all the bad happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"First of all, I LOVE this album. I love every song on it. You Dont Know How It Feels made me want to pick the harmonica back up and play again after years of messing around with it. I feel that this is Tom at his best. Many on here do not think so, thats ok. You all are entitled to your opinions, but as for me, I love this album from start to finish. I turned a friend on to this one, and had to buy myself another copy. I did not mind. I love to turn people on to great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"One great C.D., it's one you can hit play and just keep listening. So many good songs.

Some songs are annoying (\\"Honey Bee,\\" \\"You Don't Know How it Feels\\") but for the most part this is a top-notch album. Petty comes out with his softer side with \\"To Find a Friend,\\" \\"Time to Move On,\\" and the title track. \\"You Wreck Me\\" evokes early Heartbreakers tunes. In general, this is a softer album than Heartbreakers fans are used to, and that's why it's great. It's not quite a five-star album, but it definitely deserves 4 1/2."},{"rating":"2","title":"a man who's paid his dues can afford to be artistic","review":"To begin with, this album is outstanding! I love all the variety on it, from soft ballads to rocking tunes. When I first bought this album, after owning just about everything else from Tom Petty (even, gulp, the Traveling Wilburys fiasco), I could recognize that this was more of an artistic album. I think Tom Petty has spent practically his whole life doing what is commercially correct, and that the Wildflowers album represents somewhat of a cutting loose or stepping away from that constraint. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest albumn ever released","review":"Every single song on here could be on a greatest hits record.

I am an avid music fan with hundreds of albums in my collection and this one of the ones that I can always put on at any time and listen to start to finish. There isn't a weak tune to be found and it's the barometer by which to measure the rest of his work. I believe it's not only his best album - with honorable mentions going to \\"Full Moon Fever\\", and the underrated \\"The Last DJ\\" - but also one of my favorite albums of all time. You cannot call yourself a Petty fan without it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, the world would swing if Tom were King..","review":"Worth owning, for the incomparable \\"It's Good To Be King\\" which, with the much older \\"Free-falling\\" stands out as Petty's signature masterpiece of American male guilt and regret. Both share a lyrical self-delusion, and both have transcendently pretty tunes. \\"It's Good to be King\\" is jaded, hypnotic, tired and heartsore, and it ends with a remarkable 16-bar orchestration by Michael Kamen that absolutely leaps out at you. The first time I heard it, it reminded me of another lovely orchestration, that of \\"Diamond Dust\\" on Jeff Beck's \\"Blow by Blow\\"--, with much the same tone of edgy remorse.The rest of this CD is pleasant but unremarkable. Tom Petty hasn't changed his haircut nor his sound in decades, but that's not a bad thing. As he ages, I find I enjoy his wisdom and simple tunes more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Modern Jazz","review":"Boney James is one of my all-time favorite saxophonists, and this album itself is bathed in the great jazz flavors of the early 90s. Album takeaways, for me, are \\"Another Place, Another Time\\" and \\"Metropolis\\" - but this album also contains one of my very favorite songs ever written: \\"Lily.\\" I can be having the worst of days, but when I listen to this song, I am immediately so relaxed, and it never fails to do this. Highly recommended piece of hallmark jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but nothing great.","review":"The book is a modified version of Swindoll's sermons on 2 Corinthians.

Absolutely no Beastie Boys interviews or music on this one. A lot of panning and zooming in and out on stock photography though.2) A 1999 audio CD called \\"Maximum Beastie Boys\\".

I've found that the working mothers I know just don't have a lot of time to spend with their children after working all day, coming home and cooking and cleaning and doing the things that need to be done.Plus it perpetuates the myth of \\"quality\\" time which I think is a very dangerous concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Mama Comes Home","review":"We have been using this book in our Child Development Center for years.

The comforting notion seems to resonate with them that after a long day, mama will come home to the sweet bedtime routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Such a great gift for Mom's who will be returning to work. It reminds little ones how special they are and that Mama will spend time with them when she gets home.

Consider the difference. There are times when it makes sense to do the same thing right, over and over again, without slipping. But there are also times, and types of activities, where doing something in a very new and different way is essential. The real-life examples in this book support these 11 methods for finding new ways of doing things, and producing new kinds of products and services. Worthwhile reading for anyone who wants to inject a little spice into the routine of software development and delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I thought the book was a great way to think of different approaches to common work situations. Anything that sparks creativity and conversation is always a good thing in my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories, Doable Wisdom","review":"But Sutton's approaches to innovation are as wise as they are weird -- and eminently doable. Filled with wonderfully compelling stories in contexts as varied as high tech start-ups to large established companies to rock and roll bands, the book will force any reader who cares about fostering creativity to rethink many of their assumptions about how they manage. But he doesn't stop at good stories. Sutton seamlessly weaves in a wide range of management theories to elaborate his accounts of innovation successes and failures.This will undoubtedly become a classic among management texts on innovation. But it should also be read by anyone who wants some wonderful ideas for managing and people who simply want a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure worth having","review":"Years ago, my aunt bought me a copy of this book. I read it cover to cover many times, and even used it as an episode guide when the public broadcasting station showed the series from the Hartnell years. Sadly, through financial difficulties, I lost my copy and mourbed the loss. I searched for years trying to find a copy but all I found were softcover. I came across this, at a decent price, and jumped on it. I am happy to say it was like going back in time when I first received my copy. The stories, information, illustarions, everything is worth looking at.

Very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain junk","review":"Not sure if these were ever a good product, but this seller obviously has no problem selling old junk that is worthless. Not only did the majority and I mean major majority, barely even glow, the ones that actually did glow(green and blue) lasted a couple minutes.These people should be ashamed because they know that the odds are this purchase would be for children to enjoy, and they don't hesitate to cruelly disappoint them.Trust me, stay away from these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL - Straight to the trash","review":"Don't buy these.

His high notes are strain to the max and he sounds like he's singing in half falsetto.A total disappointment. I recommend Gigli and Del Monaco instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have CD set for opera buffs.","review":"In my opinion, Jussi Bjorling has the best tenor voice for which we have, at least, acceptable quality recordings. Some might argue that Enrico Caruso had a better voice but any recordings of Caruso are of such poor quality that you can't appreciate his instrument.If you love listening to the operatic tenor repertoire then treat yourself to this CD set.I might add that my opinion is based upon having studied as an operatic tenor for more years than I care to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introductory course for beginers","review":"It is a good german course, it begins with the classical method of self introducing and advance to more complex figures. As in any language that I learned you must take your time, pay attention and be consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onmogelijk! This has *got* to be a practical joke.","review":"Having grown up and matriculated through elementary and high schools as well as college in The Netherlands, I know what a difficult language it is. It has oftentimes been compared that, for a non-Dutch speaking person, it is akin to learn Mandarin.Not quite impossible, but very, very difficult.A book and CD set cannot possibly cover all of that for the Dutch language, and the dearth of sets like these for Mandarin proves my point."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really a good starter book","review":"if you don't know a thing about the dutch language this is certainly not a good starter book. I've read better books and better explaination. being dutch myself I know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Daryl Buitenlander...","review":"For a person beginning to learn dutch, I found this book to be extremly frustrating at times. Ive learned a forgien language before and I know this is not the way to learn a language. Learning a language is not about memorizing phrases and then repeating them by hearing them by some silly dialogue. The excercises seemed like the authors were really lazy and wanted you to make up your own excercises instead of practicing sentence syntax and structure. I would suggest the colloquail series too. (although ive only done the second series so far..and not thefirst) I did this series twice (because i didnt really know where to go to find an inexpensive dutch beginners book) and i cant say it vastly improved my dutch skills. If youre looking for a book to help you speak conversationally on a trip to the netherlands, this might be a book for you. If youre serious about actually learning dutch, get something with more substance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent course - I recommend without hesitation.","review":"I spend six months as an exchange student in Amsterdam - I got hold of this book two months before I went and worked through it thoroughly. It is absolutely excellent. I was prepared for all the basic everyday things very well, and Dutch people were surprised but delighted at how well I could speak the language. The dialogues on the CD are very good practice, particularly since some speakers speak in the Belgian (Flemish) accent, so you can also get used to that. The pace is fast, and I had to listen to some dialogues several times before I could understand every word, but that's no reason not to get it. I've just bought the TY Spanish book which is equally great."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get a lot for what you pay","review":"While not the best language course in the world, it is surprisingly good for its value. In less then a week I have found myself understanding very basic conversations in Dutch, thanks to the program's easy yet complete lessons. So even if you can buy better programs, I dare say this is definitely the best you can get for such a low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"cound not get past page 20","review":"Book is far to eager to start in on 'conversations' and never gives the student the volume and time to get basic sounds down. I got very frustrated not knowing how to pronounce anything I read from the book, went over the three minutes of basic sounds over and over again but one instance of each is not sufficient to know the sound and be able to apply it to new words. I got very board replaying the first few chapters and not learning anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do they actually think people can learn this way?","review":"I've had several language CDs, including a few from Pimsleur and Michel Thomas, and this course is no comparison. The others, while different, are easy to follow, and great for using, even when I only have 10-20 minutes to listen. This course *requires* the book - just listening is not possible. Note that this is not stated on the package. So immediately, I am unable to listen on my drive to work (which for me, is 30-minutes of prime learning time with the other brands). Further, following along in the book is difficult, as there is no time to practice, and no repetition of the content, either (yes, I know that I have a rewind button, but I'd prefer not to wear it out with the usage that this course would require). Finally, my last complaint is that the content is not words or phrases, but whole conversations. Hence my title for this review - do they actually think that people can learn this way? I do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will challenge you to rethink the church from scratch.","review":"Provides the real challenges for real change in today's culture and our love for past formula's, our disdain for a world we disagree with.This book is not filled with a statistics that tells the church what it already knows - \\"things are bad and the church is losing effectiveness.\\"McLaren digs into our thinking habits and compares that to the culture around us. He provides a bridge that helps us maintain our spiritual integrity but reaches out to a world that has fully embrassed the postmodern philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest look at why people don't go to church","review":"The title does not accurately describe the contents of this book. Reinventing Your Church is not about comprimising the values and morals of Christ for the sake of the world, but just the methods of how the church chooses to communicate them. Brian McLaren really takes an honest look at why people are so turned off by church today. He states that our culture continues to change, and that churches need to adjust their mothodologies to spread the gospel effectively. He doesn't condemn any particular denomination, but explains how each church needs to understand who they are trying to reach and how to create an environment to welcome those individuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best reference on seed starting","review":"This is a great reference book for gardeners who are interested in starting plants from seed rather than buying the same old stuff from their local garden centers each year. This best thing about this book is that it rates each plant on its degree of difficulty when it comes to growing that plant from seed. Unlike the seed catalogs which imply that all plants are easy to grow from seed, this book breaks it down into detailed instructions as to how to get the seeds to germinate and what conditions they require once germination takes place. It is a great reference when browsing through the seed catalogs as to which plants are worth trying to start from seed and those whose needs may be way too much time, money or environmentally demanding to even bother with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garage product","review":"Do not buy this line it is garage.

I still have to read the other Clarice Bean books, but this one I don't regret I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before getting this book...","review":"...if you knew who wrote this book, you'll never want to read it. Lauren Child is the creator of Charlie & Lola. Although Lauren Child's artwork is really good, she made a bad choice to waste it on Charlie & Lola. Other than that, the book looks like a good book about a girl kids can relate to. But the fact that this person's the same person who created Charlie & Lola takes away 3 stars.

Bringin on the Heartbreak version #2 had the audio from version #1, not the remix audio and Poor Some Sugar on Me had a problem in that in the orginal Historia VHS, you could hear the crowd singing along just like in the one seen on MTV/VH1, but on the Historia DVD no crowd! This DVD is no different!! I bought this stupid DVD in hopes that that was fixed. I would give it away if it weren't for the video of \\"Now\\" which is not on another cd. DO NOT BUY this if you are a true fan--buy the VHS version of \\"Historia\\" if you can find it.

There are more than 3 interesting things about this DVD. Yes, the commentary and 2 new videos are great, but what really makes the difference to me is the newly remastered surround sound, particularly the DTS track. You have never heard Def Leppard like this before! Perhaps the previous reviewer is without the benefit of a surround sound system, but it really makes all the difference. But like the other reviewer, I deduct one star for some missing videos, including \\"Long Long Way To Go\\" and \\"Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion)\\". But overall, this is well worth having, even if you already own Historia and Visualize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time here, loser","review":"I am a big fan of SG1, but this is a total loser.

While any of the episodes are better than the average television show, a few are simply spectacular. The season opener is decent and the ending is absolutely wonderful. However, I found the most powerful episode to be \\"Grace.\\" It is simply amazing. \\"Heroes\\" is also an amazing two-parter that any Stargate fan will want to own. These episodes are the reason this DVD collection deserves five stars, though it is a little overpriced. This is also a good season to watch if your a fan of Carter, Teal'c or Daniel. O'Neill spent less time in the spotlight this season and it appears that this will also be the case for season 8, the last of the series. Even if you are a fan of Anderson you will still like both seasons 7 and 8 along with the new Stargate Atlantis where he will make several appearances.

Richard Dean Anderson did not wish to participate for the most part, and the episodes that he did show up, he looked bored and phoned his performance home. Don Davis was sent packing, and most of the episodes were characters studies on the team's lives, very little on the off-world action we have come to expect. On balance a very disappointing season.

Fallen was quite possibly one of the top 5 Stargate episodes ever. It had action, adventure, and great character development. The first half was amazing, with only a few pitfalls along the way (Avenger 2.0).Unfortunately, the second half of the season just went downhill with way too much focus on romance. (Who cares if Carter has a boyfriend anyway? I'll Days of Our Lives if I want lame love stories.)I recommend you buy this set. Even though some of the episodes were bad, season 7 reclaims some of the magic that Stargate had lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Glitches","review":"Partway through the first episode on the last disc, the DVD freezes. Fastforwarding only reveals distorted sound bytes and occasional partial frame changes. Using scene selections for chapter 5 of this episode has the same result as fastforwarding.

I really liked how the writers gave the cast a chance to showcase another dimension of their acting skills. The supporting characters were all quite good, and the writing was pretty decent as well. Episodes like this are one of the many reasons that this delightful show ran for ten enjoyable seasons. I'd have liked to see Adam Baldwin appear in a more permanent role in the show, or maybe in Atlantis. All in all, a good war movie-esque story, with complex and multidimensional characters.

The tone that instrument produced was almost magical.Fast forward almost 30 years. I got back into playing guitar last year after a 20-year hiatus. My first guitar was an epiphone Les Paul Studio, but I knew that I wanted an acoustic. After demoing dozens of guitars, I landed on this model, the D10S by Washburn. I got lucky, and picked mine up for $149 as a factory restock. The tone equals that old Yamaha, which is now owned by my brother. When I brought this guitar to his house to A/B them, his face was stunned at how good it sounded for such an inexpensive instrument.If you're in the market for an entry-level acoustic guitar, don't let this one fly under your radar. Give it a listen, and I promise it won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better books on Napoleonic battles","review":"I found 'Napoleon Conquers Austria' to be a well researched and written book covering the 1809 campaign for Vienna. The author presented the campaign in such a fluid style that I lost track of time whilst reading the book. His account of the Battle of Wagram was excellent and there was 13 maps to assist the reader to follow the action. I think that the maps could have been better presented but they were sufficient, the illustrations (19) were interesting with some recent photos of the battlefields. Overall this was an easy to read account of this famous campaign and it was an enjoyable journey to take. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Napoleonic history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"How it is I do not know but the majority, vast majority, of books on this exciting period put me to sleep.

She and the 'famous moments of legend' earn any positive rating I give this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dull movie!","review":"I truly do not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know about Alexander the Great. I have been reading about the Great Macedonian for four years and I connot explain how completely inaccurate this movie is. Everything from the costumes to the characters are incorrect. The armor the soldiers and Alexander wear looks very close to fifth century BC armor, especially the helmets which have feathered plumes and not horsehair plumes. This is suppose to be the fourth century BC! King Darius's daughter was not Roxane in reality, the movie portrays her as being so. She was the daughter of some barbarian Alexander captured. There are so many mistakes in this movie I have to give the director some credit for at least trying to create this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised how good this film was.

It's very well done.I had honestly never heard of this film until a picked up a dvd copy at my local library. I expected very little, but got a lot more. Burton is terrific as Alexander, but I think the real star is the writing.

Well, when I decided to have dairy again with the Lactaid Pill, at first (hour or two) everything was fine, then I would later in the night and next several days have a worst reaction then the Dairy itself every gave me in the past.

He is faithful to the Magisterium while explaining it in a way that makes sense to anyone willing to read the material. This is a solid introductory presentation on the topic of the Magisterium that can be used for undergraduate theology students or interested general readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foggy responses","review":"With due respect to another reviewer, Gaillardetz's book is the last place an RCIA candidate or confirmandi should go for guidance on how to understand an appropriate response by the faithful to Church teaching. Gaillardetz believes that only a very rigid form of heresy that involves the explicit rejection of a dogma impairs one's status with the Catholic Church. He even goes so far as to say that the rejection of morally-binding social doctrines (he cites Church teaching on cohabitation) \\"does not in any way separate\\" a person from communion with the Church. This is pure conjecture. Doctrines exist in order to establish boundaries around what is morally licit behavior. In other words, to go beyond those boundaries is to sin, and sinning does indeed impair one's communion with Christ and His Church. At any rate, on too many questions Gaillardetz provides foggy responses instead of clear answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Providing cover......","review":"Dr. Gaillardetz is a brilliant man and posesses a knowledge of the Church far greater than most can claim. However, having skimmed this book and having had the pleasure of hearing the author lecture, I find myself feeling that he's on a mission to legitimize a more relativistic form of Catholic Christianity which can proclaim itself at once orthodox and faithful to Christ and the intent of the Fathers while at the same time providing cover and legitimacy for those who seek the Church's accomodation and approval of a tepid 21st century interpretation of the Faith. How to do this? Imply that all those bulls and encyclicals aren't binding. I fear in Gaillardetz's perfect model of Catholic Christianity, the role of the Pope would be reduced to that of the preachy, doting father that the teenage child has no problem ignoring when convinient.

The topic of what the troops of Santa Anna wore from the 1830's to the 1840's is difficult to research at best, and most of what is presented here is a re-hash of old hash. The author does offer a few illustrations that have seldom seen the light of day, but they tell us very little. (The sentry in Yucatan from 1827 wearing cotton civilian shirt and trousers with black belts for example) Chartrande ignores the special campaign uniforms worn by some of the dragoons for the Texas campaign. Also ignored are the rifle companies of the 1840 period which DID exist. Younghusband's plates are quite good, but his soldados look a little too well fed. You didn't get fat in the army to say the least! Lacking are plates showing the fatigue wear, the overcoat, the packs and accounterments. Maybe another author will tackle the subject, and I'll patiently wait until then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Received this as a Xmas gift and put it to immediate use.

Popped it in on a 3 hr road trip. It's obviously a late 80's early 90's sounding \\"contemporary jazz\\" sounding piece of work. Honestly I probably wonn't listen to it again as nothing really grabbed me. I'm a drummer and the playing is un-inspiring frankly especially compared to the other material I've heard from Mr Lavitz. Coming back on road trip it ended up on the floor board for some reason...I think it's still there! Not worth picking up in my opinion.His best work is with the Dixie Dreggs and Jazz is Dead and 2 other solo albums I just can't remember the names of at the moment.

After a week of taking the class that I needed this book for, I realized I didn't need to take the class and wanted to save my credits for other classes, so I dropped the course. Since Amazon has a 1-month return policy if you aren't pleased with the book or find out you don't need it anymore, I was able to return it back FOR FREE, since Amazon provides the return label for UPS. So the book was free saver shipping too when I bought it.

Kim Huffman decorates an otherwise dreary mish-mosh, but it is beyond her acting ability and girl-next-door appearance. The detective tries to be so serious and tough. The other assorted players are one dimensional: the sister with marital problems, her straying husband, the neighbors, the female prosecutor, the villain, etc.Granted, there's not much in the script to work with, and the ending is blushingly silly silly silly. The director didn't put up much of a fight to make this watchable. It was made for TV movie, a genre famous for its shallowness. Only Kim Huffman seemed to give this a genuine effort. She's not exactly beautiful, nor does she have a great figure, but she has an appeal as a young woman you might meet anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipe for Revenge","review":"Need to smile?

It is the best CD I have ever bought. The riffs are awesome and the solos are great. I love every song on this album. The solo in \\"For Salvation\\" is awesome.

If you like these bands you're gonna love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"not many people might agree with me on this...","review":"first off, i'd like to say this is a good album. The vocalists voice... or \\"scream\\" is really good... he has a great range and, thankfully, doesn't have the whole \\"monotone\\" boring kinda feel to it. The guiters are awesome also. But, i do have a slight problem... The guitar solos get somewhat boring after a while and seem kinda dragged out. Don't get me wrong, they are very good, but would be better (in my opinion) if they were a little shorter. Secondly, some of the songs sound the same. They are all different, but all have the whole \\"verse,chorus,verse,chorus,ending\\" thing...but still, a very good CD... and oh yeah, these guys don't sound ANYTHING like Shadows Fall... your crazy if you think they're similiar"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the absolute best metalcore out there!","review":"The sophomore effort from All That Remains, 'This Darkened Heart' (2004) is perhaps the best metalcore album of today. True, God Forbid, Shadows Fall, Unearth, and Heavenshallburn are worthy contenders, but only ATR have been able to produce a metalcore album as good as this! It is undeniably brutal, which is just one of the many unbelievable qualities this album possesses. It also features blistering riffs, particularly in the closing title track, it is BRUTAL! And then the solos! As opposed to a generic series of metalcore solos, we get stuff in the style of Iron F***king Maiden! 2-part harmonies, blistering lightspeed fingertapping...it's all here! Also, vocalist Phillip Labonte has an excellent growl range, he can go from a low-pitched growl to a high pitched metalcore scream in seconds flat! Highly recommended for fans of thrash or metalcore, and even a few melo-death fans might be interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Immediately when I heard this album, I thought of Killswitch Engage, but as I began listening to it more in dept I realized that they have their own unique style. The rythm guitars are absolutely amazing with tempo changes and downright brutal heaviness. The solos are precise and are no doubt classically influenced (classic metal that is--Malmsteen, etc.). The drums and bass make the transition from verse to bridge to chorus, smooth and precise. The vocals are KSE'ish, but are forgivable due to the pure emotion behind them. If these guys would take out the signature Killswitch Engage pick slides, this would've received a five from me. This album is definitely worth owning. Buy the cd, download, or whatever. But turn the volume up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2","review":"This is the second installment by the metal band all that remains. It has outstanding solos and shows ATR in there true form.

The only mystery is what these two people saw in each other because West never creates any kind of chemistry between them. Tom Clancy writes better love scenes!

Hutton's full-throttle personality is tempered by Bracken's puppy love for her, and director Preston Sturges' sure hand keeps the hilarity rollicking all the way from start to wacky labor room finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw first this when I was 12 years old -- 12!","review":"I have seen this movie several times over the past 65 years and it not only holds up perfectly, it has few if any runners up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Comedy","review":"Steven Speilberg said a few years ago that he would gladly replace one of his films on that absurd TOP 100 films with \\" Sullivans Travels\\" another Sturges masterpiece.Mr. Speilberg, with all due respect..I would replace most of your films with \\" The Lady Eve\\" \\" The Great McGinty\\" and \\" Hail The Conquering Hero\\" et all..\\"There will never be another Sturges' comedy\\" Paul Schrader.I agree with Mr. Schrader. \\" The Miracle of Morgan's Creek\\" is a unique film experience!

My favorite Preston Sturges comedy - nobody did them better. Here is Betty Hutton at the top of her game before she became disillusioned with Hollywood and turned her back on it after Annie Get Your Gun. A lack of extras keeps this dvd from getting a five, but the movie itself is a solid 10.

Usually I end up cringing at the misperceptions, bad advice and third-hand information they contain. The great thing about Stathis' work is that he gets everything right. And to do that over 600 pages of dealing with all the intricacies of starting and financing a business is quite an accomplishment.If you are an entrepreneur who is considering seeking angel or venture capital financing, this book will help you understand what the picture looks like from the other side of the table, and what things you can do to strengthen your company...and thus improve your chances of getting funded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robart meter, crooked","review":"I was disappointed with the meter in that the degree scale was glued in out of alignment so at 0 degrees with the level it read 1.25 degrees being a precision instrument you can't have pieces installed wrong and be able to use it as intended.

I soon began to lose interest. I enjoyed the book more after his school years were over because there was much more drama and action and it was about his conversion to Christianity from Atheism. Also it talked about how he reached his peak of fame by writing \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" which is one of my favorite series. I gave this book 4 stars out of 5 because the beginning was somewhat dull but the ending was much more interesting.

Implementing just one of the steps will more than pay for your investment in the book. If you like what you read, then I highly recommend picking up a copy ofMoney-making Secrets of Marketing Genius Jay Abraham and Other Marketing Wizards (A No-Nonsense Guide to Great Wealth and a Personal Fortune)a.k.a. the Mr. X Book. If you only want to get one Abraham book, pick the Mr. X Book over this one. However, both are good.

I could immediately picture what the location looked like as well as Pat (a Xena look-a-like) and Carly (a Gabrielle look-a-like). The characters were well defined and the story was developed from beginning to end. The romance that blossomed in the story was also wonderful to read. Yes, there is sex in this wonderful \\"trashy paperback\\" as I've heard them called, but there is a wonderful buildup that makes it such a joy to read. I read the book one day and started re-reading it the next. The only disappointment was on the last page....when it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make it a movie","review":"Do you ever wonder, when you read great books like this or the others by authors like Radcliffe, LJ Maas, Karin Kallmaker and so forth, why independent movie companies don't make these stories into movies instead of the dreck that most of them pass off as lesbian material? People always talk about the lack of money, but independent companies are always making terrific movies on shoe string budgets. When will someone realize the market that's out there for really good lesbian stories in the movies? This is a great story, well developed and a pleasure to read. There are certain authors whose books I will purchase and read without knowing what the stories are about. After reading her two books, Gerri Hill goes on that list. She ought to be on your list, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with product","review":"I received the product in a timely manner, and the book was in great condition even though it was used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but great routines...","review":"Tony has this down to a science!

I tried a few other filters, both by this manufacturer, and the other leading filter makers, and this one was the best. Had the best color reproduction-truly seems like the combo filter does exactly what it says it will.If you are after one filter to shoot landscapes, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polarizer makes colors pop","review":"Polarizers help ensure vibrant colors when shooting in bright mid-day sun and when working around snow or water. But most polarizing filters are gray and thus are \\"cool\\" toned. The Moose filter is brown/amber based, and therefore brings out the warmer tones in your image. Reds, yellows, oranges will pop, while blues and greens will gain deeper saturation without overwhelming. I use the Hoya/Moose Polarizing filters whenever shooting during hiking and backpacking trips in the Cascades, Sierras and Rockies, as well as when canoeing or kayaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Circular Polizer","review":"I debated about buying a CP for a while mainly due to high cost of the good quallity ones.

Unlike some other authors who have critiqued Baudrillard, Mr. Lane is very sympathetic and supportive of Baudrillard, and his acceptance shines through in his own excellent scholarship. I recommend this book as well as Douglas Kellner's \\"Baudrillard: from Marxism to Postmodernism and beyond'."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product for a crafting girl","review":"Easy to follow steps for my 7 year old daughter to basically do this on her own.

I purchased NEW, however, I'm so embarrassed to be giving this to my daughter for part of a Christmas present. Sometimes buying retail is best to know what you are getting. Amazon likes to sell used items while claiming they are new....this is the third time this has happened to me, so I can't imagine all the times they send out old, used product.

For a beginner, this is a pretty cute and fun kit. The plastic canvas is color coded and you can use matching thread to complete the pattern. Instruction is included, but even without it, it is easy to work on.The reason of just 1 star is because (1) the plastic needle is too frimsy. It was easily bend, and (2) there were not enough thread to complete. We ran out of red and blue. My daughter was so disappointed when we realized we didn't have enough thread and cannot complete.FYI. I bought another ALEX needlepoint kit (different pattern) and that one didn't have enough thread either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Age 5+? Not with these inaccurate & useless instructions.","review":"Got this for my intelligent 6.5-year-old. If she had simply followed the instructions she would have run out of yarn long before she finished the project. The instructions say to go straight across each row, changing colors as needed to follow the pattern. This method requires much more yarn because so much gets wasted in an endless succession of knots on the back.

The plot is weak, the writing horrible, and the premise implausible. Clarke developed some incredible phobia around earthquakes, then turned the phobia over to McQuay for a book. The result is not pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"I actually give this book 3.5 stars, as I don't think it quite deserves four, but it doesn't deserve three either, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt.As well as being scientifically interesting (if not completely realistic- but since when has science fiction been completely realistic), this book was also futuristically interesting. In my opinion, I found that some of the social predictions were quite reasonable.The plot wasn't brilliant- it was quite predictable in many areas- but I found that the setting and vision of this particular future made up for the story's shortcomings. The book ended in a very over-done way (if you read it you'll know what I mean) but not so over-done to ruin the rest of the book. On the whole, this book was quite good and quite satisfying to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not an Arthur C Clarke book.","review":"This book was written by Mr. McQuay based on a 850 word outline by Mr. Clarke (as Mr. Clarke explains in the afterword). McQuay ought to be listed as the author and Mr. Clarke's name ought not appear as an author (he was not consulted during the writing and simply approved the final draft). The resulting book is wildly implausable and has some of the worst cyberpunk and racial cliches I have seen in a long time. America is \\"owned\\" by sinister orientals and the fanatical Nation of Islam plots racial war. The cliches and outright \\"cheese\\" actually make this book quite funny, saving it from a lower rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely trivial","review":"It seemed like a chore to finish this book. I cared about none of the characters or the situations they were in (the racial stereotypes were especially bothersome), and the earthquakes themselves (and the damage they created) were pretty ridiculous. Sorry folks, one earthquake will not send an entire state into the ocean. And being able to predict exactly how a building will collapse, and exactly what damage will happen where (let alone being able to predict earthquakes to that degree of accuracy) is impossible not only currently, but probably forever.Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Clarke's best","review":"This book was based on an 850 page outline by Arthur C. Clarke. He farmed it out to another writer becuase of his limited knowlege and experience on California. Well, Clarke should have had a few lunches with Cal-Tech seismologists . He would have learned all he needed to know about California seismology and did a much better job himself. While writer Mike McQuay does have some interesting ideas on future socio/economic/techological developments, his ignorance of California seismology damages the quality of this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"sometimes i don't know why i even try to read arthur clarke.

It strays from infantile political ravings (the world turns Islamic and the deep South becomes an Islamic state), psuedo-futuristic events that seem totally implausible and absolutely outlandish and unbelievable characters. Once again, the authors are at their worst when at their most intimate. Characters (who are they?) seem to appear, disappear without any rhyme or reason and the political events are so unreal as to be laughable. American keeping all minorities in ghetto by law by 2005? In 2030, white American will be 30% of the population? Chinese will take over and we will know and accept it calmly voting for \\"Yo-Yu\\" (I kid you not) or Li Chiang corporation/ticket.

Clarke!","review":"Before you pick up Richter 10, read the authors notes at the end of the book. You will discover that this book was not written by A.C.C. The idea was concieved by him, but then handed over to Mike McQuay. A.C.C. is NOT to author of this book. In fact, he didn't even talk to Mike McQuay during the writing of the book and never even met him. So any reviewers who say that this is one of Clarke's best, you are wrong. This is one of Clarke's mistakes that somehow got his name on the cover. Im not critisizing Mike McQuay, but he simply isn't as good as A.C.C., so don't expect to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"I was encouraged by the source (author) of the book but was very unhappy with the result.

As for the \\"science\\" which he lauds in both preface and notes, I've seen more accurate renditions of seismology and planetary physics in The National Enquirer! Predicting not just an earthquake, but the place, date, and time of EVERY major earthquake on Earth years ahead of time is truly a fairy-tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Clarke, but not bad, either","review":"Clarke fans may be upset to learn that he did not write this book, but come on -- the man is about 500 years old and still cranking out good ideas for stories. If you like \\"mad scientist\\" stories, then this is definitely one to add to your collection.

That being said, I cannot stress enough that this album contains some very, very unique songs. \\"Bob George\\" comes to mind, specifically for the voice Prince utilizes throughout the song. Yet, \\"Superfunkycalifragisexy\\" \\"When 2 R In Love\\" \\"Cindy C.\\" and \\"Dead On It\\" are fantastic songs as well, meriting this album its four stars.

I really like this movie. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe do a great job. The action continues throughout the movie and tension remains nearly constant between several players. Crowe displays the right amount of arrogance as the amoral outlaw, Ben Wade. Christian Bale typically does a great job and this is no exception. He plays the quiet but forcefully determined rancher with dignity.This is, of course, a western and the set, plot and pace is excellent and believable. The name of the game here is courage and commitment. Christian Bale pulls this off well with his commitment to his livelihood, family and the task at hand are intertwined in an engaging story. Better than the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puttin' Him on the 3:10 to Yuma","review":"Best part about this movie is Sam Elliot. By far.Russell Crowe is pretty awesome too.

Russell Crowe is ruthless and Christan Bale expands his portfolio as a every day guy thats not a super hero or idol type. It has the feel of the old westerns that most modern western lack.

The scenery was beautiful, the plot was suspenseful and Russell Crowe was one of the most menacing film villains in memory. The whole effort was then ruined by one of the stupidest endings I've ever seen.

A fairly basic \\"chase\\" movie it is the acting performances and dialogue that take it up a notch from your run of the mill feature. With no \\"poor\\" performances it only leaves the the standouts to mention--Ben Foster--Wow...the intensity he brings to the screen is exceptional, after seeing him in \\"Alpha Dog\\" and then again here I am hungering for more of his skills to appear on screen...Christian Bale--also excellent in getting the pain of a father who has not lived up to his son's and wife's expectations to come across to the viewer. Pacing of the film is good though some sections (the tunnel for instance) could be done without as well as the last 15 minutes cleaned up and simplified to be more cohesive to the viewer...but all in all, very well done and will be counted among the \\"necessary\\" westerns when the discussion of the \\"reinvention\\" of the Western is talked about in 10-15 years..."},{"rating":"2","title":"like","review":"looked like an actual blu ray disc and case compared to other blu ray movie purchases ive made on amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hat Lovers will be Aboard the 3:10 to Yuma","review":"An action-packed western for fans of the genre.Enthusiasts of head gear will also enjoy the film.I've seen 3:10 to Yuma a total of three times. With each viewing, I'm thrilled with the attention to details and sound effects, but most fun is noticing every character's unique head apparel. I don't believe there is a single duplicate of a hat fashion throughout the entire movie. There are low-riding hats, thick and tall designs, flimsy brims, rounded tops, conical asian hats, and so much more.A fine film of the western genre and hat apparel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3:10 to Yuma","review":"What you want from a Western, lots of shooting and fast drawing villains.

Maybe you could describe it a a western if Dr. Phil or Oprah was directing. Also contains an annoying kid as Christian Bale's eldest son (what is this? The Wonder Years?). Some of the acting is decent, some is bad. There is a lot of weak dialogue. Some terribly bad plot points that leave you shaking your head saying, \\"it just makes no sense that that just happened\\". Just not an exciting movie. Not a good movie. Not a good western."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great western","review":"Let me begin this review by stating that I have never seen the original 3:10 to Yuma, and that I am not a fan of Western movies. Having said that, I liked this movie, and thought it was one of the best movies of the year. Starring two great actors, and a host of smaller-name actors and actresses, this movie is part action, part drama, with a little bit of comedy and romance thrown in. The gun fight scenes are great, and very realistic. The storyline itself is very good with original characters. Even the stagecoach robbery scene was original. All in all, a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUD!","review":"I bought the DVD thinking Russel Crowe's string of hits would continue. I didn't.

My problem is that the filmmaker didn't make this the lean, spare western that Elmore Leonard intended. For that, you'll have to rent or buy the original - it tells the same story in a much better way - with 30% less running time (and fat)."},{"rating":"1","title":"way overrated","review":"was ok until crowe and co showed up.his side kicked was such a pansy trying to be a tough guy.i got tired of someone telling someone else to stop talking to wade only for that person to continue talking to wade.i was also lmao @ wade being hand cuffed in front and not shackled at the feet when off of a horse.and the whole bad guy with a conscience was a sham.if i were the director,wade gets shot between the eyes after poking singer in the neck with the hidden fork.roll credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb","review":"I really looked forward to seeing this movie, probably because I haven't seen a western in a while. Unfortunately, this did not fill my cup. The movie plot is interesting enough, but it was hard to believe that guys hired to take a murder to a train were so spineless. It was equally hard to believe, given the spineless folks that the villain would have any trouble getting away. The last scene is completely laughable, bullets flying everywhere as the villain apparently goes spineless and lets \\"the farmer\\" push him in front of him as they make a dash for the train (this is before \\"the farmer,\\" explains he is trying to be a hero to his kids).

Consequently, he never met a man whose killing he couldn't justify -- until he meets Bale's character.Bale's integrity and the way it breaks Crowe is an interesting metaphor for the triumph of good over evil. The only problem is that this phenomenon requires the audience to temporarily suspend its sense of reality.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it to anyone interested in western or morality dramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I've seen this movie four times in theaters! It's better than the original!

He plays Ben Wade just right. Not too over the top, but with a witty ego for sure. He could make you laugh one second and cut your throat the next.I would agree with most critics who say this is the best western since 1992's Unforgiven.

This one so mangles the story and has such unbelievable twists and turns that it is a waste of time to watch it. A few of the problems: there is an Apache attack at night; Apaches didn't fight at night. The hero, Christian Bale, has lost his lower leg in the civil war, yet at the climax of the film he can run like Jesse Owens. The Russell Crowe character proves how evil he is in a number of ways, but by the end of the movie, he has helped his captors fight off the indians, stayed with them numerous times when he could have escaped, and finally, helps fight off his own gang and willingly gets on the prison train.

It can be a valuable study guide on how to convert a terrorist with cliches. The converted terrorist will kill his own gang while telling another cliche, then surrender his weapon and lock himself in a cage out of sense of civic duty while his guard is disarmed and dying. It is the happiest ending ever.Cliches make up for the multitude of holes in the plot and for the more discerning viewer there's a scene of drawing a female nude - the same stuff that made Titanic the best movie ever.Seriously: a good flick if you can suspend your brains and not expect anything logical in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"tolerable paralysis","review":"This movie made me mad about half way through, and I had to stop watching.

And the good guys don't do anything but just keep on going without even tying him up. At this point you think to yourself, \\"This is not believable.\\" A good movie is believable, lets you get lost in it. Not this movie... Waste of talented actors on a bad movie.Or, just keep watching with a question mark over your head with a feeling of tolerable paralysis (there's got to be a term for something like this in psychology) as if you just got kicked in the stomach...and your stomach will get better in a few minutes if you just keep watching...But I stopped.

At every key point in the plot the characters behave in completely uncharacteristic ways. The low point of the film is the scene where the bad guys line up in the street below the hotel window and dialogue with the good guys in the room above them. In real life, when bad men who are trying to kill you get this close and hold this still you start shooting them, not engaging in meaningful social intercourse. When the Indians attack the camp of the whites, nobody puts out the campfire that makes it easy to shoot them. The outlaw gang keeps coming after their leader when the intelligent thing to do is to split up the loot and get the hell out of the territory. This film stinks worse than a poisoned water hole and you would do well to ride a wide circle around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst western ever","review":"Western movies are, at their best, about strong individuals who face challenges and make their own luck.

The one star is for Russell Crowe who is not terrible in it. Beyond that, the movie is close to unwatchable and deserves 0 stars. If the plot matters to you at all, stay away, and you will thank me for saving 2 hours of your life. The plot is complete nonsense. You can read some of the other 1-star reviews and compile a long list of specific story points that are absurd. But suffice it to say that by the second half of the film, you will scream \\"WHAT!?!?\\" to yourself (silently or aloud) at least every other minute. The ending is the real icing on the cake, and if you make it that far, you'll think \\"At least it's finally over, and I'll never watch this crap again\\".I can't fathom anyone giving this movie 5 (or 4) stars.

More of an American homage to Sergio Leone and the Spaghetti Western era, particularly with an ending that would make even the Spaghetti King himself weep. But Russell Crowe here is no Clint Eastwood. This is one of his weakest efforts to date. Christian Bale is far more watchable here but still isn't strong enough to carry the film on his own back.

I had promised myself never to watch another Christian Bale movie after that inexcusable tantrum of his (where he was yelling at some hapless D.P.) hit the internet. Oh well. Have to be more careful next time.The movie was hard to enjoy, since there was very little to admire in any of the characters . . . even after the supposedly redemptive ending. Sure, the final scene trying to get him on the train was fairly gripping, but even that had the rug pulled out of it after the bandit chief confesses that he's previously escaped from Yuma prison twice already.

First the movie- Although I enjoyed the dialog the action was below par. Westerns simply don't work these day because of all the special fx in movies.

The ending was ridiculous to the point of being laughable.The Blue ray disc- terrible. There was lots of ghosting effects in dark scenes. Lots of grain in the light scenes.

That 1957 movie had superb acting, and you really cared about what happened to the characters. It also had a very satisfying ending.James Mangold's 2007 remake of 3:10 TO YUMA also has superb acting, but the almost continuous and extreme violence turned me off to the point that I couldn't have cared less about what happened to the characters and how the movie ended.

Russel Crow brought some intensity to the role of the bad guy and some unpredictability. The only con about the 2007 version was that they changed the story line a bit, it wasn't true to the 1957 version. I will not disclose the differences you will have to review to come to your own conclusion.

However...there's one very significant hitch in this instance.The production of the DVD must have been an operation supervised and quality checked by morons or prokaryotes, because the disk provided a video image that resembled the image one gets off the satellite when the signal is attenuated by clouds or rain; all out of synch and pixelated.I'll wait until I get a Blu-Ray player and try again, because I really want this movie in my collection.I'm hanging up DVD and HD-Discs entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a nice surprise,","review":"I thought making Westerns was a lost art!

After the first viewing I liked it. But it wasn't until I watched it again that I fully appreciated it. There's so much passion and intensity here! As the story unfolds, it shows a transformation--how two men who begin a journey are so completely different yet, through their time together, they gain respect for the other and before it's over, each sees a brother in the other's eyes. Priceless! This movie has Heart, my friends. It's a winner. Casting couldn't have been more perfect: Crowe, Bale, Fonda and Lerman in particular.

(Like re-doing Easy Rider). I had recently seen the original with actors Glen Ford and Van Heflin. Their just no comparison to the original in performances and drama. The kill all at the ending was like James Mangold just didn't know how to end the film. I will not be waiting to see it again on TV. Instead I'll pay to rent the original over and over again unless I buy it. I have about 600 Movies collected.This new 3:10 to Yuma will not be added to my list.

While there are some unexplainable elements concerning the motives for the characters at the end, especially Crowes, its still refreshing to see a western where the guys would like to see some of themselves in the toughness of the characters as well as the actors portraying them. Crowe and Bale are the perfect actors to pull off these parts. If you want men who swing a different way than the men in Yuma, go rent Brokeback Mountain. Theres no room for the likes of wimpy boy gyllenhall in a tough guy movie like Yuma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noble attempt to be an in-depth movie + Outrageously far-fetched ending + Few entertaining moments = Not worth buying","review":"It tries hard to be an in-depth movie. It deals with psychology, conscience and honesty. There are very few exciting moments. The worst problem is the outrageously far-fetched ending. That has never happenned in history or reality.

Let me say this is truly am album worth having. Let no one fool you, Motown albums are highly prized and sought after. Out of all the Tempts albums this is perhaps the most special. First, this album predates David Ruffin. That makes it special. Secondly, Paul Williams is carrying the lead on several of the songs. This makes it very special. Because of the uniqueness of this album, all fans should own it. You just got to hear Paul sing \\"Your Wonderful Love\\" This song alone is worth buying the album. Then there is \\"I Want A Love I Can See\\" Everyone talks albut the great David Ruffin, but Paul Williams was something else! Do your self a favor.

Making history was not theri intention (although that is what they did). Rather, they produced a record which was at times raw and gritty while also being light and fluffy (thanks Smokey).

Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks provide the lead singing chores here while David Ruffin, who would soon become the face of this popular group, is heard in supporting background vocals and is not prominent on this record.

I was most impressed by the way Dan dealt with understanding LW's expressions. There's a full Chapter on just the practical applications for expressions and an entire Chapter on animating with expressions.

For Dan Ablan to take on such a huge task of trying to teach people how to use a program as complicated as Lightwave is commendable. But it seems that once again the publisher New Rider has dropped the ball. This book like Inside Lightwave 6 is chocked full of errors. It would be nice if New Riders or Dan Ablan would hire someone to do the tutorials and check for errors before a book like this is published. All I can say, after waiting for months for the release of this book is --- \\"I am disappointed.\\" And in my humble opinion I would not recommend this book until the errors have been fixed or at least Dan's Website has put up the definately upcoming errata page to fix errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Overpriced","review":"First, I want to say this isn't a bad book.

I am a huge fan of folk metal, and was surprised to find such a dvd existed. The movie however, was as total letdown. The bands featured were subjected to the most assinine, offensive, and completely irreverent questions possible. Instead of using the interviews and live footage to show what an interesting and talented group of people the narrator got to meet, he seems to use the time to show what an uncultured idiot he is. This movie is a toss up, because there are no other documentaries on folk metal yet, Its cool that it exists, however its painful to watch. If you're interested in seeing talented musicians struggle to answer idiotic questions, this is the movie for you. The only up side is that now that world can see how classy and intelligent the members of the featured bands are in their responses.

Not because it's written badly - it's not. It's really a good read. But you cannot tell fact from fiction. Barry Sanders was an early Stickley collector and I think this book was written in the 1970s but found no publisher. Now with the craze on all things Stickley it surfaces. His research is dated and in many cases supplanted by much newer information. The footnotes indicate he has read Mary Ann Smith's groundbreaking book Gustav Stickley: The Craftsman and yet he states as fact many things that are the opposite of what Smith writes, and footnotes, in her book. Sanders' research is poor and he does not separate fact from his own speculation in the text. Readers should refer to Smith (though dated) and to Marilyn Fish's continuing series of books for the latest accurate information.

I found all the songs very boring, I didn't like the music and the beat. Anyway, I think there's something to save. As I've already said the single were ok, that is to say because We Want To, She Wants You and above all Honey To The Bee. I don't understand why this song is together with the others in this collections, it's so beautiful and different from the others!! But my fav song is absolutely I dream. Another song which hasn't anything to do with the others. It's a wonderful midtempo track and Billie's voice sounds good! I think Billie can sing, it's a pity she gave up singing. It's also a pity I didn't buy Walk Of Life instead of Honey To The Bee, in fact her second and last album is better!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"puke","review":"ooh, shock, a manufactured-industry-money-making pretty little girl singing simplistic lyrics to a catchy beat.

I must say, she is a terrible singer. I saw that UPN special (unfortunately), and it was just torture. All her songs sound the same. Her videos are plain cheesy (what's up with that dinosaur?!).

Stay in Britain, where you belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful","review":"Billie is a talentless and unfortunate young girl. She was not blessed with normal teeth, neither was she blessed with ability to dance. worst of all the girl cannot sing. Billie's records are nicely produced and i don't deny the catchiness of the SONG honey to the bee but billie really has an awful voice like a foghorn. how can any of you say she has a good voice or a nice r'n'b feel when it's not her. her engineers tune her up beef her up and so do the backing singers. the real shame with people like billie is that she is occupying a lucrative record deal that a talented singer songwriter with no money craves..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No No... Why is Billie popular?! She's not good","review":"Em, I think Billie is such a waste of space in the pop scene. She doesn't belong.

Please, Billie, go away, go back to school and get a proper job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Singles are better!","review":"I think that she is a good artist, but I think that the produced tracks on her album were not that good, but some of the released singles are the only good songs on there which are great songs to listen to and dance to. But I highly recommend that you get Christina Aguilera because she is very good with different vocals and looks awesome. I think that she is better then other female pop artist though she reaches two different genres.

I mean with such songs like 'because we want to', 'Girlfriend' and 'Honey to the b' you just want to dance! Her music is rythmic, relaxing and just pleases your ear. She may not be as beautiful as Britney, but in the music world, its the voice that matters!! (Hint, hint) Go get 'Honey to the b' you won't regret it. It is unique, soothing and downright excellent.

The author covers the various types of gold deposits, how to hunt for them, and what types of detector to use (VLF or PI, preferably both). Mr. Straight has an almost \\"stream of consciousness\\" style of writing, in which he bounces from one subject to another, but his information is always relevant and helpful, and especially valuable since he is not only a veteran prospector, but a formally-trained geologist as well.

This book has it all - excitement, intrigue, mystery, murder, and romance. As I read each page, I felt as though I was right there with Elise, hearing, seeing, touching all that she encountered. I especially loved being taken back in time to relive the lives of the \\"Defenders of the Holy Grail\\". I kept my faith in Katherine and when she lost her beloved Reed, I knew she would carry on. Elise became a modern-day Katherine and I could easily have read another 200 pages. I hope there is a sequel and would love a chance to watch \\"Defenders of the Holy Grail\\" on the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree--don't be fooled--NOT a quality book.","review":"The inappropriate, and unnecessary, foul language and romping sexual adventures detract from what might have been an interesting topic and an interesting writing style (similar to Nevil Shute's in 'An Old Captivity,' 'The Rainbow and the Rose,' and 'In the Wet.') The book is bothersome to read, what with its short, choppy, 4th-grade reading level sentence structures and its endless 'songs.' If you are truly interested in the ideas posited in this book, I would suggest Gardner's 'Bloodline of the Holy Grail.' It is a quite good read, is based on much research, and is a class act compared to this poorly-proofread (especially with to/too, + pg 50 and pg 120) novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defenders of the Holy Grail","review":"Interesting premise, but very poorly written. The book reads more like an outline than a completed work. It has no drama or passion. Too bad, since this is an extremely important subject. This century will see the emergence of Mary Magdalene as a key religious and historical figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy and uneven","review":"After reading the other reviews I was all set for an interesting read. Sadly I was disappointed. The writer could have used a good editor to even out the plot and cause less confusion between stream of conscious writing and parallel plot. As this subject has been examined ad infinitum, there was nothing fresh in the concept, the characters with the exception of Elise were all pretty flat. The cover offered great promise, but sadly the book didn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as they say","review":"Do not be fooled by the glittering reviews. This is not a good book. It tries to be an action adventure murder mystery, set against the theories that jesus had children, and that the crusades were his children's attempt to retake their rightful land. The problems are that it does not develop this theory enough to be plausible (ooh, a secret book explains it) to those new to the field, but offers nothing new to anyone who has read up on this stuff. If you are interested in the theory that jesus had children, read holy blood holy grail. If you have read that then stay away from this book at all costs because you'll be bored. On top that, the fiction portion is as, if not even more, underdeveloped. The characters are wooden at best, and the plot is standard. The other reviewers mention songs, but who cares! If you want poetry read frost. Once again I offer this warning, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Interesting subject matter, and with all the glowing reviews I expected much more from this book. The ending was a HUGE disappointment, and the characters were not very realistic. I didn't really care about anyone or anything that happened. The songs were distracting, not romantic and inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Crazy book","review":"While I understand the author's inspiration for this story, it's a wild mish-mash of too perfect coincidences, frequent POV changes and thinly drawn characters who don't bat an eye when a close friend or relative dies. Its also full of anachronisms and historical mistakes. French knights named Eric and Storm? A lot of the writing just bridges scenes so that the reader is left wondering what the heck happened to a character or what is going on. Who edited this manuscript?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible show","review":"I attended the show this book is based on at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and was extremely disappointed.

Haven't we moved beyond this? I mean really. Mr. Hollinghurst seems to have mistaken sexual prowess for character development, and graphic details of sexual encounters as plot twists. It was sloppy and after about three chapter, tedious. If you feel compelled to read Hollinghurst, read Swimming Pool Library. At least, before the pages and pages of sexual innuendo, he actually sets up a plot. Hmmmmmmm, interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves readers spell-bound!","review":"This author's almost obsessive attention to realism will enchant readers with beautiful language and fascinating characters.

This is a very boring comedy of manners. The story line and the characters are completely uninteresting. While Hollinghurst is the premier English wordsmith, this book represents a complete waste of his talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironically undersexed","review":"Hollinghurst's character development is attrocious to a point where nothing is out of character for anyone. While he brings together four potentially strong characters (the nice guy, the young tease, the oddly aloof and the aging circumspect lover), he leaves an unseemly amount of room for expansion on both the characters, their interactions, their foibles and a multitude of themes. He deals sparingly with class distinction, its role in gay society and differences in city versus country life (by making the country-dwelling main characters oblivious of the staid nature of the tired hamlet). Oddly, he writes powerfully of the \\"nice guy's\\" first experiment with Ecstasy, intertwining it poignantly his relationship with the \\"young tease,\\" though overall the book does little to challenge or promote thought. The Spell is little more than a mildly believable portrayal of gay life, a diversion that should be recognized as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"What You Expect , What You Get","review":"The LC make loud, plain, by the numbers punk.

Just today I made the eggplant parmesan, and though I cooked it for 15 minutes instead of the ten called for in the recipe, it still came out undercooked and no one ate it.

I have been his fan all my life. Though his 87 years shows in his aging voice, he can still deliver the heart felt lyrics of a love song, or any other song for that matter. Now, what he has lost in range and technical ability, he more than makes up with a voice full of wisdom and experience. In short, he now knows what he's singing about, and it comes through. His voice is filled with emotion and character as he sings these songs, just perfect for him at this stage of his life. He can still deliver the lyrics in a way that makes you feel the emotion he is feeling as he sings. I hope he makes more CD's. I'll buy every one. He's the best sentimental love song singer ever, even at age 87. God Bless Eddy Arnold. He truly is one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Recording from this Great Artist","review":"I must say I listened to this last recording by Eddy Arnold with a tear in my eye. I have been a fan of this unique artist for the last 30 years. At 87 years old - he can still sing a song - not like he did 40 years ago - but what artist can sing at his age? How many of today's stars will be around and performing when they ar 87 - probably none. This is a last recording from a great and unique singer that we will not see the likes of again.I was moved by his abilty to communicate every word of a song and still make one feel he is singing just for you.

However I have read many books on Buffett and his investing techniques and the fact that this is not written well does not differentiate it substantially from many others.What does differentiate this book from the others and consigns it to the \\"don't bother with\\" pile is the irritating smugness of the author.

I have read a great number of books on Buffett and his investing style and this one is the worst. Simmons spends very little time on the calculation of Intrinsic Value and ends up using a formula which doesn't take into account a number of the important factors which Buffett looks at. The formula is a VERY simple one based on only the Return on Equity of the firm and a discount rate. You've got to be kidding me! The case studies are helpful, but once again they are simply explained and gloss over much of what is important. If Bufffett actually invested in the way described in this book noone would have ever heard of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of expectations","review":"The text appears to be overly simplistic in its prose and analysis.

In this book, as in its predecessor (Damned Lies and Statistics, 2001), the author warns against believing as facts the statistical figures that are always presented to us from various sources - both authoritative and otherwise. The solution is to be critical and to ask questions such as: Who produced those numbers? Exactly what was counted? What are those numbers really saying? Is there a way to present the information in a clearer more objective way? At the end, the author strongly argues in favor of the development of some system in society that would impart, what he calls, statistical literacy in the population at large. The book is clear and well written; it should be widely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic; disappointing","review":"Based on the reviews on the cover of this book, and the reviews of others, I bought it expecting something new and original. Boy was I disappointed. Indeed, in the preface the author owns up: \\"I should confess that, in writing this book, I have done little original research. I have borrowed most of my examples from works by other analysts, mostly social scientists and journalists.\\" Boy howdy, did he ever \\"borrow\\" them. So don't look here for anything new.

Essays that everyone's read before. So it's not an anthology you turn to because you want to figure out what's new out there. Really it's anthology you turn to for the sake of the sensibility behind it, John D'Agata's own voice that somehow manages to creep into the anthology and carry the entire 500 pages through on a whimiscal story about why he loves essays. It's got to be the most charming anthology I've ever read. At times bold (many of the essays aren't traditinally thought of as essays), at times funny, sentimental, outright smart, the anthology is trying to show what the essay has in its potential.

It is simply a design flaw. Otherwise it would have been the perfect kettle, beautiful, functional, handle high enough to not get too hot to hold, and easy to pour. We had to send it back. The most beautiful kettles don't whistle.

Mine didn't whistle, either, and after a month of use has developed cracks all around the outside bottom, at one inch intervals. Cuisinart has told me to return it to them, but I have to pay shipping in both directions if they decide to replace it. Definitely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"whistling tea kettle","review":"almost everyone has written in and says that this tea kettle doesnt whistle.this tea kettle whistles. the whistle is on the top of the kettle. it doesnt sound like a whistle, but sounds more like a harmonica. i suppose if you only keep a small amount of water in this kettle, most of the steam pressure will be released in the spout, not leaving enough pressure to activate the whistler on the top of the kettle. if there is a reasonable amount of water in the kettle, the kettle will let you know when the water is boiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stove top kettle","review":"This kettle is very reasonably priced. of good quality, and has a very distinctive whistle; as others have said, a very mellow train-like noise.I can't imagine why people have problems with it; take the lid off and look at where the spout attaches to the body; if the water covers the outlet to the spout, steam will be forced out of the lid and it will whistle. If the water level is too low it will just blo steam up the spout and make no noise.Oh, and the lid should be shut securely as well; if you don't put it on properly again air will not go through the whistle or not enough will go through the whistle and it will be low in volume.If that sounds complicated, it isn't. Really happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust on Day 2","review":"We used this kettle 2 times before a rust spot appeared on the bottom of the inside. We also tried the \\"Copco Cambridge Stainless-Steel Teakettle\\" and it rusted after the first use. Apparently it is impossible to find an actual stainless steel stove top kettle which will not rust. I wish at least one or two manufacturers would stop outsourcing to China. It is getting really hard to find quality products anymore. Tea kettles should not be disposable. They should last for decades and not begin decaying after the first use. If anyone has found a stainless kettle which really is stainless and will not rust, then please let me know. We do have an electric stainless kettle which works great (the \\"Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle\\"). We've had it for at least four years. Water sits in it all of the time...no rust or tarnish at all.

The handle was too hot to handle which makes this kettle a fail for our family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Whistle","review":"After using this kettle (almost daily) for a good 6 months it has \\"whistled\\" about 3 or 4 times. And the whistle is more of a hum or buzz which doesn't carry very well. When pouring hot water it can spit out of the lid/whistle holes. Not happy with it. It's fine if you're hanging around the kitchen but when relying on the whistle to alert you when it's ready, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"We have used this kettle about 5 times.

It hasn't rusted or even blemished the stainless. People complain that it doesn't whistle. Well first off it's not a whistle but a 2 note harmonica. To make it work you have to fill the water full enough to cover the hole to the spout or the steam will just blow out that hole. They must have updated this model because mine doesn't have an encapsulated aluminum disc. My only complaint is the handle can get hot. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I purchased this item to replace one i had returned to cuisinart under warranty.

There's nothing more here than paranoia, fear-mongering, and bashing. This more greatly skews the public against psychic vampires, and for readers who aren't even AWARE they were psychic vampires, this book helps them towards a life of guilt and depression.This uneducated, barbaric filth is little better than books about \\"Satanic Panic.\\" Ms. Hort, please grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Information","review":"All of the information in this book about vampyres is false.

This book is more like a few long stories linked by that idea.I was bothered at first by the lack of meat, but by the end of the book I'd let myself settle for a big helping of between meal sweets.I would have loved to have a few of the obvious loose ends properly explained or wrapped up. Perhaps Baker will do so in a later book.All in all, a pleasant diversion, light and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of tease, not much action","review":"When I was about 40 pages from the end of this book, I suddenly realized that nothing much had yet happened and that no real plot had been set up--a few minor incidents were set up and resolved, yes, but IMO they fell flat. There are some unsubtle teasers for plot developments in future books, but they only emphasize how little actually happens in this installment. I loved \\"In the Garden of Iden,\\" which is probably the best time-travel morality play since Connie Willis's \\"Doomsday Book,\\" but I found \\"Sky Coyote\\" completely unsatisfying. I'm not planning on reading the next book in the series, \\"Mendoza in Hollywood,\\" until it comes out in paperback; if it's as much of a letdown as \\"Sky Coyote,\\" I won't bother with any further books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While I thought the first book in this series, In the Garden of Iden, was an interesting take on time travel, Sky Coyote did not live up to my expectations. Mendoza's voice was the one heard in Garden, and Joseph's in Coyote; but I found no difference between them and had a difficult time adjusting to Joseph's narration. I find it hard to believe a 20,000 year old man and the Neanderthal \\"giggle,\\" although this verb appears several times in relation to their dialogue. Perhaps Baker has a more difficult time getting into the head of a male protagonist, but I never believed Joseph was speaking. I do not wish to offend anyone, but I also thought that after the first few pages, the description of Chumash ceremonies was gratuitous and did not move the plot forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fun and Profit in Time Travel","review":"I loved In the Garden of Idun and had just as much fun with this one. Joseph as the wiley coyote trickster god is absolutely perfect. Mendoza doesn't get much of a role, but she's there, as the Company operatives try to rescue a whole village of the Chumash Indians before they are nearly wiped out by European invasion and native religious fanaticism. I loved the Rotarian twist she gave to the Chumash which knocks on the head any idea that these people were not socially sophisticated.I can hardly wait for the next novel of The Company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Pratchett Does Time Travel","review":"I picked up this book on a lark - I was unfamiliar with Ms. Baker's work. Just the first 3 pages convinced me it would be a good read - smart, sarcastic, and the main character doesn't take himself too seriously. Of course, the main character is 20,000+ years old.....A light-hearted read with enough plot to keep you engaged - think Terry Pratchett doing time travel. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK! A MUST HAVE!","review":"What a great book! This is truly a must have!

I'm an embedded engineer, with good c background, and some experience with c++, and this book IS THE BEST. After spending less than 1 hour on first few chapters, I felt like I was finally getting it, and right now, more advanced reading like Blaszczak's MFC finally makes sense. I am also surprised by negative reviews here - in my opinion this book is THE book to get started with windows programming, and really know what you are doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Applicable to MFC v2 not MFC v6.","review":"I bought this book to learn MFC version 6 which the book claims to cover. The examples do not use any of Visual c++ wizards and I was constantly battling to try to get Visual c++ to accept the example code. Additionally it is only when you get to chapter 17 that the author reveals that all the examples in the book have been written for MFC version 2 and chapter 17 gives a brief overview of version 6 and the class wizards. I gave up on the book at chapter 5 and have made good progress using only the help and examples found on the Internet. I think your money would be better spent on a more current book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Starting Point.","review":"I think this book provides good coverage of the basics of windows programming. Some may quibble with the fact that it teaches you how to create resources \\"manually\\" as opposed to using a Wizard but personally I would rather teach my students that, and let them learn Wizards on their own time (You shouldn't need a book to explain how to use a Wizard!). My only complaint here is that it occasionally spends a little too much time explaining how to do tasks that are altogether similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are fairly new to MFC, this is the best way to learn","review":"After being away from GUI development for 3 years, I was faced with MFC 4.

It was by far the cheapest saw with a brake and a good base, and the quality and durability appear to be at least as good as any of the others. It has every feature I need, and nothing annoying (like Porter Cable's dust duct). It feels like it will last forever, and is a joy to use. I'm glad I got the brake, but it doesn't stop quite as quickly as I'd hoped. Still, it stops alot faster than any without a brake. My only complaint is that not having bought the rip fence when I got the saw, it was impossible to find one locally, so I had to wait to mail order one when I suddenly needed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Saw, but Brake could be better","review":"I used this saw for a recent home improvement project and was pleased with it. I liked the quality of the construction and the feel of the saw. In my opinion, safety features are the most important consideration when purchasing a power tool.

This collection of songs equal the best of her earlier work. She talks about a lot of subjects, from the oppression of women on The Magdalene Laundries (about Irish nuns in a convent) and Not To Blame (about women who are abused.)The way the people see artists and vice versa is the subject of the title track, with references to Vincent van Gogh (who she imitates on the album sleeve. Another highlight are the complex guitar tunings from Joni. This album has won two grammys in 1996, one for best pop album, winning over Madonna, Mariah Carey and Annie Lennox. The second was another deserved one, for the recording package. The paintings in the sleeve are incredible beautiful and burst with colours and shapes.

Try Star or Tanya Donnely's Lovesongs for Underdogs for better stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time...","review":"I truly hope that people discover this gem of an album, one that had critical praise at the time, but commercial sales were lacking, which ultimately and unfortunately led to the demise of the band (lost in the grunge shuffle of the era), whose pop-rock style was way ahead of its time (as was Letters to Cleo and 4 Non Blondes, who wound up breaking up for similar reasons). Boston never got the props that Seattle got in the early 90s, but the music that came from there was as amazing. It fits in 2004 more than it did 1995.Belly is definitely one of the best bands to come out of Boston and both CDs are well-written, produced, and sound awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tanya Donelly is a goddess...","review":"Tanya Donelly really shines on 'King', the follow up to 1993's Star which was a critically acclaimed album. Tanya is one of alternative rock's most important people, man or woman. The combination of the whole band's overall skill, Tanya's amazing vocals and the sheer pop make this a must own of any music fan.Tanya's vocals will melt you. It was sad to see Belly leave but it brought us a whole new era of Tanya's genius work.

Really fun to play with, I'm not even done building it and I'm already having a lot of fun with it! But some parts don't fit together. I guess it depends on the set you buy on how many pieces don't fit. I've read reviews where they say many pieces are REALLY hard to fit, but so far only one of those pieces have been like that for me. You just have to get lucky, I guess. It can be frustrating to build, but really fun to play with. I recommend this for any lego/building, dragons, or fantasy fan ages 6-12."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutley horrid","review":"With land of rape and honey being the pedestal most industrial bands are compared to, ministry has become one of the most unlistenable bands around. It is sad to see what used to be one of the premier industrial bands become one of the worst acts around. I wouldn't call one song on this album good, as they are all poorly done and make me want to bash my head in with a hammer. Absolutely talentless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best albums ever!","review":"At first, I hated this album. I put in a tape of it a friend had made for me, expecting something like Mind or Pslam 69, and got something completely different. Looking back on it, the reason I didnt like it was because it wasnt what I expected. But I listened to it a few more times, and realized just how good it really is. It's slower than any of the other albums (except for With Simpathy, of course), but it is definetly the heaviest. It is loaded with good tracks, and Al still sounds the same as ever. I couldnt say which song was my favorite, because I dont think I have any one. Some of the better ones were Useless, Lava and Reload (no relation to that god-awful Metalica album). I would recoment this album to all the fans of Ministry, or anyone who just likes heavy industrial / metal music. Al Jourgensen, I worship you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy","review":"This album was such a disappointment, I don't even know what to say. I've tried to let it grow on me, but after several attempts, it's futile. Mind... is one of the greatest albums of the decade, perhaps the greatest industrial album ever. To turn out this piece of crap just two albums later is a mystery to me. What happened? My one star is for the excellent remake of Lay Lady Lay, the only redeeming track on this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is Ministry's worst release; it is nothing more than a slow, somewhat grinding metal album. The guitars sound as if they belong on something with a faster tempo, but instead they have been sludged down almost to the point of being in reverse. Besides this, Filth Pig is in serious need of synthesizers and samples. The classic sound of Ministry is a synthesis of Slayer-influenced metal with industrial programming and sampling, making the music easy to dance to as well as to thrash to. Unfortunately, this album will not want to lead the listener to do either one of those things. Also, the song-writing is lacking in creativity, and Filth Pig is nothing more than an incredible bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Ministry album","review":"This is their least popular album but easily my favorite. This really isn't an industrial album, its a rock album. But it still definitely sounds like Ministry. Their approach is still the same...repetitive grooves that give a hypnotic feel. But the difference is they combine this approach with a more organic sound via guitar, bass, and drums as opposed to samples. The drums on this album are awesome. Basically this record is just a big ugly slab of heaviness with a very dark and trippy feel. Not for everyone but I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a rewarding album","review":"I hadn't heard many Ministry songs, let alone albums before coming across this by chance in the late 90's.What I found was a dark, gritty and rough masterpiece which has been rewarding since the first fly-through.This is one album you'll find yourself coming back to for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filth Pig: A Portrait of an Artist in Crisis.","review":"This is a great album. Although it is not the dancey \\"12 inch singles\\", nor the more industrial \\"Twitch\\" or \\"Land of Rape and Honey\\", it is not the sample-aided and cruely heavy \\"Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste\\" or \\"Psalm 69\\", but it is a more slow, grueling, and muddy offering of new boundaries and limits. This was a catharsis for the band during tough times. They are purging themselves through this album, and it shows. That's what is good - true artistic expression. Like any credible artist worth spending time or money to listen to, Ministry has grown steadily throughout their career, experimenting with new musical styles as their own personal growth dictated. This is a great album worthy to sit alongside any other Ministry album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but good.","review":"This album is reminds me of White Zombie \\"Astrocreep 2000\\" and Jane's Addiction. If you're looking for another \\"Psalm 69\\" or \\"A Mind is a Terrible Thing To Taste\\", I warn you, DO NOT LOOK HERE. You'll have a better chance with KMFDM. But if you're looking for something with a heavy bass groove, like most if not all of the tracks on this album, then by all means pick this album up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated Ministry album","review":"Ministry definately strayed from the norm with this release. At first I was quite put off with it but after repeated listenings to it I noticed a jewel of grinding metal and rage. People waiting to hear a \\"Stigmata\\" or a \\"Jesus built my hotrod\\" will have to slow down their tenacity a few notches to truly enjoy the uniqeness of Filth Pig. I'm currently writing this after buying and fully appreciating Ministry's latest release, \\"Animositisomina\\". Many people thought Ministry had lost their edge because of the slow, drudging pace of Filth Pig. The new one confirms they still can tear it up when neccessary. This album is just a bold expirimentation for them. And it works if you look hard enough. Beneath the harsh and sluggish exterior, there is a masterpiece to find. This is a different and yet briliant addition to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Survival in an X-Rated World","review":"A book every Christian parent should read!

The use of panels requires support for the frames.The easiest support to use for a single panel is the set of legs. Multi panel sets can be bound together with nylon strips. You can even create 42 x 78\\" soft boxes by using three panel frames. Outdoor use for diffusion, is usually the trickiest because the frame or frames will usually be held up, off the ground, to interpose between the subject and the sun. This will require light stands and clamps, or stand adapters and Manfrotto mini clamps in order to adjust the angle at which the panel is being held."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aging isn't pretty","review":"The version of 'River of Jordan' on this album discards the original lyrics for a more politically correct version. . . what was once \\"we are the father, we are the son\\" has PC'd into \\"we are the father, mother daughter and son\\". What a disaster, adding extra syllables and a new meaning completely ruins the tempo and bastardizes the beautiful original tune. This is what happens when liberal PC sentiments muscle out innocence.A few of the songs on this album hold up and work well with the new collaborations, but River of Jordan isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Sentimentality","review":"I am a PP&M fan, but this album left me cold. The selection of songs was relatively uninspired given the repertoire, but it was the vocal interpretations that made it a snoozer. Even one of my all-time favorite songs, \\"Stewball,\\" was performed in such a weepy, sappy manner that it called for a fast forward.The use of guest artists seemed like an afterthought. If you are going to use a John Sebastian or a Tom Paxton, why not feature one of their own great songs?I suppose there are folks who will get into this. You know, the type who get teary eyed singing \\"Kumbaya\\" around a camp fire. But, with the exception of an upbeat one-time throwaway called \\"Virtual Party,\\" this album was a virtual desert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsatisfied","review":"The battery did not fit a Treo 750 like it said it would.

Like Richard Pryor and Freddie Prinze, Foxworthy attacks his ethnic background of being a Redneck, including such jokes as being a male chauvinist pig, implying that all people born in the South are indeed stupid, old age, the troubles being a parent, the troubles having rednecks for family, and the dated joke of the \\"1996 Olympics being in Georgia\\". It is all done in good fun, because Jeff Foxworthy is a redneck and would know about other rednecks. \\"Games Rednecks Play\\" has got to be one of his best albums.

However, it was very disappointing, unfortunately a fascinating and intrigung story was ruined by the prose of Mr Allin. Who quite frankly can not write to save his life.He never really focused on what he was writing about. One minute he banging on about politics, the next about some obscure French general. This book was too rapped up in nationalistic twaddle to be a good read.

Allin is a very good writer, holds your attention throughout with a trail of trivia, all held together by the story of this giraffe.

This is the perfect book for a long airplane flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating blend of history, zoology, and adventure.","review":"I *REALLY* enjoyed this book! Allin does a remarkable job of historical research, but he doesn't stop there: by providing many fascinating details of life in early 19-th century Europe and Africa, he fleshes out the remarkable story of this gentle beast and the humans so enchanted by her. Allin proves that history, properly told, is if nothing else a fascinating story. I am eagerly awaiting his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enchanting Fledgling Effort","review":"I loved this book it was well written, well researched and incredibly interesting. The history of Zarafa, a little Giraffe that was a gift to the king of France, is more than just a history book. It has a very fairy tale sort of a feel to it. It's so well written that it even the descrition of French and Egyptian foreign relations seemed interesting, which is some feat because politics, almost by definition are dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zarafa is an enchanting creature made immortal by Allin.","review":"The wonderous spectacle of Zarafa walking across France is almost unbelievable. How wonderful it would be if humans could regain that enchantment at the sight of another creature. Allin has made a page of history very real and fascinating. This is a special book to be shared with those who care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating history lesson","review":"Heard the taped version of ZARAFA by Michael Allin, the true story of how a giraffe in 1826 got from Africa to become the first such animal ever seen in France . . . she was a royal offering from Muhammad Ali, Ottoman Viceroy of Egypt, to KingCharles X of France, presented in the hopes of keeping the French out of Ali's war against the Greeks . . . although her arrival did not accomplish its intended task, Zarafa did become an instant celebrity and fascinated all of Europe for the next 18 years.Although the tale skipped around a bit too much, I did find it a fascinating history lesson . . . what's more, it gave me a good look at what publicity was all about--back in the nineteenth century . . . and it made me appreciate the herculean effort that took place in moving this magnificent creature such a distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This is a surprising little book that tells you so much more than the adventures of a giraffe in her way to post-revolutionary France. Anyone interested in Egyptology or the Ottoman Empire will also be surprised by the little bits of interesting information that permeate the tale.It is only a small book, but it is a big story. At times the writing itself appears a little stilted, but the author does a good job with the topic nonetheless. It is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zarafa steals the heart","review":"Zarafa steals the heart, which is not surprising when you realize that she charmed all of France, including Charles X, the greatest scientists of her day, and the French people en masse. The book acts as a brief history of the Enlightenment, bringing to life such figures as the viceroy of Egypt, the first \\"Egyptologists\\" (otherwise known as grave-robbers and plunderers), Napoleon himself, and the preeminent French naturalist of his day, Saint-Hilaire. Zarafa's relationship to all of these figures, and the sweetness with which she conquers France, makes a fascinating and sometimes poignant read. Allin has done his homework, and his affection for Zarafa makes the book much more than a dry history text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful True Tale of Giraffe's Journey Up The Nile...","review":"...across the Mediteranean, and through the countryside of France, and into Paris! This great little book will be enjoyed for many years to come by people of all ages. Just transporting this bulky beast was enough of a headache, but fortunately its demeanor was (usually) cool, calm, and collected. In 1826, how could this animal set upon such a long, difficult journey? You'll learn in this book! And the French were enthalled by this animal, so unique from all other animals in creation. The \\"Zarafa\\" became the center of a huge tourist industry attracting throngs of well-wishers and curiousity seekers for over a thousand miles! Like today's Super Bowl or Academy Awards, all kinds of momenta were made to celebrate (and earn a few francs) this singular giraffe, including clothes, and pottery. A great value and a fine book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal Hodge-Podge Meanders Endlessly","review":"I pretty much agree with an earlier, lengthier review in here. Zarafa's story is barely told, and pretty poorly at that. The historical background is interesting, but confusing because much of the information has nothing really to do with the journey. Basically, this would have been a fantastic New Yorker article or historical children's book. I was tremendously underwhelmed and tossed it aside before Zarafa was halfway to Paris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing story lost in convoluted details and prose","review":"The story of Zarafa is intriguing as political, scientific, and social history. Thank you to Allin for bringing it to our attention. Unfortunately, the author's telling of the tale is a tangle of poorly crafted prose and convoluted, repetitive detail. The uneveness of his writing disasterously distracts from the story. Instead of enjoying his juxtapositions of fact and fantasy I spent my time frustratedly wishing an editor had intervened before publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinatiing story","review":"This is a terrific book. The author was able to access primary sources, and describes the intellectual and social environment of this period, and even with this intellectual depth the book has the charm of a fairy tale, the narrative of a zoological piece, and pulls the reader into the journey of Zarafa. I happened to visit Paris for a few days not long after reading this fascinating book, and made a point of visiting the Jardin des Plantes. No physical trace of Zarafa remains, but I spent a few hours wandering through the small zoo and the gardens, and the knowledge of Zarafa and those twenty years of her life in Paris made it a memorable afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Second tier Wolfe book","review":"This book attempts to adapt the quintessential Gene Wolfe formula by positing several interesting characters around a central mystery. Unforutantely, this is restricted to our world, unlike the fabulous worlds of his varied 'Sun' novels, so his imagiantion is not given free play. Equally unfortunately, he fully explains his vitae idea, a general time traveling back to a pereptually flying ship (which by the way was probably the msot origianl thing in teh book, of using the 300 mph jet stream to glide on. Also includes a tie in to howard hughes.)In brief, this is a book to read after you've finished your Pynchon and Eco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characterization at its best","review":"Every novice writer should be force to read this novel to see how characterization should be done right. The book is also at times wickedly funny, particularly a seen during a black out in an insane asylum. The plot seems to be disjointed but Wolfe pulls every thing togethar at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Translate: My granddad's a WITCH DOCTOR","review":"This title euphemizes what is common knowledge to every African. The true and original name in English of the profession of animistic witchcraft is, for all obvious and appropriate reasons, 'witch doctor.' If you adhere to scriptural eschewance of all occultic practices as abomination to God, you will want to reconsider choosing this book. There are any number of wonderful books and other media for teaching your child the beauty of African culture. I have done in-depth studies with each of my children of the customs, art, music, language, clothing, folklore, and landscape of Africa-- including its religions at an appropriate age-- without promoting witchcraft or throwing open the door to such influences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endodontics","review":"The fundamental goal of conventional endodontics taught at the US dental schools and that sustained by Sargenti is exactly the same.The common objective is to save endodontically involved teeth from the forcep to prevent the disruption of the masticatory apparatus.The debate whether the Sargenti modalities are acceptable or not is a mere exercise in futility because the N2 Method has already shown its effectiveness in a long period of extensive clinical application. The Sargenti procedures are routinely used by thousands of practising dentists in the USA as well as all over the world.THE SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND of the N2 Method has already been established three decades ago by internationally recognized European researchers.

This book is a lot of nonsense. What's up Chak ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wading through sand","review":"Hmm. Perhaps I was not in the correct mind set to read this. Perhaps I have read too many of this genre before and I am all maxed out - but the first half was a laborious read. Nothing snappy, notable, interesting or magnetic about the writing style, that's for sure. And instructive books DON'T have to be boring in writing style.Some of the pscychology-based concepts were interesting, but there was nothing here that hooked me, drew me in, educated or inspired me. No \\"aha\\" moments - not a one.And when I got to the part where Mr Keating ascribes difficult childhood behaviour to the parent, well, I'm sorry... this is when I had to put it down, and I'm afraid I haven't picked it up again. I was looking for enlightenment in a psychological sense, not subective opinion on parenting issues. Monsieur Spock, he is Not.Overall, this was just average to me. I'll try it again in a year, but I do have a feeling that the spine of this book is going to remain pristine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"The person with the cash in hand is the real boss, according to Harvey Thompson, proponent of Customer Value Management (CVM). You can make your company more customer-driven using CVM, which he developed at IBM and then implemented at other U.S. and international companies. Thompson identifies the customer's vision of ideal value, and tells businesses to use that as their guiding star. If you can integrate the best customer value in every system, your company can retain customers, sell more and increase profits. This is not a new theme, but Thompson takes it a little deeper than most as he discusses ways to strategically incorporate CVM, from top management to the front desk. If we were telling him about his reading customers, we'd ask him to shake some dust off the dense, academic language, but otherwise we... recommend to most business leaders this solid book about strategic customer management."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holisitc approach!!","review":"Mr. Thompson really shows us the whole meaning of Customer Value, teaching about the linkages between customer targeting, process, organization and technology. The way he drives us in the real world while he focus on what is important (high ROI) and what is less important, is a very valuable driver to the correct use of the scarce resources (human, assets and dollars) to sustain and growth the business dramatically. This metholodogy, applied with success in IBM and in many other companies around the world, demostrates that is not a mere theory but a real life experience. Strongly recommended to be used as an educational material and as a base in a your methodological project approach. World class reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice for making and keeping your customers happy","review":"Companies have known for years that customer loyalty is key to their success, but the way to foster that loyalty has perhaps been missed. By shifting management's focus away from internal issues and onto the customer's desires and concerns, Thompson has given businesses not only a way to survive, but to thrive in rapidly changing times. The anecdotal information about IBM is fascinating and timely. When it seems all else about the business world is changing, Thompson has hit on the one stable premise: make the customer happy and he or she will be back. Highly recommended for any businessperson interested in their company's success, and their success in the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I was surprised by all the great reviews for this book.

I love reading stories where otherwise devil may care guys get stuck doing something they didn't want too.

Ray's \\"The Weekend Novelist\\" can help just about anyone realize their potential as a novelist. I don't think any of us out there can drop everything to become a professional novelist (unless you're born into wealth, I guess). We all have to work sometime. So, Mr. Ray puts together a program that will allow you to not only write a novel on the weekends but also write a novel with depth and meaning.Before I read this book, I wrote lots of short stories and the start of a few novels. I used this book to turn some of my old ideas into the reality of a manuscript.I felt myself getting bogged down at first by following his program of hashing out the details of the lives of the characters. But I quickly realized the commitment that is involved in writing a novel. It's important to develop meaningful characters/structure before you start writing.Thanks, Mr. Ray! I highly recommend this book to any aspiring writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on the market for beginning novelists","review":"Ray in this book manages to hit all the bases as far as writing a novel is concerned (i.e. plot, characters, etc.) but even more importantly, he provides something of which the novice is in desperate need, but which I have not found in any other book on writing: a concrete, explicit, comprehensive, and yet flexible writing plan by which any and every beginning writer can overcome the first major hurdle, and actually finish a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"boilerplate","review":"To each his own.

I liked this one. It had a good story line and the characters were interesting. I did make reference to a trip to Jerusalem which is out of order. Jerusalem, should have been read first in chronological order. However, if I had done that I might not have read this book. OH JERUSALEM was boring and did not contribute much to the partership of the two detectives. This one had old parchments, intrigue and was entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating premise, beloved characters, some disappointment","review":"Once again, the relationship between Holmes and Russell makes for fascinating reading. The \\"Letter of Mary\\", a scroll potentially written by Mary Magdalene, is timely given renewed interest and scholarship related to her over the last few decades. All the ingredients of a great book were here...But I was incredibly disappointed by the lack of backbone Russell exhibits in this story. Her \\"Mary Small\\" experiment was upsetting on multiple levels. Worse was the final resolution concerning the letter of Mary (stop reading here if you don't want to hear anything at all about the ending!). Would a strong, centered, feminist, scholarly woman deny deep truth in order to appease a limited and abusive man whom she has virtually no relationship with? A depressing conclusion to a book with enormous potential.Still love this series, but was really disappointed by the ending of this installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After reading the first two Mary Russell books, beginning with The Beekeeper's Apprentice, this third novel was a disappointment. It had such an excellent premise with a letter that could shed new light on early Christianity and the roles women played in its development. Instead the letter says almost nothing of importance. King spends several chapters on Mary Russell invading the life of one of the suspects and yet that suspect turns out to have nothing, nothing to do with plot. First person narrative fails King here as the more interesting plot is told second hand by Holmes. This book is saved by its premise alone and fails everywhere else almost completely. I hope King finds the charm that captivated readers in The Beekeeper's Apprentice in her future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book","review":"This book lacks a coherent plot, and has an extremely unconvincing ending. The feeling one gets is that the writer suddenly decided that she'd written enough words, and would wrap it up in quick time. I hope Holmes and Russell will start to do some honest detecting again real soon. The great detective deserves a better life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conan Doyles Sherlock continues","review":"Any good mystery always leaves you wanting more.

To my horror, I open this book and find on the first page that Holmes and Russell are now married! What a catastrophy. I read no further. I couldn't abide Sherlock Holmes married, much less to a women less than half his age. The Sherlock Holmes I came to love was brilliant, eccentric, and loyal, but ALONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrated fan cries out for help","review":"I heartily wish I had never read Beekeeper's Apprentice! If I hadn't read it, I wouldn't be so hungry for more stories about Russell and Holmes, hungry enough to even absorb the stale leftovers provided by the next two books. Please, Ms. King, put me out of my misery! Either write a good Russell/Holmes story, or inflict them upon me no more. Signed, a beleagured fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Journey, Not the Destination","review":"I love Laurie R. King's voice. It's unique and engrossing. When I read a title from her Mary Russell series I always learn something intriguing about Greek, Hebrew or linguistics.The plot for 'A Letter of Mary' could be written on a flea, as Herman Melville would say. The plot and its twists and turns aren't exciting or broad in scope. It is the mind's eye of Mary Russell that pulls me along. She is a fabulous protagonist and King's depiction of her is unerring.Four stars for a great trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Runs Out of Narrative Steam","review":"While I enjoyed the first two books as light reading, this third one puts an end to my reading of the Mary Russell series. The first two books proved entertaining despite various problems with characters and grating little errors, but the thin plot sinks this third book. The characters seem less developed and less interesting here, and most of the book is given over to false trails and irrelevant theological musings.I have decided after finishing this third book to stick with Elizabeth Peters as my mystery writer of choice; her Amelia Peabody series does a lot more with the same time period and features stronger, more lively writing and characters. If you like academic period mysteries with female detectives, I suggest the Peabody books or Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as described","review":"You should know that CD#2 is for Spanish speakers, and that other parts require you to choose to work in Italian, Spanish, German or French.

A clip-art dachshund with a tail with motion lines is used for please or thank you (I forget which), but many people will probably fail to get the connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written biography","review":"This book is a well written biography of Admiral Cunningham, or ABC as he was known in the service. Many people consider ABC the greatest Admiral since Nelson, which is quite a high expectation.The writing does not drag, as many biographies do. And while the writer obviously admires ABC, and puts him on a pedestal it is not a real tall pedestal.Now, why did I give the book four stars and not five? Two reasons. First, the book skips quickly through ABC's early life and career, and almost completly avoids ABC's part in WWI, which he spent largely commanding a destroyer. Second, while he gives an excellent description of the Battle of Mattapan, ABC's largest fleet action, he fails to indicate why the battle was important.All in all, if you like biographies or naval history, this book would be an excellent addition to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Label","review":"The cover and inside look are very decieving.

However, we have now owned the shower head for 9 months and it is falling apart. It is cracked on the side and we receive almost no water pressure from the head. It is made of plastic and is pulling apart. We have had to tape the handle together to receive any water out of the head.There is a reason this is such a great price - my advice would be to invest a little more and you will not be shopping for a new shower head in 9 months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality!","review":"Don't buy this!

A friend had the white version of this showerhead, and it seemed like a good fit for my shower. I bought the chrome version because I thought it would hold up better than the white one. I really like the showerhead! It is heavier than the bad showerhead I had before, but it works so much better! It is completely adjustable and stays in place without having to use any tools. I suppose that it would be tighter if I used tools; however, the package doesn't recommend it.

A pretty poor design by WaterPik."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will comply - over and out","review":"This album bore the brunt of audience expectations after the demise of Uncle Tupelo. It's not surprising it was initially viewed as a disappointment coming on the heels of that legendary band's swansong \\"Anodyne\\", but it might be time to take another listen. \\"A.M.\\" doesn't have the scope or ambition of all future Wilco discs, but it does boast a solid collection of country-rock tunes, played and sung with no-frills honesty. If \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is Jeff Tweedy's \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", then this was his \\"Meet the Beatles\\", and as such it's a perfectly acceptable first chapter in the Wilco saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop, not country","review":"I love this album. Perfect melodies, Tweedy's excellent lyrics, and songs that range from happy pop to twang to folk. You can't really NOT like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceedingly listenable","review":"I came to Wilco via the Billy Bragg/Wilco/Woody Guthrie Mermaid Avenue project. I have an off-and-on affection for Wilco, the off part being because I think on occasion they get so wrapped up in being musical craftsmen that they forget the average listener focuses quite a bit on the lyrics and emotion of the delivery. Given all that, I would say this is better than the double-album Being There, but not as good as Summerteeth in terms of blending all three things (music, emotion, message). The one song Stirrat sings \\"It's Just That Simple\\" is a sweet little song and \\"Pick Up the Change\\" is a brilliant comment on relationships. And you can't help but sing along to Passenger Side, a song about drinking and driving...kinda. (\\"You're going to make me spill my beer/If you don't learn how to steer\\"). You won't regret this purchase even if you don't wind up loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick Of The Year (1995)","review":"In 1995; music was needing a savior band. After the death of grunge; us; the music fans were needing a true band to carry the songwriting torch. Wilco came up to the plate and hit a home run.Born from the defunct Alt-Country pioneering band; Uncle Tupelo, Wilco came out with a debut every bit as raw and edgy as The Rolling Stones early recordings; and arguably better. Jeff Tweedy's songwriting on this record is flawless and heartfelt. From the upbeat; 'Casino Queen', to the mellow; 'Dash 7', the music arrangments and songwriting seem flawless; but still sound edgy and cool.A beautiful mind captivating record. This is what good; no great music sounds like. The record has a poise to it and still this youthful energy of a band that's just coming to terms with starting over and making a muture, elegant yet gritty debut album. Thisband rocks more than people give them credit for; and this record shows off that rock bambast."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fave Wilco album","review":"This grabs me more than any other Wilco album. There is no filler on this album as all of the songs are fully realized and catchy.I generally like the other Wilco albums, but this one just grabs me the most. I think it is cool that Wilco have tried to \\"branch out\\" and not keep making the same albums, but I keep coming back to this albumI can really relate to \\"Box Full of Letters\\", and this could be a theme song for all of us procrastinators. Wilco hits its highest notes with me on the \\"ne'er do well\\" trio of songs: \\"Casino Queen\\", \\"Box Full of Letters\\", and \\"Passenger Side\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it for over 15 years!","review":"My first Wilco album and still one of my favorites. Wish they played more of these songs live. They are a great act to catch. The whole band and Jeff Tweedy solo are wonderful. Some of my favorite songs are from this album. This and their live album are a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"not yankee hotel foxtrot","review":"i gave this album two stars not so much because it isn't any good, but because it isn't any good for Wilco. My problem is that I started my Wilco facination by listening to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, which is probably one of the greatest albums of all time. A.M. sounds like a totally different group altogether. As a matter of fact, you probably won't understand Wilco's Country Alt Rock label until you listen to A.M. I'm not anti-country at all, but what Wilco has evolved into since this album came out sounds so much better. I would listen before you buy. If you're a fan of Wilco's current sound, you'll probably be disapointed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Wilco fans probably won't like it","review":"I've gotten into Wilco starting at the end and working my way back to the beginning. This album couldn't be farther from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot if it tried. I loved YHF and wanted to see more about this band, but was sorely disappointed to see they were making Hee-Haw-worthy country albums like \\"AM\\" before they figured out how to sound cool. Avoid unless you're a country music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Alt-Country Around","review":"Let me start the review by stating that country, even alt-country are probably my least favorite of all genres, and that as a big Wilco fan myself, Summerteeth is the album that got me into Wilco.With that being said, I enjoy A.M. certainly alot more than Uncle Tupelo. (That also might be due to the fact I much prefer Jeff Tweedy's voice of Jay Farrar's)But, while it is certainly great power-pop, it is obvious why people who jumped on the Wilco bandwagon late in their career would be angered and slightly confused as to what exactly Jeff Tweedy was thinking and how an alt-country band went crazily experimental. Nonetheless, a great debut, and great album overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than I ever expected","review":"I was introduced to Wilco through their album Being There. I then moved to YHF, and they became my favorite band. A.M. was the last album of their's that I bought, and when I first listened to it, I ignored it, and it went back in its case for quite awhile. I had added the songs to an mp3 playlist, and so I listened to it when I went to bed every night. After about a week, I began to appreciate the album. Every song is very different from each other song, and they all give a very distinct feel to the album, and by doing this, gives the album its own texture, different from each other album. It also helps to see the roots from which the Wilco we all know and love grew. A definite keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilco's best by far... but that ain't sayin' much","review":"If you consider Wilco a deep, artistic, philosophically important band (meaning you gave YHF a 5-star review), then you may as well pass on this one. \\"A.M.\\" is what alt-rock was back in the day - a little twang, a few hooks, a bit of crunchy guitar and... a cowbell! In other words, fun. \\"Casino Queen\\" is about as fine a piece of Stones-worship as you will find. \\"And my wife that I just met, she's lookin' like a wreck\\" is a wonderful, witty line. If you want to hear the pre-morose Wilco, this one is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the show","review":"Its becoming more like showtimes Jeremiah, which was an excellent serial. It remanins to be seen if the show can stick to the main story arc, or if it will slow down to focus on the supporting stories. So far, its been a slow, but interesting ride.The ending of season one I thought was spot on. A nice direction to take the story in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ole Cliffhanger!","review":"In the beginning we missed season 1 of Jericho because we thought it was like Jeremiah, which we didn't particularly like. We saw Jericho on free tv and it left us salivating because we had to wait another week for the next episode. Nowadays its extremely difficult to find the kind of imaginative writing that takes the viewer to the point of wanting more, but Jericho does exactly that - leaves you wanting more.

It catalogs every TV show series from the start of TV programming. Each entry includes a basic show description, evolution of changes from season to season, major characters, cast breakdowns, dates of the show by season and more.Extra tables and references in the back of the book are also excellent including the prime time lineup of TV shows by year. I enjoyed reviewing the original show evening lineups from the mid to late 1960's. The same shows were the reruns of the 1970's.This is the type of book you pick up out of curiosity then 2 hours later you realize you other things you need to do. Flipping through book will make you remember shows and personalities of the past. You will find yourself cross referencing like crazy to satisfy your desire to recall TV shows you have all but forgotten.My book is only up through about 2000. If this book is regularly updated, it is probably growing in size or shrinking in font. A fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Print Source For General TV Information","review":"This book is one of the best print source for background information on TV shows.

However, a number of entries list inaccurate dates w/regards to when certain casts members joined a series (this first became apparent in the previous edition, published in 99), and other occasional errors show up here and there.

Book is very affordable, I purchased for less than $5 with shipping; a large hardcover, finely bound in Italy and filled with numerous, high quality color reproductions. Serves as a great guide to the massive palace, and is divided into four sections: Museum, Gardens, Trianon, and, of course, the chateau itself (divided into seven sections, each showcasing particular suites, apartments, and the opera house).

Great addition to any library for the price, great for any history/art lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun and Good Humour","review":"This game is good fun.

It is outrageous, it has very unrealistic weapons (Shark gun, world's smallest black hole, etc.\\", and it has a ragtag group known as the Lionhearts. I'm not sure how far through the game I am at this point, but I can't put it down. The jet pack missions are just awesome.The game won't win any awards for graphics, but they do the trick. No complaints there. The voice work is some of the best I've ever heard.

Armed and dangerous is Fun. It doesn't have forty different guns because you don't need them. Sniper rifle, machine gun with a generous clip a rocket launcher and a Landshark gun for laughs. What else do you need?I think a multiplayer will be released soon enouigh and if the developer is smart, they'll make it a free download. A&D II should be great fun.PLay this game!

Please stay away from it for your own good","review":"This movie is goofy funny, but goofy to the point of being idiotic. There is nudity but nowhere near enough. I really disliked this movie because it does not make it as a comedy, and much less as an explotaintion movie. The box cover is a major deception. The only redemable quality in it is Rhonda Shear who I still find attractive and wished that they would had shown more of her especially in the shower scenes.

It wa a big hit on X mas day for the whole family, sitting around having a ball. Some take it more seriously than others. But whatever you level of expertise this singing game is both FUN , histerical (when you are with the right crowd) and definitly encouraging for the hard core karaoke singers. Whether you sing for the fun of it or take it in seriousnous, you will enjoy this game.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and very fun","review":"This game is very fun and it is an very good game to take out at a party for any age group. I got this for my twelve years old sister and it was fun. Especially when it judges how well you keep up with the song because if you don't the audience will grab their ears and walk away. I am glad I got this for her but now I wish I would had brougt for my nine and six years old so we can play it at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fun the family will have with your PS2","review":"This is now my favorite game on the PS2 - and the family too. And I'm not even that big into singing. The best part about it is the headset that scores your actual voice singing the notes - MUCH better than the American Idol game where you have to press the controller button in sync with the notes. The first day I got it, I played it for 3 hours - it's totally addictive trying to get a better score by singing. This is also a great game for parties (after everyone's had something to drink of course). At our Thanksgiving dinner, family and friends loved it (and was really good!). The 35 songs selection is great - some rock, 80s, and music you hear on the radio today. I can't wait for the expansion disc to come out with even MORE SONGS - so if anyone from Konami is reading this, get more songs pronto! This game should blow American Idol out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This game is EXTREMELY FUN to play!! I'm more of a kinda person that plays mostly Racing, Battle, Multiplayer, Dance Dance Revolution games.... and this is one game that's using your VOICE which is WICKED AWESOME! Only downside to this game is that there's not many songs to choose from HOWEVER, they are going to be EXPANSIONS!!! can't wait for those.... my friends and i play it so much that our throat hurts so much when we wake up in the morning but that doesn't stop us from playing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY PLEASED CONSUMER/LOVE TO SING","review":"This game is awsome, great fun for the whole family. My wife and kids are having a blast playing and singing. We cant wait for the expansion disc to come out, so far I havnt' found one in stores anywhere. The headphones are alittle small but I can adjust it to the right on my head so you can get the wole effect of the vocals. We are going to have Karaoke parties with more people and have sing offs. So far my high score is 40,000 pointson Every Morning which is way above platinum scoreing.

My husband and I took this game with us when we went to a family reunion. I don't know about you, but our family reunions are usually not very lively. My husband had the great idea of showing this game to everyone that was there. Soon, the whole room was taking turns singing karaoke! It was hilarious!! Everyone in the room was rolling with laughter.This game isn't just for parties though. It is just as fun to play by yourself. Especially if you are a DORK like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Practice","review":"When I heard that Konami was doing a karaoke game I was shocked. I love to do karaoke and I wanted to see how it would be. I love playing DDR and I probably spend over $25 a week on the game to show off. Anyways, I started playing it and it was great. The only difficult thing is you must not sing too much with a vibrato. The microphone picks up your voice and the arrow needs to be on spot. I haven't tried the guys yet but I bet it will be a lot of fun. Even my younger brother hates me singing, but pouted if I refused to let him play. For anyone who is afraid to sing in front of people, don't worry, the graphics do it for ya!! This is the best way to start!! Go ahead now!! PICK IT UP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overpriced!","review":"Target sells these for a third of the cost.

This product has been giving us severe headaches and watery eyes even when we were just airing it out for a few days before use. Beware of asthema-like symptoms once you receive it and stand close to it. We had not had any prior experience as such with a few other stroller rain covers. Had to return it. Too bad the plastic smell is so strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! A MUST HAVE! - Boston, MA","review":"We read a lot of the reviews for this product before buying it - some did not like the zipper quality ( 2009 covers).I have to say that I am VERY pleased with this product! The zipper quality is heavy duty. I had no problems assembling it into my stroller, I was worried about fitting it in my single jogger stroller(from baby trend) but I was pleasantly surprised! It has straps on the bottom so you can pull and adjust the fitting to your stroller. I Highly recommend it to parents! If you live in areas where snows, rains or is windy this cover is a PLUS. Bottom line, my daughter stays nice and warm inside this stroller cover. Well worth the money for us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The History of Marshall","review":"Since there are no OTHER books out there dealing with the Marshall amplification history this one will just have to do..for now. Sporting no glossary, and with more pictures and poorly reproduced schematics than relevant tonal references, I found myself searching time and time again for some clue as to the legendary tonal qualities associated with the individual models. None were given really. I was hoping for some help in trying to select a new or vintage Marshall amp and I couldn't find it here. There is far MORE INFORMATION available on the internet than is compiled here in this book. Copyrighted in 1993 this book NEEDS TO BE UPDATED, it's now 15 years out of date. For $33.00 I could have done without this book..although I do like looking at the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Not what I expected. Although very basic it lacked the detail I expected such as a more in-depth write on Jim Marshall's life and the pictures of the actual artists which use Marshall Amplifiers weren't sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact Yet Comprehensive","review":"This guide was invaluable during my first birding trip to Australia. Although I've birded for a number of years, Australian birds have almost no overlap with American birds, so virtually everyone of the 215 species I saw were new. The guide helped me quickly identify birds in the field. A few birds are listed in more than one place, which I first thought was an error, then I realized it wasn't and actually helped a lot when a bird could easily fit into more than one category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slater's Australian Birds is perfectly fine","review":"This book is just fine for almost all level of birders. The index is clear, the photos are colorful and generous, and the bird detail writeups are standard. The book's dimensions are fine for a backpack, though it's a little heavy for a pocket.

The reader walks with her, experiencing the vibrant beauty and complexity of Indian culture as well as the inward journey of Jazz toward accepting her own beauty and complexity. Perkins does not shy away from the harder questions around poverty and injustice, raising the story a notch above mainsteam young adult literature. As Jazz's heart softens toward the poor, so does mine, a feeling that has stayed with me. A must read for mixed race youths or anyone else willing to probe their feelings about poverty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I thought this book was great!

They need to go back and review their old material!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time to call it quits, boys.","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I really enjoyed the first two Jerky Boys CDs and much of the third. By the time the fourth CD rolled around, the schtick was getting tired and the pranks went from funny and silly to rude and stupid.Now, the Jerky Boys have unleashed their fifth CD: \\"Stop Staring At Me.\\" This CD is just the pits. There's not even one or two good tracks. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore","review":"The first two Jerky Boys albums were unlike anything I had ever heard. Sure, prank calling has been around since Graham Bell told Watson \\"Ha! You believed I really needed you! Get back in your office, ya tool!\\". But the Jerky Boys gave it a special touch. Filthy, extreme, and unbelievable, they still somehow managed to draw people into their trap even after making a movie introducing the whole world to their characters. (Of course, no one watched the movie, so I guess that's not that amazing.)But they've simply run out of ideas and have worn out their welcome. This album is the best evidence yet of that fact. Prank calling is the best example of a type of humor best in small doses, and the Jerky Boys are past the Recommended Daily Allowance."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny","review":"There is no imaginative effort or creativity on this tape.

They've run out of ideas, and most of the time people are well aware they are being pranked."},{"rating":"1","title":"gradual decline","review":"At this point the JB's are getting by on name alone, because their material has fallen off noticeably. If this effort had been their first release rather than their fifth release I doubt they would have made much of an impact back in 1993. I can't blame them for wanting to continue to cash in, but if they can't put much energy into their new material maybe they should consider releasing the remaining bootleg recordings from the early 90's which have not yet appeared on any of their official releases. I have one of those Jerkey Boys bootleg tapes and it is so filled with raw energy and inspiration it's hard to beleive it was done by the same two guys who put out SSAM. Maybe listening to and releasing the old stuff will remind them what they are capable of, or at least inspire them try a little harder. So c'mon guys, at least go down fighting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but still funny!","review":"I just got this CD today...I listend to it and I thought it was pretty funny.

This is as low as crank-calling gets, and it's obvious that the Jerkys had lost all of their inspiration at this point. This is a couple of tired, bored guys pumping out a product to make a few more bucks.Just look at Sol Rosenberg, once the greatest character in prank-calling comedy. Some of his tracks on the album - 'Masturbation Box' and 'Send A Salami' especially - are excruciatingly stupid and unfunny. It's a real shame. The Jerkys were once clever punks; now they're vulgar and predictable, spewing juvenile potty humor. And what's with the '1,000 Chickens Trlogy?' None of the three parts is funny by itself, and it's less funny as a whole. Once Sol starts talking about having sex with the chickens, you'll shake your head and wonder where Brennan's clever and bizarre sense of humor went.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boys on auto-pilot.","review":"This is what you guys came up with! I knew it couldn't last but if these guys don't stop (excuse the pun) phoning in their performances I just might have to do somethin' silly and stop buying their CD's. What is this stuff? The Boys used to be artists; the way they used English language was avant garde and refreshing. Now they do caricatures of their characters, who were only novel vessels which to screw around with people in the first place. The jewel of the bunch here is \\"Willy the Jackass\\" Now that's some funny s**t. The guys have lost their edge. Pranksters mourn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a HUGE Jerky fan and have all of their cds, but I was really disappointed with this CD. There are a couple of funny tracks, but the majority of the tracks are stuff that people do as kids, not the hilarious crazy stuff that they did in their previous cds.In my opinion, this is not worth the money for only a couple of funny tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The party ended hours ago they really should have split then","review":"... The sad part is, I really loved the 1st and 2nd CD, and even hung in there for the 3rd one, but they must have about 6 of them now and the joke is just tired. Kamal was never funny anyway, although he would gladly spend several hours explaining to you why he feels that he is the funny one, (which only serves to further illustrate the fact that he never really, \\"got it\\" anyway). John was the real Jerky Boy, and Kamal was, well, just a jerk. John B. still cracks me up and he has his moments even on this CD, but if you want the real deal, just listen to the first 2 CDs (only bother with John's tracks) and you will see why they (read, John Brennan) became so popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"First True Understanding About Anxiety","review":"Rob is insightful and humorous, breathing passion and optimism into what can be a very depressing subject. His teachings about healing the real feelings behind the fear and using a new \\"cool\\" anxiety attitude are so wonderfully put.This is not the real program. This is an old listing with the same title. The 8 CD program that I bought seems to be only available at the website.

Bijou has a lightweight voice that is grating and has a bratty tone. There is nothing new here.

Most improvements are in scenery and clouds, ATC is also somewhat improved. A tricked out FS2K2 does just about the same. Microsoft did not put much effort into this latest upgrade IMHO. I would expect the next version to be the big push, and it might be worth waiting for that version. After I installed Century of Flight, I found myself still using FS2K2 using my addons.

If you like MS FS, buy the older version and save the money. It is flat out rediculous that you cannot crash a plane in this game.

It will just bounce off the surface until it come to a stand still, you also can take it off from there. Material obstacles are none......you just fly through them. I expect from a good flight simulator that doing the wrong thing and putting the plane \\"outside the envelope\\" has real consequences for the game i.e. you crash or damage the plane. Also it is disappointing how \\"buggy\\" the game still is...flickering screen and vanishing text and picures when scrolling. This game is not what I would expect from MS.

I like the idea of interaction with ATC, and having flown real aircraft for the past 14 years, the calls are close to accurate.This is one of those games/sims that you'll really appreciate sometime in the fall of 2004, when you've upgraded to the next faster machine. For now, at playable settings, it won't look much different than what you've flown before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Assessment of MS Flight Simulator","review":"MS Flight Simulator is a very advanced \\"game\\" which requires advanced knowledge and skill on the the part of the user, and a very high performing computer gaming system to present at its best.While the \\"game\\" will play on a pedestrian system, power computer system performance makes that difference between \\"game\\" and virtual reality. Following on from that, the effort to learn the skills of flying will add greatly to the reward of flying in the low fuel consumption MS Flight Simulator.Take it from someone who has managed, maintained and flown advanced flight simulators since the mid 60's, this system is as incredible as your computer system and your skills.This software is fabulous provided that you have the computer system and the personal dedication to get the most from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugs A-Plenty & Not Much New","review":"There is not a lot that I can say that hasn't already been stated by other reviewers. I've made the mistake of buying MS software fresh off of new releases and swore I would never do it again, due to glitches, bugs, lock-ups, etc... that were not caught in the 35 minutes of Beta testing done prior to release. I'm really upset with myself that I did it again. While anxious for what was a highly anticipated Flight Simulator, I ended up disappointed by the apparently lacking quality control put into the finished product. I agree with the other reviewers who said to wait for 3 to 6 months before buying; hopefully by then the patches will have corrected some problems.

I would suggest waiting a while before you purchase FS2004 especially if you own FS2002. The software development team used the same old tired panels that have been used since FS2000 and before. The work seemed to go into the new aircraft ie, Wright Flyer etc. If you have FS2002 and have updated panels from the base set of aircraft you will be very disappointed to go back to the Jurasic era panels. Microsoft really needs to pay attention to what is out there as 3rd party addon's for instance Paul Goldings panels and aircraft.General advice wait 3 to 4 months before buying by than Microsoft should have solutions to most of the problems once enought people beta tested it for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the game, but...","review":"game did not come in the \\"tin\\" as shown, would not have ordered it from here if I had known that the \\"tin\\" was missing!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great begining.","review":"This is a good flight sim that has a lot going for it.

That said, don't bother wasting your money if you already have FS2002. The graphics look almost the same as FS2002. As usual looking down at the terrain from a high altitude is great. On the other hand, once you come down to a lower altitude you can't tell if it's a field or a brown block. Sounds like they've used the same old programmers from FS2002 into 2004. Microsoft needs better programmers so we can appreciate the scenery at low altitude. They should also add farms and houses on mountains. It is completely desolate in the game with no lights at night.

An added benefit is that they don't hurt nearly as much when someone spikes a ball at you. They are all around more user-friendly for the novice players.

Sure it has extra outfits and stages and online play for those who can afford the excruciating monthly broaband fees, but it fixes none of the information problems in training mode, the characters are hard to control, and the optional English Language Dialogue that was in DoA 2 Hardcore for the PlayStation 2 has been stripped from the X-Box version.As for the Dead or Alive series in general, if I want confusing combo moves, I'll play one of those stupid dancing games.

Oh about the fighting physics they suck. You can about counter every freakin move. I used Hybusha for a few days and I beat a Super rank gamer on DOA online, how pathetic.

The interjections of his personal experiences lends the reader the confidence necessary to just relax and enjoy the book. He will gain insight and wisdom from his findings.

I enjoy the pleasure of having a very extensive golf library. This book is at the top of my list because it does away with a lot of the bs, and actually teaches you something about how to handle yourself and to grow as a golfer AND an adult. There's more medical info about how the brain works than a lot of people need to know or would even understand. That's not all bad, though; because you might learn something beyond the usual crap about your grip and how complicated it is to swing a stick. Personally, I'm playing better and enjoying my time on the range and course waaaay more. That is the point, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh Approach to Sports Psychology","review":"Having read several sports psychology books - Rotella etc. - I found \\"On The Sweet Spot\\" to be refreshing and provocative. Keefe marries sports performance with the science of the brain in an instructive and memorable manner. This is not a traditional \\"how to\\" book that reviews the standard steps such as \\"pre-shot routine\\" - I am sure that Keefe felt that those topics have been covered effectively by the existing body of work. Instead it probes deeper into the mysterious interaction between the self, the brain and spirituality.This is not a casual read, it demands thinking and reflection - but ultimately delivers a compelling message."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT book for wolf lovers","review":"This is the best book of its type about wolves.

There were so many typographical and grammatical mistakes that it made it unpleasant to read. At first, I thought this book may have been badly translated. However, after I read the jacket information, I realized it was sloppy editing. Shame on them!!! Mozart and his women deserved much better treatment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive","review":"Impresario Glover has a global view of Mozart, most tellingly through her deep understanding of his music as well as her conscientious attention to the voluminous correspondence among his sister, his parents, and his other women friends and associates.

No matter how many biographies of Mozart you have already studied, I would recommend this work as an essential addition to the bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set up for the Revolution","review":"Great book explains all the details leading up to the Revolution with the pamphlet that contained the 46 pages written by \\"Thomas Paine\\" named \\"Common Sense\\" this man was one of the most brillant people that ever walked the face of the earth, what he writes in 1776 is still true today, he was truly Revolutionary!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolution From The Bottom Up","review":"Scott Liell's treatise on the genesis and impact of Thomas Paine's \\"Common Sense\\" is perhaps a bit repetitive, and perhaps a bit obvious to anyone familiar with the evolution of the Colonial Congress, but it does bring out the guiding principle that made American independence such a powerful symbol. This was a drive for independence which arose from the farmers and tradespeople, not the politicians -- and it was predicated on the principle that government should be \\"of the people, by the people and for the people.\\"It was not just a revolution against the British monarchy, it was a revolution in thought, a paradigm shift, that people could and should govern themselves, and would do a better job of it than any inherited bloodline.These thoughts are just as revolutionary today, and still bear defending against modern advocates of aristocracies and plutocracies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great narrative history","review":"I had not thought much about Tom Paine since I read Howards Fast's novel about him while I was in college. Someone recommended this book to me and within the first chapter I remembered what I loved about Paine's story then. Liell's book is as well paced and well written as fast's even though it is a non-fiction work. One warning: five minutes after you are done with \\"46 pages\\" you will be going to Amazon to plunk down your cash for a volume of Paine's great writing.

Every song is a sad one, but running through the album there is the promise of better things to come over the horizon. Chris's vocals are just amazing, full of emotions ranging from sad and accepting, anger, desperation, and sorrow, that you can just feel the pain in each song. A brilliant album, in a retro-rock style...with great vocals and instrumentation (guitar, bass, drums, Hammond B3 and sax). The title song is a sad ballad featuring just Chris on guitar and vocals.

He is not a true original.That said, Chris Isaak's music grows on me. This guy plays meet and potatoes Rock and Roll with a superb singing voice. His songs are fairly simple but this simplicity makes them special.\\"Forever Blue\\" has Isaak singing the heart-broken melodies once again. \\"Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing\\" is a very cool song with Chris singing low to the base line. If Elvis was alive today and released such songs as \\"Somebody's Crying\\", \\"There She Goes\\", or \\"Don't Leave Me Walking on My Own\\" people would be going nuts over these fine songs. Get a hold of this album if you enjoy Rock and Roll the way it was meant to be played: a couple of chords, a good beat, and a great voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set this one on Repeat Play","review":"I bought \\"Forever Blue\\" after reading the reviews here and was not disappointed. It's one of the few albums I listen to straight through. There are no bad tracks! Some songs are more mellow than others, but all are good and very listenable.'Somebody's Crying' was the big single; I enjoy it, but my favorites are Graduation Day, Go Walking Down There and Shadows in a Mirror.The band is great; it sounds like they're playing just for you. The musical style is simple, charming, nostalgic. Chris' voice is earnest and intimate, smooth, but achy, and when he sings (in Shadows in a Mirror), \\"Oh, and I, I still need your love/I can't see my life, darling, without you\\" it's like he's Orbison, only better.This is my only Isaak album, and I hesitate to buy one of his others only because I'm afraid he couldn't make a better one than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue, through and through.","review":"I've enjoyed a few Chris Isaak albums, from his debut, to \\"Heart Shaped World\\", but this is his best front to back. It's very consistent, from the mood, to the quality of the songs. Some of the better tracks here are \\"Somebody's Crying\\", \\"Graduation Day\\", \\"Things Go Wrong\\", and \\"Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing\\", which became popular years later. \\"I Believe\\" is a good one too, as well as the great closer \\"The End Of Everything\\". It's hard not to make comparisons to \\"Orbison\\" and \\"The King\\", I mean, he does sound like \\"Roy\\", and looks and style wise, he is the modern day \\"Elvis\\". Just without the popularity.

I bought this album years ago, but everytime my heart breaks, I find myself going back to this one album. It is, by far, my favourite album by any artist. I never tire of it. From the raucous opener \\"Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing\\", to the soft, straight-forward sentiments in the title track, I always find some strange, selfish comfort in the knowledge that out there, someone else is feeling as bad and heartbroken as I am.

Their take on rock (and I would call it rock) was totally fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Poundingly Gorgeous","review":"I bought this album on a recommendation from Billboard's Timothy White, and he was right on. Thirteen years later, there's still no album quite like it - it's a catalog of deep feelings being pushed over a cliff. \\"Bound Together\\" is like \\"yea! we're all going to get blown up together!\\" \\"Snowman\\" is the POV of a woman after being beaten. But the songs are so beautifully crafted, even Debussey-esque, that you find new insight in old corners. In it's own way it's tougher than most of its grungy contemporaries, yet every song is very hummable. If that sounds like Steely Dan, you're getting the picture.Your mother would like it too, but don't let that stop you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely!!","review":"I love the first cd and love this one even more. Suddenly Tammy is a great band and I wish they would group back together and make more great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing unit","review":"This little thing is just amazing. Every capability Line6 described is true and you can spend hours experimenting with new quality tones. Setup was very easy, even though my computer met the minimun requirements. I don't know what latency is because this unit has solve that problem, I really believe that Tone direct monitoring is working great. I've been using it on a daily basis and every day I can create and recreate a lot of tones. If you want to save your money and still sound great, you should give it a try.PD: I'm thinking seriously to sell my amp and get a pro Line6 hardware, they met my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vista compatible -- But watch the wiring","review":"It works well with Vista, and the interface is great. Lots of variety in selecting sounds, guitars and amps. It's truly hot. But while I can manage the box via USB, I can't get sound out of it the same way. I had to plug the box directly into the sound card through a mike port. It's a bit primative and the sound is analog, not digital. Also, you have to watch the volume or you could fry the sound card by putting too much electricity through the mike port. I recommend the product, but be aware that you may have to manage the box via USB and get sound by running a cord between the headphone port on the box and the mike port on your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"We purchased this for our five year old daughter. The quality was better than we expected for the money and she absolutely loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ariel Mermaid Watch","review":"Great value for the price. Better than expected in person. Quality watch for the price. Love this undersea face better than the other models out there. Was happy to find out that even though the band is \\"kid sized\\", it also fits adult women's wrist.Highly recommend. Will probably buy one or 2 more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Watch!","review":"The watch was very pretty & cute. I was worried it was going to be small for an adult, since it stated it was kids size, but it fit perfectly! It is a very nice watch.*edit* The band (coming from a person in hot so cal) creates sweat at times which makes am unpleasant smell (if smelled up close), from what the person i gave this to as a gift told me. The band is plastic as well so this may be sort of expected. So I would recommend buying another band after you order it. I would change it to 4/5 if I was able to edit the star rating! Too bad they didn't make the band cloth with the star imprint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money...","review":"The Great Margarita book basically contains one (1) margarita recipe over and over again. The only thing that changes is the brand, type or blend of tequilas that are used in the recipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless...","review":"EVERY recipe is the same. Just substitute different tequillas, different oarnge liquers, lemon juice, and give it a crazy name to get every single recipe. Everybody loves fruit twists in their margarita nowadays, but there is only one mention of a strawberry and a peach margarita at the end. It ends up being just a big ad for the resaurant where all these margaritas were \\"invented.\\" The pictures are pretty, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"I had a thought about writing a Margarita recipe book. I went to Mexico to see the Tequila-making process and taste each and every type of Tequila manufactured.Or so I'm told.Later, when I woke up at home, I was disappointed to find there was already a very nice-looking Margarita recipe book. I keep the book on hand, as a kind of joke. It opens with some history, then a classic, uncompromising, margarita recipe. Turning the page, one learns that a Margarita can, in fact, be made with a different Tequila and orange liqueur altogether! Each and every recipe is exactly the same; only the brands of Tequila and liqueur are changed, to protect the innocent. If you want a book where you can find an identical, genetically purebred Margarita regardless of which page you open to, this is the one to get. Heck, get two dozen identical copies. Your sense of whimsy will not be lost on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A One Recipe Book","review":"If all you want is one recipe for a margarita this is the book for you. It takes the same formula over and over (tequila, triple sec and lime juice) then varies the type of tequila and triple sec. What a waste of good paper. But it is printed well, great layout, nice photos and illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a Great margarita book.","review":"Yes, the history of Maria's, tequila, and the margarita are interesting. Some of the \\"tidbits\\" are also interesting and useful. There's a foreward by Robert Redford to boot. But the fact still remains, this book consists of one basic recipe repeated again and again and again. And I don't buy the argument about the careful match of tequila to a liqueur. After reading the book, I couldn't shake the sneaking suspicion that I'd been had. If you're looking for some margarita recipes, search the internet and skip the book, I just don't believe it's worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"I bought this book in preparation for a trip to Mexico. When the book showed up, I was very disappointed - it's basically the same recipe over and over again using different tequilas.Buy a book about Tequilas and experiment with the Tequilas that appeal to you using this formula; 1.25oz Tequila, 1oz citrus liquer of your choice and 1.5oz fresh squeezed lemo or lime juice. Repeat 75 times substituting various Terquilas and liquers and you will have replicated this book.Happy Margaritaville!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair book; lousy service","review":"I just visited Maria's Restaurant, owned by Al Lucero, in Santa Fe, NM, and have never, in all my world travels, experienced such bad service as I did this evening. The waitor was horrid, rude and incompetent. The food was cold and dry, and the margarita was fair at best.This restaurant has a reputation for being wonderful. It is NOT! Don't waste your time visiting the restaurant, or buying the book. There is no information in the book that can't be found quite easily elsewhere, and after my experience with the author and his family restaurant, I will burn the first book I've ever burned in my long life."},{"rating":"1","title":"75 Recipes for the same margarita","review":"I bought this book in preparation for a party. When the book showed up, I was severly disappointed - it's basically the same recipe over and over again using different tequilas. The book does briefly talk about a lot of different tequilas and has a few (and I do mean few) recipes for other margaritas (fruit etc). But instead of buying this book, try [web address] you'll find a much better variety and save yourself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"If you want to learn about some different brands of tequila, this is okay, but you can get more and better information for free online. The margarita recipes are virtually identical. It's unbelievable that they have them printed over and over again, page after page, just with a different brand of tequila."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I liked the song \\"Kids in America\\" so I thought I'ld give this album a chance. Oops.And hey, would you mind stopping screaming for twenty seconds? My ears are bleeding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drummer needs a better band","review":"Roy Mcdonald is one of many unlucky talented musicians. He has to rely on other peoples songs in order to be heard on record. Unfortunately, Kim Shattuck is a 3rd..............no I take that back, a 4th rate songwriter. Not an original thought in her head. And what a terrible singer. Roy, do yourself a favor, and find a better band. Remember, your only as strong as your weakest link..............and you, my friend, a playing with a broken chain. Two stars for the drummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius","review":"While \\"The Muffs\\" should be a term in everyone's vocabulary, this band has somehow continued to simmer without becoming the most popular punk band of all time. One listen to Blonder And Blonder should reveal to you that punk rock songwriting genius just doesn't get any better. Slightly less infectious than Green Day, The Muffs are more advanced punk rock craftsmen. Roy the drummer is a complete phenomenon, with skills to hush the greatest in history. What really makes The Muffs is the subtle yet impossible to emulate songwriting style of Kim Shattuck. The intricacies of her melodies greatly surpass anything else that has even been done with pop punk. These Muffs albums are very solid purchases, textured, and well produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Green Day back then","review":"When I was listening the first two Muffs albums I also had Green Day's 'Dookie' and I always thought the Muffs would go along the same road fame-wise. Their first album was superb and this one also does not let you down.Right from the fast start with 'Agony' and 'Oh Nina' up to track 4, the very poppy, almost commercial track 'Sad Tomorrow'. The highlights are definitely in the first half (or A-side if you have the LP). After that there are some misses ('Ethyl My Love' or 'I'm Confused') but also some perfect punkrock songs in 'Won't Come Out To Play' or the funny 'I Need A Face'.After this album it went somewhat downhill with the Muffs, but this will always be a classic in my collection."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-cb42c3dd"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/50.md","filePath":"sponsor/50.md"}'),H={name:"sponsor/50.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
