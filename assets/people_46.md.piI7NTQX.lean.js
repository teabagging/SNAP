The pace keeps up with the next cut, \\"All Would Envy,\\" a Brazilian flowing piece with great vocalOceanesque sounds of \\"Best Time\\" are cooling and refreshing, followed by nice tempoed \\"When I See You.\\" What a great number \\"Light the Stars\\" with trumpet flowing around, over and behind nice acoustic guitar, pulsating into groove.

That's right, boring. The first two tunes weren't bad, nothing to write home about but passable. By the time I got to the eighth track I could no longer check my impulse to hit the fast forward button. I couldn't even finish listening to the last tune on the CD.

This was a disgrace to the franchise, an abomination of animation and a complete hack job to an otherwise highly revered series. Much like the new transformers series airing on TV now, it clearly demonstrates that American studios still believe that animated programming should be aimed at kids, instead of exploiting the versatility and intricate character traits that some of these creations possess. Watching the Anime retain the horror, action and drama that can only be envisioned through the videogame, its hard to sit through this and not be disgusted by the character design, animation and tone.

Let me also admit that I did not, could not finish this book. It was written in as dry a language as I have encountered (and considering I am an engineer who has to read extremely dry technical manuals, this is not an observation to be taken lightly).I dont know if Mr. Merkur is unable to write well or, as I suspect, he feels that by assuming this dry removed tone his work will seem more scienitic and objective. In either case, his presentation falls short. He makes some good points, if only one can stay awake long enough to read them.

These are memorable, engaging, superbly told stories that celebrate trout fishing in rivers, creeks, lakes across \\"trout country\\". Trout Country will prove welcome and pleasurable reading for anyone who has ever experienced the thrill of trout fishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice of Experience","review":"This book by Bob Saile is a must-have component of any serious angler's library -- a study in honesty, accuracy, and carefully-thought anecdotes from a master. Unlike some fly-fishing writers who seem wrapped up in attitude, or demonstrating what and how much they know (that you don't) Saile's focus in on the essence of this sport, the people, the places, the traditions. His stories are unassuming, yet enlightening. Living in the Rockies, and having fished the places he writes about, with many of the characters he describes, I can tell you that his words are dead-center. You will realize (in a subtle manner) that Saile has literally seen and done more between the riverbanks than most of us could hope to experience. As a writer, and an angler, Saile is the master technician ... the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dominique is America's Sweetheart","review":"Krista Quiner did it again, another fantastic gymnastics biography.

Also, the people I work with-- mostly cancer patients-- found the authors' comments about cancer and other illnesses insulting.

It has made me understand that whatever happened in my life has to do with my background as a child, I was responsible to care for my younger brother and sisters from the age 5 years old . I was sent to reseidential school at the age of 6. I witnessed a lot of physical abuse that my mother received from my stepfather. This book is wonderfull, it makes me realize that I am not alone or weird. I thought I was the only one to have a complex problem like I have.At this time, my boyfriend is always leaving me home and takes off to the bar. He is very jealous of my grown sons. He thinks that I spoil them. I believe I don't. He alway stays with his mother downtown when he doesn't get his way. He doesn't even speak to me, he just leaves. My sons do not stay with us, they are on their own. It seems that he resents any time I spend with them.

I immediately recognized in myself the same patterns described in the book: I was always \\"falling in love\\" with the men who were distant in some way, where I ended up \\"loving\\" the guy more than he loved me, always hoping that he would change. (Yes, HE was always the problem). Through reading this book in conjunction with working with a therapist, I learned how to focus on myself and my own feelings, getting to the core of the past issues which lead me to think so poorly of myself. I learned to love myself and how to wait for a man who would love, respect and appreciate me. I am now happily married to a man whom I love \\"just the way he is\\". I suggest this book to anyone who has been in unhealthy relationships and for those who keep waiting for another's indecisive (regarding committment), disrespectful or abusive behavior to change."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful book","review":"Women Who Love Too Much is a classic self-help book that transcends the genre. Ive read it several times and am always impressed at the wisdom and truths in it. And it reads like fiction. With deep compassion and insight, Robin Norwood describes exactly how women and men get involved in relationships that are destructive rather than the perfect romances they first appear to be. This book does not cater to keeping illusions alive. Some women Ive known cant finish it, or must make several attempts to read the entire book, because its painful to see their illusions about changing him shattered.

I was not able to see at the time, how I was recreating my childhood. I read the book and initially thought it was certainly not descriptive of me. But the words from the book stayed with me until a year later, when I finally realized that a person can't possibly love someone and treat them the way I was being treated. I walked away, actually, ran away. It was only a few months later that I met my husband and we have been together for 19 years. I do partially credit being able to find someone and build a relationship with them because I wasn't looking for that \\"love at first sight\\". Love at first sight may work for those who can intuitively channel their happy childhoods into good decisions, but for those of us with destructive childhoods, we need to make choices based on rational thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has saved me..","review":"This book showed me the error of my ways, I learned from this book how my desire to \\"win\\" was keeping me in relationships that were destroying my peace and serenity. \\" If I only love him enough he will change\\" was truly my motto. Letting go is one of the hardest things to do, fear and ego kept me in situations I had no business being in. I also discovered just because I had finally become smart enough to get out, I was predisposed to make the same selection for myself again and again. If you are a relationship addict, co-dependent or just simply a woman that cannot see herself without a man in your life then buy this book!Ms Norwood reminds us:\\"When our primary aim becomes protecting our own serenity and well being-rather than finding the right man- then and only then are we able to choose companions with whom we can be friendly and who can also care about us in a wholesome way.\\" From Robin's book :Letters From Woman Who Love to Much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up Women!","review":"I found this book very helpful to use with high school students who were pregnant.Most were \\"women who loved too much\\".

Norwood later admitted that \\"many of her patients in the book are really just her.\\" (reference: Backlash:The Undeclared War Against American Women, by Susan Faludi, 1991).

I have found that a number of my friends who married for the first time after the age of 30 had read this book just before they started dating the men they ultimately married.

The personal stories in this book can apply to many women to one degree or another.

We have all read the book at least once and many of us have so dog-eared and marked up our first copy, that we were appreciative of the foresight for the second copy we had been given. I honestly keep this next to my King James Bible and I refer to it as my \\"Second Bible\\". I have to read from it daily. I can not describe with words the power I receive from my worn-out copy.

However, it is extremely important to remember that Robin Norwood, the author, later admitted that the various case histories presented in the book are really herself (see Backlash, The War Against American Women, by Susan Faludi). It is good that this book has helped so many people, but I think it is wise to be honest in self-help books like this one, because one of the goals of this book is to enable you to be more honest with yourself, and what you want in your relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of 'morals'; No substance","review":"I can't help but believe that the only people who would enjoy Lichtman's stories are superficial, have low self esteem, and are of average or below average intelligence. They are looking for something to make them feel better about their shallow, dogmatic morals.Most of the stories involve a person faced with a moral decision, and in order to make the right one, invoke the venerable morals of their parents. Here's a shocking discovery: THAT'S NOT HEARTWARMING. They never ponder WHY a decision was the right one. They never explore morality at all; what it is, how it is useful. It's like someone TOLD them what was right and what was wrong and they don't have the curiosity, insight, or intelligence to find out for themselves.I am a morally conscious person, and I encourage people to continue to explore morality and discover it for themselves. But the only thing this book promotes is thoughtless devotion and conformity to obscure, unproven principles of morality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source of information for herstorical heroines","review":"I enjoy everything that Simone Schwartz-Bart writes.

My husband loved these as a child and I remember how much my best friend's brothers liked them too. (I watched them on occasion as a child and thought they were ok. But they were for the boys, or so I thought). The plots are very simple, and the fighting can sometimes be even comical, but my boys love it, and it is just about right for an 8 and 4 year old.

I like how there aren't severe limitations on obscure letters or the number of letters like there are in Scrabble (my husband found 'zyzzyva' on our first game). We usually only play 7 rounds since we don't give each other a time limit on each turn, which keeps the game from getting too long.It would be great for teaching children math skills in addition to language skills.

LaMarsh's \\"Introduction to Nuclear Engineering\\" is the other IMHO. For those interested in a broad overview of Nuclear Engineering, it is my opinion that you should start with the LaMarsh book. Duderstadt's book contains a lot more math and can be difficult to follow without some solid math background and a few Nuc Eng courses under your belt. There are a few cases in the book where a series of equations leading to a conclusion skip a few steps. It's not as bad as the old \\"A=B and from this we see that e = mc2!\\" joke, but some work is required.That said, this books drawbacks are also its strengths. It has stood the test of time [my copy is over 20 years old] and will probably remain relevant for another 20 years.

The chapters are now managebable for use in a college level introductory aerodynamics course primarily geared toward flight students, in any of the new emerging college curriculum. The book's organization has improved significantly over the first edition. The text is easy to read with good practical examples but there is a level of sophistication above most of the other aerodynamics texts geared for pilots.

The strength of this novel is in its power to force reflection - on the nature of art (music in general, the role of the musician/conductor in particular), the relationship of human passion to art, and the relationship between man and woman. The first switch in stories, from that of the conductor to the ice age lovers, leaves the reader momentarily baffled. At the first return to the contemporary story, however, the interrelationships become clear. Thereafter, the structure of the novel seems natural. At the novel's end, the reader is left with many unanswered questions which in this case leads to a desire to reread, picking up interrelationships not noticed in the first reading.This is not a \\"perfect\\" book but it is well worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bugy","review":"They lasted about two weeks and stopped workingIt took me awhile to figure out what was wrong.The trick to get them working again was to disconect the AC from the base and take out the batteries from the headphones.This hard boot fixed my issue.So far this hickup is my only complaint.

I never have trouble receiving sound. They are amazingly comfortable. Great battery life, and batteries are rechargeable. Long distance is great too, I can walk throughout the whole house on multiple floors without any trouble.But... it's FAR to often that these are NOT working. As a matter of fact I've gone through FOUR pair in the last 2 years. The first pair didn't work out of the box. The second pair lasted two weeks and then the headset just would not turn on. The third pair lasted about eight months before the same thing happened, they just would not turn on. The forth pair lasted about a year and then yesterday the very same thing happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acoustic Research 900MHz Wireless Sterio Headphones AW771","review":"I bought this wireless headphone AW771 in Dec. 03 at Circuit City.

Are These Designed To Be Disposable?","review":"While the sound quality is fine, the construction of these earphones is a disaster. A duster pushed the unit off of its base from which it fell six inches or so onto the table on which it was sitting, resulting in the breakage and separation of the right part of the unit. As a consequence, the right earphone just dangles and cannot be reattached, rendering the unit useless. The earphones were less than one year old, not subject to heavy use and are either made of flimsy material or engineered poorly. If this is representative of what AR is turning out, one may wish to avoid the brand. Certainly avoid these earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiddle,fiddle,fiddle","review":"I bought this head phone expecting the best, but got the worst. There is so much adjusting of various switches each time you use them that you might feel like you are a radio engineer. Also, living in a large city you have to contend with other head phones, cordless telephones and the like using the same frequency which causes most of the audio problems. i would stick to infra-red headphones (even though they are not as portable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"They work OK, but they are too big and unstable on your head","review":"They work just fine. But they are too big and unstable on your head. After a while they feel uncomfortable and you can't walk around with them on because they fit so loose they will fall off. Acoustic Research definitely got the electronics right, now if they would get a handle on the ergonomics this would be a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken","review":"I was very disappointed with this product. I previously purchased the same item for myself at a local retail store and have enjoyed it immensely. I then purchase the Acoustic Research AW771 900 MHz wireless headphones for a friend this Christmas.

Now it is a challenge to get them replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality product","review":"worked fine the first time, didn't use them for a week, never worked again. one of the provided rechargable batteries was corroded. i tried new ones (both fully charged, working rechargeables and alkaline) but the headphones were dead. you may get luckier, but do you really want to have to take the chance? I'm gonna try the sennheiser ones now - they seemed a little pricey at first, but maybe you have to spend a little more to get a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good, comfortable, but sadly unreliable","review":"These are very comfortable to wear for long periods, and sound good. Battery life is very poor, however, and need to be charged every day unlike other wireless headphone I've used that can last 3 to 4 days between charging. My biggest complaint is mechanically and electrically they are junk. A constant irritation is you can hardly turn the things off. Sometimes you have to press the off switch for more than a minute, and often it takes several attempts. I am gentle with them, but they physically broke after a few months - the swivel post that holds the ear pieces to the frame broke. I did a creative glue job and gave up the swivel feature, which bought me another couple of weeks. At that time they just died completely, and I never got an additional peep out of them. I paid a high price for these at another retailer, and am very annoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Purchase","review":"Purchased this item to replace a different branded item that is no longer available.

I found the headphones a little difficult to setup. Not technically difficult, but it seemed like a lot of unnesessary work (there are two volume levels, three if you include the reciever or PC you are plugged into). My pair eventually died and were unable to connect to the base. I also found that the headphones were not as comfortable as other ones I've owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Materials","review":"The materials and design of these headphones are poor.

I can get noisy signal while 10' from the transmitter. The antenna is much too directional. Over the last two weeks, the headphones got where they would not turn on, despite fully charged batteries. Problems also turning them off. I discovered if I happened to move the L headphone, the power and receiver went crazy, then off. Very poorly designed as far as the transmitter/receiver goes. As for the sound, I guess its OK. I received these as a gift this past Christmas, and contacted A/R about service. Nothing doing without a receipt, which I never had. I explained it was a gift, but nothing doing. I can say I'll not be purchasing any of their products in the future, and I'd advise staying away from this product.

Dr. Frager's understanding and contribution to sufism is valuable. His writing is easy to understand and practice [though page 173-174 is acceptable for those who are not yet Muslim; Muslim should refer to more valid intruction and guide].What he shared at times touches my heart. Sufism/tasawwuf, or the spiritual component of Islam is the beautiful aspect of Islam; the right path to God as long as practiced according or within the syariah, the physical component.Dr. Frager, being a clinical psychologist was able to show how sufism could be incoporated into healing. This aspect of healing should be within the capacity of all muslim doctors.This book is suitable for lay person as well as specialist in medical or psychological field.

So while it is not structured like a conventional history of this era, or a biography of the Kaiser, an abundance of historical and biographical information is presented.I enjoyed this book very much - it is very well-written and was a pleasure to read.

True, they were created in the 70's, but Scooby Doo was funny - this isn't. Of course it is in the same style of Scooby Doo which makes it even worse, especially for an Addams Family fan - which I am. Not that I have anything against Scooby Doo.

For example, Brahmins dont eat garlic for religious reasons, while other castes do. I'm staunchly against the caste system in India; I mention it now only to stress the authenticity of Padmanabhan's book.

I got to say, I don't love this book. I find that often the recipes do not come out right - sauces are too soupy, the food is often too oily, and that masala dosa has NO spice to it. I ended up adding WAY more to just make it have taste. All in all I suggest getting 'The Spice Coast of India' instead.

Don't forget to add lots of sex, money, and luxuries that only Harold Robbins can imagine vividly.

I think 50% of all words is about sex, adultry, teen sex or intercourse. COM' ON!The Betsy was a book about building cars. This books is about sex. Oh and some people are involved in the car industry.This is something you see more often with establised writers.

Here the balladeers of Monteagle Mountain in Tennessee, the wild fiddling from North Georgia, and the white blues of Alabama all came together, producing greats like The Allen Brothers, Bob Douglas, Eldia Barbee, and Blaine Smith. The younger musicians of the area were lucky to learn from many of these legends first hand, and the best of these are here to play for you in a new band called CITICO. Ain't no Berklee graduates here, nor none of them fuzzy-talking northerners who learned their licks outta those funny-smelling Mel Bay books. These gents know what do with a biscuit and a plate of sorghum. They also know how to sing a murder song without getting all teared up. And best of all, they know the right way to honor their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as stated","review":"this book arrived with a perfect cover but 5 pages inside terribly torn. i patched and sent them to a local charity for kids. obviously could not use this book in my basket of gifts for a youngster. this is the first book i have ever ordered that was not exactly as stated. maybe the seller should thumb through his books before stating the condition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull to read and Painful to look at","review":"The text is preachy and boring and would make any little kid squirm to be doing ANYTHING else except listen to this book. The illustrations make whiny, spoiled, self-pitying Sammy look like a defective Cabbage Patch doll and his stuffed Mr. Cat looks like road kill. If you want to PUNISH a child, make them read this book.

Lucky it was a gift and I didn't waste my hard earned money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"Laura Schlessinger's awkward text and Dan McFeely's ugly illustrations make a book neither kids nor adults will find appealing. Children won't relate to language no kid would ever use (\\"I hate my life!\\") or to the humorless, patronizing moral lesson. The best children's books are lovingly written by people who like and understand kids and want to entertain them. This object isn't really a book at all: it's another \\"Dr. Laura\\" promotional product. Reviewer \\"zeh\\" is right: you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Children","review":"This book is not for children. If anything, it would increase their feelings of isolation and nurture their insecurities about their place in the family. It's not surprising that Ms. Schlessinger would write something like this. In fact, it seems to mirror her own life as documented in Vicky Bane's very well done bio, \\"Dr. Laura: The Unauthorized Biography\\". In short, \\"Growing Up Is Hard\\" does a far better job of telling us about Shlessinger's tormented psyche than it does imparting moral values to children. If you're looking for a child's book, pass this one up and consider something that's really for children. I'd suggest \\"Click Clack Moo, Cows That Type\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed","review":"This is a nice-looking costume that I thought would be like other inflatable costumes I've seen on friends -- their costumes have been used over several years. My son put it on and within minutes we found the connection between the fan and the batteries didn't work properly. The costume would only partially inflate.

I am glad that I did for there is nothing terrible revealed in this book. It let me see the vulnerabity and that she was human. She wasn't a Saint but she did have a kind heart. I am glad that I got it and reccommend it highly to anyone who admired the late Princess."},{"rating":"1","title":"RELUCTANT REVELATION","review":"This book fell short of affirming that Ken Wharfe was a real Diana insider. Its \\"secret\\" details are very scanty: contrary to the expectations its title aroused. Mr Wharfe refrained from revealing any \\"close secret\\" that is hitherto unknown.If you cherish reading anything about Lady Di, you may enjoy this one. But, if you are interested in some new revelations, I doubt if this book will quench your appetite.As is customary with our nature, Ken displayed a deep sympathy for the dead. He did his best in down-playing any of those embarrassing moments in Diana's life. Still, I would have liked to know the reason why the late Princess, who called attention to charity during her lifetime failed to include charitable donations in her will. Instead, she left her entire wealth for her sons, who are not only royal, but are already multi-millionaires.My inference is that the \\"secrets\\" in this book are so closely guarded that no reader will be able to come across them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Few Secrets Divulged","review":"From the reviews this book has garnered so far, I was expecting much more. Ken Wharfe is one of many, many people coming out of the woodwork to tell of their time with Princess Diana. Any person you seen in the background of a photo of Diana has a story to tell. The thing is, Wharfe doesn't want to tell too much, so there's not much new here. There's a lot of self aggrandizement -- how Wharfe saved the day, this time and that time, how the \\"most beautiful photos ever\\" (in his opinion) were the result of his taking a island holiday situation in hand. And of course, how if HE had been still providing protection, she would not have died. The thing is, let's face it, Diana did not protect herself. SHE did not wear her seatbelt, SHE put her well-being in Dodi's unctuous hands and she herself, as Wharfe notes, was one to drive at speeds of up to 100 MPH.I think there's much more Wharfe has to say, and why not? We're all dying to know more about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone finally comes out with the truth.","review":"I loved this book. It was written with alot of love. He did it to clear her name not to make a fortune like alot of other books. I loved the incidents he talked about and the candid way he related himself to Diana. You could read between the lines and feel the love he had for her and she must have had a lot of trust in him."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's disappointing...","review":"Contrary to the title, this book certainly doesn't reveal any extraordinary secrets. Furthermore, the author seems quite taken with his own self-importance. What is surprising is that there isn't a single reference to Paul Burrell, Diana's butler so recently in the headlines and whom she apparently called her \\"rock.\\" So many people have written \\"inside\\" stories about Diana and one has to wonder who really were her confidants and who have simply been capitalizing on the employer/employee relationship. Mr. Wharfe, despite his altruistic assertions as to his reasons for writing, has obviously hoped to profit from time spent in her service."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION: Difficult Fitting Pull-On Boot","review":"These beautiful boots arrived today -- and I tried... and tried... and tried... to get my foot into it. The ankle area is VERY narrow, and the angle at which one would have to try to get past that narrow area into the actual \\"foot\\" of the boot is impossible.

I've never ever played such a repetitive game in all of my life (unless you count Ms Pac-man after level twentysomething). I can see how it would appeal to the young gamers who're probably playing their third or forth game ever, but this game is a complete joke to anyone who has played any other game where you fly around in the air and shoot stuff.

The Violin Concerto is especially wonderful - convincing, concise, rhythmically exciting, melodically and harmonically arresting and orchestrationally vivid. This is a modern violin concerto that can hold its own right up there with Barber, Shostakovich and Stravinsky.The other concertos likewise also combine music of great concision, drive and drama with moments of great serenity, beautifully drawn-out melodies and delicate construction. The result is music that grabs the ear of the listener the first time around and every susequent time."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Joan Tower","review":"I just discovered Joan Tower listening to Sirius Radio.

The second one features Alagna and Gheorghiu which is also very good. In my opinion this 1984 recording is the better one between the two. This Romeo & Juliette featured Alfredo Kraus whose stylish reading is hard to beat and his high notes were still very secure.Catherine Malfitano's Juliette was young and fresh, is much more preferable to Gheorghiu's too mature sound Juliette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic First-Rate Illustrated History --A Must Have","review":"This is a classic, breezy and engaging first-rate history that ranks as a \\"must-have\\" for cable car enthusiasts, but should absolutely not be overlooked by anyone exploring the history of San Francisco and it's unique character.This is a handsome, oversize book rich with historic photos and illustrations, including endpapers with detailed colored drawings of various models of cable cars that were assigned to specific routes of the city.The accompanying text is serious history written in an engaging style that weaves the technical details of cable car history with the unique charm of San Francisco, its sometimes eccentric and often visionary citizenry, and the neighborhoods and businesses the cable cars served.Undoubtedly more could be written about cable cars, but it's unlikely that any book could more delightfully capture the wonderful atmosphere of San Francisco's cable car world when it was at its bell-clanging, rail-chattering peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"This is a terrific CD.

Some of the photos are the only known color record of their subjects. The story is largely told with extended captions based on extensive record-keeping by Pfeifer, a Union Pacific railroader for four decades.Subjects include rare color photos of Soo Line steam and early Union Pacific turbine locomotives, as well as the last years of big mainline steam power in Nebraska, Wyoming and Utah.The large-format book is beautifully designed by the late Mike Pearsall, with plenty of room given to the photos.The book was published in a small edition in 1990."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keen Northwest","review":"Excellent condition!!

It should be required reading for ALL Christians. Before this book, I knew that prayer was important, but I didn't really know why, and how important. It's semi-intensive, but it's easy to read and keeps my attention. I love the stories he tells.The power to affect others through our prayers is already available to us. We just have to believe in it. And if you know the story behind prayer, why it is required, you will believe that your prayers are powerful. God's power, released through prayer, changes lives and eternal destinies.After reading this book, you'll know exactly how to pray for healing and the unsaved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!

Do yourself a favor, buy the rest of his books because once you read this one you will be hungry for more. I did and it was WORTH it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intercessory Prayer","review":"This book and accompanied DVD's are excellent resources for anyone in need to know more about intercessory prayer. Pastor Dutch Sheets teaches with the authority of one having many years of first hand experience and thorough Scriptural knowledge about the subject, yet with the humbleness of one knowing he is just as much in the growing process as any other Christian. In my opinion, a much needed - and most important - book for ANY Christian serious about living a victorious life as God ordained it and helping others to get freed from burdens and oppression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Add New Power to Your Prayer Life","review":"Simply put, intercessory prayer is the act of praying on behalf of others. I was looking for a good book on this subject and came across this one. I have to say, its just solid biblical teaching about the many aspects of prayer, and I think it will answer many of the questions people have about prayer. You can certainly tell the author has a degree in theology.I found it to be humorous many times (which helps me keep my attention), and it definitely reaches its goal of igniting and empowering the prayer lives of those who read it. Prayers really do work, but you have to pray. And if you're like me, you don't pray enough - but if you want to add new power to your prayer life, well, this is just a great \\"guide\\" to get you on the right track!

I am not sure what age of the intended audience for this book was but the sentences were on the advanced level of an easy reader. I expect more from a Magic School Bus book.Magic School Bus books go into a very appropriate depth for a child. This book did not. It also painted a rosy picture of life in Ancient Egypt. I realize a kids book shouldn't be depressing but it shouldn't make it seem like the Ancient Egyptians had an easy life. The flooding of the Nile each year wasn't even mentioned. This flooding cycle had a great affect on the daily life of the Ancient Egyptians.All in all, if you would like a book on Ancient Egypt that shows your child a realistic portrayal of Ancient Egyptian life, this is NOT the book for you.

Ivan Anguelov brings out the structural integrity of even the early symphonies, which too often are dismissed as jerry-built, and conducts with a fervent intensity that is undeniably galvanizing. However, those who like a little sugar in their coffee, so to speak, may not find Anguelov's \\"modern\\" approach to phrasing and accents congenial--Dvorak here is not quite as lovable and relaxed as usual. A passage such as the opening bars of the Fifth Symphony sounds less evocative of a sunlit early morning than it does in, say, the Kertesz performance. Listeners who prefer a more traditional, Romantic style may want to look elsewhere, but for a fresh approach, Anguelov is a strong contender."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first one is much better","review":"Die Hard Trilogy (the original) is much better than this game.

I liked it then, and I like it now. For me, \\"Blindman\\" is the stand-out 'track'. That song was re-released as a Whitesnake song on \\"Ready and Willing\\", but it was tweaked a little and is subtly different from the original. The album is a mixture of upbeat rock songs (eg White Snake and Celebration) and DC being mellow (eg Blindman and Hole in the Sky). Each one is good honest performance.The only downside for me on this album is that Mickey Moody played guitar - I'm not a fan of MM's tinny 'tone' (I trust that guitar aficionados will forgive a layperson's attempt at describing the sound). He's not a Blackmore, Page or an Aldrich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best guide in WORLD!!!!!","review":"I really like this book.

The music in this album delivers beautiful renditions of the holiday favorites such as \\"Angels we Have Heard on High\\" and the \\"First Nowell.\\" The songs that really stand out are the tuneful Paulus compositions and arrangements: Hallelu, A Saviour from on High (my favorite), and Snow has fallen; Christ was Born. The Choir sounds like one big heavenly voice in all the songs. The Harp accompaniments add another voice that gives this album its trademark. The harmonies are exquisite as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry, technical, and academic look at queer subculture","review":"A dry, technical, and academic look at queer subculture in London between 1918 and 1957. Interesting in that it reduces to a science the rather inexpressible notions and progressions of gay life. There is certainly a parallel to be found between the passive->excluded->marginalized->subculture->pride progression of gays and other social movements. Houlbrook tries to weave in personal stories that humanize the concepts presented, and while he does a good job in those parts, the people reading such a book are in no need of convincing; the parts serve only to make the technical bits endurable. A great book, I'm sure, for academics, but not for pleasure reading.Continued at: [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"comparative subjects","review":"the book is written in the vain of comparative religion and philosophy as perceived in the mid 1800's and was intended to enlighten members of the scottish rite freemasonry as to what the degrees they went through should bring to mind..each chapter was to represent a degree..each degree was about a year of time of learning and study on the members part..many members never made it to the highest ranks but only to the 14th..it is definitely a hard read but well worth the time, effort and money involved in the pursuit of knowledge, both current and archaic..remember that latin and hebrew were subject that were taught in the 1800's in the schools and is used throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Scottish Rite explained, but very difficult reading","review":"Albert Pike was the first person to write a comprehensive review explaining the meaning of the various degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. He writes in a style that is esoteric and philosophic; this is not light reading. Each of the 29 degrees in the Scottish Rite are explained, interjeted with Pike's personal views of how they relate to modern (at the time) Masonry. Originally written in the 1800's, this book has survived to become a standard reference for all Scottish Rite Masons.There are other books that explain the Scottish Rite and are much easier to read, especially for a new Scottish Rite Mason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masonic Occult Hype...","review":"In reading the above reviews I am still amazed that people place so much importance on this all but worthless fraternity. If there is one thing you can learn from reading this book you should understand that Masonry in Pike's time is nothing compared to the pathetic social clubs that exist today under the title 'Mason'. Most masons I see today are either a bunch of old overweight, white trash men or arrogant young blacks both of which are literaly without a clue. Whether or not you see Masonry as occult or satanic or whatever one thing is for certain...it is not some powerful cabal in control of the world by any stretch of the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless,,,,,,","review":"Prententious, mind-numbing narrative.

Nextel service has become the biggest joke on the planet. And the products have got to pot as well. I had the insurance so I was (after much aruging, kicking and screaming) able to get a (new) replacement. Now, only a couple of months later, the SAME EXACT thing is happening again. My sister is experiencing weirdness where the display takes forever to get the foreground banner. I suspect its a circuit issue. If it wouldn't cost $200, Nextel would be eating my dust!

The last stand was huge and easy to trip over. This one is compact with the total circular design. We have a 7 foot tree with a trunk base of about 4-5 inches circumference. It steadied quite quickly and literally within 5 minutes it was centered, which if you saw the tree (It's a big bubba chunk-we call him Jaimison-or fat albert because one side is bulbous and extends way out frm the trunk unevenly, yet this tree is standing straight up and doesn't tip or want to fall over. Our tree was supposed to be a simple Noble Fir, but it's actually a Grand Noble Fir it's extremely full and fluffy. To add to the best thing about this stand, it has a spillover lip at the bottom that catches overfilling and misses with water jug. It's awesome! There are flat nuts on the end of the 3 screws that hold the tree without digging into the tree so it actually hold it in a centered matter, ingenious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little stand","review":"Worked like a charm. The spikes on the bottom add a lot of stability, and the depth of the water well was perfect for our several days out of town during the holiday. My only concern resembling a complaint would be that the height of the stand makes placing the tree skirt a little tricky - that's more of a tradeoff for the extra capacity for water, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Decided to go with this stand over the larger one as we usually get 7 foot trees. It was easy to set up and straighten the tree. We were a little worried since the stability relies on making sure the tree goes into the spikes at the bottom of the stand, but that ended up not being an issue. I like that the screws are above the water line so they won't rust. The only downside is that the water basin is small and we had to refill it 3x a day for the first few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand","review":"Putting up our 7 foot tree was easy. Stuck the tree in the spikes and had one person tighten the bolts while another held the tree up right. Took a few minutes to center it, but other than that it was a piece of cake. It holds a lot of water too. Our tree stood perfectly straight for over 3 weeks without needing re-adjustment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Very solid, easy to load tree in place.

It keeps our 7ft tree standing vertical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for trees under 5 feet","review":"Two major draw backs to the this unit: First, I ordered it last year, and shipping was so slow I didn't get it in time to use it last year. I see another reviewer had the same problem. Mine took over 2 weeks to get. Second, it says small tree, but does not actually work on small trees. We have a small house and always buy tress that are about 4 ft tall with a trunk diameter about 2.5 to 3 inches, and the old style stand never held it very well. So with two kids in the house now, I decided it was time for something more stable, but this doesn't cut it. Even pressed down on the nails in the bottom and with the adjustment screws as tight as they'll go, the tree still twists. The screws just aren't stable when pushed out that far. I was really hopefully, but this stand ain't for small trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why wait so Long","review":"Still haven't received it...

Robert Hardy as Churchill delivers an excellent performance. The dialogue, acting, and general ambience of this series are excellent. The sound quality on this DVD is questionable, specially Episode 1. Much of the dialogue seems muffled. Understanding Baldwin's mumble is quite a chore. However, after one adjusts to these shortcomings you are sure to get hooked.One caveat. You will have to turn up the volume to compensate for the accents.One can say with regards to Churchill that the \\"man and the hour had met\\". Churchill certainly was a major figure in saving Western civilization. Going through this series I could not but help noticing how privileged a life he led. The family estate, Checkers, was beautiful with servants galore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor dvd image","review":"I was looking forward to viewing this series. I was shocked to see the poor quality of this DVD.It looked like an old fashion video that had been played 1000 times. It was very blurry.Wow! I can't believe they would offer this kind of picture quality on a DVD. In this day of HD imaging this was a real let down. I was also disappointed that this DVD had no english subtitles.Sometimes you don't want the volume up so loud and it would have helped to have subtitles.The picture quality is so bad I could not continue to watch it after the first half hour of viewing. The acting is superb but the picture image quality is certainly not what I would have expected from a DVD. This was a rip off.

Having read several books about him and having been enamored by his famous one-liners, both inside and outside of parliament, I wanted to get a \\"feel\\" for the person. Let me tell you that this DVD did precisely that. The fact that the focus is on the decade of 1929-1939 when Churchill was believed to be politically inconsequential makes this very interesting becaue it builds up the case for the \\"delicious\\" outcome that history has already shown us. It is not easy to portray a leader such as Churchill whose persona is well-established/remembered even many years after his death. While it is possible to copy trademarks such as the rotund body shape and cigar, it is far more difficult to build the personality, charisma and forcefulness that he had within a character role. This has been done brilliantly by Robert Hardy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like brand name trash bags- so was pleased to find Glad...","review":"I've had messy bad luck with cheap trash bags, and while I wish these had handles and not flaps, I'll live.

There are several riffs that are very impressive and entertaining. But when it comes to trying to provide the listener with instructions, he falls quite a bit short.I found that he tends to speak in generalities and makes some assumptions that, had he clarified, would have added volumes to the listener's understanding. I listened to the CD several times and never could find an instance where he actually indicates where he is about to start on the harmonica (4th hole draw, 6th hole blow, etc. . .) It is this lack of clarification that I found very distracting, and often downright frustrating.The turnaround riffs starting around track 45 are excellent.

The black and white cinematography reminded me of Pennebaker and I discovered later that the cameraman, Jim Desmond, had been his protegee. There is an energy to this film that carries it along and I was not bored for a moment. It has a very '60s feel and the technique of the film reflects Dali's surreal creativity.

Episodes came to rely less on plot, allowing viewers opportunity for introspection, a strength of the series that became one of its hallmarks. Although bonus features are not as abundant as on the season one package, the three included here (profiles of Miles and Susannah, and a feature \\"W.G.

When I saw this item on sale at Toys R Us, I knew I had to get it for the holiday. We didn't open it until Christmas, and I really regret it. When the doll turns on, she repeatedly asks \\"Whats your favorite song?\\" (as if she could hear you reply). When you'd use the scanner on the cues on the Memory Book, it would not be recognized. (She'd still ask what your favorite song is). Like a reviewer below, if by chance it would scan, it would only play a tiny portion of what it's supposed to say, or it would play something from a completely different page.I wouldn't reccommend this toy. I was annoyed after discovering the toy malfunction, but my daughter could have cared less.

Also for those looking to extend the reach of their USB devices - USB standards are very specific as to how long a cable can be from device to hub. According to USB.org, the maximum length of a full-speed device cord is 5m (full power devices have a cord that can detach at both ends) and for low-speed is 3m (low-power devices are permenantly attached at one end - like a mouse).

She is intelligent and is a capable writer. To that end, her book explores significant moral questions and offers sound leadership guidelines. However, \\"Center of the Storm\\" is bannered as the definitive account of the controversial November 7, 2000 presidential election in the state of Florida.On that note, this book is a journalistic dud. She fails to answer crucial questions. Moreover, some appraisals of her work are self-serving. In conclusion, the controversy swirling around the performance of the Florida Secretary of State during a sensational period in American history will not subside with the publication of this book.

For the most part, the book sounded like an overdone research paper, in which the author stated a thesis, and spent the rest of the book attempting to validate this thesis. If I were grading this paper, I would definitely subtract points for the repetetive set of ideas that kept resurfacing under different headings. These ideas were well recieved the first time around, but I would expect a fan of Glenn Gould to come up with a more creative way of proving that Mr. Gould's ideas were consistent and meaningful.

Louise Rennison puts us in the shoes of an ordinary, teenage girl's life..except her life isn't so ordinary..She goes through many embarresing problems that other girls could relate to. This entry into Georgia Nicolson's diary is as loopy and as hilarious as ever. The whole point of the story? Gerogia has the Sex God as her boyfriend, but still is confused about her feelings for Dave-The-Laugh. Some other distractions? A class trip to Paris, and being made captain of the hockey team, are just some of the hilarious things that are included in this book.

Sure, some points are funny, but the whole scenarios are exactly the same as they were in the other three books. Georgia obsesses over Robbie. Georgia antagonizes over her lingering feelings for Dave the Laugh. Yawn, yawn, yawn. Jas seems like a total Girl Scout (no offense to Girl Scouts or anything), and the rest of Georgia's friends are just lame. Like, please. Who actually does a disco dance and finds it FUNNY?!?!I have been looking forward to this one forever, but it's lost the charm. Ah, well, perhaps I've outgrown Georgia Nicolson and Mia Thermopolis...so sad.

Why these books insist on including \\"greek\\" Greek is beyond me. Apparently, most sign, menus, etc. in Greece include the phonetic (Roman/Western) spelling of the words. So, unless your prepared to learn another alphabet, this all but useless.But then after one page, the book leaves out the phonetic spelling until the very end. So one is left turning the book this way and that trying to figure out what the word is.And owning the tape does not help matters, since it is often hard to hear exactly what sounds are being made.I gave it one star and I am being charitable...there was no choice for zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is greek to me","review":"Getting by in Greek: Is very poorly written.

As with Barry Scheck's book, \\"Actual Innocence\\", one of the most disturbing conclusions is that there are many more falsely-convicted individuals who never will be cleared because their alleged crimes did not leave DNA evidence behind.The pictures in this book put a human face to the exonerated. The simple, direct accompanying text and quotes from the former prisoners tell the story over and over.

This is a straight raw hip hop album, raw solid beats, strong lyrics. Definatly a buy. Its as good as Aziatic or Doe or Die. Az has to be the most consistent rapper in the game, always coming strong.

AZ, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated, slept on mc's of all time, and I mean that in an extremely good way. His lyrical ability, his flow, and his overall style make him a great mc. He raps with confidence, and he raps about his life, anything that you hear on the radio, you won't hear from AZ. My favorite tracks on this good release are \\"New York\\" feat. Raekwon and Ghostface, \\"AZ's Chillin\\" \\"Street Life\\" feat. Half-A-Mill(R.I.P) and Begetz, and two of the bonus tracks, \\"Magic Hour\\" feat. CL Smooth, and \\"The Truth\\".

This is one of the last rappers that actually can carry the beat with his lyrics rather than the other way around. You could get a 3 your old to beat on a desk with a plastic hammer and he could still make a hit out of it. This can go down in history along with illmatic, the chronics, ready to die, and other hip-hop clasics. The choice in producion is superb. The only downside to this album (note: I don't think AZ had too much control over this) was the lack of influence from Premier. Every true lyricist has a producer that compliments his flow and facilitates the rappers delivery; AZ has two, Premier and Alchemist. Premier only does one track on the album......HERES A THOUGHT....THIS CAN TRULY BE ONE OFTHE BEST ALBUMS IN HIP HOP HISTORY. NAS, AZ, ALCHEMIST, DJ PREMIER, ONE ALBUM.....MAKE THAT HAPPEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"AZ is back finally.","review":"With AZ back, Nas and Ruggedman will actually have some lyrical competition. AZ has always been hot, since 9 lives til now. But this CD solidifies his career. This one is as good, if not better then 9 lives. This CD is great because if youve heard az before and were waiting for this album, he lived up to your hype, but also, if you havent heard him before he gives you a taste of real rap. Buy this album, its worth it. If you havent heard him, definitely give him a try, hes the reeal deal. The standout track list IS the track list on the back of the CD so no need for that here. GET THIS CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"AZ's Chillin but not on this album","review":"Many will agree when I say that Az delivers like few others can. The one thing that I'm most impressed with is the fact he is finally out of Nas shadow. I feel that on this album he finally separated hisself from Nas and just did his own thang. Not sayin I don't like Nas because he is my favorite rapper without a doubt and has been 4 a while. All hip-hop heads know when Nas first came up Az always seem like his sidekick. Now I feel like he is his own person. The album is great.

Tate and the ECO play it well, but it could us a bit more zip. It is a significantly lesser work c.f. the other two symphonies here. I prefer the #32 performances of Bohm and Krips, both with the RCOAon Philips, and Bohm with the BPO on DG. The Haffner here benefits from apt ceremonial pomp and prominent windsand trumpet. Textures are perfect, and Tate again proves himself a winds maven in the tradition of Klemperer and then William Steinberg (whose Haffner is ideally performed in mediocre sound -see my review.)#39 is tailor made for Tate, especially in the wind laden second movement and third movement trio. No tempi problemsare evident, and the second movement is one of the best ever.Additional peers: #35- Szell/Sony; Steinberg/Pittsburgh; Kubelik/BRSO/Sony; Dohnanyi/Cleveland/Decca#39- Jochum/BRSO/DG; Kubelik/Sony; Szell/Sony; Dohnanyi/Decca; Klemperer/PO/Decca; Sawallisch/CPO/Eurodisc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I was able to use this product about 3 times.

If you are tired of Perl or any other language or simply want to learn a new an exciting language, then this book is for you.

As a reference and indepth study, it is less useful, but this is more due to the young age of the Ruby language and libraries, than a failure of the book.Both the language and the book make for excellent brainfeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"Well I have been up all night long reading 'Programming Ruby' cover to cover. I've been thinking about getting into Ruby programming for a while now, but lack of documentation and lack of time has always stopped me. However, after reading this book I am thoroughly hooked on Ruby.Not only does the book have an excellent tutorial which goes over major Ruby concepts and the majority of the language you will encounter on a daily basis, but it also has an indispensable language and standard library reference, as well as an overview of the C API and details on the inner workings of the Ruby interpreter.This book is definitely worth picking up if you want to start dabbling in Ruby, and is almost a requirement to have on your desk during heavy hacking sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good experience.","review":"I was very happy with this order.

I thought the picture quality was excellent, but the menu and options were cumbersome to get to. Also, the charger was huge and very irritating to use. I bought this camera specifically for a vacation and it stopped working during the actual vacation. Needless to say, I was really upset. On a positive note, amazon refunded all my money and even paid for the return shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera Okay, Software Horrible","review":"There's a slight delay between pressing the shutter release and actually having it fire. Indoor pictures always seem overexposed. The $7 disposable film cameras in the grocery store take better pictures.What's infuriating about this camera is the Olympus Master software that comes with it. It has context sensitive menus, so the icon you're looking for is often nowhere to be found. There's no File->Open or File->Save options, so you're forced to do things their way. In my opinion, both approaches to user interface design should be criminal. To be fair, you can figure out basic functions by reading the manual, but have no illusions that you'll be working for this camera more than this camera will be working for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dud","review":"I have tried to like this camera, but I haven't been successful.For years, I have been a big fan of Olympus. This is my fourth Olympus digital camera. I started with a 520 (I think), and proceeded to a C-50 (the mechanics were a bit hinky). Then I purchased a Stylus 800. It is a fabulous camera. Finally, without hesitation, I purchased the Stylus 1000. Huge mistake.This camera is slow, unreliable and not fun to use. It seems to have gone downhill in features, speed and range of use from the 800. You can't even make manual adjustments. The macro is terrible. I can't believe they put this camera on the market.I will say that, under standard, optimal conditions, the photos are very nice but I don't have much interest in that as my only option.Now, I have to figure out how to get rid of it. I'll lose money I can't afford. This is the end of my romance with Olympus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grainy","review":"I am very disappointed with this camera.

That means that if you take it on a trip with you, you better take the charger also because the battery won't last more than a half day of regular shooting. And, you can't charge the battery through the USB port. When you take a picture by pushing the shutter button, you better hope no one moves for a while. It takes quite some time for the camera to decide to take a picture. And, the pictures tend to be blurry. If you want better ones, always use the flash -- at least you can know for sure whether the camera decided to take the picture or not. The red eye reducer flashes about 20 times before finally taking the picture.

I teach water aerobics 10 hours a week and the chlorine would degrade other suits within weeks. I've had my Endurance suit for over 6 months and its still going strong.The Flyback style in the Endurance fabric runs small, especially through the bust. The front panel is quite narrow, and they are cut high at the hip. With no Lycra \\"give\\", this makes the suit feel about a size smaller than tagged if you have a curvier figure. If you are very athletically built, with a small bust, it may feel more true to size.The Endurance styles with the wider straps fit more true to size in my experience, than the Flyback suits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you for real?","review":"Who are the MORONS that put this DVD set for sale??

I remember it was one of the first FPS games where you could knife people.This game however is a joke. Must of been made by a different company because the graphics, gameplay, storyline....everything is far worse than the original. Comparing it to FPS games like \\"Unreal\\" during that time period, this game looks like it was made in the early 80's because it has ancient graphics and is as glitchy as \\"E.T.\\" for the Atari 2600.I probably put about 30hrs into it only because I was a goofy teen who wanted to get his $5 worth, but looking back I was a fool to have played the game for more than 20 minutes.

Possibly the only book that covers this subject with such thoroughness. It is scientific and at the same time spiritually inspiring. I have no idea why some of the reviewers are claiming the author has an ego. I certainly did not get that impression. This book is priceless to those interested in spiritual growth like myself. It fits right in with my factual books on the raw food diet as well as my books on the chakras, etheric body and astral projection...and it merges nutritional facts with our true spirtual nature and how we may awaken it even further with a raw vegan \\"life-force\\" diet in one very comprehensive book.I am already 80% raw vegan and I am thrilled to take this journey a step further.

Additionally, in an effort to be modest or 'i-less', I suppose, the author refers to himself in the second or third person exclusively, which is annoying by the end of the first chapter.This is a good book, with some gems of infomration, but it is opaque and you have to hunt for them.

The author of this volume, Tremper Longman III, is a professor at Westmont College in California and was previously on the faculty of Westminster Seminary.The commentary is arranged by chapters and contains sections on the original meaning of the text, the context in relation to the whole Bible, and contemporary significance of the text. His writing is easy to comprehend and pleasant to read. The book would work equally well as reference or as a group Bible study.Longman is solidly reformed. He resists the temptation to use the prophesy in Daniel to set specific dates for the end-times. In fact, he has publicly debated Harold Camping on just this issue. Although not directly addressed, his traditional approach effectively answers the error promoted by dispensationalists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"Very happy with this cd as usual Hal Ketcham delivers great music.

I put a bottle of riesling in and it set it to chill to 46 degrees.

After reading the negative reviews I still decided to try for myself. I took an empty wine bottle and filled it with water. I turned on the machine and set it to a low setting of 54 degrees. The temperature gage in the unit said it was currently at 80 degrees. Then I placed two different thermomiter probes in the water. Both read 68 degrees. When the unit reached 54 degrees the probles read 66 degrees. I did notice that the bottom of the bottle was very cold though and thus I poured a few glasses and tested each glass. The water that was in the bottom of the bottle was noticeable colder but still only around 64 degrees. So basically, not only does the top part of the bottle not chill, but the temperature gage is totally off on all parts. It must just register the temperature of the outside of the part of the bottle that is immersed, which is totally usless.Too bad there is not a way to give zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work as advertised","review":"Got one as a Christmas present - great concept, but the performance falls well short of the promise.As another reviewer noted, wine from my wine fridge (56 deg.) registered as 74 deg. when placed into the unit; wine at room temp (72 deg.) regularly registered 78 deg. or so. Although the unit ran through it's cycle and indicated wine had been chilled to the proper temperature it never was. In fact, if you put the bottle back into the unit immediately and started it again it would register a temperature about 10 degrees warmer than it had indicated just seconds earlier.I tried about half-a-dozen times over a couple days, but it never worked properly.We returned the unit to the store for credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit is junk","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas.

It chronicles the life on Mick Foley, from his high school days in East Setuaket, New York, to becoming one of the top stars in the wrestling business, and all the adventures in between.

The poetic and passionate nature of his memoirs is inspirational and wonderful.

It has to do with the cost of the book, and it changes with whatever version you are reading. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foley is my hero --","review":"-- no lie. This book is an inspiration. From everything I've read, Foley is one of the most genuine and kindest people walking this earth. But he was a terror in the wrestling ring, mostly to himself. The injuries discribed in this book are gruesome, but Foley persisted despite having most of his body broken or burned or cut off. When he was finally retired from wrestling, I bawled like a baby, and so did all of the other guys sitting around watching the pay-per-view. Detractors of professional wrestling fail to see the human drama and emotion conveyed by performers, and no one wrestled with more heart and emotion than Mick Foley. This book captures the many sides of Foley, and is whole-heartedly recommended to wrestling and non-wrestling fans alike, so that all can understand the motivation behind the man and the business he loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAVE A nICE dAY.bY MANKIND","review":"The book \\"HAVE A NICE DAY\\", which is written by mankind, is an autobiography on his life.

My friend Roque Stiltner commented on the book by putting a review on the internet that stated quotes like \\"It was great!\\"And \\"It was the best book I've ever read. Even my other friend and wrestling fan Rashunda Barzey said \\"It was the best!\\". Although some people do not like it because it has some violence, it is truly the best.

I'm impressed by both the sheer size of how many people reviewed the book and also by the average score of five stars! I just wanted to add myself to the list of over three hundred satisfied customers. Mick Foley truly is God. This book is absolutely amazing. I physically cringed whenever he described, with intimate detail, the pain he's been through. It's absolutely sickening in a strangely pleasant sort of way. Mick's truly paid his dues and this book proves it. Not only has he suffered over eight concussions, but he still retains the memories of his life to the point where he can churn out a book of outstanding magnitude. I honestly thought I was a fast reader, but I spent over a week reading and savoring this book. It is well-worth the cover price. In fact, it's worth twice the cover price. If you want a book that will make you laugh, cry, cringe, and cheer, then buy this book. It is worth every penny. Mick Foley is beyond God. He's the Hardcore Legend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood, Sweat, and a Helluva Great Book!","review":"Mankind's book is a blessing to all us devoted wrestling fans out there!

The realy best part in his book was when Mick Foley was the king of death matches in 1995. The thing the I did not like about the book was Mick Foley used BANG BANG in most of the book.

I'm proud to say that this book is written completely by me.'Okay, maybe that wasn't the exact quote. But the point is, he was right. For example, \\"The Rock Says\\" by The Rock... an autobiography, yes, but it has a ghostwriter! And, \\"The Rock Says\\" only has about 200 pages in it. Have a Nice Day has over 500!I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that this book is probably going to be one of the most true autobiographies you're going to find.

He talks about his injuries, friends other compinies, and everything he sees outside of the ring and inside. He talks about trips to stadiums, his family, his school days everything you wanted to know. A couple of chapters in your hooked. It takes you a while to soak up everything. It took me 6 months to read it. And what amazes me the most is he wrote all 748 by hand with a pen and paper. It is an interesting book and even if your not a fan of wrestling, it is still a good book to read if you want a nice story and some laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I must admit, I haven't been a big wrestling fan since I was a kid and Hulk Hogan was rumbling around the ring with the Junk Yard Dogg. Now that I am a college student and avid reader, I've perused through everything from Steinbeck to Kant to Clancy, and this book is by far one of the most pleasurable and life inspiring pieces of literature I've ever read.

Mick Foley truly is a unique human being. Not for the intense pain he has withstood over his career, but for the way he has stayed so grounded and humble throughout his life. I've met the man twice, and both occasions were greeted with a handshake, a quick and friendly chat, and me telling him how much I enjoyed his book.Also, if you enjoyed this title, be sure to check out \\"Foley is Good\\" as well as \\"Tietam Brown\\".

It kept me going NON-STOP. It would also have appeal to non-wrestling fans. It provides intresting facts about wrestlers live that you can't get from RAW or SMACKDOWN. If you are, or have a wrestling fan in the family get it. If you aren't a fan try it out anyway. It is a swift but challenging read.

I just didn't know how articulate he actually is. I received the book on a Friday, and finished it the next day.I loved it and you will too. This book not only will take you through his incredible rise to the top, but it will let you in on a secret about wrestlers... They are real people with real problems, real emotions, real fears, and real insecurities. If anyone has a dream, if anyone is in need of a role model, Mick would be a great choice. Not because he is a \\"star\\" but because he sacrificed his well being for something he believed in. He followed his dream, and is living a life worth living. Sure he could have missed the pain, but then he would have missed the dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mick Foley's dream comes true with this book","review":"I didnt really know what expect from this book the first time i bought it,i was just so exited to have it,Mick Foley was always my favorite wrestler,and I walways looked up to him,but after i read this book,it changed the way i looked at him forever,he was no longer Mankind,or Dude Love,or Cactus Jack,he was Mickey Foley from Long Island New York,a loving father,and a great man,nothing like his character.I recomend this book for non-wrestling fans so they can finally answer the question,\\"Is wrestling real?\\" and i recomend it to wrestling fans,Foley fans or not,just sit back and enjoy the story of the man we know called Mankind,the wrestler who gives his life everyday just so we have something to watch on TV,enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and the best","review":"The WWF decided to publish wrestler autobiographies back in the late 1990s, and Mick Foley was the first to have his published. It not only dominated the wrestling fan's eyes, but the mainstream as well and was received so well by everyone it went to the top of the New York Times bestseller lists for non-fiction. And he wrote it all himself.Not only is it a classic telling of some truly amazing personal stories, but its organized so well it flows flawlessly. The book is written superbly, and its impossible to forget that it was written by a man who's undergone serious punishment to his entire body, what with his vivid descriptions of the events within the pages.Bottom line, this book is a must read.

Well.","review":"First, I have to admit, I am a bit biased. I a)Love wrestling and b)Think Mick Foley is one of the most entertaining people alive, so pretty obviously, I loved this book. First, to be perfectly honest, if you despise wrestling, odds are this wont be your cup of tea, but personally, I found that the best parts of this book are when he isnt wrestling, such has his childhood and his family. The only flaws I can find in this book, are the Al Snow jokes (If you dont know, Al Snow is a friend of Mick, and a fellow wrestler) and the ending...simply put, I wanted him to go on even further, and that, Im sure, Is a sign of a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A great book that is very readable and entertaining. If kids need a role model Mick Foley is the man. Mick shows himself to be a truely decent human being, a man of integrity, kindness, and a loving dad and husband. A great look into the world of pro wrestling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"This book isn't just about wrestling, its about Mick's life in his very own words. Indeed, he has much to say, but he does it in such a way that its not only real, admirable and interesting, but very humourous as well.I've got to say that Mick did a very good job of writing the book his way in his own words. I was hooked on his simple, yet absorbing tale of blood and sweat. Compared with the Rock's book, I've got to say that this one has definitely more depth and variety to it as Mick has been in the business longer and have paid more dues than most wrestlers nowadays.My recommendation is that if you're an avid fan of wrestling or Mick, then you just got to have this book. Mick surprisingly expresses very good taste in bringing humour to his story, and there's no doubt you'll have a good laugh reading as you go through his book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for fans and non fans alike","review":"Even if you are not a fan, this book gives a great in depth view of one of the greatest legends to ever enter the wrestling ring. Starting with his childhood, this book explores how Mic Foley entered the world of wrestling and it gives his thoughts and feelings on some of his defining moments, such as his \\"Hell is a Cell\\" match vs. the Undertaker, which is believed by many to be the greatest match ever. Foley also speaks of other classic matches like the exploding landmine match he was in. Even if you are not a big fan, you will enjoy reading about the pain and sacrifice Mic Foley gave to make it big in the business. If you are a wrestling fan, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete treat for a true fan.","review":"I have been a fan of Cactus Jack ever since I saw the photos of his matches with the late Eddie Gilbert in 1991. I paid big bucks in 1995 to get the Kawisaki Death match tapes, and followed his ECW career as well as I could being unable to access a satelite dish. So what a day it was to actually read about all these matches as told by the man who performed them. It is a pleasure to read about the life of a man who pursued his dreams, and gave so much of himself over the years for his family. Foley IS good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on wrestling","review":"Many wrestlers have written books an wrestling. A lot of those books were written by \\"bigger\\" stars than Mick Foley. And yet, their books are not bigger as in better.When I grew up I idolized wrestlers and wanted to be one of them. It seemed like a very glamorous world. Mick Foley's book debunks all of that. He tells you how wrestlers really start, and the suffering they have to go through before they really make it big. When he was still wrestling I did not think much of him, but after reading this book my view of him has completely changed.The book is well written and describes his rise to fame in great detail. While telling us this he also gives an insight into the lives of wrestlers and things that go on in the wrestling world.If you love wrestling, and want to learn more about it, buy this book, together with Bret Hart's autobiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"mankind","review":"When I bought this book I did not know what to expect. I had seen Mick on tv for several years but I did know he was so smart and funny. This book had me laughing from start to finish. It is a must read for any wrestling fan and also to anyone who enjoys a good read and laugh. He has proven himself to be an incredibly brilliant author. I highly recommend this enjoyable journey. You will not be disappointed. He is truly an american jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have A Nice Day : A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks","review":"I only have one thing to say about this book and that is if you want to know about life as a wrestler you have to pay the money to order it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a Nice Day","review":"Mankind's book was a great autobiography!

It let the regular person in his life and find out about his home life and his kids. I think Mick Foley is a strong man who self personafies himself as a rgular guy but for those who watch wrestling, we know that there is a lot more to him than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says pro wrestlers are dumb?","review":"A must read of any wrestling fan, and an amusing read if you aren't.While at times his amateur writing style is a little confused this is a book that is hard to put down. Mick Foley does an amazing job of detailing his life and the struggles he underwent to attain his wrestling Stardom.I loved the fact that Mick was honest with his oppinions of other people in the wrestling field. He would give examples of why he loved someone, but would also point out major faults in the same person.From detailing the ignorant and hateful acts of some wrestlers (ex. breaking someones leg or ankle to get them out of the business) to showing the struggles that most wrestlers go through in order to stay in the business (such as sleeping 3 or 4 in a small dirtbag hotel) he keeps you captivated with his life and the growth of wrestling from hundreds of small regions into a few large companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well deserved five stars","review":"Yep, he did it. I didnt expect anything less of great when I heard about Mick Foley publishing a book written by himself. When I sat down to read this 500 + page monster, I had no idea how much I would end up enjoying. Foley has done some incredible things in his career, and he writes about them beautifully in this book. Like I allways say, anyone who thinks there's no pain in wrestling? Make them read the back of the dust cover for this book.This is packed with great information, stories and experinces and it was just a great experince to read it. I was perticularly amazed with how well-done the Owen Hart chapter was. The problem with the Rock's book is that virtually all the second half of it was in-character rant. The first part of the book was great and packed with information about his history and family. But this is just page after page of flawless writing. This is one book that has *deserved* it's spot on the new york times listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mick Foley is God","review":"Mick Foley is indeed god. Those who have read his book would know why. You will find out all about his injuries like his burn from a c4 explosion and his scars and bruises he has endured. If you ask me I think he's the best. I never was a really big wrestling fan until I read his book. The people who read the book will find out just how real wrestling is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Realistic Literature","review":"This autobiography gives new meaning to the word realistic. It is funny, sad and gruesome at times. Obviously, this book does appeal to the wrestling ethusiasts, but I recommend all read it. It brings new light to the so-called \\"fake\\" sport of wrestling. I believe those who read it will gain a new respect for wrestlers, considering the time and effort they devote to the profession they love. Overall, the book is great. Surprisingly, all those shots to the head did not affect Mankind's literary talents. The generally summarizes the life of Mankind from the time he was eighteen to now. It reveals many secrets of the profession and discusses his long and hard rode to the top of the sport. I personally suggest all should give it a try and I promise all will be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best By Far","review":"Mankind, a hardcore legend also a writer? Oh heck yeah. By far the best book I have ever read even though i'm only 15. Anyways buy this book for anyone who is a wrestling fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mick Foley is a true superstar!!","review":"Mick's story is a warm, genuine, honest look into both his remarkable life and the remarkable world of professional wrestling. True fans of 'sports-entertainment' will love the details and the stories and 'inside info', and non-fans, should they read this book, will find that it is a fascinating life story, written (very well) with honesty and candor and lots of humor. Mick's writing style reminds me of Stephen King's, the way he draws you into the atmosphere of the tale he's telling. Wonderful book!! Mick is truly a man of many talents! Buy this book and read it at least twice, and then share it with friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mick is the greastest wirter and wrestler ever!","review":"This book was a classic...no doubt about it.

Congratulations Mick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most inspiring book ever","review":"I have been a fan of pro wrestling for sometime, but in all my years I have never met a man so dedicated to work and his family than Mick Foley. I love how Mick makes you feel that he is your best friend. This book is not for the sqwemish because he goes into full detail of his Japeanese death matches and his classic HELL IN A CELL matchup with THE UNDERTAKER. What ever you want to call him,Mankind,Cactus Jack,or Dude Love. if you buy this book you will not even dought that he is the Hardcore legend. This book is a book that you will read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a Nice Day : A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks.","review":"Mick Foley is a human being contrary to popular belief. his death defying stunts in the ring become less watchable as he describes his painful journey to the top of the wrestling world! Great Read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Open the flood gates!","review":"Before 'Have a Nice Day!', wrestling stars were respected for their athleticism and charisma, but intelligence and personality? Since Mick demonstrated that a pro-wrestler can compete not only in the ring, but on the NY Times Bestseller list, we have seen a swarm of biographies released on almost every headliner that the business has seen in the last 20 years. From his ability to take a beating, to his love of amusement parks and kids stuff, Mick easily draws you into the glorious mind of Mankind. Foley, Foley!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, fun read","review":"I'm a wrestling fan, but more importantly, I'm a Mick Foley fan. Mr. Foley's exploits and adventures over the course of his eventful career made a sixteen hour flight to Asia fly by. Having said that, I'm also a fan of well-written books, and this is, unfortunately, not one of them. It's clear that the book may have benefitted from the work of a ghost-writer, but at the same time, an autobiography from a man an straightforward as Mr. Foley would have seemed disingenuous with one. In short, this book is an open and honest look at the business of wrestling (although Mr. Foley skirts the issue of genuine heat between Owen Hart and Steve Austin), that is at times rambling, but nonetheless extremely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book ever made","review":"I going to get the book soon but i know this book is great , a most read for anyone who loves to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing inside look into the secretive world of wrestling","review":"Good read.

From the first chapter telling of where he gre up and how he got into wrestling, to the last few chapters from his first couple years in the WWF, it was amazing. The best part was that as his story went on, I started remembering the things he was talking about, as I had seen them on TV. His ending with himself winning the World title was the greatest, because I remember wtching that very moment on TV!I can't say any more, it was an amazing book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book explains the true identity behind the mask","review":"I have never watched wrestling like a die hard freak but after my friend convinced me that it would be one of the truest, funniest books I have read in a while, I did.......

From sneaking out of college to see his hero, Jimmy Superfly Snuka, to Cactus Jack, to Dominic Dennuci's school, to meeting Collette, to going to the WWF, I could NOT put the book down.It had HIS opinions and his comments, and they weren't \\"fixed up\\" by some guy like the Rock's book, not saying it is bad. I really did crack up, some of the comments were just so funny. One really neat thing are the pictures, some never before seen. I don't work for the promoting crew of Mick Foley, just so you know. As JR says in the introduction, \\"This book will make you laugh, make you cry, make you wonder just how he lost his ear, but most of all, it'll make you relize just who Mick Foley is\\". All of those things happened to me, not to mention all the Al Snow jokes.Let me warn you, it does have some questionable terms and language, so don't let kids seven and under read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like sitting and having a beer with a great storyteller!","review":"When I picked up this book I was a bit worried that the \\"Mick\\" from the WWF is just a character. Well, he is, but not in the way that I worried about. Mick is the same great guy that appears on TV and at promo appearances.In reading Mick Foley's book I find myself feeling like I'm sitting on a barstool listening to the best storyteller in town, except in this case he's telling his life story.Mrs. Foley should be very proud of her little boy, he's done a terrific job (as in employment, not as in losing) in writing his life story."},{"rating":"2","title":"From someone who's not a wrestling fan...","review":"First of all, let me just say that I'm not a wrestling fan. As a matter of fact, I rather dislike this form of entertainment.However, I do like to read authors who have a knack for telling stories. And Mick Foley certainly does. As a matter of fact, this book has given me newfound respect for the practitioners of this entertainment form.The only negative points to it are that it sometimes get a little tedious in the play-by-play description of matches, and lots of terms are specific to wrestling and are not explained (perhaps a glossary for the non-initiated would be a good idea?).Mick Foley is one tough SOB, and also a great storyteller. I had a hard time putting the book down.I'll never see wrestling in the same light, that's for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a Nice Day","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Many people arecommenting on its literary merit, but don't read the book for that. Iread many books, and this one was different and refreshing. I decidedto pick this book up, because I have often been fascinated by one of the most bizarre and often most misunderstood forms of entertainment - professional wrestling. What I got was one man's account of his own life, a life that was spend in the crazy world of sport's entertainment. Mick's writing is very honest, and very insightful to the behind the scenes accounts of being a wrestler. I even particularly enjoyed Mick's stories of his own personal life outside of the ring as well. And I love the way he compares his experiences to songs and scenes from movies. Its very amusing. Great job! If you are not a wrestling fan, you might enjoy this book anyway. If you are a wrestling fan - you will.

Mick Foley did such a great job writing \\"Have A Nice Day\\" that I felt as though I knew the characters. I felt that Colette and the kids were my friends. I couldn't stand seeing them cry when Mick was in the ring. I am probably the only person in the world who will cry at \\"Beyond the Mat\\" but I couldn't watch those people whom Mick had portrayed as flesh and blood human beings. I don't think I realized just how good this book was until I saw a movie with the same people -- and they were familiar. \\"In that one moment they had somehow become friends. There does not seem much chance of their meeting again in that world or any other. But if they ever do they will rush together with their hands held out.\\" (C.S.

Foley serves up a large dish of information on all facets of the wrestling game. I know have a better idea of why the WWF is beating the hell out of the WCW.This book gives Foley the kind of positive exposure that Brett Hart's video \\"Wrestling with Shadows\\" does.

At times the book seems jumbled and hard to understand, he relies on the reader already knowing the names of wrestling moves and terminology. The last two chapters seem to be thrown into the book just to provide a finish that gives closure. It seems that 85-90% of the book is about Mankind and EWF and WCW and the rest about WWF.

With a wealth of knowledge behind her on the history of psychiatry and psychology, Dorothy knows how to explain depression in consumable fashion, straight through the usual mystifying psychobabble and chemical imbalance theories. As a therapist, I am conscious of how many people Dorothy's book has helped. They come back with passages underlined, words that are full of wisdom and truly heal. She knows how people feel in the prison of depression and they begin to be allowed to be depressed and eventually make the choice to heal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful only for mild depression","review":"I think this book was damaging for people with chronic depression, as it suggests that you can just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and, with the help of God, get over it.

The opening cut \\"Baby I Don't Care\\" rocks with the best of them. \\"Falling for a Goldmine\\" and \\"Bad Valentine\\" are hauntingly lilting, quite unlike anything else.

It looks wonderfull, lots-a-luck putting an edge on it. If you were to carry it in the field and you needed to sharpen it you would have to take a day back at camp with a stone.

Most importantly though, I found Davyn to be particularly annoying due to his self-righteous and priggish attitude especially towards Icefire. While a little jealousy and hostility from him might be credible, this character is so judgmental that it completely turned me off the book and the series as a whole (a pity I already bought the whole trilogy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality poetry from a spurious source","review":"I've read some of Dana Shuster's works and found them moving and with a real air of authenticity. Like many, I was shocked to discover that Dana Shuster had actually never been in Vietnam and that no record existed of her ever having served. Reportedly she's confessed and is in therapy. That leaves me with mixed feelings; obviously she has talent, because how else could she convince so many people? But her talent will be forever tainted by the deception, which is too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry from a fraud","review":"While there is no doubt that Dana Shuster has a talent for poetry, it must be acknowledged that she is a complete and total fraud. She never served in Vietnam, never served in the military, and never was a nurse. If this were fiction that would be fine, but she claimed to have served in Vietnam, witnessed the horrors of a Vietnam operating room, came home and suffered from Agent Orange and PTSD. The problem is that none of it is true! She made the whole thing up.

Jolson portrays Al Fuller, lead showman for Meadow's Merry Minstrels.

These films put a lot of the movie piano players out of a job. Based on the Broadway play \\"Mr Jones\\" by Irving Berlin. 1 hour and 24 minutes of glorious black and white. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film, seeing and hearing Jolson again. There's only one voice like that.

This movie has a few funny moments, but overall it's a sad tale of a lonely woman who becomes unglued after her dog dies.

Woof! Woof!!Peggy Spade's (played by Molly Shannon) beloved beagle dies and thereafter she descends into a dysfunctional madness and obsession with other abandoned dogs and animal cruelty. I am an ardent dog owner/lover, but this is a disturbing portrayal of a whacked out PETA-type who embezzles money, lies and essentially destroys her life in order to save impounded dogs. Hello??? She treats the people around her shabbily but reserves her empathy for canines.This DVD has fleas... Dig a hole and bury this misguided movie faster than a dog would hide a bone...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Year of the Dog","review":"This movie is a real DOG. I rented this movie thinking that is was a comedy, but sadly, it is only a cheap vehicle of propaganda for PETA. It has a ridiculous plot line and the main character is not likeable, half way through the movie I found myself wishing she would put an end to her miserable life. I can sum this movie up by saying that it probably was not released, it actually escaped. I would rather have a bad case of mange with a side of fleas than watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and sad","review":"Slow and quirky, weird and sad (to see someone disintegrate before your eyes).

It stars Molly Shannon, who as a comedienne on Saturday Night Live was terrific. In this dramatic role she is as stiff as a board. But the problem is not just the acting. The script is hopelessly depressing.Loving animals is a wonderful thing. This movie focuses on their abuse. A series of tragic circumstances causes Molly's character to lose her beloved pets and she has a nervous breakdown. Hardly subject matter for young children or a happy family occasion.

BEWARE of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD DOG","review":"This movie is not funny, it is not entertaining, and it is not instructive or informative, even if you are a dog and animal lover, as I am. Morose and disturbing is the best way to describe this tale of a woman who becomes essentially an obsessive, psychotic mess after the death of her beagle, even to the point of committing various crimes such as stealing money from her employer and breaking into homes. This is not a good message. It's sick, and I think offensive to those normal folks who truly do love animals but are able to maintain a decent perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THE DOGS","review":"With SNL Funny Lady Molly Shannon and Talladega Nights John C. Reilly you couldn't go wrong, right? WRONG!!!! The cast and even the director are actors I've liked (separately) in other movies but this just doesn't work. From the beginning I understood that it was going to be a dry comedy. There was plenty of DRY but NO COMEDY. I started to think that this was some kind of PETA or ALF propaganda film but when I saw the ending I realized it was quite the opposite, or at least the meaning I took away from it was. This is not anything like \\"BEST IN SHOW\\" which was printed on the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Dog only lasts a couple of hours","review":"I thought this would be some cute romantic comedy, I was wrong.

I, too, am an animal lover, but do not like sad movies and I was not prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film Glorifies Mental Illness","review":"Sadly this film glorifies animal hoarding and tries to make the mental illness that underlies these human tragedies look trivial. There are thousands and thousands of sane, healthy, hardworking animal rescuers in this country; but this film is NOT about them. Instead it is about those who lose their way, become isolated from people and harm themselves and the animals they love. This film tries to validate their insanity and make their lives look desirable. Hoarding is not funny. It is the most serious source of horrible cruelty for thousands of animals each year, and a tragedy for the people involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it..","review":"I love the actors in this film, which was kind of why I was so disappointed in it. It was slow, depressing, and showed an unrealistic portrayal of a woman going INSANE over animal rights and devolving into a crazed idiot who hordes animals and throw her life away to go on a protest circuit. I could identify with Peggy's love of animals, but I couldn't figure out what they were trying to say about animal lovers as there's a lot of mixed messages throughout the movie. I'm not sure the makers of this film knew what they were trying to say here. Ultimately, this ended up being a boring film about a pathetic woman. So much comedic talent wasted here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and LIfe-Affirming","review":"I saw this film last night and could not stop laughing or crying. I felt it was overall very life-affirming and sweet as well as being very, very funny. Of course, if you are an activist, you would enjoy the nuances and humor more.I am dismayed by some of the negative reviews. I did not see her character as being \\"negative\\" at all. She was lost and looking for purpose and probably a bit lonely, too but she has a huge heart. I found her to be very lovable and endearing. She is just part of the human condition.I left having a warm feeling in my heart. How great to have a movie made about a real person who has feelings...not some hyped up Glamour woman.

There was no way this tarp would hold up to a heavy storm, so I actually cut it up and sewed it into a pup tent for my grandson.Do yourselves a favor and take a 12'x16' camo tarp out of the package and check it out.

Many of us Anglicans hold moral viewpoints (yes, even on abortion, fornication, and concubinage) which would match those of the most devout Roman, and our attitude towards divorce would be no more carefree than the RC annulment mentality.The book is not dishonest, but certainly is very incomplete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblical Arguments Missing","review":"I purchased this book as I was considering converting from the Roman Catholic Church but after reading this book I changed my mind.

I was expecting a volume which like - Surprised By Truth Vol 1&2, gave the testimonials of former Protestants who became Catholic after providing detailled biblical reasons for their conversions.

I don't think that they should have made Mami that confident in the beginning when she was beaten by Ran many times and now she thinks she can beat her. In the second episode I like the way they showed more information of when Miyu was in the gang and how she met Yomato. In the first episode I like the way they did the snowball so realistic.

There are so many holes in the story that needed to be cleaned up before it ever went to press. Throughout the book, the author writes in a fifteen year old voice then at the end we find out it's a retrospective. Would a 21 year be writing a retrospective in a 15 year old voice? Also, why is Edmond so damaged? The other children faced atrocities as well and seemed to come out intact. It would have been more fitting for Edmond to have been dead. Especially since the main character suddenly lost her telepathic abilities with him which was hoacky anyhow. Why did it take her 6 years to go back? Why did the telephone suddenly start working? Screams of a deus ex machina- If we are going to publish gritty works that are relevant, let's have the courage to really finish the story, not just make convenient endings--"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This was such a weird and odd book. I read it a few years ago and to this day, I still am a little enraged by the outcome of it. I felt it was anticlimactic and just weird. I don't recall any specific literary meaning or morals learned in this book and it felt like a waste of time. I looked over some of the reviews and feel like I should give it another go, but I can't bring myself to it because for whatever reason, I am seriously enraged when I see the cover because I hated it so much. When all was said and done I remember saying, \\"What? That was so stupid.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing but worse content","review":"I didn't like the writing style of this book but could have gotten over that. I had a major problem with the main character having sex with her cousin (this doesn't really give away the plot). Maybe I am old-fashioned but some things should remain taboo. Just an odd off-shoot of the plot that seemed unnecessary, but I guess sex sells."},{"rating":"2","title":"best YA book I've read","review":"Considering the current global climate, this book gets right to the meat of what's truly important -- not only to teens, but to people in general. At first I wasn't sure where it was going, but I kept reading and was drawn in by Daisy's voice and outlook. She's so REAL. Although the story is fiction, something like it could happen, and it's nice to see a strong, female heroine \\"make it\\" without being perfect in every way. I don't think it's just a book for girls, or even just for teens. It was the first story I've read in a long time that made me think AND made me feel satisfied when the story ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not understand the praise for this book.","review":"I wanted to love this book, I really did. I read the description, I read all the glowing reviews, and I was so looking forward to reading it. Then I started it, and by the end of the first chapter I was bored out of my mind. I finished it out of a sense of obligation but didn't enjoy it at all. The long, rambling sentences were practically unreadable. A male character named Edmond who hung the moon? Twilight, much? I won't even get into the ickiness of the incest.I think this subject matter is intriguing (the war part, not the incest/telepathy crap) but it was very poorly executed in this book. Perhaps I'm just too old to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!","review":"This plot of the book was good. Interesting, in the way the kids go from heaven to hell in a heartbeat. But the fact that Daisy falls in love with her cousin is desturbing. They sneak off and have sex in the barn in the daytime, and in their room at night. And Daisy likes the way he tastes because he smokes. That's just flat-out nasy.The other thing is the run-on sentences because they go on and on forever and take up whole paragraphs and half the time there's only two to three sentences on one page and there's no commas or any punctuation in them unless you count the periods and you end up getting confused and exasperated and distracted from reading because you're wondering when the sentence will end but it never does until the next page and then there's ANOTHER run-on sentence and see how annoying this is?The last thing I have a problem with is the dialogue. There is none. The author only describes what's being said. What happened to SHOW instead of TELL?Hence the \\"blech.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Say what?","review":"We had to read this book for school, and I must mention right away that I strongly disliked this book. I love reading, that's not the problem, but it's written very poorly, and the fact that they don't use proper symbols really got to me and they just use an irritating amount of capitals. The story itself was somewhat okay, but also odd.

Although I do understand the author's intentions, the grammar and punctuation were incorrect. Issues such as an eating disorder and incest were present and were never really dealt with or handled properly. Overall, the story was very unrealistic. I had to make myself finish reading it, despite wanting to quit many times. It was not exciting and didn't keep my interest. Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only OK IF I am Generous","review":"The information on the war was vague and unrealistic. The incest was never dealt with, as was her unnamed bulimia. Dad was a jerk and that was never resolved. She is supposed to go off in the sunset with her English lover who just happens to be her shell shocked cousin at the end? YUK! However, the initial story, before the war starts, is sweet and almost innocent. If it were not for the fact she's doing her cousin while all the adults are utter fools."},{"rating":"1","title":"If i could give this book zero stars i would","review":"My teacher at school reccomended this book to me.

Hokey and not very erotic or interesting. A big waste of money! I saw the movie in a theater in an upscale neighborhood in the early 1970s when X-rated films were still shown in normal theaters. I thought it was one of the most erotic movies I'd seen. Hadn't seen that many to that point. So when I got a gift certificate to BN, I bought the DVD, among other things. It came and I was VERY disappointed. I guess I'd forgotten how bad it was. Extremely bad acting, even by X-movie standards. (Well, maybe not, but ...). Extremely bad 'effects' -- among the worst you'll ever seen anywhere. No beginning film-maker would be caught dead doing such silly models and animations nowadays. It might be a 'classic' in somebody's book. If so, it is a terrific argument for trashing and forgetting such 'classics' forever. Embarrassing. In a word. I barely could sit through it.

However, the restored footage is not an improvement - resulting in a draggy midsection. The sophomoric hijinks worked better in the original R-rated version. Highlighted by some surprisingly good special effects (even Buster Crabbe was impressed), \\"Flesh Gordon\\" remains more palatable than the majority of low-budget midnight movies.

I forced myself to make it 3/4 of the way through, but finally had to turn it off.(And I like wierd stuff). The acting was beyond horrible. The special effects were intended to remain true to original series, but they were actually worse! It was an excellent concept, but the end result was just plain awful. I will give it one more shot.

That scene is almost flawless and as good as any Harryhausen animation. The one love scene with Flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice. The film is worth a rent if your curious but it's really just a lame and unfunny movie.

I'd highly recommend this converter for overseas use with small appliances. It's relatively small and lightweight making it a good choice for travel.

Haven't found a reason to watch video on it, but it's nice to know I could. Just a few cons, playlists are tricky to set up, and it's far too easy to hit the record button on the side. Also, fast forwarding is a pain, especially if you lost your spot in an audiobook because you accidentally hit the record button on the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but a lot of problems","review":"Seems to be a well constructed item, however, a lot of the time it can't seem to load the selection for 3 or 4 minutes.

They're simple small speakers with a thin foam pad on them.Would I buy another one or recommend it - not if there was another option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I have to say-I was pretty excited to get the FOUR players I purchased. My family and I are in the process of moving overseas and because of this, we had to think wisely of what we wanted for Christmas. So this was it. MP3 players for our long flight. We didn't even get out of December before my daughter's MP3 wouldn't hold a charge. Then, today (January 14th), my son's screen started blanking out. It just flashes between the SanDisk and then goes white. I kept hearing how Apple IPODs and Nanos were a pain, but I am really wondering how much worse can they be compared to the two out of 4 I bought. It sounds sad, but I am afraid to use the other two.

My third child received an ipod, which he took back because it was difficult to use and didn't have the features that the SanDisk e250 had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mp3 player","review":"Picked this player as my Christmas gift. Already had a small 512 MB M200 series SanDisk player and really liked that, so I stuck with SanDisk and upgraded to the e250. This is a great player. I love the large colorful screen. The controls are easy to navigate. But probably the best feature of all is the expansion slot. Since I got the smallest capacity of 2GB, I picked up a Micro SD card and filled that with more music. I have not tried any video on this yet, so can not comment about that feature. The only negative I have is when you start up the player, it takes about 30 to 45 seconds to run through its \\"refresh database\\" warmup. Not sure if that is because of the expansion card, but it is slightly annoying having to wait every time you turn it on. Other than that minor flaw, nothing but rave reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little player","review":"The Sansa e250 is great looking, relatively low-priced, easy to use, easy to navigate, has great battery life and is compact & lightweight. It replaces a low-capacity player I'd owned for several years, and there's just no comparison. I only wish now that I gotten the 4gb model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Device for the money","review":"This is a great device. Every feature on it is better than both versions of the iPod nano (I have owned both). The video is good quality, but it's not as smooth as I would like it to be. The front and back don't scratch easily, which is a pro in comparison the the original nano, which scratched super easily. I'm actually selling my Sansa now though because I don't listen to that much music. But you should definitely get the Sandisk brand mp3players instead of the nano if you want a nonscratchable, multifeatured device for a great price.[...]I'm selling a used 2gb without any scratches for 50% off, with a free 512mb Micro SD to add 125+ more songs onto the Sansa."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: microSD Card expansion often not useable","review":"I received version 1 of this product. There are two modes for use: MTP and MSC. MTP is REQUIRED for use with Windows Media Player 10+ and other software, but when the player is in MTP mode the microSD card expansion slot is UNUSABLE. This has been confirmed by Sansa technical support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little MP3 player","review":"This mp3 player is a steal for the money. I needed one to take on motorcycle trips and backpacking excursions. This one worked out real well. It is fairly stout and can withstand some bumps and abuse. I got a rubber cover for it which helps protect it. I was also happy with the free software for converting video content for uploading onto it. Get it at the Sansa website. I keep my pictures and some video to share with people who I meet and I can get most of my music on there too. Volume is adequate but could be better at the cost of battery life which is also just adequate. I carry an extra charged battery on backpacking trips and can change out the dead one in a minute with a tiny screwdriver or knife blade. Radio is good but can be directionally sensitive. Voice record works great. I recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio problems and substandard electronics","review":"This mp3 player has many different features which can be useful, however, its drawbacks are rather problematic. First of all, the volume level cannot reach high enough, for those who like to listen to music at a relatively high audible level, or if the audio file is recorded at a low volume level and you need compensation. Second, the sound quality does not offer good bass sound and the stereophonic quality sound it offers is really not high quality. Third, the buttons often jam because of the fragile construction, or in other cases the circuitry jams if various different buttons are pressed too rapidly in succession because the corresponding electronic systems are poorly designed. Also, the memory size can be problematic. I would say every mp3 should offer at least 4 GB of memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Sansa products are junk","review":"The SanDisk company sent me one of these after four successive Sansa Clips all fried on me, through no fault of my own. A week ago, this one broke, too, a piece falling out when I was simply trying to plug in the USB connection. Now the company won't replace it, saying the warranty ran out a year after I bought my very first defective product, five MP3 players ago.This company makes cheap, defective junk, then won't own up to it.Stay away from these products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect MP3 Player","review":"Bought this for a friend who is not techno-oriented. I charged it and loaded music on it for her. She absolutely loves it. Perfect size; easy to read screen; no problems navigating for a non-techno. Probably not the best player for someone looking for a lot of bells and whistles, nor a lot of memory. But if you want a really solid, good capacity, easy to use MP3, then this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with this mp3 player","review":"This is like an Ipod but cheaper. This mp3 player has an amazing sound and good colors. The screen and the icons are well organized.

It has a great appearance, even great features but all that doesn't do any good if I can't hear the music i put on it. I am a very active person, either by running, playing basketball, or working out I use my mp3 player. There is only two choices to adjust the volume and the highest one is still like a whisper. It doesn't work with my fm transmitter also.

I attend day long meetings several times a year and wanted a device that would record a series of sessions. The device only records in two hour or so increments. Additionally the battery ran out after several hours. So for short recordings, it works okay. But if you need it to record additional information, be sure to get the car charger (or find an outlet) so that you can record all day. Lastly, it was not that easy to figure out how to use. The instructions that came with the device were minimal.

This software is worthless. Even after numerous sessions with Sandisk's technical support I am unable to load or view even a small photo (JPG or BMP). I only paid $109.00 for this product. I guess you get what you pay for.

I thought I'd borrow one of them from the kids and switch from being a \\"books on tape\\" to a \\"books on MP3\\" listener. Wrong.Like so many other MP3 players, these are missing 2 important software features: variable-speed/high gain fast-forward & reverse, and bookmarking. Without these the unit is worthless for trying to listen to an hours-long audio book. Without bookmarking, you'll frequently find yourself inadvertently reset at the beginning of the book. And its 5X fast-forward would take 2 hours of button-holding just to get back to the end of a 10-hour book.Each of these features is a fairly trivial bit of software/firmware. And Sandisk has wisely built into the e200 series the ability to update the firmware. For now I'll hold out hope that Sandisk will retrofit these features into their firmware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok MP3 Player.","review":"I bought my Sansa 2 GB at Radioshack and 2 weeks later it went into an incredibly little interface crash and has been irresponsive ever since, the player does not want to work at all and the 14 day return policy expired (before you buy please check if there is any return policy) Other than that enjoy the little life it has.

This is a huge con for me as I listen to my MP3 at work where I need to talk to the people around me at the same time.-Windows Vista:The Sansa will not work with Vista, bottom line. Even with a new driver it would sit there and try to load over and over again without ever accomplishing anything. I was forced to upload my music from my new computer to my old one with XP to get anything to load onto the player.-Minor stuff:The control wheel was a little strange. It was easy to go past what you wanted to select, but I could overlook this with the reasonable price of the player.Bottom Line - If you want a decent, reasonbly priced MP3 player that will load your music and videos easily and not deafen you when you listen to them, don't but the Sansa E250."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandisk 2GB MP3 Player Review","review":"This player has turned out to be reliable and I have experienced no problems with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This product is very good.

It crashes often, and even when it works it's so small as to be pointless. But the sound is fantastic. Sound quality is a variable that's often forgotten when shopping for MP3 players, but quite a variable it is from experience. This player has better sound than my ipod, and much better sound than my Insignia player. Just because it's digital doesn't mean the quality can't vary. Clearly they used good components in these, and the sound is crisp and without distortion.

Great when it works, but its too much trouble to get it to that point once it goes sour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 Player","review":"I love this mp3 player. It is easy to use and has alot of memory even without using the SD expansion slot. I have about 200 songs on it, which has only used about half of the memory. The radio works pretty good even without the cord being used as an antenna. The battery is pretty good also - it lasts through several of my study sessions for medical school. The only thing that totally annoys me at times is the case. This is because since the case just slips over the mp3 player, it gradually slips off when walking or running if the player is loose. However, since it is really good about protecting the player from scratches & it does stay on when it is in my bag, I'll live with the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent player","review":"This is a great mp3 player. I was going to get an ipod nano, but i saw this one, for 129.99 at circuit city I got a 4gb and it's awesome. i have 233 songs, music videos, and pictures. and if i ever need more memory i can get a memory card. the video quality is great, and the screen is twice as big as the nano's. love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Money!!!!","review":"I really like my new mp3 player.

The radio worked fine. The MP3 player worked, but I could not load music on either of my computers. I have a Macintosh desktop at home. The Mac would recharge the device, but did not recognize it. The other computer I have is an HP laptop with an XP operating system. It would not recognize the player at all, I kept getting an error message. Once, during the two hours I messed with it, it froze and had to be rebooted. I called tech support and found out that the Sandisk Sansa 250e will not work with a Mac at all. His other suggestion was that the device needed Microsoft Media Player version 10 or 11 or it would not work. I checked my laptop and it had version 11. I sent it back and got my money back. I bought an Ipod clone that works great on either system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact - Easy and user friendly","review":"This is the best of all the other MP3 that I have had!

Interacts great with vista and allows you to rate songs as they are played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !!","review":"I love it !! I was able to purchase a 4 meg upgrade and now have 6 GB for all my music. I have been confused by it ( transferring playlists from my PC ),but after reading the manual it (duh) worked out. the only thing I would change is making the plugin module internal and having the device treat all memory as contiguous. Sound is great (but then I'm older and went to a lot of live concerts when I was younger, and was always close to the speakers <grin>) and works for me and all my favorite 60's and early 70's music.

I will be purchasing one soon for my 7-year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as any Ipod","review":"This Mp3 player is the best I've owned so far, with all the features you need and at a much more reasonable price than any Ipod. My favorite part is the spinning blue wheel, which looks cool and makes song selection convenient. Although you may prefer the 4, 6 or 8 gig models for more space, this is one of the best players out there. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cheap mp3 player","review":"I bought this mp3 player about 2 months ago, and so far I am very satisfied with it. The fact that its inexpensive but still has some decent features is nice. The fm receiver while simple is a very nice touch, so that i can listen to the news when jogging etc. While the capacity is small, I quickly bought an 8 gb micro sd card which instantly expanded my storage to 10 gbs, really a pretty good amount and still under 100$. Granted I have not even atempted to use the video functions on this device, and they probably could be better, but for 50 bucks this is a hell of a buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very sturdy unit","review":"I bought this as a gift for my wife in March of this year. It functioned well until now. The player was never banged around or exposed to excess heat, but the display sreen suddenly went wonky. It displays nothing but a frozen piece of abstract art on the screen, and nothing I have done will fix it. Now I understand why most people buy iPods; they're worth a little bit of extra money. And that is exactly what I'm going to purchase as soon as this review is finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Features Great - Performance Poor","review":"I've had this player for 4 hours, in that time I've had to remove the back of the device in as many times to remove the battery in order to reset the player.

Looking at the other reviews for the e250 product, they made it sound real good, and there was the ~$90.00 discount; thats why i bought one. Mistake. When I got it, the picture quality and sound was perfect. At first, I thought the only con to this product was that you have to plug it to a computer to recharge it, but it was no biggie. But after I used it for 2 HOURS and I shut it off and was about to turn it back on, it didn't work. I looked at forums here and there, and many people with this mp3 also had the same problem. Some gave solutions, but even thought I tried them all, it still didn't work. In the end, I had to replace it, just like many others with this mp3 did.The only good thing is the picture and sound quality; I'll give you that, but what use is it when it doesn't work? Not worth the $110.00. I give you my word that it will break in a year if not sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy","review":"Easy to set up, It is an older model but for that price is great. 2gb might no be much but you can add more memory.

When I got it, I carefully followed all the instructions and loaded my music. While listening to it, the screen went white and the Sansa died ... after less than one hour of play. And I mean it really, quite sincerely died. Guess I should have heeded all those negative reviews. I went to SanDisk's website to try to troubleshoot it, but the amount of work they expected me to do to on a brand new product was unreasonable. Fortunately, Amazon took it back and gave me a prompt and hassle-free refund. I'll stick with MUVO..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I bought this unit from Amazon a few weeks ago. It is my first MP3 player --- basically an experiment of mine to see what these gizmos are all about. The unit seems solid, well finished, and it works exactly as promised. The tiny screen is extremely clear and vibrant in its colors. And the unit was not expensive at all!I have actually never had a good experience with an Apple product, so before I handed Steve Jobs hundreds of my bucks for a nano or iPod, I wanted to make sure it was something I would actually use. Now, with my Sansa, I see no reason to buy anything else, it does the job right.The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the ear-buds are uncomfortable and cheapish, so I'll have to find better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRASHED the second day","review":"So disappointed with this.

This has been going on for about a year now, but this time it has had it I guess and is ready for the trash.

As others have stated, the wheel is just poorly designed.It will likely either randomly delete or duplicate songs when you sync with Window's Media Player.The record button is poorly placed and too sensitive, so when I had it in my pocket while walking, it would randomly start recording.The port where you plug in the headset went bad on mine 2 months after purchase. The exact same thing happened with the replacement. I became so frustrated with this piece of junk, I eventually just slammed it against a brick wall.It was enjoyable seeing destroyed into several pieces.

I expected to us eit for video play or image slide play. But I just can't get it right for most of occasion. Now I almost foot I still have this e250 until I saw the page from here so I think I need to share part of my experience.I don't sign up for any online music service. Only use media player to transfer music from my library and collection. For many times I have difficult to transfer the right songs to right location in this e250. I feel there are many bugs issues in this model. So I gave up and go get ipod to get the better life. For sound quality I may give it 3 stars but for ease of use I will give it 1 star. The conclusion, the quality at sound can't even compare with the digital voice recorder \\"OLYMPUS ws-300m\\". How sad!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this mp3 will ruin your life","review":"Sure, this player looks nice and has wonderful sound quality -- if you can figure out how to get music onto it. Once you have, your real troubles begin. Why, for example, does it suddenly decide to no longer accept podcasts? How do you get it to begin downloading them again? Who knows. This is probably an excellent product if you have an advanced degree in computer engineering. For the rest of us it's an infuriatingly complicated, user-hostile waste of money and time. Oh, if I could only get back the hours and hours and hours I've spent trying to operate this thing since I bought it last summer. This is the first product review I've ever posted. I do it to warn the others: WALK AWAY. DO NOT BUY THE SANSA E250. IT WILL DESTROY YOU. SAVE YOURSELF.

The sound is acceptable and the interface simple. I was never very excited about the wheel controller because it does stick an awful lot.The main problem with this product is that it is very sensitive and can crash easily. If you do not disconnect from your computer in exactly the right way, it gets very upset and will crash. Once it does crash, it does not recover well. I have spent two days reformating, deleting everything, trying again and getting more frustrated.I cannot honestly say that this product is otherwise so special that it is worth putting up with this frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVED IT, BUT...","review":"The screen broke, just cracked down the middle one day. i was very careful with it and the screen just cracked out of nowhere and never worked any more after that :( no wonder its so cheap. go for their new products that aren't 1/3 of their original price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product is easy to use","review":"The product worked fine after the recommended 3 hours of initial battery charging.

I opened it up and I found out that this product like way to many of the current mp3/ media players cannot play normal mp3s. what I mean by normal mp3s is an mp3 gotten by putting the data from a cd on to your computer. The only mp3s that it can support is ones that have the special permition encoding like ones bought online. This product did not even deserve the star I gave it. If you have a library of mp3s that is all bought online then this is the mp3 player for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Product, Poor Support","review":"This mp3 player works great, BUT! I purchased two of these units for my daughters. They work great and hold more music than an average person could listen to in a month. The problem is that Sansa offers no accessories for them. You can't get a car or wall adapter to charge the unit. There are NO cases available that will fit properly. The plugs on Sansa products are NOT the same as Sony's, so don't waste your money trying. If you are not constantly near a computer with a USB port, you cannot recharge the battery. Because my daughters carry them in their purse and no cases are available, they get all scratched up. Until Sansa gets their act together, I would not buy any of their products. I even called them, whereas I was told accessories would be out by Christmas (2006). Here it is April of '07 and still no accessories. Most stores are now refusing to even carry this product.

Think carefully before you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sansa e250 Review","review":"This MP3 player has lived up to all my expectations. I haven't used the micro SD slot yet. I've just synched songs from my PC and played them on my MP3 player. I've done most of my battery charging while hooked up to the computer although I also purchased the extra Macally SN-A411 USB AC Charger. I should use the charger while on vacation. Later, I bought an arm holder that I put the MP3 player in and use while working out. The MP3 player is held steady this way. That's the main reason I bought an MP3 player. So far, I've used it while working out and while working on the lawn. Amazon's price was the best I found and when I later found the same unit in a store, it was more than $20 more expensive at the store. Delivery was as estimated by Amazon. The only disadvantage I've seen is most optional equipment is made for Ipods but for the price difference I'm not concerned. I think Amazon or SanDisk is the place I could find such equipment made for my unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This MP3 really does what it says.

And once in a while, I'll finish a listening session and all my songs are fine. Then I turn the device on later that day to listen to more music but most or all of my songs say \\"Unknown\\" for the title. I cannot figure out what causes the device to do this but I do know that it causes me to get pissed. Good luck getting video on it because I can't get mine to take ANY video. But in the devices favor, it has a nice bright screen, easy user interface, and good battery life. I just wish it wasn't so buggy so I could listen to music easily! Don't listen to people who say it's not loud enough because that all depends on your earbuds/headphones. I have some Philips earbuds that are so loud, I can only turn the volume up to one. But overall, just don't buy this, get a Creative or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 player at a fair price","review":"This is a great MP3 player as well as a great video player.

I am returning it to amazon and will probably by a Nano in its place.I usually dont have any problems with electronics items I purchase, perhaps luck has always been on my side.

This one is great. It comes with basically no instructions, so I had to download a user's manual from the internet. I would think something like this would come with instructions, but as I said, they were very sparse. Now that I have the user's manual, I really like it. I guess I'm just surprised that it wouldn't be included. or at least instructions on where to download the manual. Pretty much nothing.

However Amazon's customer service was excellent and told me to return the item and a replacement would be sent. Not only was the replacement sent before I even returned the item but the return shipping was free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good MP3 Player, works well with Linux","review":"Music works well with Linux - Grip or similar to rip .wav files off your CDs and convert them to .mp3; and just use regular file copies (bash or Nautilus) to move or remove files on MP3 player.Voice recording is also good. Creates .wav files with date in name, easy to transfer off MP3 player to Linux.FM player is fine.No documented method to put pictures or video on to player except included Windows \\"Media Converter\\" application. The JPEG pictures apparently need some specific format - a regular JPEG file does not work. I do not intend to use this for pictures or video, but I would add one more star if these were documented for use in Linux.The CD also includes a Windows only application for access to the Rhapsody online music store. According to the Rhapsody web site, Mac and Linux users can use the Rhapsody service via browser."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally!!!!","review":"...This mp3 player works, my previous one froze within 3 days of use, I made the mistake of replacing with the same one and had the same problem, so I bought this and I am very please, so far a month has gone by and no problems, I would recommend this to any one, simple to use, thats a plus I think, I don't like complicated things, battery does lasts, its rechargable thru your pc. It holds pictures, it has a radio....and a great price, you can't bit the price for what it does...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A newbie whose made the right purchase...","review":"While not the most agile when it comes to the latest technology, I reviewed the customer recommendations for the Sansa e200 since I was looking for a good MP3 player, and was pleasantly surprised to find most customers were very satisfied with their purchase.A friend who also has a Sansa advised that I would get easily addicted to down loading songs, and she was right - I was up late last night doing that very thing.The directions are pretty clear, and luckily I did some research prior to my purchase to find a site that would be most compatible with my Sansa - for my preferences, it's Rhapsody. They have the \`click and drag' method and I was amazed at how easy it was.My only complaint, and mind you it's a small one, is the screen is already scratched. It's not a big scratch but I know it's there...if anyone can recommend on how to protect the screen, or give any idea's, that would be great.Overall - I'm a very happy customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves it","review":"I would have rated it 5 stars but I am an Ipod lover. I bought this for my husband to use when we workout at the gym. He loves it. He has put all his CD's on it. He even walks around the house listening to his music. The only problem we have is we can not figure out how to make a playlist. He uses the artist or albums list instead and he doesn't really care that much that there are no playlist on it. He did purchase new headphones because the ones that came with it were too large for him. I think he is ready to get the microSD disk for it so he can put even more music on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I purchased this for my husband and he's been having a great time using it. He is electronically challenged and he's had no problem with it at all. He thought he would never use 2GB and now he's saying maybe he should have an additional memory card. One of my better buys for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent MP3 player","review":"What is not to like? Expansion slot for additional memory, Radio, Music, Voice recording, Video. The Sansa has it all. I have been using it for about a month now and I can only say it is all good as far as features go. A couple of words of caution, consider buying a case for it as it only comes (much like all of them) with the flimsy little bag carrier and a useless carrying cord. The unit also only comes with a cord to charge your unit off of a USB port on a computer. It would be worth it to get the AC cord. I am considering buying both of these. Other than that....it is a great unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've had it for 4 months, and just can't bring myself to complain...much...","review":"This is a neat little toy - it always works, it's never *ever* locked up, the software is witless and simple for pics and vids, the batteries last for-freaking-ever, it sounds very good, and it's survived a gazillion falls - even down hard concrete stairs - without issue.Those falls, by the way, were absorbed by the Speck caseSpeck Products ToughSkin Case with Belt Clip for Sansa e200 (Black)which is the gawd-awfullest militarily brutish looking thing in existence, but man does it work.My complaints, one real and one nit, are as follows: The nit - the bulk factor. This is juuuust a little fat, compared to some other players. With the Speck case it's downright obese. Still, not so big that it would stop me from recommending it.The real complaint: the earbuds. They sounded like crap. Got some better ones, and viola! Sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3","review":"I bought the e250 a couple months ago after reading hundreds of reviews about various mp3 players. So far, I have been completely satisfied with it. At first I was worried about using up 2gb quickly, but now I don't know if I'll ever fill it up. It's a piece of cake to transfer music files with Windows Media Player, but I haven't experimented with video files yet. Loaded with tons of features [...] I don't know of a better value out there. I give the e250 5 stars and will definitely buy more SanDisk products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"OK, I hate ipods and itunes. I think they are overpriced and itunes (IMO)is not that user friendly (yes I am computer savvy). This baby for the price plays mp3's, stores/views jpeg pictures and mpeg4 video and is podcast capable. All you have to do to get files on this player is to click and drag from your PC to the sansa and bwam-o you are done! You can also go through windows media as well to get mp3's on. I'm lazy OK and clicking and dragging is all I want to do. It automatically creates the folders with artist/alblum name. Great alternative to the $150 (and up) ipods. The sansa has an optional memory slot as well to increase drive space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sansa is Superb","review":"I bought this so I could have something small to listen to at work. The 4Gb is plenty enough space to hold what I need. (It does come in larger versions) The size and features are perfect for me as i perform my duties in the factory where I am employed. The sound from the ear buds is very good. The EQ settings make playback very appealing. Would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good MP3 Player."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I originally bought the colby mp3 player, but didn't like the fact that you couldn't set up a play list. This one has all the features that I wanted and getting it on sale was a plus. The only con is that it's a bit heavy, so even in the protective skin and armband it feels like it's going to break through the covering. But so far it's holding up fairly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great the first week","review":"When I purchased this product,I was looking for an MP3 that was compatible with Rapsody to go. I bought one for me and three others for my sons and my husband. However all of our Sansa's stopped working sooner than later. Mine was the longest lived and it lasted about three months. My sons' and husband's MP3s all died within a month or two.If you are looking for an MP3 player that is compatible with Rapsody, I would try the zen. That was my next MP3 and it is still working well. My husband got the Sansa clip and he has had that for a few months too. The clip is also great for workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad, beautiful story","review":"The heart of this book is terrific.

Sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"It is very difficult to be able to read the captions. The piece that has the captions on it seems to float too low in the liquid, so it is very hard to be able to read. Tilting it repeatedly seems to eventually work, but after that effort, the intended humor is gone. I don't know if it is related to that issue, but I have only been able to get ~3 different responses to ever come up. I suspect that the weight of the floating piece is too heavy, and not equally balanced. It was intended to be a gift, but I ended up not giving it, since it wasn't fun to use, since it was so hard to read. Part of the packing inserts were missing, so I suspect I got one that had been returned - probably since it didn't work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of fun","review":"This little toy provides a lot of fun for a small price.

This is a dangerous toy for children and should be taken off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be fine, if it worked.","review":"I ordered the Sarcastic Ball as a little joke to go with my gypsy/fortune teller Halloween costume. I had a magic 8 ball when I was a kid, so I figured this would be the same, only sarcastic, right? You would think so, but no, apparently not. The liquid inside the ball is sludgy. It's too thick for the message die inside the ball to rotate and come to the surface. In the ball I received, the message never came completely up to the surface of the window, and the liquid is so dark, that it has to be on the window or you can't read it. So, after 10 minutes of shaking the ball and hoping it would begin to get better, I gave up. It's being returned. Also, as a side note, the construction was crappy. The ball has a seam around the middle that was assembled badly and had some glue reside on it. It was just very cheaply and poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping Issue","review":"I read a review about how one of these balls had arrived broken. I just thought that it might have been a fluke... So I ordered the 8 Ball for a friend here in Iraq.

I am not sure, but it seems to me like the manufacturer may need to improve on the design of this ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this for the company Christmas gift exchange.

As a child, I played daily with garden fairies and tree sprites (I called them). I believe that Dora had a different name for them. I have always known that there are other worlds or dimensions that exist with ours. I believe that people are really capable of multi-dimensional sight over 3-D, but only a very few have crossed over to experience it. I no longer see fairies. I wish I still did. I know they are there.Reading Dora's book gave me a wonderful feeling of knowing that there were others that feel the same way. She has explained this unexplainable world in such a talented manor.

This dvd is not worth buying because all Kathy Griffin does is talk about shallow topics in an anecdotal way which gets kind of boring and monotonous.

The reason I am writing this review is that the other reviewer is mistaken. She says that the book is not about \\"Cooking with Artisan Bread.\\" The book is about precisely what it says: using artisan bread in your cooking. What the reviewer Jane means is that the book is not about baking bread, and the book does not pretend it is about that. (Think: cooking is not baking.) She should have read the editorial descriptions and the recipe list to realize that. The recipes are for dishes--panini, bread pudding--in which you USE artisan bread. I am buying the book so that I can use loaves more fully. Sometimes after the first day of plain bread with a meal, the loaf sits there unused. My bread-loving family will probably devour the dishes from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Ok","review":"Better to read Presentations for Profits.

We had to give up after less than 30 minutes. Instead of using the 7 hours for a more faithful presentation of a masterful plot, it is nonsensical from the very beginning.It is hard to imagine someone who never read the book understanding what is going on and who these characters are. Harder to understand is how the French succeeded in botching up one of their own cultural masterpieces.It is a good idea to rent this movie first before buying it.The best screen adaptation of the novel that I have seen is the 1954 version with Jean Marais.

I sent it back to Freehand and they supposedly replaced it but the second battery did exactly the same thing. Now it doesn't hold a charge at all and I have to use the power cord every time. I've considered buying a new battery but Freehand forces you to purchase 2 at a time for $90! No thanks! My second complaint is that the hardware is slow and the software is very limited in what it can do.Buy an iPad at half the price or a touch PC for the same price and get much, much, much functionality with faster speeds and loads more battery life.On a related note, I have a MPP for sale if anyone ignores my comments above and is interested :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"FREEHAND MUSIC NO LONGER SUPPORTS THE MUSICPAD PRO","review":"I upgraded to the new Apple operating system \\"Lion\\".

Now Freehand have discontinued the product and all support, although you can still download music from their website in a format that is only usable on this product, or by the iPad app. The Android app which was mentioned on their website no longer seems to exist, and their customer service response when I asked about it was \\"I am really sorry but we no longer service the MPP\\".

The story is well-paced, absorbing and evocative of the 70s; the characters are totally believable and sympathetic; and the subtle word play is witty and hilarious. Often when I read first novels I find myself getting sort of anxious on behalf of the novelist, but in this case I was completely confident that the author wouldn't betray my trust.

The tips it gave were rather common-sensical, the stories it shared didn't really give any insight into how the game applies to business, and to top it off, it didn't not give accurate rules to the game. For example, the book said that you couldn't collect rent while in jail, so you should always try to stay out of jail and in the game, just like in life. That's a nice maxim to live by, but you CAN collect rent while in jail and every good business person knows that there are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative. Overall, the book was very disappointing and I hope only to spare others from making the same mistake of wasting time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Editor's Nightmare","review":"The was a good book and easy to read, but I have never seen a published book with this many errors in it.

The problem may have been my expectations for the book -- it's obviously intended for an advanced audience -- but I took Gufeld at his word when he says that players of all levels can benefit from the book... Note especially the point about people buying repertoire books to save time, whereas GM Gufeld's choices require far more time to digest tons of theory.For us patzers, the best opening \\"repertoire\\" I've found so far is in the last three chapters of Seirawan's _Winning Chess Openings_.

But when I got the DVD I saw there were only 24 episodes. Why on earth did they leave off 'Horsepower' and 'Horse Sense', two perfectly innocuous episodes? I can't understand how or why this oversight happened. It's just so annoying, I buy DVDs in order to get rid of my tapes, and now I have to keep this one.

If you are looking for a good book that you can't put down this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read","review":"I have enjoyed Holly's work from the first time I picked up the first one years ago. This series (The Secret Texts) is the largest projuect I have seen from her and she pulls it off nicely. In Courage of the Falcons, like the other two books in the series, she once again draws you into the world that is Matrin and the lives of its inhabitants, taking you for a exciting ride filled with danger, love, intrigue and action. If you have enjoyed any of Holly's work in the past you will love this one, if you havent had the pleasure of reading her work I recommend you pick up Diplomacy of Wolves and read this series from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage of Falcons (The Secret Texts, Book 3","review":"I rate this book as a four because it was exciting and the detail, and suspense was excellent. The writer keeps you guessing. You should read the whole series 1-3. They will be well worth your time. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage of Falcons","review":"After reading the first two books in the series, I anxiously waited for the third. I was able to get a preview copy offered by Holly Lisle on her website and immediately dived into the story. It does not disappoint. I can virtually see and hear the story as I read; I feel as if I am part of that world. All the threads carried through the first two books are woven neatly into a satisfying tapestry at the end of the third. Yet I leave the story knowing that there is still more for Holly to tell. I can hardly wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is For Jewelry","review":"I have a one man foundry for ceramic shell lost wax casting of sculpture. There are many challenges and opportunities to do things better. This book did not help because it is for the jewelry maker who is doing lost wax casting and not for the foundry casting art sculpture.The pictures and illustrations seem to be from the 40's and the book is for the person who is experienced and equipped as a machinist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book rewiew","review":"I am very pleased with the contents of this book. It has detail in other aspects of casting/investment molding that I am finding helpful. The oven design is small and must be monitored personally but it has the detail for increasing size and adding a simple temp. controller to make it easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, full of errors","review":"This book has almost one error per page which is much too high for a technical book. It is unfortunate that the authors did not put in the effort to proof read the book and to check their solutions. It is interesting to note that the solutions on the web site are not consistent with the exercises in the book.I wonder how the authors authors keep their real jobs if their attention to detail is the same as demonstrated in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to solve backup mystries","review":"Good book to get a grasp on backup and recovery process for Oracle.

Cobb gave a better performance and his fellow actors. Hoffman's portrayal of the main character, Willie Loman leaves you with questions about what is actually going on. The play with Cobb is clear and to the point. I really enjoyed watching the play more and came away seeing why the play is such a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good I Spy book for treasure hunters","review":"Welcome to Smuggler's Cove! Here you will have to solve a bunch of riddles in order to find a hidden treasure.This book has realistic pictures to make it really look like you are in Smuggler's Cove. Please note that some of the objects blend in. For example, if you are looking for a thumbtack, the thumbtack is made to look like a satellite dish. Another oddity is that the duck pond is not only where ducks swim, but a pond that actually looks like a duck! There are also various destinations to look in, like the Treasure Chest store, the old barn, and Shipwreck Shore.Overall, 4 Stars. This book is a good book for treasure hunters. However, if you really want a treat, check out the I Spy Treasure Hunt computer game. It has a lot of cool new riddles, new destinations to explore, and best of all, 3 hidden treasures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The books seems to tell a story as a whole","review":"This I spy book is a bit different from others, in each page works together to tell a story as a whole.

It helps to occupy her students time when finished with assignments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Wrong Age Range","review":"I think the I Spy Series is Wonderful and Treasure Hunt has great pictures. My only negative is that the age range listed in Amazon is wrong, and even the 4-8 age range usually listed for this book should be a little higher, like 6-8. I have to admit that I have a hard time finding the pictures, so my 4 year old gets frustrated with this one.I think the Picture Riddles is a great one for 4 year olds to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun","review":"I spy books are absolutely fun for the whole family. Exercising your brain with your kids means a lot for you and them. My son is 4 and although he cannot find all of the objects he finds a lot of them. What I like about the books is the photography and how they made different views from the same place. Look for yourself. I also like the fact that you can put them up and get them out after time and start all over. I recommend them highly and plan on buying all of them over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and educational","review":"I bought this to read with my 5 year old godson. He loves all kinds of eye spy games. The images are all interesting and different and he loves the treasure hunter theme. I think it reminds him of the Pirates of the Carribean movies. His favorite I spy book is the Spooky one and then this one next."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ohio girl helps slaves find freedom.","review":"A sixteen year old Ohio farm girl in the years before the Civil War, Lucinda Spenser helps runaway slaves find freedom, yet at the same time, she wonders which of the two young men vying for her affections she should choose. Asked to stay at the farm of a widow and help her with nine fugitives hiding in the attic, Lucy, who wants adventure, readily agrees. She never even begins to imagine the danger she will face over the next month in a half, and the sacrifices she will make to save an infant from a life of slavery, or the new values she will learn. A touching, beautifully written novel, Katherine Ayres's moving tale, written in the form of Lucy's diary, will teach the reader valuable lessons about life, love, sacrifices, and the true meaning of freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book was direct and to the point. It was very inspirational and motivational to those who are seeking the Holy Spirit. It has given me a helpful insight on how to properly work with the seeking souls on the altar. This book is very moving and serves as a guideline for those who are currently altar workers and for those who are desiring to become altar workers. I highly recommend this book because not only does it serves as a tool for teaching, it is a keepsake."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York story of two upper-class sisters fighting over the same man in the 1900s....","review":"Really good, pacy read with excellent characterisation and a nice plot.

That will help 1000% better then high priced thermal grease."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just works.","review":"I know this is going to sound dumb/bold, but... JUST BUY IT. It does an amazing job keeping my CPU cooled down.Before I applied the compound, I would roughly get temperatures of around 45C to 50C, doing normal web browsing, such as Youtube, Facebook, etc. Now, since I applied it to my CPU a few weeks ago, I'm getting temperatures of roughly 23C to 45C-ish. (When I'm watching HD videos it goes around the 45C area) That's roughly 20C reduced while doing normal web browsing since I used the compound.So all in all, buy it. It works. It does what it says on the tin. For $7 it's totally worth it.I can tell that I'll be using this brand for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ensuring the life of my PS3","review":"I have an old fat PS3 and was beginning to become concerned about its age.

It had no packaging that indicated it was packaged by the manufacturer. Instead, literally just the tube/syringe was put into an envelope with nothing else. Those are not things that inspire one's confidence that one has purchased the real thing. I used it to replace the thermal paste on my PS3. If it overheats and fails, I'll know why. So far, seems ok, but then I'm not playing games on it--just using it for the bluray player for a movie every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never felt so good to grease up some smooth surfaces.","review":"Yea my laptop cooled down at least 5-10degrees C after applying a new coat. It really didn't have anything to do with AS5, but rather with the fact that some chinese worker decided to glob on a huge amount of grease on it during assembly. It's good for marketing because then the chips burn out faster.I'd give 5 stars if they would've just sent me like a crackball size amount instead of a whole eighth, as if I would need that much thermal grease in my lifetime. Like I said before, it's just good marketing. I only used like 0.1g, which is like a dabsworth. A 0.1g dab will take you really far out, man.I only give 1 out of 5 because I didn't even use 1/5th of 1/5th of 3.5g of robot smegma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did its job","review":"It cooled down my pc exactly like it was suppose to.

The syringe dispenser looks like it could carry an element of danger, but ultimately the worst it can do is leave grey glop on your fingertips. I guess that exciting thermal goop would be something that failed and made components explode in a shower of sparks and iridescent fumes, but after the novelty wore off it would get expensive and tedious to replace parts. I've never been able achieve this effect when using Arctic Silver, but it does a good job of keeping my machines cooled so I'll begrudgingly forgive the mundanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse performance than Cooler Master stock compound","review":"For my V6 GT I've been using the stock CM thermal compound. Temps got up to 80C or so at 4.6GHz @ 1.3V on my 2500K. 80C is a high limit for Ivy and Sandy Bridge, so I was interested in getting the \\"5-10C\\" drops other people are getting. The result: 10C HIGHER temps at idle and 3C HIGHER temps at load. I know AS5 has a LONG cure time, so I hope I can give it a better review after it cures. It's supposed to cure in 100Hrs or so, but review websites are finding it's more like 120Hrs+. Still, the stock thermal compound from CM has NO cure time, which makes it more valuable to me. If performance doesn't improve over the next week, I'll try reapplying and see where that gets me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"Its cheap and does the job that its intended to do.. nothing else to say.

To tell you the truth, I liked it so, so much, and I can't wait for the next one to be released. I've watched all of the volumes till now and I sure will keep buying the upcoming ones. I don't know, but I think that I like Tsukuchi to be with Tsukasa more than with Rui Hanazawa. I can feel that he loves her so much, though he is a spoiled brat who got used to always get what he wants. I want them to end up together, but we will never know till the end. Rui is a good guy but he is better off with the one he loved and I think that he still cares for her and that's why he refused Tsukuchi, though he implied that he did so because of Tsukasa, his friend since childhood.

Excellent features include long battery life, night illumination when needed, and a small footprint for travel. The single and the weekday alarms are nice. The loudness of the alarm increases as it sounds. The alarm pitch is excellent for my older ears; I cannot hear alarms on many electronic clocks (or watches).I found changing options complicated and unintuitive. Because months could elapse between these changes, I needed to consult the manual whenever I made them.Recently, its radio time-setting ability failed even though the WWV signal strength remains high.

I don't know what I was expecting, but this is just a plastic sheet that you are supposed to punch holes in yourself and fasten to your railing any which way you can. After struggling with this thing for about 20 minutes, I was not confident my crafty and relentless little one wouldn't just tear it up and slip through. Highly not recommended.

Upon attempting to install the product I discovered the product is EXTREMELY sharp along all edges. The product is not thick enough to be safe. There will always be a small gap between the product and the banister which little hands can fit through and would be cut severely. This is a very poorly designed product. All it is is a thin sheet of very sharp plastic with ties. You can find something better at a hardware store."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I would pass on this product at all costs.

Originally I was a little concerned that the plastic would look tacky, but I am glad I decided to try it. This product was reasonable, and looked as good as any other option that was out there for the purpose. You see that it is plastic if you look at it and see the shine, but it is better than having an option such as mesh (my previous, temporary solution). It took people to install it: one holding the roll tight, and the other person using hole punch and zip tying the plastic. The roll was too long, so we had to cut the plastic, which was a little struggle to cut straight. Overall I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for cats, too!","review":"We have a particularly clumsy cat who fell from our second floor loft onto the hardwood floor below. After an expensive trip to the animal hospital, we realized that we needed to put up something to keep her from falling again (she doesn't learn from her mistakes). Netting was not an appropriate choice because she would still be able to climb up. Plastic sheeting was the perfect choice because it was too slippery for our cat to climb. Knocking down the score to a 4 because it's a bit of a pain to install."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"I bought this hoping that it would look nicer than the nets that other stores have on the market. The plastic is really hard to work with, its very cumbersome, you have to punch holes into it to attach it to the railings, and the sheeting attracts dust and lint like you wouldn't believe. If you are dedicated, and will take the time needed to plan out how the guard will go up - you might be able to put this up so it looks decent. Otherwise, you probably want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kidsafe Banister Guard - a great solution for us","review":"We have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars. This was the perfect solution because you can place the tie-down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long, so they will fit around large or small bars. We had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with wouldn't reach, but it was very easy to do. I also like this product because it doesn't take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves the purpose but..","review":"We were initially surprised to see \\"just\\" a clear thick plastic sheet and a punch and some ties in the package.

Even the format of a chronicle of the narrator's year. WHAT A RIP-OFF! I would have put this book down already, but I might keep reading just so I can spot all the Bridget Jones material that has been stolen. It's almost like a game at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough substance","review":"Even for the chick lit genre, this book lacked substance. The entire book consisted of conversations in chic Boston locations - all the author did was tell us what happened. I never got to \\"know\\" any of the characters and was left feeling hollow. This wasn't as fun as I'd hoped. I would only recommend it if it's on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living as female Bostonians","review":"This novel is a quick read as Holly Chamberlin looks into the lives of a group of female friends living in Boston, living the single life. As reason and romance battle the mind of the main character, Erin, you live her life with almost an erie reality. The novel does not cover many topics, but always has something new intertwining within Erin's life. This novel includes everything from affairs with lovers to the psychological disorders emerged from family life as a child. It might be Holly Chamberlin's first novel, but it deserves a read, a few laughs, and a good reputation. I highly recommend diving into these girls lives when you just want to get away from yours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance and Reason","review":"Overall, this wasn't a terrible book. It was a fairly quick read so that was nice. Erin's relationship with Doug annoyed me first of all because he was a married man. She was never going to get what she wanted out of the relationship because he was already married. And also because he obviously wasn't good for her and didn't treat her right. However, I enjoyed reading about Erin's friends and their relationships.The main thing that annoyed me throughout the book was \\"Romance\\" and Reason.\\" In every chapter at least once (and often many more times) mixed in with Erin's thoughts were Romance and Reason. It started on page 3 \\"That was Reason.\\" It got old fast always reading the struggles of Erin's life through Romance and Reason.In general, it wasn't a badly written book. However, I didn't agree with Erin's moral standards and that made it difficult to read the book.I received this book for free from LibraryThing Member Giveaway in exchange for an honest review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it should.","review":"This is probably a bigger keyboard than I needed, since it has a handy \\"up-down\\" scale button on the side. The program does work very well and it's easy to record all your own tracks with a wide variety of sounds and instruments. I find myself manually changing the latency in the options a lot whenever I go between different pre-recorded noises, but otherwise it all sounds right, although personally I could go for a few more instruments and adjustments than offered. Also, for some reason there isn't a USB Stop option in my Windows for these devices, and when I went to unplug the USBs anyway, it blue screened me. So now I restart the comp after each session. Oh well. Session is still a fine program for those who wish to compile their own music without learning or playing any expensive instruments (other than one keyboard). It may not be as good as it could, but honestly I think it's the best in it's field that you can install on a PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice product","review":"Very fast shipment, works well with the Garage Band software, and the music sounds great.

I usually wear shirts like this every morning at the gym but felt the cut of this one was just strange. It just didn't feel right but that could have been the super-thin fabric. I don't think there is a cotton fabric any thinner than this one. Honestly, I could have bought this in China for $0.50. It is definitely not worth the rediculous Amazon price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very satisfied","review":"This shirt has a very strange cut and it fits awkwardly.

So, I sent it back. Either Delta needs to re-design the drill platform slots or they need to clarify that these vices Do Not fit their tables. I am sorely disappointed, a bit in myself after reading others' reviews warning about this problem, and in Amazon and Delta for misleading customers, incurring unnecessary operating expenses (that translate into higher prices for products!) and now being three weeks behind on my project schedule.

It's not even a close fit. I can't fault Delta or Rikon for this. I gave it a one star rating because of this and not because of the vise itself.

What happened to this company? they used to be THE name to buy and now they are just the same cheap chinese junk as all the rest. In retrospect I should have just saved myself the aggravation and $20 and bought the universal vise at Lowes. I mean, after all, its cheap chinese crap just like this one and it fits. The idiots that run this company should realize that there are people just like me out there that would pay double or even triple the price to get a well made, proper fitting piece of equipment made in the USA.

The bolt holes in the vise simply will not line up square w/ the slots in the drill press table. I can c-clamp it to the table of the press and it works fine, but no one wants to have to make such basic compromises with a brand new tool. I'm going to return it and look for the 4\\" vise instead.The two stars reflects my frustration with the false advertising, not the quality of the product. I agree with the prior reviewers regarding the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak design at quick release pin (see pictures)","review":"I purchased this vise because of the quick release. Turns out that is the problem with this vise. There is not enough material behind the quick release pin to support the pressure the vise can produce. See the pictures I uploaded at the top of product page to see how this vise broke at the quick release pin.The machining appears to be pretty good on this vise, but the casting is rough in a few spots. The rough casting was most obvious in the mounting slots, but it didn't cause any problems when mounting or adjusting the vise.I didn't get to use it long before it broke. I drilled around four test holes of different size in both wood and steel. It was straight and true for the short amount of time I was able to use it.Until they redesign the quick release pin I can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green frogs","review":"My favorite candy (and my kids' too).

Nabokov's ideas about \\"scudded feet\\" and \\"tilts,\\" while not adopted into the orthodoxy on scansion, are still read widely by the folks who study it, folks whose bibliographies led me to this little volume. It's worth a read, especially if one would like a witty, concise survey of the iambic tetrameter in English or a study of Pushkin's deployment of it in EUGENE ONEGIN.Those who arrive here as fans of VN's novels should steer instead towards SPEAK, MEMORY (his autobio) or LECTURES ON LITERATURE for their Nabokovian non-fiction. Imagine a joke written in French here. Happy hunting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Agree","review":"I read the reviews here as well as on other similar sites. I always thought that the 5 star reviews were just the author's family members pumping up the book just to increase sales. That is clearly not the case with \\"When the Dead Speak\\".

It seemed to be a selling point for the book, but she didn't use that characters \\"talk to the dead\\" trait as much as I thought. There were also a lot of characters to get to know, but you really didn't get to know them. I got confused with a few of the characters and who did what. So, an ok book, but not as \\"paranormal\\" as many other ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please - a good editor!?!","review":"Decent characters (if a bit predictable and trite by making them Lakota) good plot, decent writing but with foolish mistakes that stop the flow dead over and over.

How Sam Casey ever made it through the police academy is beyond me. She doesn't think anything through. The villains are smarter than she is. Jake seems more interested in Sam's mom Abby. The chapters are broken out strangely and there are some horrible grammatical errors.

My concerns are that the new one is super woobly (meaning the handle bars that i push her with). They feel like it will come loose. I have tried to tighten it and you can not tighten anything. My canopy is also crooked. I have tried several times to fix that.The bike is also very hard to turn. I have to really push down on it to turn a simple corner or just bare to the right a bit.

Enjoy and I wish you success in everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have Classic for Every Salesperson","review":"Any salesperson who's hit the wall, hit the bottom of the valley, or felt inadequate or incapable at any point in his/her career should RUN to the checkout with this book. There's no fluff, no \\"rah-rah\\" temporary emotional highs provided here. There are only sensible, honest answers to the very real problems we've all faced in developing a sales career.

Out of all the tips within this book, maybe only two would be helpful. Considering this book was published in the 80's, the methods used are mostly outdated (IMHO), it is 2010 now, 30 years later. The author of the book narrates what he does throughout his selling career which was probably sometime in the 1940's.If you're not selling life insurance, this book would do you little help.

For free, an old friend who's like a rubber ball when it comes to business. He kept bouncing back and is now doing brilliantly in his field. He passed on all his books to me and this is the first one of them I read.Put it on your \\"read it twice and make notes\\" list. Then read it a third time.He's engaging and delightful to read, in a charming olde worlde way. Lots of common but not so common sense. I can't think of a wasted chapter in the whole book. It's possible that it may be the only book on selling that you could need if you work for a company with a decent sales training program. Of course, if you are selling for yourself etc then you'll need other things too, and this should be on the essentials list.I'm also working through Dan Kennedy's No BS Sales Success and Moines Unlimited Selling Power-both excellent though the latter may not appeal to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aggravating !","review":"I've had nothing but bad experience with this phone.

It really is a fascinating way to kill a few minutes or a few hours and could conceivably be used as a decent historical reference. I was disappointed some of the sections are missing a number of pages but I am assuming they haven't survived the last century intact. I found the sections on tools and household utensils particularly fascinating, although the tool section is one missing pages, and the section on cameras and projectors is a very revealing look at what amounted to career choices at the turn of the century. Sears also had a way with advertising verbage which makes you think you'd not only be an absolute fool for ordering anywhere else, but you should actually send them more than the asking price.All in all an enjoyable, informative look at life a century ago.

A masterpeice of the battle between good and evil","review":"I found this book an excellent story, one that should go down in history as a classic.

My previous door button lasted a just one year, so on opening this my first impression was high as the metal plate looked quite good quality. To my utter disbelief, when I went to tighten the wiring, the button completely disintegrated in my hand.Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enduring Achievement","review":"The enduring accomplishment of this novel is the creation of Emile Poulquet, a fascinating character like no other in contemporary literature. Meidav boldly brings us into the mind of a functionary of the French occupation who cooly sent hundreds (?) to their death during World War II. Poulquet is repulsive at times, sly and funny at others, but he is never banal. She does not shrink from showing the extent of his ugliness, but she also makes her fugitive from justice oddly sympathetic. He is vulnerable, imaginative, passionate and horribly self-deluded. His justifications for his actions are comically absurd, but the exploration of his self-loathing is so penetrating, he comes to seem one of us, a very human monster. This is a courageous book; Meidav insists on moral complexity, and forces us to confront our own capacity for betrayal & cowardice. That she does so with great wit, brio and inventiveness makes Crawlspace delightful as well as sobering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning exploration","review":"Ms. Meidav has convincingly told the story of a man of another generation, another culture and another moral system. Each thought, feeling and moment presented to the reader is supported by genuine evidence, including recollection of past events. Those past events are often selected with such a keen sense of their significance and with such vividness that reading the novel has a wonderfully eerie quality.The novel ties into truths far beyond the words on the page and invites--almost compels--the reader to think. None of this is achieved at the expense of telling an interesting story that is unfolding in the present moment, and through this effective duality of past and present, the author achieves a meaningful exploration of morality, history, culture, the human mind, and most of all the human heart. It is a book worthy of reading more than once and its release in hardcover is an appropriate acknowledgement of its durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring the Monster","review":"I have been looking for a book which treats World War II in an original manner, and have found it in Crawl Space. In accessible but deep prose, Meidav (whose novel, The Far Field, about Sri Lanka, I also enjoyed even with its thick poetic language) sets forth on a journey which leads me to question my own sensibilities and assumptions, along the way giving me all sorts of interesting insights into France and various complexities related to war and memory and tribalism. I will recommend this book to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"I did quite a bit or reaseach on bagless vacuums beforeI decided to purchase this one. I was a little leary of the low price, when so many others were selling for $100 or more, but I was pleasantly suprised! I was especially concerned about it being powerful enough for stubborn pet hair. I am more than satisified with the power and performance. I had no idea how much cat hair was still left in my carpet after using my old vaccum. I had almost a full container just after sweeping one room. This vacuum also has an extra long cord, so it makes it handy when cleaning from room to room. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall value","review":"Got this vacuum because our old Panasonic was beginning to lose its life. Have to admit I have been pretty impressed. Like others it was amazing to see how much dirt and cat hair it pulled out of the rug...even after I went over the area with my old vacuum. Was easy to assemble, but looking at the instructions it doesn't seem it'll to be as easy to get to clogs etc. as with my Panasonic. You've got to unscrew some components. The vacuum is somewhat bulky and I wouldn't recommend it for cramped apartments or efficiencies. Just because it's bagless doesn't mean you lose thhe HEPA filter that will need to be periodically changed. It also has an internal filter that must be periodically cleaned. It's good that I kept my old vac for this purpose. Overall I think this is a good vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"it has been almost 3 months since i brought this one. its good. at the great price i got it its really worth the price..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad vacuum cleaner!

Used it approximately 4 times doing light vacuuming. The last time I used it, it emitted a burning smell, made a horrible noise and kicked off. It has never worked again. I have checked to make absolutely I didn't run over something, which I didn't. And of course, since I owned it for barely over 30 days, Amazon would not refund my money. THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF $90.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"this vacuum worked great when first purchaced, but after about 6 months it failed to pick up anything, I removed the brush and cleaned it, cleaned out both filters,and still, the vacuum would not pick up. the hose attachment still works very good, but not ideal for doing a entire carpeted area. very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum blows, but it doesn't suck!","review":"The first 10 to 15 times I used this vacuum, I LOVED it. Suddenly, it stopped working so well. I replaced the filters, and that did not help. The attachments would blow out while I was vacuuming, causing debris to fly into my face and all over the room. The contents of the \\"bagless\\" bag would literally blow back into the room. I do NOT recommend this vacuum BLOWER.UPDATE: For some reason, I can't change the \\"star\\" rating of this item, but after operating for some time on the vacuum, I discovered that there was a clog in the main hose. Removing the clog took forever. Thanks to clothes hangers and broom handles, I cleaned it out after working on it for about an hour. The vacuum is working great once again. I give it THREE STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for three months then nothing","review":"This vacuum was great for the first three or four months then it got worse and today just quit altogether- I kept the hoses cleaned out and the filter changed- I am disgusted-"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years and going strong","review":"With all the high-priced vacuums out there, it's nice to find an inexpensive, general-purpose vaccuum.

With it's long cord, it can reach mutiple rooms from one outlet plug. it is very powerful and does a better job than my previous sears brand vacuum. It does seem to run hot, but I've never had any problems nor have I experienced the so-called auto-shutdown when overheated.It's easy to clean the dust bin, but the hepa filter is another story. It's a little bit of a pain, and I cannot even find replacements being sold at amazon or on the internet. Overall a great vaccum at a bargain price."},{"rating":"1","title":"great-for 3 months","review":"This vacuum was great for about 3 months. I rely heavily on the attached hose. The hose is useless now. Had incredible suction in the beginning. It has hardly any suction at all now. Doesn't pick up much at all. I checked the passages and nothing appears blocked. Also, as I was vacuuming one day (not with the hose), the vacuum quit working entirely. I thought that was the end of the vacuum. After letting it sit for about 1/2 hour, it finally started back up. I guess it overheated. I've had other vacuums before and I've never had these problems before. I'm now on the search for another vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum to \\"Cool Greg\\"","review":"It's no wonder the vacuum stopped working after only 1 day.

The best part is, it's great on cat litter and pet hair. My Dirt Devil could never get all of it out my carpet. This vacuum gets it all.2 thumbs up for the superior SUCTION and sleek design from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think long term, dont get it","review":"I had this vacuum for over a year. The suction is fine, but over time the noise level has gotten unbearable. The cheap casing around the roller begins to vibrate making sounds as loud as a lawn mower. If you buy this, think long term.

Call it spriritual sit ups or creative exercise, but I call it just plain fun. I especially like the instructions on taking a mini-vacation.

The \\"tool\\" is only 7 1/2\\" long. Not sure where the weights came from but certainly NOT from this teeny tiny piece of junk!!!! It would be hard pressed to outweigh a Big MAC! Actuality is that it is a little dinky dresser that can be had from Harbor Freight for a third of the price. Additionally, the packaging was so OLD that it was thick with dust, crumbly, broken and had fallen apart in the shipping box!!! Other than that...not too bad I suppose? ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but....","review":"it only worked for about a month than started losing signal, beeping, display goes wacky. Replaced the batteries, reset the probes, did all the things you are supposed to do, but it kept going berserk. Returned to OSI for a replacement and the same thing happens. Can't recommend until they fix the problem. Suspect it is some cheap memory or poor circuits. Either way it is a BIG problem.It does look good however, and when it works, it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but consumes batteries.","review":"The temperature, humidity and atomic clock functions all work well on mine. I do recommend buying NMH rechargeable batteries for the base unit as it goes through regular alkalines quite quickly. Also, if you live in a climate with cold winters, the outdoor sending unit will sometimes not send a signal when it gets very cold. Lithium batteries seem to the best for the sending unit in cold weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oregon Scientific BAR898HGA","review":"This is a swseet system for monitoring the temperatures in 4 locations. I have the base unit in the study, one outside, one in the basement and one in the attic. The basement unit I use to monitor the humidity, as we have a lot of stuff stored there, and I want to be sure the dehumidifyer is set at the proper level. The attic unit I use to monitor the heat buildup in the summer to determine if I need to put in other cooling devices. The outdoor unit and the study unit have the obvious benefits. The system also maintains a perfect time that is set by the US satellite sytem, and so I adjust all other clocks and watches in the house to match this standard. I also view the base unit from time to time to see what the weather forecast is, but that is not its main use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little unit","review":"The setup was easy. Easy-to-understand user's guide. The satellite transmitter was within 1/2 degree of the main unit.The clock feature updated within 10 minutes of initial setup.The display is very easy to read with nice big numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"arrived promptly. Remote sensor senses fine. Main unit senses fine. They don't talk to each other, even at 6 inches. This is a rip-off. Customer service as Oregon Scientific is non existent. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Weather Station","review":"My weather station works great, everything seems to be dead on accurate. The remote sensor works further away then I thought it would, way out in our backyard. It's probably about 100 feet away and is outside the house. It doesn't have any problem with rain hitting it like I thought it might. Anyone who needs a weather station with the features this has will be happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go, Myra, Go!","review":"This is a very good Christmas CD!

It told of Bradman's early days, his rise through grade cricket and the sheffield shield and onto cricket for Australia. Follows him for the next 20 years as he came to dominate world cricket and become Australia's greatest son. Inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"These brake pads are legit. They bite down great without any effort at all. Soon as they make contact with the rim they grab on and literally stick to your rim. The color is a little off and look like a dull salmon color instead of bright. The pads seem very durable and made with nice materials instead of the hard stiff rubber most pads are made of. Feels like an eraser but more dense. I wouldn't recommend these for front brakes unless you want your face smashed into the ground. If your rim has bad braking surface and is wearing out then these will do the trick. Most brake pads I've owned in the past had bad wear both pad and rim. These pads have a more soft compound which won't do much damage to your rim. Overall, the best pads I've owned so far and if you don't mind the dull color then these are for you. (Although I wouldn't mind more colorways)."},{"rating":"1","title":"product designed by morons","review":"these are so screech loud regardless of the setup, caliper, type of rim etc. they are UNUSABLE. It is a black color in the photo with salmon color in brackets, how are we supposed to work out the color have you ever heard of red? you morons. If you believe other reviewers that these are great you will believe anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stopping power","review":"I love these things. They were simple to install correctly. I had no trouble with them squealing, and they stop beautifully on my old aluminum rims. I bought the salmon ones. Even though some people say they don't last too long, I've had them a year almost now, and have put over 3,000 miles on them. I am fairly sure that I\\"ll make it through the winter on these before I have to replace them. I'll definitely be buying another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent brake pads","review":"Excellent brake pads, I used these to replace Tektra P453 and these work much better. The brake pads did not fit my front brakes because of low clearance between the fork and rim on m bike, no fault of the brake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanastic set of replacements","review":"You only get 2 in the pack so you need to order 2 pairs if you want them for your entire bike. My front ones were just about shot and I heard good things about these. They were a little bigger than my normal set but they still fit in just fine. It took a little to get them to fit in correctly though. But now all is well. These pads are such an improvement over the stock ones I had. They are almost completely silent when your braking it's unbelievable. Haven't test in the rain but I am sure they will do tons better since they are made for rain. Couldn't be happier with them. The red color looks awesome with my bike too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little dry, but worth the effort!","review":"This is perhaps one of the best refernece books on what is acutually going on when a ball is struck on the pool table.Koehler has decent organization, clear examples, and perhaps too much in the way of genuine scientific analysis in this book. But it is still one of my favorite refernces when trying to understand what I need to do to make the cue ball and object balls move in a specific way.Without a doublt it belongs in any serious player's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those Who Need To Know HOW and WHY","review":"Many pool players are instinctive and natural, but for those of us who need to know WHY and HOW things work in order feel that we've mastered our understanding, there is absolutely no better source than this book for understanding the game of pool. I've read it twice, some of it three times or more. I return to it often, not just for technical help but because in reading it I am able to digest anew the \\"wisdom\\" it contains.I've played pool for forty years. I have a thorough understanding of the game. I've read lots of books about pool. This, for me, is the best available. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comprehensive but technical","review":"The book is very comprehensive going into a lot of detail and at times is very technical. There are lots of tables and statistics. However, it does a great job of explaining how the various aspects of the game impact the outcome of each shot. Things like cue ball and object ball movement, best cue stick positions for type of shot, how english and top and bottom spin impact cue ball placement, and much more. If you focus on the less technical aspects taught in this book you will come out with a much better understanding of how to shoot better pool. I'm still reading it but have learned alot and I consider myself a better than average pool player already. It is at times tough reading but you can get into it as deeply as you desire and several readings over time will glean more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no such thing as Too Much Information","review":"I'm a data junkie. This book is loaded with detailed analysis of how shots work, what are the permissible errors (by degrees of angle) to make LOTS of shots, and literally a ton of information that can be assembled to clear a given rack with the best chance of success. If you have EVER had trouble choosing the best shot available, read this book. That problem just won't come up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for a Pool-Loving Loved one","review":"I bought this for my fiance's birthday- it was one of the highest priority items on his wishlist. It is a big book- about the size of the average college textbook- and he read it straight from front to cover in the matter of a few weeks. He believes that it has really taught him a lot and that he has been playing better (and he was already very good) since he'd started reading it. In summary, this is a fantastic gift for the avid pool player in your life, as long as they are the type willing to sit down and do some reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket Billiards From a Different Angle","review":"As other reviewers indicated this book approaches pocket billiards from a scientific perspective which to me is good. There are many detailed graphs and tables which certainly no one is expected to memorize. However, these aids give you a good visual feel for what to expect as the many variable of the game come into play. One area that this book covers in detail is collision-induced throw which comes into play with every shot that has ball english on it. Graphs show the throw angle under all different kinds of conditions. This book covers all aspects of the game and has brought out some shooting techniques that I did not find in other sources. However, like any subject one should not limit their learning materials to a single source as there are several good books that covers this subject. But do add this book to your collection as it is complete, detailed, and has great graphical representations of what is being described in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"covers everything","review":"Great for any skill level. Covers the physics of the game in a way that dose not make you more confused than when you started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on Zen","review":"I was waiting for this classic of Zen to be back in print --- and it is even better than before! It used to be the best book on the meaning and purpose of Zen and actually doing Zen practice, and now it is even clearer, so I can really recommend it for everyone from beginners to adepts. And I'm glad they changed the illustrations. Also great new prefaces. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Thought Provoking","review":"I just started my second read of this \\"collection of dialogues\\".

I tend to have a hard time understanding, or I should say, follow a lot of the books written about Zen. Mainly because of the translation between languages.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Zen's Finest Explanation","review":"Uchiyama was one of the great modern Zen teachers, and maybe the best example of the \\"nothing special\\" type of Soto Zen. If you want a glamorous, esoteric book about Zen heroism this is not for you. If you want a rational, graceful, peaceful explanation of what Zen meditation is and what it can do for your life, please buy this book. Also search on google for Uchiyama's teacher's writings, Kodo Sawaki - another of the great Buddhist teachers that the west knows very little about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!!!","review":"This bracelet is not worth it!!I usually never leave comments, but when i saw the price for such a simple bracelet i had to say my opinion!If it actually took talent to make this bracelet, then yea i would say you should pay 40 bucks for it. But it doesnt! All it is, is random colorful beads through wire, there is no weaving or color scheme to this at all. Those beads are even cheap. I make bracelets all the time and i actually use a pattern and have to weave through to make a beautiful work of art. Please if you want something like this just go to a bead store and buy what you need there! It will save you $10 and you can make it your own!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Bracelet","review":"I bought this a few months ago, and I wear it almost daily. It matches EVERYTHING, and I always receive compliments on this bracelet. The only downside is that I work at a computer for 12-hours a day, and sometimes the pointy parts of the crystals dig into my arm. Nothing that a little shake of the arm to adjust the bracelet can't fix though. Definitely a must-buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice :-)","review":"The necklace is lovely :-) I also got the matching earrings & Bracelet.It's not heavy @ all very lite. All are so shiny...

The warning about the volume reducing once you take it out of the package can't be seen until you've already done so.

When I say very realistic, I dont mean you have all kinds of ships to choose from and the explosions are almost real. I mean realistic as in to launch just one torpedo, first you have to go to the weapons screen, select the type of torpedo you want, order the torpedo loaded, presurize the tube, lauch the torpedo, and once it has exploded muzzle the tube. I came from Jane's fleet command so I was expecting something that you could have an all out brawl. But its really like you are in command, in the Navy for reals. Took me sometime to get used to. One thing that I really didnt like is you only have about 20 or so ships you can control, unlike Fleet command's 50+. However each ship has much more detail to it. After I learned how to play I really do like the game. It takes a lot of patience however. One wrong move and your detected and dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work even in compatibility mode.","review":"I can not get past a black window and the app crashes have tried everything I can think of to get the game to work.

I have been on many, many ships and when comparing those to the books descriptions, estimate there may be in the HUNDREDS of errors in the complete book. The ratings are also very uneven, as the author fell into their own trap of trying to use a very sophisticated rating system and then fails to apply it evenly. For example, one ship with small cabins claims that they are all \\"suites\\", and he points that out, whereas with another ship and the same situation he does not. This 600+ page mess, along with the arrogant \\"ultra expert\\" tone, when in fact I don't think this guy has been on most of these ships ever, really does make Berlitz Publishing a ship of fools."},{"rating":"1","title":"the ships are not taveled on without notice points only","review":"being a regular cruiser from the u/k . i read all the guides avidly and compare them. the berlitz guide cannot be taken seriosly// by regular cruisers// for example the paul gauguin is rated 6star by every book and magazine except berlitz they say 4star why i do not believe they go on half these ships"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent reference for experienced and new cruisers","review":"gives the information necessarty to compare cruise ships"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little bowls","review":"I have been looking for ramekins to bake in the oven for a while.

The remaining half of the sticker says the dish was made in China. Nothing in the item description on Amazon says \\"made in China.\\" The seller's attempt to conceal the fact makes me suspicious that the dishes may not be safe for food use. There may be lead or other toxins in the glaze, or some other problem. (Remember the poisonous Chinese drywall after Hurricane Katrina? If not, Google it.)

I noticed many people having trouble with the stickers - they should put them on the box and not on the dishes, but I work with adhesives and the first tool you go to to remove something that is put down with adhesives is heat. Get the heat gun or blow drier. Gently heat and pull on the label until it starts to give and it will come off with the adhesive intact. Don't pull the paper off first and try to get the adhesive off with the heat - the idea is to remove the adhesive still attached to the paper label.

I'm into all the main heavy bands, with Slipknot & Metallica being my favourite, as well as scandinavian bands such as Soilwork, In Flames, The Haunted etc... and I can honestly say that both Mnemic albums are two of the best I've bought in years! From the first song on Mechanical right thru to the last one on Audio, I can't say there's one bad song! The music is plenty heavy which I love, and the singing is both heavy and melodic (soilwork style). Also the lyrics are intelligent, unlike many bands now who string ridiculous lyrics together just cause they rhyme! Mnemic are a coming force! Can't wait for their next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial Metal That Delivers","review":"I first heard of this band last year when I saw the video for \\"Liquid\\" on Uranium. I caught interest for the band, and I was looking forever to find a downloadable version of the song. It didn't occur to me until I got a CD sampler with In Flames, Mnemic, Raunchy and Ektomorf tracks. Boy, I was happy! In October, when this CD came out, I bought yet another CD sampler with \\"Deathbox\\" on it. \\"Deathbox\\" blew me away. Other great tracks are \\"Dreamstate Emergency\\" and \\"Door 2.12\\". This whole album is a must if you are a fan of Fear Factory or Meshuggah, and I am a fan of both bands. No wonder I love this CD so much. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mnemics Best Effort","review":"Recent In Flames meets Fear Factory, this is my take on it. These guys aren't anything close to Meshuggah, the drums come nowhere close at least, i could see how the vocals could sound like Meshuggah thats about it. Anyway, i'm a long time supporter of Fear Factory, and i must say the clear spots in the vocals are impressive and are accurate to a Burton C. Belle comparison. Anyway, catchier riffs and drumwork in this one, you can even hear basslines on occasion. The production and musicianmanship are better on this release than there last album and the mixing is well done. After listening to Mnemic's 2003 release \\"Mechanical Spin Phenomena\\" i wasn't very impressed. That album sounds like a more brutal early Static-X spinoff. This record has a more Mnemic trademarked sound, that i could get used too. If you like these guys you'll probably like Bleed the Sky, Fear Factory, or Sybreed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Listening Experience","review":"If you wanna rock out to some Ear Drum Pouding Metal, this Cd is for you! Amazing 3D sound Techniques Blows your Freakin mind. especially on the intro to Deathbox. they're the first band to use this effect I believe.

RELEASE ANOTHER GREAT CD!All in all Buy it! dont download, you dont get the 3D effects!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is real metal folks","review":"Hailing from Denmark, Mnemic is a prime example of what the future of metal could be, and with these guys in the mix, the future looks very bright. This isn't nu-metal or aggro-rock a la Korn or Linkin Park, Mnemic combines hard death metal riffs with engaging harmonies and sweeping choruses to create something truly special. Songs like \\"Door 2.12\\", \\"Illuminate\\", and \\"Overdose in the Hall of Fame\\" are great tracks, while \\"Dreamstate Emergency\\" is amazing to say the least. If you are a fan of old Meshuggah or Fear Factory, I strongly recommend picking up Mnemic's \\"Audio Injected Soul\\", it's just the right metal fix you need, and it will help you remember just what real metal is."},{"rating":"1","title":"very funny","review":"Another side project from the ever prolific singer from Wheatus, This one finds him in very funny satanic black metal form, made hysterical by things like white denim jeans and pentagram trucker hats that are great satire on the genre, Very funny stuff and hilarious vids, not really much for repeat listening though as the tunes are a bit like if linkin park produced a Fear Factory record, but funny as all his projects are. Again though with his sides, no greats like teenage dirtbag to really grab onto."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"Save your money....does nothing in the case of a difficult school district.

By the time I got it dressed enough to use it, it was half gone. In actual use sharpening planer blades, it turns to powder so quickly that it takes about an eight of an inch of stone to sharpen one side of one blade. Since the blade travels across the lower 3/4 of the wheel, this leaves an eighth inch raised area in the center, which automatically dulls the blade at the same time you are trying to sharpen it. Considering the cost of the stone and the cost of planer blades, you come out even at best, so it is better to buy new blades rather than go through the mess and frustration of trying to use this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grinder Wheel","review":"Prompt delivery and as advertised quality.

The Delta 23-712 works OK, but the 8 inch wheel is useless.It simply disintegrates.

It's by far the greatest language product I've ever come across. Russian is also amazing and the best. I highly recommend Pimsleur to people but the Swedish product is not up to the standard of the others.It's of course the great Pimsleur method but it is too short and doesn't nearly cover the amount of material that would be covered in 10 lessons of the Spanish course... The middle 4-5 lessons have you saying \\"I want something to eat\\" or drink non-stop over and over and over again... It's ridiculous how little you learn in the middle 50% of this product.There were so many more useful verbs and things to be covered and half the product is wasted on saying you want something to eat. It gets incredibly annoying and then picks up the learning pace towards the end in a way that should have been maintained throughout. Overall not terribly useful or well planned."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality... unacceptable","review":"The silver on these is not a woven Celtic silver knot. The silver is die cut, thin, almost foil thin. The silver is poorly worked to make it look as though it is a knot, but there are many rough spots. the welding of the know to the stone setting is uneven. And caution, because it doesn't jump out at you from the product description, the stones are synthetic.The metal is stamped 925 (for sterling, but the workmanship is so bad I question whether this stamp is accurate). The ear wires are also stamped 925.Product is labeled \\"Made in Thailand.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Yes I know it is only $20 for these earings but I've bought much cheaper earings that are better quailty then these.

The earrings shipped promptly, and looked so good, I am tempted to keep them! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the silver part isn't exactly \\"square\\" (that is, they look more handmade than cut by a machine). But they are great looking and for the price, you can't beat them.

I agree with someone who posted earlier that the flat back of the earrings sometimes shows (particularly true if you have short hair). The good news is that the backs of the earrings aren't ugly or anything. Just flat and not pretty. I, too, wish the earrings had been designed more solidly (and more three-dimensional), but for this price, what can you expect? They are pretty, and they are a nice length.

The Immigration of the Body Snatchers-Pod people take over and Homer tries to convince them they are here and not crazy.4.

Little Shop of Homers-Killer Homer plant.Pretty good book overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmm... Donuts","review":"I think this book was really funny. I really liked Homer Simpson's Halloween Carols. He is my favorite cartoon character. I guess the funniest part is, when the Simpsons were watching Kent Brockman talking about a plant that eats donuts, and Homer said \\"Mmmm... Donuts.\\" That was pretty funny. Another funny scene was when everyone in Springfield found out this was just a comic book, and they didn't really exist. Homer said \\"If I don't exist, can I still eat donuts?\\" That one cracked me up. I guess, now, you can see why I like Homer Simpson so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Was looking for a new author to read and found Truman.

His voice is poetic and his lyrics will touch your soul. I thought Ortega's last CD, \\"This Bright Hour\\" was special, but \\"The Breaking of the Dawn\\" is even more special. All of the songs on this CD are excellent, but the (2) that stand out are: \\"Margee Ann\\" a song about his wife and \\"Jesus, King of Angels\\" which has lryics that are very moving. The only problem with this CD is it ends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put into words..","review":"I have all of Fernando's cds and there's not a weak one in the bunch. They are all a masterful combination of praise songs and secular, all magnificently performed and produced. He is a genius with word pictures; a terrific lyricist, song writer and arranger. I especially appreciate the harmony vocals that appear on nearly every track. Fernando is an evangelist to be sure, creating albums (cds) that praise but also seek to draw in the unchurched. He nearly always closes the deal with an ending song that tells of his love for his savior, Christ Jesus. It's really about as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I bought this cd more than 10 years ago. It is timeless and stunningly beautiful. Lovely,lovely worship music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good acoustical music","review":"This is quiet, sometimes contemplative, sometimes rejoicing, music. Though the road song is more upbeat, the whole album isn't fast-paced. \\"Lord of Eternity\\" and \\"Breaking of the Dawn\\" are great songs, worthy of memorizing. I enjoy this artist and will buy another album sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Disappoints!","review":"I was introduced to Fernando Ortega by a friend a few years ago. I consistently turn to his music for his truth and melodic songs. They are deep, but simple. I especially love the harmony provided by various female artists such as Susan Ashton. Recently, I purchased Nicholle Nordeman's CD for the song \\"Small Enough\\", which features Fernando. Try his music out for the honesty of God's love for us all. As stated in Phil 4:8-9...\\"...whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-- if anything is excellent or praiseworthy -- think about such things...And the God of peace will be with you.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed and will not order this again.#1: The notebook I received was white (not black like the picture) and had a big black \\"Xtreme\\" logo in the bottom right hand corner.

The edges bend very easily and lead to very ragged corners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Suitcase","review":"This is a very good book about the refugees from the Bosnia war. The authors have a collection of thoughts, poems, and stories from the refugees that were driven away from their homes. The horrible living conditions some had to go through were horrifying. The thoughts and stories make you feel what they have went through. It is very touching and moving from what the refugees have to say. You can tell the authors put a lot of work into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially Very Dangerous","review":"This is the story of a very arrogant doctor who quits his medical practice because of what his \\"Inner Teacher\\" told him. This could be a sign of psychosis. Nowhere in the books is the distinction between psychosis and psychic ever made. Perhaps Joy does not want his readers and potential students to know the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy's Way is a great read!","review":"Interesting from both the evolving perspective to a 'how to' to make it real; a skill we all have but must awaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kundalini Crisis","review":"In her book, \\"Energies of Transformation\\", Bonnie Greenwell, Ph.D., describes the experiences described in \\"Joy's Way\\" as a Kundalini crisis. She also interviewed many of Joy's former students who were experiencing a Kundalini crisis. \\"Energies of Transformation\\" originated as Bonnie's Ph.D. thesis and I consider it scientific proof that Brugh Joy's conferences are highly effective at beginning a Kundalini crisis. Avoid Brugh Joy like the plague!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Mr. Joy combines a tale of his own personal spiritual journey with fairly mainstream yogic ideas concerning body energy, chakras, spiritual plane, etc. I found this book to be a very interesting read. Mr. Joy writes in a clear language that probably relates back to his training as a medical doctor. In terms of spiritual path, this book is not as \\"beginner\\" as The Celestine Prophesy.I do not understand the views of a couple of the other reviewers here regarding the \\"voice\\" heard by Mr. Joy...a voice could be loosely interpreted as our intuition or subconscious or even a spirit guide.Personally, I regret not having taken one of Mr. Joy's seminars; he is now on a two year sabbatical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vikings Sign","review":"Very cute for a guys room.

If you are uncertain about purchasing this movie because it is not too well known, let me tell you, it is a GREAT film! For what is basically a low budget film I was very impressed with the production values, acting, and historic authenticity shown in this film. Eonough character development so you cared about the 3 soldiers presented, yet not so much that it sowed the film down at all. Just enough action too. I would say that this is the best WWII movie that I have watched since Saving Private Ryan. I HIGHLY endorse this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For a war movie, this is beautifully done!","review":"I do not like war movies! I loved this one! The acting was great, the storyline was great (based on a true story), and the script was very sensitive and emotional! I recommend it to anyone who likes a good story beautifully told. Not full of bad language, or crude mannerisms, or horrifying shots! Very tastefully done! I am an older woman, and I do not like most war movies because they think they have to be crude and use bad language. Not even close to an R rating! I recommend it to all those with weak stomachs for the average war movies! This one is way above average!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible WWII movie!","review":"I watched this movie and was totally disgusted by how fake and unrealistic it was.First, there are no mountains in the area of Normandy where the Allied Forces parachuted in. The terrain in the movie looked more like parts of California than France.Second, Hollywood directors don't know jack about the military. Soldiers don't bunch up in a group and fire on the enemy. And they don't fire standing up or kneeling down. They lay down in the prone position to avoid being shot. These actors were just that. Acting. And not acting very well.Finally, US soldiers didn't save Germans during D-Day by letting them live to fight another day. For the most part they were under orders to not take prisoners.Overall, this was a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the Band of Brothers theme but was so badly written and directed that it is more of a comedy than a drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap tops, about half of the bottle tops already broke!","review":"I bought these bottles for holding beauty products that I make with essential oils. If you screw the cap on tight (so The oil doesn't leak!) the tops of the bottles crack. These are very cheaply made and are quite expensive. I will not purchase these again.

My advice, look elsewhere!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caps are too fragile for use","review":"I bought these to use for pure oregano oil, which is very potent. I couldn't tighten the caps sufficient because they would crack. As a woman of a certain age, I don't have the strongest hands, but I still managed to crack every third cap while tightening them. I would not recommend buying them if a tight seal is important to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unimpressed","review":"The caps are a deal breaker for these bottles. The actual glass bottle is a nice product. Nice blue colour, nice weight, etc. But the lids are absolute rubbish. If you even slightly ove tighten the lid, the entire side of the plastic lid splits up the middle rendering it useless. The lids are made of soft, brittle material that splits apart very easily. Why did I slightly over tighten? Because liquid was leaking out of the top like crazy! If these bottles are going to be casually used for thick things like oils, and will always remain upright, they will work. If not, don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and touching","review":"I totally disagree with the editorial review here. The illustrations are sweet and the story adorable. I was saddened to see it was out of print, as my one copy is so worn out from use. My three girls have loved this story since they got it years ago. It has such a good lesson, that no matter how busy the Mommy is, she (as Mrs. Gigglebelly, anyway) always has time for her little girl, so long as the girl is patient. And the first time each of my daughters found out that Mrs. Gigglebelly was really the mother in disguised, was priceless. In my opinion, this book is a classic.

The chocolate is above average quality for covered pretzels, but there isn't a heavy coating, which is a minus in my book.

If they would just add a bit more chocolate coating they would get 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"How anyone could eat this is beyond me","review":"The chocolate that they use on these things taste like they have been sitting out for a few weeks and have grown stale.

I was a little disappointed to find that at least 5 of the recipes could be found in my other two cook books by her. However, being a big fan I'd have to say that is my biggest complaint. Otherwise, I've never taken home any leftovers when I bring one of her desserts to potlucks or work and always get asked for the recipe. I'm pretty well rounded as a cook so if you like to \\"create\\" fresh desserts from scratch, this isn't the book for you. There's a lot of desserts made from convenience foods (cake mixes, prepackaged cookie dough, etc). It works out for me though because I get great results with little effort...(important when you work full time and have a little baby!). My advice would be to start with her other two cookbooks first and buy this one last."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. There were very few photos (16 pages of photos for 120+ recipes). I expected higher class recipes from a restaurant (less use of canned Pillsbury biscuits, brownie and cake mixes, jarred ice cream topping, frozen whipped topping, and saltines).

Of course there will be all the predictable criticisms, charging that Berger is causing arguement. The reality is, however,that when it comes to the great desecration to G-d's name and the great embarassment the messianic Jews have caused and are causing to Judasim makes these criticisms foolish. No one ever said that there will be an arguement with Jews for jesus, we dare not criticise them.

He hasn't. my question to him is: if you don't want to do outreach that's one problem, but to slander a group that does???

He is creating a negative stereotype of a movement that does great acts. He is degrading a man of great stature,a man who brought many great things to this world, only to try to elevate himself. It is a shame that during such troublesome times as these, a man such as David Berger tries to split people appart, and cause much animosity and hatred towards fellow Jews. I am just an Orthodox Jew, but seeing all of the great acts preformed by the Chabad movement can not just sit back and watch such lies be said about Chabad-Lubavitch and their esteemed leader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of hatred","review":"I couldn't even complete the book for I was so disappointed with the lack of true research. The book is biased and full of hatred. It is so obvious that the author had a bone to pick with Orthodoxy and didn't spare them.Chabad-Lubavitch with the Rebbe as the powerful leader and teacher is known worldwide for it's kindness and compassion, not only for all Jews but for all humanity. Encouraged by the lubavitcher Rebbe, the followers of this movement give up the luxuries and comforts that come with living in close-knit communities with all amenities required by their lifestyles just to reach out to others, helping them,encouraging them, supporting them and guiding them towards a meaningful life.The author ought to be ashamed and embarrassed of his lies and lack of true sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis-information and Bashing a True Jewish Community","review":"B\\"HDr Berger's book does not accurately describe Lubavitch nor the Messianic prophesises which the Rebbe himself stated. His accusations of the Meshichisten are totally false as no normal Mechichist belives the Rebbe is G-d. Certainly, no Lubavitcher has the Rebbe's picture on the eastern wall of any room. The Rebbe's piety and unswerving committment to Torah True Judiasm is well-documented and anyone who slanders the name of this great Tzaddik will have to deal with Hashem after 120 years. May Dr Berger do Teshuva before Moshiach comes with the Emes. To compare the Rebbe, a Gaon and Tzaddik, to a Rasha who tried to destroy the Torah and caused 2000 years of grief and pain to Jews is unforgiveable. It is well-known that many our later-day Gaonim including Rav Aharon Soloveitchik and Rav Moshe Feinstein had only the greatest respect for this Torah giant.

However, I believe that the most fundamental concept in Judaism is Love Thy Neighbor, a law that Dr. Berger violates with cruel intent throughout this meticulously researched book.

The Torah teaches us that we must practice love and unity. I am sure Mr. Berger has learned the statement Rabbi Akiva said in the Talmud, \\"Love your fellow as you love yourself. This is the main rule of the Torah.\\"This book represents the opposite of that statement.Would you like this to be done to you, Mr. Berger?I believe Mr. Berger should spend more time on writing books that help grow, not destroy. He may try to convince you that he has written this book to \\"help\\" the Jewish people from this terrible danger called \\"Chabad\\", but the truth is, is that this book is only a revelation of his innate hatred to the Lubavitch movement and its followers.I urge all readers to focus on unity and love for one another.With acts of goodness and kindness, you can be sure that you will hasten the coming of the Messiah, may he come NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the ego of a man can blind a person","review":"David Berger, a man looking to \\"make it big\\" in the Jewish world has found yet another culprit.

Chabad is one of the greatest orginizations today in america. If chabad was really so bad, then we would'nt have the president of the USA coming to our canlde lightings, or have senators attending our ceremonies, Or be able to put on tefilin on jewish statemen.

Dr. Berger's book is a reactionary academic version to classic Lubavitch hatred. To be brief, here are 2 facts:1.Two monumental Jewish authorities) write that a Messiah from the dead is a theoretical possibility, the author of the Sde Chemed, an encyclopedic canvassing of Jewish law, the Abarbanel, one of the greatest commentators on the Prophets and Jewish thought ever. Both were Sefardic, having no connection to Chasidim. Dr. Berger by making this accusation, accuses these great men of being heretics as well.2.Two modern-day rabbinic authorities, Rav Ahron Soloveitchik and Rav Pinchas Hirshprung, have condemned these accusations. Dr. Berger accuses these modern-day holy men of being heretics as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real Surprize from Professor Berger","review":"Unsurprisingly enough, Prof. Berger spared no talent nor time in writing this highly controversial book, dealing with one of the most (if not the most) famous, and productive groups of Chassidim in the world today.Creating the uproar and ripple effect as it did, I decided to purchase the book for myself. Don't we all have a spark of Curious George in us?I was shocked beyond words when I read the first few chapters, which dilate on nothing more than hate, and (although intriguing, however) unnecessary spiteful information, about what I consider the MOST productive and helpful orginization in the world.The content of the book is not only Halachacly imbalanced, (and these issued were addressed to Prof. Berger by very prominent Rabbis), but also ignominious, as it tries to 'undo' all the good that this group has done for the world in the past, preset, and what this group will hopefully continue to do in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed....","review":"My son is a train fanatic, and that's why I chose this toy for one of his Christmas gifts.

Bittersweet Revenge is certainly a departure from Ms. James' first novel Viking's Princess, which was almost fairy-tale-like in its innocent simplicity. BR is quite dark and stormy, a mood that is reinforced by the ancient setting and turbulent time period. Although I liked Viking's Princess for its light-hearted humor, I appreciate Bittersweet Revenge more for its depth of character development, really focusing on the interaction between two individuals from opposite worlds, drawn together by a force more powerful than social and political pressures.

But subsequent listens grabbed me. This is a great album! I can't even point my finger on it but there is something really enjoyable and infectious about this music. I've been listening to quite a bit of the other, mostly 70's, Tull albums and this one is refreshing for a change of pace when I discovered it recently. This was an album I wrote off before I ever listened to it, big mistake. Ian proves he can master the more electronic and synth influenced music and make it work- and work well. Kind of funny, but after listening to Under Wraps for a while, the other Tull material is what sounded 'different' and a bit off. Its all good but give Under Wraps a chance, look past some of that 80's vibe and you'll find some great timeless music. Just give it a couple of listens before you pass judgement..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jethro goes Techno","review":"There may, in fact, be something in this album to enjoy. Unfortunately, this album consists primarily of over emphasized kick base and a snare drum tuned to emulate a tambourine. Buried deep behind these two dominating sounds is Ian Anderson's voice and little else. The flute is seldom used and the synth is used more for noise than for ethereal sounds. The music must be played softly, as the dominant noises quickly become overpowering. While Michael Jackson's \\"You Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" shows how effectively a beat can be incorporated within a song, \\"Under Wraps\\" is, as a whole, just bad mixing.As a long time Tull fan, I am truly sorry that I purchased this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"jethro tull","review":"While I dont really like this lp, Im going to give Tull a pass on this one. I dont know what it was about the eighties, but so many good groups put out horrible records. I guess it was the advent of computers and synthesizers that groups felt pressure to put that sound into their music. Big mistake for a classic rock outfit like Tull. Just pass on this one and pick up something from earlier on in the catalog. This lp sounds like a cheesy movie soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I'm a Tullie.

(I've bought SFTW three times.) The cover art of \\"Under Wraps\\" has always intrigued me, but the reviews always scared me off. Well, it wasn't as scary as it was cathartic to finally hear what has to be the worst Jethro Tull album ever. Every band has one, and this is theirs. It is Ian's version of eighties electronica music, a genre that I'm sure he felt he needed to explore at the time, but a genre which is the opposite of his strengths as an artist and composer. If you listen to their album \\"A\\", you can hear a more successful and finessed style of synth-dominated songs. If you really like \\"A\\", you may appreciate the sound of \\"Under Wraps\\" more than I. I need to hear the acoustic instruments and natural themes of classic Tull when they sound like Tull and not the flavor of the times. But, hey, an artist has to experiment to stay interested so no problem, Ian! Thanks for all the amazing music, mate."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars...not all bad","review":"Sounds extremely dated...drum machine gets on my nerves...there are some good songs though and probably would sound good live and done with real drums...some interesting keyboard work and some guitar passages shine...I didn't know Frasier's brother Niles was a member of Tull !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap","review":"I'm a huge Tull fan, and I even really like some of their work that has been less than well-received ( such as \\"A\\" and \\"Broadsword and the Beast,\\" but \\"Under Wraps\\" is undoubtedly the most unimpressive collection of nonsense they have ever released. I bought it because I have been slowly collecting all the remastered Tull, but as I listened to it for the first time, I found myself realizing that I would probably never listen to it again - any of it. It will probably also be the one CD that I own that I will not load into my iPod, because honestly I never want to hear any of it again.

Underwhelming.","review":"As someone who loves the \\"Songs from the Wood\\" and \\"Broadsword and the Beast\\" sections of the Tull catalog, it's probably not stunning that I was less excited by \\"Under Wraps,\\" with its excessive (and frankly, rather tepid) electronica. Having adored \\"Broadsword\\" and its evocative textures, I pounced on this album immediately after release, but ultimately it just leaves me cold. There are always great moments in a Tull album, and \\"Under Wraps\\" certainly has a few, but ultimately the memorable is outweighed by the annoying. If you liked \\"A\\" -- and I'm in the middle of the road there, feeling that the players were better than the material -- you might find something in \\"Under Wraps\\" to like, but there are at least 15 better places to start where Jethro Tull is concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars were a gift.","review":"I have been working through Jethro Tull albums for a while now, starting at the oldest and working my way to the most recent.

It was really that bad.I know a lot of fans dislike A. And while I too found it to be a bit of a curveball, I grew to love it. Under Wraps I just could not bear to listen to. I tried once or twice, but ultimately, had to shelve it. The only redeeming aspect that earned it 2 stars was the track Under Wraps #2.

Ballistic Kiss is another attempt to revive or prolong the genre, and it apparently failed. Like many HK movies in the genre and befitting its title, Ballistic Kiss is over-loaded with bullets but suffers from a thin plot. However, if it did not succeed in becoming a great film, at least it was a good try. The movie is simply STYLISH. It has great visuals, every frame is masterfully shot, scene transitions are smooth, and the sound track is unusually good for a HK movie.Donnie Yen directed, starred in the film, and choreographed for the action scenes. An ambitious filmmaker, he managed to give the film a fresh look. It is during some non-action scenes that his unique vision is manifested. After a bloody battle, the killer dances alone in a dark enclosed room, for a moment, the world around him seems to have disappeared. It is surreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed experiment from Donnie Yen","review":"Donnie Yen stars as a hitman who will wait until he has 10 guns pointed at him before making his hit. Unrealistic? Of course it is, but this is a Donnie Yen movie. Yen was a cop and got framed by his partner. After being in jail for 4 years he became a hitman. Now he is out for revenge. There is a female cop after Yen and he falls in love with her.The story is bad, but not completely unwatchable. Everything is very predictable. I would be fine with this if the movie had good action, but it falls short in that category too.There is a great action scene at the start of the movie, but that is it in terms of actual fighting. Rongguang Yu (theIron Monkey) has a cameo as a hitman and I was unimpressed with this shoutout.

The Good Die Twice introduces us to a new team of detectives: Chase Dagger and Sara Morningsky. Sara is a shapeshifter, she can shift into a hawk or a wolf, a talent not new to those familiar with Native American lore. Sara witnesses the murder of a woman believed to have died five years ago. A fascinating crew of characters are cleverly drawn and memorable. Einstein is a scarlet macaw with a photographic memory. Simon is a street-wise mailman who knows everything happening around town. Skizzy is by far the most colorful -- a paranoid who believes \\"big brother\\" is always watching. It takes a gifted writer to pull this off and Driver succeeds. I just read FULL MOON-BLOODY MOON, the second in this series, and it is a notch above, taking it a step further, combining mystery with horror.

But I really liked this book. I thought the character development was excellent. I also liked the relationship development. What I mean by that, is that when very different people come together and form a healthy relationship. For example, the relationship between Dagger, one of the main characters, and the schizophrenic man or the relationship between Dagger and the cop he called Padre, because the cop used to be a priest.All of the characters are strong, they have both strengths and weaknesses. For example, Sarah is a very strong woman but innocent at the same time. It's the way the author puts these together that I find interesting.

It pulled me out of the story everytime. Plus the writer tells us whats happening too much via dialogue rather than showing us in action. He/she needs to write more descriptively and leave the long pages of dialogue for key points where dialogue is necessary.

It is a good start to the Babylon 5 seies, but hardly a first rate effort like the later \\"In the Beginning.\\" There are no extras, but the point of a DVD is to have a lasting copy of movies that one likes, after all, and especting Warner Brother's to add extras to an effort before they could be sure of commercial success is probably unrealistic.I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of the Babylon 5 series, and to anyone interested in excellent SF television."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginnings of an Epic","review":"The Gathering is the movie/pilot for Babylon 5.

I would suggest watching it after the second movie, In the Beginning, a prequel to the series that was done in the last year of the show.I just rewatched both movies recently, and they are still a pleasure. There are plot holes with the Gathering that don't make it a perfect mesh with the rest of the series, and certain aspects (character makeup, lighting, the weapons that make a sound like a nerf gun when they shoot) were changed before the series.

Strangely, the older, lower-budget pilot episode looked the best of the two.And to correct some mis-information, the second film, \\"In The Beginning\\" was not \\"butchered\\" to produce a widescreen version. The live-action was shot in widescreen originally, while the special effects shots were composed so they could be cropped for 16:9 presentation.

This double-sided disk was exactly what I expected - simple format (no special features etc) and good reproductions of the first movie and the re-edited pilot. I had not seen the latter before and thought that it was much better than the original pilot in that some of the more jarring ideas that were not in the subsequent series were edited out and there seemed to more focus on the characters.Priced really nice in the US - in the UK these are bought separately and are more expensive.Rumour has it is that if this sells well we'll see more Babylon 5 DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's up with WB DVD's?","review":"I can't believe that WB put about 3 hours of TV onto two sides of a DVD. With the only benefit being the jump to scene selection. With all the specials that have aired on B5 you'd think they would have put SOMETHING on here.

I hope so, but don't have the info.Note that Warner Bros. is releasing the DVDs. WB makes the worst DVDs on the market in all facets: audio, video, packaging, extras.

Bowdoin College doesn't have a place for her until the next semester, and Alex is incredibly busy at the hospital. Cousin Giddy's phone call seems like a godsend. At teacher at the exclusive boarding school at which she works is taking a maternity leave, and the school is in need of an English teacher immediately. Sarah accepts the position and is off to her childhood home of Carlisle, MA. The teachers are an odd bunch, but not sinister. Having been dragooned into going to a slide show given by the art history teacher, Sarah becomes one of the last people to see her alive.There are many plot twists and turns in this novel and the mystery is pretty engrossing. Borthwick writes an excellent academic mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"How she killed the French language","review":"I do not understand how an author can write about a French teacher who is a stickler for perfection and then not have an editor who has some modicum of French.

At no time was the watch abused. Seller replaced one side of the band and within 7 days the other side broke. Again the watch was not subject to any stress. At that time the seller stated it was not there responsibility and referred me to the Seiko repair station in NJ. The station at first stated it was out of warranty and the seller was not an authorized pulsar dealer but they would repair it one last time? Remember I had the watch on my wrist less than 60 days and had messed with this for 6 months. When I got the watch back I wore it for 1 day and the band broke again in the same spot it had broken before. I have a small wrist and tighten it to the last hole .

But what ruins the story is, quite simply, the writing. Characters--such as Alice's violent boyfriend--surface once, have their dramatic moment, and then never return again. This seems to be a trend in the execution of this book. Sedgwick frequently introduces interesting and dramatic elements, but then leaves them hanging in space and takes the \\"easy\\" way out. Thus, the book ends in mid-air, with a lot of loose ends, and not much substance beyond everyday pop psychology. Best to leave this book behind and instead pick up a psycho-thriller like \\"In the Cut\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychiatry - the tabloid version","review":"This book was a major disappointment. Flatly written, with editing errors even in the names of medications, this book displayed a depth of ignorance about psychiatry, psychiatrists and contemporary psychotherapy. As an experienced psychiatrist, familiar with McLean, the hospital which is described in the story in slightly disguised form, I can assure the public that junior staff are thoroughly supervised, have no time to run around playing detective and would not be allowed to violate boundaries between professional and personal in the way depicted.What about poetic or artistic license, you may ask...Well, for that argument you need a work of art, which I would argue this book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally misleading picture and description","review":"This is NOT what is pictured, not even close.

The product description also states that it \\"Features a scratch and dust resistant screen for maximum protection.\\"--the case had none of these features. The case, itself, is okay, yet way overpriced for what you don't get.

While I am not currently \\"blown away\\" by this release as I have only listened to it once through (I just got it an hour ago), I think it will be one of those \\"sleeper\\" classics.

I can get over the fact they left behind their screaming and metal guitar... even the odd metered rhythms i can get over. However, that is why I liked them before, that is what made them unique and stick out of this crowd of pop rock on the radio. But to switch to four chord progressions unanimously throughout the album? I'm pissed that I even spent 10 bucks on this cd. They've lost their talent. I hear more emotion in Leonard Nimoy's sings the blues. The drums are no more intricate than the bands i saw back in high school at battle of the bands. i can't pick out what the bass player is doing because he's doing exactly the same thing as the guitar.Change is not always a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet!!","review":"Certain bands get better on each album and other bands best album is their first.

I didn't even know it was Taproot until somebody told me. Thats not Taproot, before you even heard the name of the song you could say thats a new Taproot song, just by the sounds of the music.

With a little experimentation (over a couple of uses) you will be able to acquire the coverage you desire. I was looking to darken gray hairs over top and leave a bit of graying in temples. The first attempt left me dark all over. On the second attempt, I applied coloring to temples at the end of application, 2-3 minutes before rinse out, rather leaving it on for standard 5 minutes as the recommended for main area. This worked well, giving me a more natural appearance for my age. The eyebrows should also be done for a shorter time (2 minutes), saving you from explaining you do not use your wife's eyebrow pencil. Color does not wash out or come off on clothes.

I took it back and had to try each animal in the store to make sure it worked. It did and after reading the other reviews, it sounds like some are defective. So I recommend checking all the animal sounds (even though you may feel stupid doing that in a busy store!) before you buy. My son loves this and he doesn't have a problem even at 11 months pulling the lever down himself. He pulls it so much sometimes we don't get to hear the end of what the animal says before it goes on to the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really?","review":"1. The toy is VERY loud, and the speaker hole is in such a place that you can't tape a \\"muffling device\\" like folded paper towels to make it quiet, like I do on my daughter's other toys.2.

The actual toy is ok but our child doesn't nearly love it as much as the little farmer doll. As parents, we find the doll more annoying than the see and say toy because the doll is a lot more monotonous than the see and say. The doll can not be washed, so for cleaning purposes keep that in mind. Once it gets really dirty by, say, falling in dirty slush or snow, it pretty much stays dirty. Don't take the doll outside!

It was too late to get another gift or return it, so I can only hope the baby doesn't enjoy playing with it all that much (or that his parents are very forgiving)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"This toy is too loud, and has no volume control. The movement itself is quite loud, making a grinding noise. Add the even louder voice and animal sounds. Also, the voice is hard to understand and the overall sound quality of the songs and sounds is very poor.As soon as you point the arrow at an animal and pull the lever, it does make that animal's sound, but then the arrow randomly spins somewhere else. This is not helpful at all for teaching the different animals.The pictures are highly stylized comic kitsch drawings, I wonder if they are any good at all for recognizing real animals.My child received this for 2nd birthday, and never plays with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Version is AWFUL- It is actually a ZERO STAR toy!","review":"This toy was much better when I was a kid, probably because the animal sounds matched up correctly to the picture. The handle is hard for my two year old to turn, and the arrow may point to a dog and then oink! (instead of barking!) How confusing for a baby learning animals and sounds!What a shame!!!! This could have been an awesome toy like it was back in the day.

He will do everything by himself now, and doesn't want any help anymore, of course..:-P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible toy, good reviews for the memories","review":"This is a bad replacement for the classic! It uses batteries so the lever is useless. It does nothing but make the sounds unaudible with extra rumbling. It doesnt need the extra page because the extra animals on the other page, the song, and the quiz are all unrecognizable. The reduced size is a plus, but the handle is hard to pull for my 2 year old. So no sounds come out since the handle didnt get pulled correctly. I remember the classic being a much better toy because it would play on all pulls, the sounds were great, and the size was perfect for laptop play. Blah, for $10 it was not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Story - Be Careful","review":"Was looking for the same toy I grew up with but this one was half in size and not loud at all. Hearing the sounds are a big problem. Did not hold the childs attention well at all. Very disappointing. F-P could have made this one better - potentially taking safety too far and overiding the performance factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the old one!","review":"We bought this for my daughter after remembering how much we liked it when we were kids! But it's not the same... instead of pulling a string, there's a lever that is too hard for my daughter to pull. And the sound is terrible! It's muffled, loud, and they talk too fast for her to say it with them. Thumbs down from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT what you remember having as a kid!","review":"First of all, this toy is very small and cheaply made. The music is hard to understand and muffled.So I remember having a similar toy when my stepdaughter was young (now 9) and even when I was young. It was bigger, had a string to pull and would make the animal noise that the the arrow landed on. It was great, and this toy absolutely does not live up to the expectations that I had, which were relatively minimal to begin with. It is actually kind of complicated, and works like a quiz instead of a simples learning toy for toddlers.Total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the one you had when you were little!","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter thinking it would be something like the animal noise toy (pull-the-string type - which is probably not considered safe anymore) a lot of people of my generation had when we were little. It isn't, and it also does not work well. The lever is far too difficult for a child to pull, and it makes so much noise when pulled that you can't hear the animal sound it triggers! Terrible design, poor quality, awful sound. It isn't even cheap -- but not worth it even if it was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i remember","review":"This was one of my favorite toys as a child I can remember clearly.

The one I received was defective- for example, the arrow would land on the duck, but then it would make the frog noise. And then it would be stuck on that animal noise for the next 3 pulls. Not exactly a great way for little ones to learn what animal sounds go with what animal. This toy is a total waste- don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the pull string...","review":"When my son pulls down the handle the noise it makes going back up drowns out the talking.The string was quite and you could her it clearly. This one, we have to listen really close to hear everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad toy but watch the fingers!","review":"I really thought this toy was a great smaller version of a large see n' say I had as a kid. Here are the things I thought were good about the product:- Seems fairly durable- The words and animals sounds are pretty loud and clear (borderline a little loud but not awful)- Cute pictures my baby can identify withSomethings that need work:- The lever is realy hard for my baby to pull down so can't do on their own.- If your kid is trying to turn the pointer (since it is a moving part) and you pull the lever, their finger can get pinched.Overall I was pretty pleased with the product, but I don't remember paying $30 for it. That seems a bit steep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun updates on a classic","review":"I think the updates on this classic toy are great but my complaint is that the farmer's voice, animal sounds and songs are too quiet and often cannot be heard over the spinning of the pointer. I bought it when my daughter was 12 months and of course at that age she could not pull the handle on her own. Now at 19 months she can move the pointer to the animal she wants to hear about and pull the handle. The handle must be pushed all the way down before it will work. Also don't spend an outrageous amount for the product, you can get directly from Fisher Price for a normal price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarely works","review":"I loved See and Say as a child, and I couldn't wait to get one for my toddler. I got this for him when he was 16 months old. If the toy actually worked consistently, it would be great. But half the time, we pull the lever and it just spins without saying anything. We have to pull it just right, kind of slowly, and have it on one of a few select animals, then it will work. When it does work, he loves it. I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farmer says","review":"I bought this toy for my granddaughter that is 20 mo. old.

Glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't say the right animals","review":"This is a really cute toy and a good idea. But when you turn the \\"page\\" it doesn't recognize the new animals. It will say the animal that is in that spot when the page is turned the other way. For example the sheep is at the top left when the page is on the left.

Maybe I just got a defective one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for animal recognition","review":"I bought this for our daughter when she was 13 months old, but she really can't work with it alone until now (18months). The sounds are good, and there are two sets of animals. The only problem is that the handle is a little too strong for little hands, so they need someone's help to \\"pull the lever\\". Otherwise, she loves it. It works well for animal recognition and sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a BIG disappointment !","review":"Well, the item got to me really quick. That's great for Toyzz. But OH MAN! I just threw away 30 bucks. The quality is not at ALL what you'd expect from FisherPrice. I can't believe they actually let this piece of plastic garbage get out of the factory! You can hardly understand what the farmer is saying, it's very warbled. The sound is atrocious. All you can hear is a vague representation of the animal the pointer is pointing to. I grew up with the original and I am saddened to learn this is what has taken it's place. DON'T BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun toy but","review":"My 18 month old is having a VERY hard time pulling the lever while keeping the rest of the toy in place. He gets frustrated and so do I.

It's a move list.","review":"I bought this book shortly after buying the game, but boy was I disappointed. The book contains no strategy whatsoever inside, just a list of controls and each character's moves. Even some of these were incorrect. For example, it says that to perform a character's finisher, you press L2. Nuh-uh!! it's actually L1!! The book has other mistakes such as having the old-school 'Godfather' instead of the 'Goodfather', having the wrong captions under screen shots, and having Mick Foley in the wrong place. On the back of this book it promises to give tips on gameplay and match modes but when you get the plastic cover off, you realise you've been well and truly lied to by the writer as there is nothing of the sort inside. Take my advice and don't bother buying this book. It won't tell you anything you don't already know. It's a pity because this really is a great game.

And a surprising difference is that the phone seems to work better at longer distances from the base!

I've found it quite convenient to use the slide rule to multiply, divide, convert, and compute basic time/speed/distance relationships.I have two issues to gripe about with this watch.

What's missing is the zany logic that makes the books so charming. If you know the books, you may enjoy the references, but the movie itself ends up being pretty standard cartoon slapstick.

Elmo is not a dashboard with remote control."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good except for the flower","review":"Ever since I bought this toy for my son who is 2 yrs 3 months, he loves it. The only problem is the flower, when elmo sings give him a big hug - the flower is bulky and gets in the way. Apart from that it is very cool and my son love it, when he first saw the toy, his eyes lit up and he was oh so happy to get his favourite-elmo. A very good buy except for the flower."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love Elmo","review":"My daughter got this toy from her grandma and she LOVES IT. She carries it EVERYWHERE with her.

This one builds on what went on during the last book, plus it kind of gives us a tiny idea about what people other than Anakin and Tahiri have been up to. This is definitely a lot more interesting and un-put-down-able than any of the other NJO books, but it was a bit short. We seriously need another 500-or-so pg novel here. Oh yeah, the thing between Jaina and Kyp is definitely interesting, and I REALLY hope it progresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the series","review":"After the series was just starting to elicit some yawns, Keyes had me back in the old Star Wars that I love. CLASSIC! I laughed out loud many times and there was true insight regarding the main character (A. Solo). I hate spoilers so I'm not going to go into the details. Unfortunately, I wish I could have personally directed the later novels. Star by Star killed it all! ! !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Depth","review":"This was a very good book with depth. You learn a lot about the Vong, and the Solo children are a main feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new breakthrough","review":"Greg Keyes proves his mettle once again. His earlier Star Wars novel, Edge of Victory I: Conquest, made its fame by providing an unparalleled view into Yuuzhan Vong culture and history.Now, in Edge of Victory II: Rebirth, Keyes comes back on the rebound, still kicking. He manages to weave Luke and Mara's child into a mix of Anakin and Tahiri's relationship, another Vong attack into Republic space, and the evil Warmaster Tsavong Lah in his hunt for Jacen Solo, all in a 292-page novel (as compared to the average Star Wars length of 400 pages).If you think the New Jedi Order has been lacking lately (and it was), or if you believe the series was too dark and pessimisstic (and it wasn't), this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Continueing Saga that leaves us hanging","review":"I won't spit out spoilers, but be prepared for plot twists like you've never known. Anakin, Mara, Jaina, Kyp, the Vong, Luke, the New Republic. All do something or experience something unexpected. We continue to learn more about the invaders, yet we also keep learning about characters whom we thought we knew. Read it, but only after reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is the best book yet from the NJO series. There's something for everybody in this one. It's great to see Han and Leia play a large role and even more wonderful to see them getting along so well. The interaction between Jacen and Han was great. I love to see the personal family side to these characters. Corran Horn and Wedge make appearances that are noteworthy. The Jaina and Kyp interaction was very interesting and leads one to wonder about future development. There's plenty of action and excitement. The book got a little too strange for me towards the end. I still can't figure out some of the events that occurred there. However, I highly recommend this book to all Star Wars fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a good read","review":"Since the other reviewers have already gone over the main plot points, I won't bore you with it.Suffice to say that this is a fun read. I devoured the book and thoroughly enjoyed myself in the process. The characters are drawn well. The Solo kids (if you can still call them that) are growing up in a realistic way. And everyone's reactions in moments of crisis seemed pretty much dead-on to me.My only complaints would be that it got a bit sappy towards the end. And a certain plotline got tied up a bit too neatly. But those aren't the worst problems you can have with a book and are easily overlooked. And we're now free to move on to bigger and better, plot-wise, as a result.My congratulations to Mr. Keyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I loved this book. Thought it was better than Conquest. I really did not like Mara's birth being felt by half the family. That is my only issue with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes a strong stomach...","review":"I wish I could give this book a higher rating, because Keyes does well with what he's given. The problem is the overarching story: the New Jedi Order. So far, we've seen that those New Republic officials who aren't morons are spineless collaborators. The Jedi aren't much better: gone is the confident Luke from Episode VI, and in his place is an indecisive dillitante. Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin, the three Solo Jedi, aren't any better: they can't decide what action to take, whether they should use the Force or not, and their indifference leads to the deaths of millions. Towards the end of this book, I found myself thinking: I really don't care if these three live or die. And that's not the way I should feel about three important, central characters. I think Mr. Keyes does a good job with Han, Leia, and Lando, but their appearances are all too brief. I hope these books get better, but honestly, I doubt I'll be there to see it -- and that saddens me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't picture John Wayne as this Hero","review":"I would recommend this only for the unintentional laughs it generates. the hero commits acts of assault, mayhem, robbery and arson, but they are actions taken against the bad guy, so that's ok, right?? and the fact that he burned down the town general store is not going to affect anyone at all. I would call the book dated, but there are other books of a similar vintage that give a much better story and a better view of the old west. honestly, the hero and his sidekick come across as written by an adolescent boy, and a rather cruel one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I can't believe I haven't seen this book on more chess 'lists' - Smyslov really stresses understanding - any player will make greater gains when armed with a strong endgame.

I purchased my inversion table last spring and after a year and a half of regular use, The Teeter Hang Ups has proven to be sturdy and reliable.The assembly instructions were well written and very clear, and the actual assembly was quick and easy. It also came with an instructional video that covers beginner, intermediate and advance uses for the table. You can even do core strengthening exercises.What I appreciate most about the inversion table is the fact that I get immediate pain relief without the side effects of pain killers or muscle relaxants.

I cannot profess to be huge fan of his poetry, although it clearly has a thread of brilliance through it. His essays, however are truly illuminating. I'm not sure if there is another English language critic today who can bore so deeply into the essence of his subject, look at it from so many angles and levels, and, place it in so many contexts. His interests are universal but his gaze is most acute when looking into the psycho drama of literary creation. This book, covering a selection of every period of his career provides the reader with new insights into reading he might have already covered as well as a wealth of new material. Some selections rank with T S Eliot's 'Sacred Wood' as some of the century's most profound literary criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"reggae-rock with a hint of Hawaii","review":"I'm editing this review because I've actually listened to several albums and disagree with my previous opinion. I thought Pepper was another Sublime wannabe band until I listened to them more. Reggae rock will always give me a reminder of Sublime but Pepper has a hint of Caribbean/Hawaii style mixed in. If all ska or reggae-rock sounds the same to you, listen to more and you will find out there are differences b/w artists. This is probably my 2nd favorite album of Pepper's.In with the Oldbeing the first.I'd bump my new rating up to 4/5 if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pepper are original","review":"Alright, well I just read a couple of reviews that run them down saying they're a Sublime rip-off and this and that...So is that to say that any band that comes out with tracks influenced by Sublime then they're rubbish? I don't think so... Sublime covered such diversity in their music it would be near enough impossible to bring out another cd where it would sound nothing like Sublime at all if you are making music in the dub-rock style. I think Kona Town is a brilliant album and doesn't sound like a rip-off of Sublime at all. Naturally there is a much greater hawaiian influence - not a jamaican one. Great album, can't wait to see what they put on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best thing about this cd is..,.","review":"The first song, an a cappella piece that suggests these guys are homesick, Then the rest of the disc contains their downfall and that they weren't MTV calibre.

The lyrics are stupid.I bought two of their discs because others said how great this was. Oh well. Live and learn.2stars for the music only."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC","review":"These guys aren't bad musicians, and the band is pretty tight.

Don't waste your time with these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"Being a devout Sublime fan, i was stoked to hear another band with a Dub-Reggae-Punk style. But after having the CD in a couple minutes i thought my CD player was on repeat. Pepper's repetitiveness topped with shallow lyrics doesn't do much in the way of drawing you in. Nothing too original, certainly nothing thought-provoking, and hardly inspirational. Honestly, i think I could do better.Stick with Sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cycles and Circuits","review":"Not only does Dyer-Witheford synthesize the seemingly incomprehensible theories of the so-called 'information society,' of 'cyber-space,' he shakes loose the stranglehold of myths that fortify its existence from above, and reminds us of its appropriation by labouring subjects who resist the ubiquitous oppression of global capital.

Some recipes, such as the noodle dishes, cook up in a flash, while others, for daintier fare, take a bit longer and require some planning. The ingredients needed should be easy to find in most cities that have Asian grocery stores, or in large grocery stores with Asian food isles.Have fun and amaze your family and friends with your own Dim Sum party or simply make a dish or two for a quiet dinner.

I was constantly having to check the book for how many sets and reps I was supposed to do. If your as sleep deprived as I am you can understand it is difficult to remember when it changes on a weekly basis. I bought a pilates video and it was much easier to do and had faster overall results.Also, if you have just had a baby, it is likely that you have some weight to shed in order to see these new and improved abs. His weight loss plan is sad, eat less and do some cardio. I didn't need a book to tell me that. He also doesn't really address breastfeeding other than saying you need more calories.And is there anything more annoying than a man telling you how important Kegels are? If he hasn't experienced childbirth then he shouldn't be telling me how Kegels are a fix all for everything that changes after birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pictures and descriptions of ab exercises","review":"Despite the awful title, this is a pretty good book. I'm a very athletic woman who just gave birth to my first child. I know tons of different ab exercises, but most are too strenuous for immediate post-partum. I have found the book very useful in suggesting more controlled, safer exercises that are still challenging. The descriptions and photos are first-rate in showing you EXACTLY what to do to work your abs. The author is also good about emphasizing that every woman's recovery goes differently, and telling you how to customize the routine for your level of fitness.Overall, the book text is somewhat repetitive and overly cheery, and I don't care about the sections on diet or aerobic exercise. I bought it just for the ab exercises, and I am satisfied I got my money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"The moves in this book are great, but they are hard to do on a continual basis.

Both books are out of print and expensive, but in this case you get exactly what you pay for. My biggest problem with Upscale One Pocket is that it does not present enough examples of responding to the break or provide enough moves and strategies to beat even B players. The book has few decent illustrations, which really makes it difficult to learn any shots, and in many other ways it just doesnt get it done. Concepts such as playing the score, the value of taking intentional scratches, skill level in choice of shot etc are all given minimal treatment.

This is just not a problem when I use other oils, mainly valvoline.

Rather than being redundant, I found that this book complemented the other.Both girls were daughters of relatively privileged families who were part of the forced evacuation of Phnom Phen. The author of this one, Ms. Him, was a few years older, and this slight age difference provides some different perspective. In addition, Ms. Him's family evacuated in a different geographical direction, which also affected her family's displacement over those years. The author shows how, as a child, she demonstrated incredible determination and courage in the face of the most horrendous conditions imaginable -- she even escapes one work camp as she was near death from dysentary.This book provides another necessary and compelling autobiography of a horrible time in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!","review":"You won't be able to put this book down!

Ms. Him's account of what she and her family went through during the Khmer Rouge regime is heartbreaking. The pain and suffering they had to enduring, watching her Mak and sisters get so sick and died was heartbreaking. I admire her encourage and will to survive to share her ordeal with the world.

Picked it up because I love memoirs......could not put it down. Fascinating, well written, captivating and descriptive book. I did not know much about the Khmer Rouge, but because this book was so easy to read, I gained a valuable history lesson. I think everyone who has never been in a situation like this young girl's, should read it; her story will REALLY make you appreciate everything you have, REGARDLESS of what little you think you have!Hopefully she will write a part 2 of her life in America? Hopefully. She is an amazing person with an amazing will to live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading in preparation for Cambodia trip","review":"I read this first and then Pol Pot, by Philip Short, in preparation for a trip to Cambodia. The combination was excellent. Short's historical, researched book helped me analyze what had happened and why. Him's book gave a personal story to go with it. While I traveled in Cambodia, I thought back to her comments as often as I remembered Short's history. Together, they gave me a much better travel experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Broken Glass Floats; Growing Up Under the Khmer Rouge","review":"I found the day-by-day description of life in Cambodia during this period to be far too detailed and repetitive. Even though the story is quite harrowing, I found myself losing interest in the detail because it was so repetitive.

This book is extremely helpful for those times when you are knitting away and the pattern dictates some technique vaguely familier or completely new. This book relays such techniques in an easy-to-understand precise manner.Frequently our ability to understand things is as unique as our personalities, so it is good to investigate many different handbooks. For my knowledge as a beginner-going on-intermediate knitter, this book went just enough beyond \\"Vogue Knitting, Quick Reference\\", without all the fluff of \\"Stitch'n Bitch\\" or Debbie Bliss' \\"How to Knit\\" (each excellent, but far too large for a knitting bag).Couple this book with \\"Stitch'n Bitch, A Knitter's Design Journal\\" and you will be good to go for current and future projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you already have a portable knitting reference...","review":"then you don't need this one. I was disappointed when I browsed this at the local bookstore. Pictures are adequate but not as well done as in Vogue Knitting, Vogue Knitting Quick Reference, or Knitting for Dummies. The information is very basic and just about all of it can be found elsewhere and with better detail. For example, the section on blocking consisted of one sentence, maybe two. Given the variety of methods of blocking and the reasons for each, this should have been 1/2 a page at least. There are much better portable reference sources available.The only positive thing I can really say about this book is that the binding (covered spiral) and size are good for just popping in your knitting bag.

It's easy to swap this tunnel in and out for a piece of regular straight track because it's the same length and has both a male and female connector.

So what you get is a large map on one side that's not detailed enough to be useful (and honestly still not large enough to encompass all Atlanta offers) and a map of Downtown, which is woefully inadequate since Downtown is only part of the typical Atlanta experience.

The drumming on A Question Of Faith is first rate, and reminiscent of the drums on \`The Pleasure Principle.' Other standouts are a few of the earlier songs - Noise Noise, I'm An Agent, Listen To The Sirens, Stormtrooper In Drag, The Hunter, Jo The Waiter(!!!). The loudest, most powerful song is I Die: You Die. Ade Orange's bass work stands out on Praying To The Aliens and Stormtrooper. There are also some re-worked songs like Replicas, Everyday I Die, and a funked-up version of Are \`Friends' Electric. I don't have any other live Numan albums, so have nothing to compare it to, but if you like the style of \`Sacrifice,' \`Exile,' and his Tubeway Army era stuff (me, I like it all), then I definately recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hes back and hes proven","review":"Live performances have always been Numans strong point and he has always paid equal attention to both light and sound. It is for this very reason that his live audio recordings stand up by themselves! This is somewhat of a retrospective set managing to please and excite fans from all eras of his career. From the very first notes, the tension is created, then smoothly maintained right through to the finale. See him live...but if you cant then buy this cd, close your eyes, and imagine youre there! Its well worth the trip!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Numan Excels Live","review":"Gary's had many ups and downs in his career. Yet, through it all, his live albums tend to serve him well. This might be one of the best. Sound is very clear, the performance is solid with just enough loose and raw ambience to give it edge. The set list is really what makes this stand out though. This was recorded on the 'Sacrifice' tour, so that album is well represented. What recommends this, however, is focus on tracks that are rarely heard live. \\"Cars\\" and \\"Metal\\" are absent from this set. Instead you get b-sides, Tubeway Army and Numa tracks like 'Noise, Noise', 'Stormtrooper in Drag', 'The Hunter', 'Jo the Waiter' and 'I'm and Agent'."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very realistic","review":"Not overly impressed with this one.

I was so angry at the mislead purchase, that I actually felt obligated to warn other potential buyers. I bought this book to learn new ways to please a partner. Instead what I got was a book with a little common knowledge and a whole lot of filling. Written by an obviously submissive man and his dominating wife, most of the book is spent on meaningless psycho babble, instead of good sexual tecniques. It even goes so far as to say a man is unimportant in a relationship. \\"What do you get out of this?\\", it asks. \\"A pleased woman, which is after all the only important part of a relationship\\", it basically says.If that's your thing, jump at it.

The connection is tenuous at best, and you find yourself often having to reset it just to get it to move the cursor. Speaking of moving the cursor, when it does move, it is jerky, and often just jumps back to the lower left hand corner of the screen for no apparent reason. The reaction time to mouse clicks is horrible, if it even responds at all, and renders this piece of junk worthless. I finally gave up on this glorified laser mounted paper weight and reconnected my USB mouse. Why is it that Microsoft, predominately a software company, can make a wireless X-Box controller than works perfectly from across the room, while Logitech, who specializes in controller hardware, can't make a wireless mouse that actually works from a distance of 3 feet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for the money","review":"If you're looking for a no-bells cordless set that is lightweight and easy to set up, this is the best I've found for the money.

Customer support tells me there are no replacement parts for this and since mine is now out of warranty, I'm out of luck. Now I can either lean the thing on a book or buy a new one. I'm going to buy a new one - I promise you it won't be Logitech. If they are going to have cheap flimsy parts that fall apart with normal use, the least they could do is provide replacements.

I contacted Logitech about the range which is only about 4 feet. To my shock and amazement, Logitech states this is the acceptable operating range of this unit. This was confirmed by their own website:[...]Now, if someone needed a max range of only 4 feet, wouldn't a corded model do?Conclusion - Logitech should simply be embarrassed of putting it's name on this one.

The mouse bottom sense red light is always ON, even you truned off the computer. I believe the keyboard does, too. (Keyboard has no LED light for me to tell, but you can know per change battery period.) This set is a crazy battery drinker.In addition, this set requires way more battery power to work normally. I take out the batteries after the mouse losing control and put batteries into my old Logitech mouse (Logitech LX5 Cordless Optical Mouse). OMG, it still can work for extra 2 weeks.I just wanna give this battery drinker 1 star after I used it 1 month.Overall, the end out is 2 stars from its advantages and disadvantages.

I am definately not buying this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective mouse and generally poor components","review":"I had read these reviews and, when ordering, expected a cheap mouse - not a defective one. The tracking laser forgets to track my movement every once in a while, leading to death and inaccuracy in online games.The center mouse button does not operate nearly as well as other middle buttons. The whole setup seems cheap and rushed. I'm sure the type on the keys would have worn off in a few months, had I not returned it for another model. Do not buy this set unless you _really_ can't afford a slightly more expensive model. I am not very well off myself, but I won't be buying another cheap keyboard and mouse set ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest more money, this keyboard/mouse not worth it","review":"I bought this product maybe a year ago and haven't really used it much since then. It goes through A LOT of batteries, way more than the average person would ever want to place in a wireless keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse never shut off so even when your computer is off you are still losing battery power. I brought this back out last week sometime and have been using it and taking the batteries out when I am done. In the middle of typing last night the keyboard completely stopped working. Tried everything to get it to work with no avail. The only way it does work is if I hold the keyboard so it is vertical and try to type like that. Definitely not worth it and I would invest in a better set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine at first, uses lots of batteries...","review":"I'm on amazon right now to buy a new wireless mouse. This one uses a ton of batteries. I even started using rechargeables! Anyway, the right click button stopped working, so I can't even check my spelling in this review! I'm constantly having to reset the button on the bottom because the lazer gets \\"stuck.\\" How annoying. I also have to open the battery case and reinsert the batteries up to 5 times per day. The more I write, the more I think about changing my star rating to a 1, but it did work great for about a year, except for the constant battery changes. The keyboard is fine. I like how it has an email key. That's about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Not all Logitech brand products live up to expected quality.","review":"I purchased this product about two months ago. I noticed the lack of the traditional cap-lock and num-lock indicator LEDs right away. I also noticed the very short receiver range. The last straw came yesterday when the mouse died and I had to go back to my old one to continue working. If you need to go cordless I suggest going to a better quality product. It may cost more up front but will be more reliable than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouse is cheesy","review":"I would not buy this. This was purchased by my office. On the keyboard I really like the location of the back button, the calculator, home page and e-mail buttons. The keyboard and mouse are loud. I can't express how much I hate the mouse it's really really noisy especially when scrolling and it eats batteries like you wouldn't believe and there is no warning that the battery is low. I would invest my money in a later model and get a rechargeable mouse, which will be cheaper than the money you will have to spend on batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited range","review":"I have a computer linked to my tv, I wanted to have a wireless mouse and keyboard for it. The range is really bad, four feet and it has trouble working correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This is one of Logitech's cheapest wireless desktop items, and the quality shows it. The keyboard is functional, but the keys sometimes feel a bit squishy and less than responsive. The media keys are cheaply-made, and some of mine are already loose even though I've hardly used them. The mouse is by far the worst mouse I have ever used: it feels sluggish, is not particularly ergonomic, and worst of all, both buttons squeak with each click. I suspect this last part has to do with a badly designed battery holder, which seems to grind against the inside of the casing whenever the buttons are clicked.In terms of overall bang for your buck, it's not much buck, but even less bang. I'd suggest one of their higher-end products if you want to go with the wireless desktop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish","review":"I bought this item because of the price, and I needed a better mouse.This mouse is sluggish. I tried to tweak the software, but no dice.Maybe there's a time delay between the keyboard and the mouse, but I can't play some of my computer games -- especially Luxor2. The mouse acts like there's velcro on its bottom. It's OK for simple tasks, but terrible for response time."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE","review":"I bought this combo as I thought it was a deal getting a keyboard and a mouse together for one low price and decided to get this one as I have had good experience in the past with Logitech brand. The keyboard is very nice in the aspect that it has a multi media control buttons it has 4 programmable keys you can program to do just about anything even open programs for you it also seems to have a good distance you can take it away from the computer and still works. The downfall for it is sometimes it is difficult to get the mouse to sync with the dock and I have to shut the computer down to get it to sync again. Also the tabs on the back of the keyboard are not the sturdiest as mine have already snapped right off and are broken to the point they won't go back on.

Tried it on finger cutlicles, and ended up with a few bruises & nicks... it's way too sharp and unwieldy - especially if you're not ambidextrous - so it's hard to get to the target spot without taking off a bit extra (sorry for the graphic violence!).

The newer bag is far more resilient to sharp objects and heavier items but comes with some downsides. It has an odd feel to it, a bit powdery and rubbery, but not a big thing. More annoying is the higher price. Most annoying is closing the drawstring. On the old bag, simply pulling up caused the opening to bunch and seal nicely for tying. On the newer ForceFlex, the drawstrings seem to rub against the rubbery texture and consequently the bag is much harder to seal. Not appreciated in an everyday garbage bag. Unless your personal trash is sharp and heavy, skip the annoying ForceFlex and get these very simple, excellent bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Extra Mammoth or even Mammoth and not fresh","review":"I received this bag of worse than ordinary pecans.

They sing with excessive vebrato and blend poorly, the effect of which is a sound reminiscent of recordings of Renaissance music from the 1950s and 1960s.

Also of interest is the recent madrigal disc by L'arte Soave on the Tactus label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baroque meets Synagogue","review":"Salamone Rossi 'Hebreo' seems justly to be much in demand these days, and previously unrecorded Italian and Hebrew works are appearing in the catalogues. For years the only recording of the works of Salamone Rossi (c.1570~c.1630) was that of Joel Cohen and the Boston Camerata (Harmonia Mundi mid-price) which still stands as a great recording, but this version is as good or better. This disc of Hebrew works was recorded at West London Synagagogue in January 1996 with such famous names as Paul Esswood and Ian Partridge among the voices. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that the CD booklet includes English translations but no Hebrew text. If Harmonia Mundi can include romanised Hebrew texts for Alia Musica's 'El canto espiritual judeoespanol' (HMI 987015) there's no reason why Carlton could not do the same. That aside a fine release.

In addition, the choir has a muddy sound which is not at all suited to the music of this period. If only one of the better early music ensembles would record Rossi's sacred music!

I can understand why she mentions the Haitian mothers \\"testing\\" their daughters' virginity, which has quite a horrifying impact on the reader -- but why does Danticat insist on harping on this over and over and over?

Breathe, Eyes, Memory lacks creativity in tying important and turning point events together. Although the story line is extremely captivating, the author does not elaborate well from point to point. This causes the mood or tone of the book to sway in every which diection, leaving the reader in a confussed state. Because of this dysfunctional set up, the book loses its credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"So?","review":"This book portraited an all too familiar childhood upbring for some of us as women. The bond with a close family member over your mother, the dysfunctional \\"'shaking of the finger' to keep your dress down and your panties up\\" warning towards our virginity and sexuality from mothers, aunts, and grandmothers, the painful memories of sexual assaults from relatives, neighbors, friends, strangers and people in authority, and dealing with death.

There must be a better way to illustrate female strength than through such a steady stream of pain and victimization. In fact, there is something kind of heavy handed about the story telling that causes this book to finally fall short in my opinion. Maybe I am just too old for this kind of thing. I remember reading lots of literature in this 'telling-the-story-of-female-oppression' genre as a baby feminist,' but I guess I have heard enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing - Why did Oprah choose this one????","review":"This could have been a good book if it had been completed.

It's basis was powerful and well- stated . As young Haitian woman I can defenetly relate to her experiences. The story in itself hits close to home , because her arrival to the states were very similar to mine.The bond she develops with her mother at the end was magical. A sort of link that Haitian women have with one another that is needed for support. Ms. Dandicat used alot of Haitian language(creole) which introduces a lot of the culture to its audience. It is a lways agift and a benefit to learn about cultures. I defenetly would recommend this book to anyone that is looking to expand their horizon, and communicate in the language of another ethnic group."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a charmer!","review":"After the first chapter of this lovely little book my immediate reaction was \\"Oh no! Oprah's given us another 'oh the poor women' story, but by the end i was totally won over. Danticat loves the women, you can tell by the way she treats them. Even when you can see that their actions are flawed and almost verge on pathetic, this sense of 'I can understand her doing that' floats gently back into your mind and then BAM! hits you square in the face. And if the last page of this book is not the best I have read in a while then I just do not have a clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Light Reading","review":"I enjoyed the book but did not see the suffering and courage of Haitian women it is supposed to show us.

Very moving and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and heartfelt","review":"This was a pretty good book, better than I expected, an easy read.

I appreciated the look inside rural Haitian maternal relationships and struggles. The undercurrent of mental illness provided for a dark and somber flow. Not sure if this was a reflection of common Haitian mental health issues or simply one family's experience. The physical transitions between New York and Haiti were interesting and informative. Certainly a book I will recommend. I would also recommend \\"A Butterfly's Way\\" by Danticat, for those wanting to explore other issues that challenge the Haitian diaspora."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaged and Guessing","review":"Edwidge Danticat really captures the traditions and her memories in Haiti when she wrote Breath, Eyes, Memory. This book is written about a young girl named Sophie Caco who had lived with her aunt in Haiti for as long as she could remember. At twelve she was reunited with her mother in New York, where she was sent to live. She went through several changes and uncovered many secrets about her past and her families past. Sophie and her mother fought hundreds of inside and outside battles that they cannot explain and no doctors could help. It seemed like the only resolution to their problem was to die; but would that end their problems, or would their demons follow them into their past lives? This book was an easy read; it kept me engaged and kept me guessing what was going to happen next. I don't think I would read this book again but I would read some of Danticat's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remembered that I liked to read","review":"I picked this book up while working a grueling twelve hour graveyard shift, and I was pleasantly surprised by it. I have read books in the Oprah book club before, but I was really pleased with this one. It was short, poignant and well written. It helped me remember how much I really enjoy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A credible first attempt","review":"It was an interesting portrayal of Haitians as something other than wretchedly poor or occult preoccupied. This was, however, unlikely to have been Ms. Danticat's intent. Her agenda appears to be that of a liberal woman of the Ivy league, rather than storyteller. It might be remembered that some fathers care for children and balloons do not typically rise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book About Surviving, Even With The Losses","review":"This tranquil novel has a delicacy and peacefulness in its tone and expression, yet underneath the simple sentences and serene language, is a tormented, turbulent novel.Set in Haiti, New York City, and Providence, Rhode Island, the female protagonist, Sophie, lives in perpetual sexual paranoia and is tormented by ancient ghosts of sexual intimidation. Quiet Sophie, gentle Sophie, she watches her mother, her aunt, her grandmother struggle as females in a patriachal society. She decides to torture her own body as a means of liberation, but does this really free her?For Feminist Literature, this sensible tale has a distinct tone of serious, dangerous struggle for survival, in spite of the loses. She will carry on the human chain, but there will be loses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm over Oprah's Book Club!","review":"While I related to the characters and learned something about the Haitian culture, I found the book rambling and rather elementary in scope. I was happy to read that it was one of the author's earlier attempts. There are shades of promise here. I have been so scalded by some of the other Oprah books that I think this one finally convinced me that I make better choices on my own. While I have overcome significant challenges in my own life, it seems to me that most of her books have a similar theme.....poor people, who can only escape their existance within their minds and suffer, suffer, suffer so eloquently in the process. I was so tired of this story by the time it was over!! Previously, I had to start \\"She's Come Undone\\" three times. Toni Morrison's books are beautiful, though tedious, because she tries to use the entire dictionary in her syntax. I'll make my own choices.. I found Amistead Maupin, Diana Gabaldon and Barbara Taylor Bradford on my own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed","review":"I enjoyed the initial part of the book. During the rest, I kept hoping for it to become less predictable, for the characters to turn out more real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Barely An O.K. Read","review":"An o.k read. This was certainly one of those books that didn't live up to my expectations. I guess if you're a woman -- a Hatian woman more specifically -- you are more likely to connect with this book. I don't think the author did an adequate job of writing this story to reach a broader audience. The least favorite of Oprah's book recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I agree with many of the other readers that this book had the potential to be very good. However, the characters and the story could have been and should have beeen much better developed. I, too was surprised that it was chosen by the Oprah book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook characters","review":"I found this book more of a lecture on Haitian culture and characters who serve as \\"types\\" rather than people with complexity. If the setting weren't related to Haiti, would it still be considered such a good novel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY BOTHER???","review":"After all the publicity this author and this book, as well as \\"Krick! Krack?\\" received, I would never have anticipated such an ordinary an insignificant work. The declarative writing style does not engage the reader in the least and eventually makes you feel like you are reading a newspaper account. The characters could have been likable and reachable from the reader standpoint, if at least developed to the point where they are not just capricious women with a lot of vague and trite points of view on life....that the author is trying to turn into sageness. And I wont even go into the male characters!!! I hope Edwidge grows up and refines her style as well as her subject matter..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No dreams left","review":"Yes, this is a typical award-winning book; written by a young black woman, subject matter being the so-called 'everyday angst' that critics yearn for these days. Danticat has the makings of a poet, but it's sad to say she can't weave a decent plot. Instead, this books keeps wandering in the wilderness of destroyed dreams, traumatic human relationships and the difficulties of being a woman. As a male person, I must say this doesn't touch me. I think the book is pathetic, too sentimental. Not the worst of its kind, but I would never recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart wrenching and yet beautifully told","review":"This book can connect with any woman at any point in her life. The connection between a mother and a duaghter is never smooth sailing. The relationship in this story is one of distrust,anger,resentment, and yet there is the undying love of a mother that comes through in all these emotions. Only a mother's love can cause a daughter to feel resentment and love at the same time towardse the same person."},{"rating":"1","title":"has very little relevance for students of european politics","review":"Although in many ways this is a fine book, I have to warn the potential buyer that it ignores many of the important issues associated with european integration. Some material on the institutional balance of ecosoc and the court of auditors would have been helpful. All told, a thoughtful and cogent study but if you are only going to buy one book about the enormous changes sweeping europe I would not recommend this sadly unfocused title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not emotionally move me....","review":"I bought this book because it was Oprah's book club pick...I could not put the book down because I hoped that there was more, but instead, it was very predicable and not very interesting or moving....I have not read any other novels by this author and do not care to."},{"rating":"2","title":"cultural learning","review":"This book provides an in-depth view of a different culture and the assimilation into american culture"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking fiction","review":"What a grand adventure! BREATH, EYES, MEMORY is a stunning accomplishment, one of those rare books that open one's mind to limitless experience and perception. I recently read the new novel everyone is talking about, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and didn't think anything could top it, but Eyes has come close. What a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of strong but troubled women","review":"I liked the strong connection of these women in the story--Sophie, her mother, her Aunte Atie, and her grandmother. It is amazing for 4 women in one family to have so much in common and yet be such different people. The customs, traditions and folklore of this Haitian family were so primary as to almost be characters in the story themselves.I found this book to be so charming and eloquent as to distract me from its flaws. My only major disappointment is that there couldn't have been a more positive way for Sophie and her mother to escape the ghosts of their pasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"Having both read the book and the reviews it received by amazon readers-- I must say that you shouldn't pick it up because Oprah did. I think you have to have an interest in cultures that differ from yours and a sentivity to them. It was a great piece where you could feel the the women and men's pain as well as learn about the culture-Haiti's. I am impressed by the author's age as well. For bad or good I see the similarities in Amy Tan and this writer. Perhaps I see the similarities in living as a first genereation American in 2 worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Geiger's Extra Credit (Wings Academy) -Illis","review":"Breath,Eyes,Memory by,Edwidge Dandicat,is a coming of age story about a girl who leaves her home of Haiti,to live with her mother in the United States.As the daughter of a poor immigrant,Sophie stays fully determined to acquire the dreams of her mother to stay pure,and her aunt's dreams of an education.As Sophie progresses throughout the story,she realizes that she is a child born out of rape. Her face painting the reflection of her mother's attacker. We see throughout the book,Sophie playing a strong role, taking on the full weight as savior of her mother's nightmares as well as contending to her own conflicting roles as a independent woman.The gaps in between the story impose growth in Sophie's character,leaving much to the reader's imagination.I very much enjoyed reading this book.Coming from a Caribbean background,I was able to relate to the struggles of the Haitan people.I highly recommend this book to all my classmates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylistically Fabulous!!!!!!!!","review":"Ms. Danticat's vision is extraordinary. Stylistically, Danticat sometimes weaves a narrative of utter simplicity; however, the simplistic nature of her composition along with her understanding of human relationships are precisely what make this novel a success. Many reviewers have found fault in this novel due to its simple nature, but like Hemingway, Danticat forces a reader with an acid eye to realize the difficult nature of this deception. \\"Breath, Eyes, Memory\\" is an emotional rollercoaster ride--informative, climatic, and emphatically conclusive. Like many other Oprah selections, \\"Breath, Eyes, Memory\\" deals with several feminist issues, but the universality of family relations and the importance of multiculturalism are the enduring foundations for this book. Edwidge Danticat has the tools, and many great novels can be expected from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching, and wonderful novel","review":"I am a Haitian woman, I lived there until I was 18, and I am shocked by some of the silly responses this book has received from other customers. As one of the more level headed customers noted - when we read Arundati Roy's book do we conclude that all Indian children commit incest? Of course not. This is a beautifully written, thoughtfully and carefully observed novel that engaged me throughout. I read it, judged it, and enjoyed it, as a work of fiction. Most sensible readers will no doubt do the same. It's a beauty, as is Krik Krak and I for one, can't wait to read Danticat's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite !!!","review":"I found this book to be positively exquisite. With the recent proliferation of trash in the genre of popular African American fiction, it was heartwarming to read a piece like this. Popular fiction has its place but my true thirst is for literature by talented black writers.I am not sure if I was more mesmerized by the story or the skillful prose. It takes a REAL writer to create imagery. It takes skill, study and a very special gift. Though the subject matter was not what I expected, the mother/daughter/aunt/grandmother bond truly represented a family tree. If one had any empathy at all, they were able to see and feel each point of view. Sophie's painful acceptance of her mother as a person who did the very best she could with the cards she was dealt should be a lesson to all adult children to stop blaming and for parents to stop feeling guilty.I had to put down Krik-Krak because I found it too sad at the time. I will go back to finish it and anxiousl! y await the next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air","review":"Told in a straightforward and vivid manner, Breath, Eyes, Memory tells the story of Sophie as she leaves Haiti and her aunt, the only home and mother she's known. Summoned to New York by her mother, Sophie must learn how to get along in this foreign land with a woman she barely remembers.Through her own experiences, Sophie learns to appreciate the bonds of strength and nightmare that she shares with generations of Haitian women, choosing what to keep and pass on to her own daughter, and what to abandon. A quick read, but one that will change my perceptions of motherhood and sisterhood forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writer","review":"Couldn't put Night Frost down! Excellent writing with the characters and situations coming to life. Laugh out loud funny with Frost, even though had to accept his bawdiness and crude observations as part of his otherwise lovely character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic book on PLM","review":"I've only gotten through the beginning of the book but I can say that it is very well written, divided into many small chapters to help find any specific topic. It is written like a text book on PLM but a well written one. It defines PLM and puts it into historical business perspective and provides knowledge to implement a PLM project at a company. It is very long and thorough without many diagrams aside from several slides in the appendix.I will add more review once I complete the book but so far I have found that it contains straight forward, well organized insight into this field about which very little has been written so far. I would say this is a must read for any project manager planning to implement PLM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits typewriter...but not our computer keyboards!","review":"I ordered this for my classroom. It fits our typewriter perfectly, but is too big for all of our classroom computer keyboards (ours are Dell and Gateway that seem like the \\"normal\\" size...but must run slimmer). The product goes on the typewriter keyboard easily and looks like it will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tennessee Suspenders","review":"Item was as described, however, they were a bit more \\"dressy\\" than I wanted.

The idea was that the entire family could play the home version of this fun television show. Not!

This is a box that will sit in the closet unused for years until it makes it's way to the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the family","review":"This game is fun to play with the whole family. It is the board game version and not the DVD version, but in my opinion it goes back to the way games should be played....at the table and not in front of the TV. The whole DVD board game idea doesn't work all that well so I'm glad they made a straight board game verion of Deal or No Deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yesssss","review":"Cool Cool...i really enjoyed this fine feature film. It had plenty gore, which I like, and it also had a midget. Ralphus is sweet. i love when he uses that blowgun to get that girl. Not a good flick to show your girlfriend though. She will think you have major problems in the head..The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it was filmed in like the 70's so it is pretty cheesy, but still a fun movie to watch if you can handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw-Dropping Eye-Popping Cult Classic","review":"A few years ago, my Dad was visiting and I rented \\"Bloodsucking Freaks\\" because it looked fun to goof on. But it hadn't been running long when we both fell silent and just stared in dumbfounded fascination. This film is SO perverse that we couldn't believe it was available on an open shelf to rent. The combination of skin (lots of it, and pretty good, too), violence and sheer depravity make it unlike anything else I've seen. The scene with the dwarf, the babe, and the guillotine is a classic. And don't even get me started on that special \\"Black & Decker\\" moment. A disgusting gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different form of entertainment","review":"This movie is not as gruesome as some of the other reviews I've read would have one believe.

Trust me!!!","review":"Now.. I am a big fan of Horror movies. The more gore the better. However in this movie there is nothing whatsoever to relate to or even to analyze.

No plot, bad actors, horrible video transfer. It is a sequence of sadic acts against women, while two sadics laugh all the time.

All their films I see usually have some redeeming quality. But not this one. Now, I'm not bothered by the acting, which is pretty good for a Troma movie. I'm not even bothered by the tasteless, gratuitous nudity. What bothers me is the torture scenes. Now, I don't mind torture scenes as long as they're redemptive (Last House on the Left, I Spit on Your Grave). But these torture scenes are just thrown in there to be torture scenes. There is no redemptive quality to this movie.The DVD is loaded with extras. If you want a good Troma movie, get Troma's War, Tromeo & Juliet, anything but this movie.

I have roughly the same reaction to this mess as I have to watching surgery on television, except that the surgery might have a point to it.The only redeeming feature is that the above effects were obviously faked.

So you see the final product, the setup and 3/4 of the time, the photographers comments. If your new to the game, get it, its valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly out of date","review":"Published in 2002, but full of images that would appear to be from the 1980s, this is horribly out of date. Thus, no mention of digital and the dramatic changes it has bought to studio photography and images that have dated terribly. Even as a 'technique' book this has limited value as many of the compositions are so bizarre and unusual that you are hardly ever likely to need the kind of lighting that is presented. If you are looking for a book with general advice for product and still life (which I was), this is not the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better...","review":"I got this book as a christmas present. I did find it quite informative and helpful as it shows you a floor plan layout of how the shot was set up and lit.The only thing i didnt like is some of the photography was quite dated and old fashioned. The front cover looks great and modern, but inside its a bit disappointing, but the lighting techniques could be applied to your own ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showing its age","review":"This book reads like it was written before digital photography and Photoshop were viable options for the professional photographer. Many of the elaborately staged shots are laughable and seem quaint compared to today's techniques. Don't let the cover images fool you either, most of the shots inside have a very 1980s feel to them. Even so, a handful of the shots have useful lighting information, so this will stay on my studio's bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is an oldfashioned book with elementary sketches showing lighting setups and not much else. I would recommend instead:Light: Science and Magic: An Introduction to Photographic LightingThis book explores an approach to lighting that excites the imaginiation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, didn't even finish it","review":"This book had great potential, but utterly failed. It was incredibly too long, and that's just judging from the 70 or so pages that I did make it through. The plot was confusing (was there a plot?) and there was absolutely no excitement whatsoever. When you think of three girls renting a house together for the summer in a popular area, you think crazy parties, sexy men, etc. This book had nothing. In fact, the plot kept switching from their homes to the summer house. Did they only stay during weekends? Couldn't figure that out and didn't even care to try. Glad I got it from the library and didn't waste money on it! I'd say skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I rolled my eyes about 100 times....","review":"I agree with the reader from Syracuse; I was expecting a light, beachy read but this was terrible, even by those standards. At least most books of this kind keep you interested and make you laugh every now and then. All of the characters in this book were embarrassingly one-dimensional. The dialogue was so unrealistic - where did this author come up with this stuff? This is not how people talk to each other! Equally annoying was the way Chamberlin ends nearly all of the short chapters with some attempt at a deep thought or epiphany for one of the three women. It doesn't work. Truly, I'm amazed I got to the end...I think the only reason I finished it was that I was incredulous that a book this awful got published, and I was stuck on a train with nothing else to read. I cannot believe this book was displayed among MUCH better \\"beach reads\\" such as Jennifer Weiner's \\"Good in Bed\\" and Jane Green's \\"Jemima J\\". Please don't waste your money! I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgraceful!","review":"Holly Chamberlaine (author) needs to get another job. She is a very poor author. This book was horrible. Everything about it. The story line, the characters.....especially, Gincy, and the length. It was SO unecesarily long. How many times was she going to try to cash in on the joke about NH. Everytime Gincy referred to her hometown, it was always something like, Armpit, NH. Rodent infested, NH. I mean come on, it was somewhat funny once (NOT) but how many times are you going to try to repeat the same supposed joke? GET A LIFE. Readers, don't waste your precious reading time. I cannot believe this book got published and I wasted $13 on it. Which is the only reason I totured myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed by this novel. I was looking for a light beach read, but this was way beyond that. The writing was flat and contrived (I can't imagine anyone would ever talk that way in real life!), none of the characters were realistic or even likeable, the book flopped back and forth between different characters and locations without ever following through on anything, and each chapter ended in a silly almost sitcom-like \\"moral.\\" I was also really put-off by the childish gag about one of the character's hometown (she kept referring to it as things like \\"barfville\\" that nobody above the age of 12 would ever use). I felt upset and cheated the entire time I read the book; like someone had stolen my money and time. I actually stopped reading about 50 or so pages in because it was just too bad to continue. I leafed through the rest of the book to find out what happened and see if anything improved, but it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I wish I'd checked out the reviews on Amazon prior to purchasing it, but I bought it in a bookstore when I was in a hurry and the cover looked good.The characters are one dimensional and extremely unlikeable. For example, what would Rick see in a woman like Gincy? The author never tells us, yet portrays Gincy as a very unpleasant, loud, and hygenically challenged woman.Danielle, the lone Jewish character, is portrayed in an unflattering, stereotypical manner. The JAP? Yeah, right. Perhaps the author can enlighten us as to why shrimp and bacon would be served at a Jewish wedding when both foods are not kosher.And then there is Clare, who is supposed to be a teacher yet we read nothing about her as such. Does she love children? What attracted her to Win in the first place? Why did she feel attracted to others while in her relationship?Very disappointing book. I won't be reading anything else by this author in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Easy Read","review":"I breezed through this book in two days.

I have a standard 19\\" mountain bike and it wouldn't even fit over the handle bars. So not only was it small but the straps were a joke and couldn't keep it in place when the wind started blowing.

You get to like the characters and believe it or not even the villain gets you in the end. A page turner with a twist. Great entertainment and a little gore. Can't wait to order the 3rd book. At $2.99 - very reasonable, for sure. I do not think we \\"Kindle Kuties\\" should pay over $9.99. Publishers better wise up.

I'm a big fan of good literature (my favorite children's book is \\"Rikki Tikki Tavi\\" by Rudyard Kipling) and I was excited to receive this book based on all the glowing reviews. That excitement was short-lived when I finally read the book to my 6 year old son. It's not an awful book, but I didn't find it nearly as endearing as the other reviewers. It's a fairly short book, and all it's about is how the kids in town use their imagination in this place called Roxaboxen. They pretend they're riding horses or put in jail for speeding, etc etc. I wasn't a fan of the story or even the artwork. My son's opinion? He said, \\"Mom, this story is lame\\". This book will be going in the Goodwill pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful :)","review":"This is a pretty nostalgic book about the author's mother's childhood. She and her friends made the land behind their houses into their own play area, and spent time there, year after year, making cities and fighting \\"wars\\" and eating \\"ice cream\\".Reading this book is really like diving right into somebody else's make-believe world. My nieces love it, but they don't get to read it too often, as it does make me cry :) Definitely check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood memories","review":"This was my FAVORITE book as a child. I am 25 now and it is still one of my favorites. I used to read it over and over and wish I was there with those kids, in the desert with the sparkling glass. Today, I spend most of my vacation time out in the desert and I think this book really helped shape my love for it.Very cute story and even inspirational without being sappy.Very relatable, too.Illustrations are really pretty and sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roxaboxen is a rocking good story","review":"RoxaboxenThis book is a great read-a-loud for all ages.

A wonderful writer's workshop book for teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"When free imagination reigns","review":"What I love most about this story is reading it with my children. They are fascinated about building something wonderful from just the things around you. They love the town of Roxaboxen and the wonderful ways the children use the ocotillo as swords. This has been a wonderful addition to our bookshelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice book for adults.","review":"Lovely, haunting, poetic book -- for adults.But, for a child, nostalgia for \\"the way we all used to play outdoors in an abandoned lot, decades ago\\" doesn't make a very interesting topic. Certainly there have been no repeat requests for this book at story hour. And mine is not a child who shuns the haunting, the subtle, the poetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a Children's Story...","review":"This is a wonderful inspiration for anyone who works with or for children.

The memories of childhood are forever and the impact is widespread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a good story","review":"This is a great true story about a bunch of children with wonderful imaginations.

The tracks here are well-produced and on par with their other works. The duo do what they do best and deliver the goods.I agree with Constant's review of the track listings, but Outlaw Pride and Leave the Rest Behind stand out as my favorites off the album. \\"Make You Happy\\" is a good love song, which is surprising considering the groups subject matter, showing their talent in all ranges.The high production value is also evident with the original beats (besides Leave the Rest Behind, which is sampled off another original beat).

RVs at wilderness hot springs","review":"The only useful thing about this writer's books on hot springs are the USGS maps and the latitude/longitudes. I bought a book of his nearly 20 years ago and was thoroughly dissatisfied, & was incensed when it seemed to me he was more interested in providing info for the land yacht crowd. I wonder if his book alleging that the lunar landings were hoaxes is any better. I doubt it. He probably denies the Holocaust took place, too. If you want a book on hot springs, check out Jayson Loam's books. They are much better. If you want info on faked lunar landings, get the movie \\"Capricorn One.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what you're looking for...","review":"I teach composition at a mid-sized Catholic university in the mid-Atlantic region and used this as my course text last semester (the department's choice, not mine) with decidedly mixed results. If you want your students to get beyond \\"mere rhetoric\\" and into critical analysis, this NOT the text you should be using. Most of the examples quoted are taken from newspaper editorials, which are notoriously one-sided and don't exactly encourage the reader to give the opposition's view a fair shot, and the last half is a handbook (useful if you don't want your students to have to purchase more than one book, but frustrating if you'd rather see those pages devoted to substantive material on teaching composition). If you like the argument/debate model of writing instruction (I don't), this will probably work out better for you than it did for me. I must also note that most of my students found the book's tone patronizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be cheap, buy the lastest edition.","review":"Trying to save money, I purchased Discovering Arguments 2nd Edition thinking I'd get by with the older edition, and it led to a very stressful semester. DO NOT buy the older edition to save money. The 2nd edition in comparison to the 3rd edition (current ed.) is completely different! Sure, it still explains how to write essays the same way, but 75% of the stories, essays, and visual images are different. I spent many hours in the library comparing the two books, and taking pages upon pages of notes just so I could catch up for graded class discussions. So if you are debating on if you should get a cheaper, older edition save yourself the stress and spend the money on the newer version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"A book such as this one touches on a realm that Christian fiction often doesn't address.

Actually, for young teens it's probably a moderately satisfying read. Only managed to finish it for lack of something else handy to read. The second book (takedown) is surprisingly even more shallow and comes off as nothing more than a harlequin romance with a slightly better plot line. So bad I just couldn't finish it, which is a rare thing for me. Got both books because they sounded interesting and had strong reviews. Simply shocked by the celebrity reviews; what, did these people even read this book or were they just bought off? If you are interested in supernatural detective cross-over novels, give F.

They look exactly like the Systi Matic Superfine dado head but they have three things that the Superfine dado head does not. First of all, These sets are available in 6 and 8 inch diameters ranging from 20 to 42 teeth. They also include a 3/32nd inch chipper while Systi Matic does not and you get 8 shims and a manual as well.

A Hollywood actor finds himself living transported into Nazi Germany, where he's a black marketeer. He alternates between that life and his current one, where he's filming a new movie, and realizes the black marketeer has been living his life when he's in the past. By contrasting two morally bankrupt societies, (the Nazis and the Hollywood film industry), Kotzwinkly brilliantly drives home the motivating factors of greed and power which dehumanize those who fall prey to them. And in contrast to the the preceeding sentence, which sounds like some crummy English paper reject, this book is suspenseful, moving, and funny. A brilliant book that I'm still waiting for someone to make into a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise","review":"I really like this author.

I enjoyed the return of Mr. Hilliard, the emergence of Kitty Kat (their pet lion), and the way the Addams family terrified one or two people who rather deserved it. Some good parts: Wednesday and Pugsley's scuffle with an obnoxious boy (in which they get the better of him); Morticia and Gomez's swordplay; the feeding of the piranhas; and Morticia's beloved plants strangling each other. I also loved it when Gomez told Morticia not to worry that Hilliard would drain the swamps -- all politicians do exactly the opposite of their campaign promises!The old Addams family show doesn't have the gloss and style of the movies and cartoons, but it's charming and funny. The laugh track, though, is unnecessary and too loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has some of the series strengths and weaknesses","review":"Some original and fun plots in this set but it overdoes the Ophelia plot devise too much.

After reading both books it appears that Amy Welborn has based her arguments on the same beliefs that were chanlleged by Dan Brown.

Why? Well, simply because Amy could have written this book of \\"proofs\\" much earlier then Dan wrote \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" which found place in our minds and makes a lot of sense.If Opus Dei's people cared about Christianity they would give everything to the poor and unfortunate instead of building offices all around the world and donating billions of dollars to the already extremely rich countries. The Vatican.Jesus didn't own anything but a big generous heart! That's why there is only ONE Jesus and lots of Opus Dei's people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogmatic Christian Rebuttal","review":"Amy Welborn rebuts Dan Brown's novel -- as if a novel needs rebutting -- by comparing it to the bible. Where Brown diverges from the bible, Welborn concludes Brown is wrong.Why? Because the bible is the word of god and infallible.If this level of intellectual discussion sounds attractive to you, be my guest. It was a little too moronic for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far less than I expected.","review":"There are a lot of good points in this book, unfortunately, the author does not remain very objective and takes every chance that she can to slam Dan Brown. She even gets so petty as to scold Brown for calling a document a \\"script\\" when it is in fact a \\"codice\\". Thanks for the info, Amy. Now I can sleep tonight.I think I would have more respect for this book if it didn't seem like such a personal attack against Brown, but instead laid out the facts and counter-arguments in a non-biased and objective way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not what you're looking for...","review":"If you're looking for an objective view of how to 'de-code' the Da Vinci Code, this is not the book for you. This is obvious from the author's own adamant verbiage, such as 'This is simply not true' and the fact that she does not always provide historical data to support her argument. Welborn tends to focus on tedious and irrelevant parts of the book. Teabing tells Sophie that the Bible was not 'faxed down from heaven' and according to Welborn's brilliant revelation, this is 'not news to us.' Well... duh. Thanks for clearing that one up. Robert Langdon is a professor of Religious Symbology, which Welborn chooses to remind us doesn't exist at Harvard. Why is Welborn picking apart character development now? Dan Brown is clearly pushing for an Indiana Jones-type character, which works just fine. I blame myself for purchasing this book, since I failed to research the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much anger!","review":"Just when she makes an interesting point, a paragraph later her logic devolves into a slippery slope tirade.Example- p23\\"Brown's characters frequently assert that the traditional Christian understanding of Jesus' life and ministry is false. Which would mean, then, that the New Testament, the source of that understanding, is completly untrustworthy source of information.\\"Am I the only one that sees the massive holes in that assertion? Just because SOME of the New Testament may have been doctored doesn't mean therfore that it is COMPLETLY \\"untrustworthy\\".Clearly she set out writing this book with a mission in mind. After all, this was by a woman who wrote a series of Sunday school books for teenagers entitled \\"Prove It\\".Given that, its hard to give this book much credence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides the big picture","review":"Very readable book that should appeal to believers and agnostics alike - anyone honestly interested in the truth. Early church history is something most know little about, and the author (who has a BA in honors history and MA in Church History) has done an excellent job helping to fill that vacuum. She explores the sources of information Dan Brown used for his book and seeks to unravel fact from fiction in an fair-minded way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't look for facts here.","review":"This book reads like the churches answer to The Da Vinci Code. Much like The Da Vinci Code is filled with assumptions of history, so is this, without the preface of 'fiction'. If your looking to delve further into 'true' history of Da Vinci, don't buy this book. I've always been one to treasure literature, but this book I literally tossed into the garbage after reading the first 50 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, still not good...","review":"A reader from Chicago is absolutely right. I didn't finish the book because it was completely and totally too absurd. And obviously, someone does not like for others to have their own opinion on such matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not a clear and critical review of the Da Vinci Code","review":"The author is biased about all the speculations offered in the book. She conviently discusses what she thinks is the \\"correct\\" and \\"right\\" facts according to the Bible, but she does not go on a lot of historical facts and details that are essential to understand the speculation caused by the DVC. I think she should have done her homework in a better and more thorough way. She lacks a lot of historical background that is needed to understand the scriptures. It was very disappointing. I don't recommend this book unless you are a fanatic that don't want to hear anything beyond the holy scriptures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"I purchased this book hoping for an unbiased examination of the assertions made in the da Vinci Code, many of which stood in the face of my traditional Catholic upbringing. What I found was an obviously exasperated and sarcastic slam of Brown's book. Clearly the author is distressed by the novel and couldn't wait to get her two cents in, based on her obvious devout Christian beliefs. If you are looking for clear comparison of the novel and historical fact, skip this book. There are many better written works on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"total dribble as well as boring","review":"What is it with all these authors who are trying desperately to make money off an admittedly fictional book. Just because they didn't think of it first, doesn't give them the right to critize someone else's work of fiction. Does a piece of fiction have to have ALL their facts correct with no tolerance for creativity and literary license? According to Amy Welborn, the answer is no as she tags her name to the best selling book \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Brown in an effort to make some money off the fame of the book herself. She needs to grow up and write her own book that she creates from her own mind rather than stealing from other peoples works to make her own living."},{"rating":"1","title":"I also want my two hours back","review":"The book is written in a very condescending manner which I found to be insulting at best.

She refutes \\"Leonardo's\\" homosexuality despite its common assumption among historians. Other glaring misintrepretations and deletions made this a worthless purchase. Very bias and did not give all the facts about the fascinating issues Dan Brown focuses interest on in his fiction novel. Surely she realizes we understand The da Vinci Code is fiction, but it did bring attention to many fascinating areas. More than I can say about this lousy rebuttal. I want my money back, Ms. Welborn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow Thinking","review":"This book is a perfect example of narrow-mindedness; she might as well say \\"this is the conventional wisdom, so ask no questions, explore no further.\\" And I am so tired of seeing her phrase \\"serious scholars\\" - is it not true that great thoughts and inventions have always been the products of unconventional minds? The Da Vinci Code IS a novel, and perhaps people have gotten carried away with the whole thing; but not only has it made the author and publisher richer, it has enriched those who have read it by sparking curiosity and controversy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the Da Vinci Code!","review":"And I liked this book, too. It clarifies issues and points you to more information. I didn't take the novel as fact, but I know some people who have, and this helps me explain things to them - about the Gospels, Jesus, Mary Magadalene, Leonardo, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy copies to give away","review":"I have plenty of friends who read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and who seem to think that it describes some sort of factual, accurate history. As Welborn shows in this book, it doesn't, and it's kind of amazing how Dan Brown really didn't seem to know what he was talking about in any area, and how his publisher let all of it pass.This book answers all the questions in a style that's very entertaining. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"Full of interesting, thorough arguments and facts.Simple to read, but not simplistic at all.Just what's needed.And a reviewer from San Diego neglected to mention that Welborn addresses the \\"fiction\\" question quite thoroughly, leading one to wonder how closely he/she actually read this book. Of course the Da Vinci Code is fiction - the problem is the many readers who don't think it is (read the reader reviews of the novel if you want to figure this out). This same reviewer can't spell the author's name of this particular book correctly, doesn't note the many, many sources used and cited within the chapters (the books mentioned at the end of each chapter are clearly labeled \\"for further reading\\"), and leaves us all wondering exactly what a \\"scorce\\" is.No, this is clearly one of the top Da Vinci Code- related books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fun!","review":"A really fun, fresh movie with a great visual style - smart and funny!

This is perhaps the only book dealing with the history of the movement, but much of it seemed impersonal. I am not sure if Benkov's target audience is lesbian and gay parents and their supporters, or if the book is supposed to be a way to convince those opposed to the movement.

The copper fabric is very elegant and blends beautifully with home decor when she is displayed.Usually when I go to purchase a doll in a store, I meticulously search through them to find the \\"perfect doll\\"--a combination of flawless features, straight, unrumpled clothing, and a perfect to near perfect box. Sometimes I have to go to 3 or 4 stores to find one like that. But I found this one on the first try, and just about every other one I've seen looks just as good as mine.

With her upswept hair, vampish eye makeup and draped gown she is one of the most glamorous Barbies to come out recently. The back of the box shows a prototype doll using a standard Barbie head sculpt, fortunately this doll was actually produced using the Lea/Kayla head sculpt which is clearly a better choice. The only fault I can find with this doll is the fact that her dress is sewn on so if you plan on redressing her you will have to carefully undo the stitching, this doesn't ruin the dress but is a nuicance considering that it could have easily been made with snaps. Other than my one objection, and if you plan on leaving her as is this won't be a problem, I do think this doll is an outstanding value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful doll","review":"I've been collecting the Princess Collection, and this is by far the most beautiful.Her hair is wonderfully done, her skin colour and eye colour are perfect, but I did give her only four stars because her costume isn't truly authentic.

The problem is that THE OUTFIT DOESN'T COME OFF!I would like to slap the Mattel people for sewing her outfit on her.

The long track grooves inside the roundhouse allow your engineer to double stack up to ten engines inside as in the stories. The open back portion allows little engineers to see into the shed where their engines sleep. In addition to durable doors which are sized just right for little hands, the sturdy construction allows a pint-sized engineer to sit on the roundhouse while running at his/her feet below.Some of the Thomas tracks don't stand up under my three-year old's impression of \\"Godzilla\\" but the roundhouse withstands the monster's fury every time!It is unfortunate the Learning Curve did not see fit to market the red turntable as a part of the Roundhouse toy as it takes up less room on your island of Sodor than the other wood-colored turntable.The roundhouse is a terrific anchor for any railway line.

The author's voice is fresh, grounded, and clear-headed so there's a solid sense of credibility.

It's a nice rich red color which we both like and I'm tempted to order one for myself.

This product is not sound activated, only motion activated. I bought it for the sound activation, as I need to bridge a larger distance than the meager 20ft reach of the motion sensor. I installed it anyway, and the other disappointment was that it doesn't work well with my energy saving fluorescent lights. The light turns ON fine when activated, but in automatic activation mode the light never turns OFF completely. When the timer switches to \\"OFF\\", the fluorescent light keeps flickering. The regular shipping charge of more than $7 (half the item's price!) was also kind of hefty, considering the small size of the item. On the plus side (I have to justify giving a star), the installation instructions are clear enough that even I, as a novice, was able to install it as a 3-way switch.

However, the switch is designed to be used in the \\"auto\\" setting (i.e. turn on if motion is sensed and auto-off afterwards). In the auto setting, my bulbs turned on perfectly, but when they were supposed to turn off, they would not turn off completely and just flickered continuously. I've never heard of this happening before (I've heard of flickering instead of turning on, but not instead of turning off), so I'm not sure if it something peculiar to my setup or not, but after swapping out the CFL bulbs for normal incandescent bulbs, everything seems to be working fine. The bulbs are not used very often, so I don't mind swapping out the CFLs, but it is slightly annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great as one-way switch","review":"Works phantastic as a 1-way switch. But there are some minor issues when replacing a 3-way switch: There is an older and a newer version of the switch, but unfortunately the installation instructions were not updated and are not complete (when it comes to replacing a 3-way switch). Luckily the manufacturer's customer service quickly provided me with the instructions. However, I still couldn't get it to work the way it is supposed to (as many others according to some other internet forum). In my case the remaining conventional 3-way switch cannot trigger the light to come on which is fine as the sensor field is so big that it is no longer needed. If your 2 conventional 3-way switches are far apart from each other you can replace both by a Pir sensor switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for flourescents or (probably) low wattage","review":"I installed this on a low wattage flourescent bulb, the kind that are coiled to fit where a regular incandescent bulb would fit, and the switch would leak enough power that the bulb, although very dimmned, was still on.

I've had this switch installed for about a year and a half, and have had absolutely no problems with it. It works as expected, and I have high expectations.The switch came complete with the wall plate, was easy to install, and offered clear instructions for use. I replaced a standard light switch in a stairway to a basement that is shared by mutiple residents as a way to ensure that lights aren't left on by accident. The switch turns the lights on when the stairway is entered and keeps them on for about fifteen minutes, more than long enough for the average basement drop-off/pick-up. On the occasions when I have needed to work on a project and need the lights on longer, there is a switch (\\"Off/Automatic/On\\") which allows the lights to remain on until turned off, like a standard light switch.Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensor switch","review":"Great concept, but after I used my switch for a while, I realized that there are competing brands out there that do a better job. I installed my sensor switch in the laundry room. My switch requires \\"additional stimulation\\" sometimes before it turns on - I find myself waving at it quite frequently. It also has a short \\"on\\" cycle. This may also be related to the \\"additional stimulation\\" factor. I feel that it shuts off long before I'm ready for it.

You can replace any light switch in minutes. I have many occupancy sensors and some are the type that work with compact florescent bulbs. This one only works with incandescent/halogen bulbs according to the description but there are some advantages to this type. This one makes no sound at all when the switch activates which is very nice. It also does not pick up on my cats even when they jump on my kitchen counter 5 feet in front of the sensor. That is excellent in my opinion. I will definitely buy this one again for another room. Also I think it is worth pointing out that if you use one of these you should use incandescent or halogen bulbs because they reach full brightness right away and the energy consumption doesn't really matter if the light turns off after you leave the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for conventional incandescent bulbs","review":"I installed this sensor in my den because the light switches are on the other side of the room from where you enter from the hallway. I also have conventional bulbs installed in my den. The adjustable sensor works to perfection.

If you have a similar situation as mine, this item should work well for you, too. As said in some other reviews, however, if you are using CFL's do NOT buy this item.

I don't know what bodily dysfunctions the animated bowler suffers from, but is it really that difficult to computer animate a bowler with decent form? Finally, the varying camera angles are kind of interesting, but they make it impossible to see where the ball is hitting the pins in order to make adjustments.

In this book, there was no kidnap or forced movment of Helen, she went on her own free will which turned the whole story around. The last half of the book is Cassandra's(Paris' sister)point of view, how she felt about Helen. Cassandra sensed destruction when she first met Helen, but they became friends.

But it was a good book, definately a 'must have' if you are a Troy fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Booksellers through Amazon's network","review":"Book came from out-of-state dealer on time and exactly as described. It was not obtainable at any local stoes and Amazon came through again. I will contiinue to order anytime through Amazon's network of booksellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important book","review":"I read this book 2 years ago and found it to be not only edifying but electrifying. Her thinking is not only logical but new and powerful. My novel, Lip Service, owes a lot to her insights and I am thankful for women like Wendy who are not afraid to think out of the square."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good argumentation but poor research","review":"Pornography is a feminist ally. This is one of the basic premises of this book and by doing so, steps on the mantra of those who hate naked people and are crying for censorship.What makes this book worth reading is that it takes each of the arguments used by those who claim that pornography can not fall under the protection of free speech, and proves them wrong. Indeed pornography is a mode used by those who want to express the nature of their sexual beings and the different lifestyle alternatives enclosed within it.On the other hand the books falls short on testimonials of those who are part of the industry and well as their detractors. Particularly, from those who like to pose for the camera and who are the \\"workers\\" of the trade. This lacking rests support to several of the claiming of the author. Nevertheless it is a brave work to stand up and defend such a despised activity which although it attracts the interest of almost everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not researched well enough to really do that much good.","review":"I wasn't that impressed with this book although I agree wholeheartedly with her message. A very sloppy effort on her part."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first MP3","review":"I never thought I would want an MP3 player because I am not inclined to try to figure out how to make things work. When I read the reveiws on this product I thought it sounded easy enough for me to work and it is. The price was right, sound quality is good and it is easy to use. Some day I may want to upgrade but for now I like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"First of all, order of songs is dependent on order n which they were copied to the device. You cannot reorder songs once they are on the device. BUT you can cluster songs in subdirectories on the root directory. The player will not allow you to play only one song, but it will stop at the end of your songs and not repeat. I don't use shuffle mode - so that may not always be true. This is PERFECT for my hypnosis sessions - I can copy that track last, fast forward to it, and it will play the hypnosis without looping back to follow it up with rock and roll. By putting the hypnosis in a subdirectory, I guarantee it is last in the playlist. BTW this sounds great with my noise-cancelling headphones and worked very nicely on my last airplane flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even Mediocre","review":"I, also, have used Streetwise maps and been pleased. However, the Florence map is basically useless. It's awkward to use and difficult to read. Every tour book I've seen has a better map. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT DRIVE IN FLORENCE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAP!!","review":"We purchased this map from AMAZON only weeks before our trip to Italy. Either it was incorrect from the start or has never been updated since its publication....or there are one way gremlins afoot at the publishers!!After trying every approach into central Florence using this map we realized that at least HALF of one way streets are WRONGLY MARKED! Finally we chucked the map and followed the actual street signs and found our hotel."},{"rating":"2","title":"planning 5th trip to Italy","review":"I have purchased several Streetwise for various cities. I found ALL of them to be useful. For Florence, it was particularly useful because the streets in Florence are narrow and not straight. You can easily get a bit lost - but not if you have the Streetwise map with you. You can use it to quickly get your location, and to see where the nearest piazza, church or museum is located. It also takes you across the Arno to the Piti Palace and Boboli Gardens. It is easy to carry and for someone who has progressed to bifocals -- easy to read."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],W={key:0},C={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-c6550805"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/46.md","filePath":"people/46.md"}'),R={name:"people/46.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
