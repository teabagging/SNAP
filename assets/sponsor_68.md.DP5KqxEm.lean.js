I found this game to be mediocre at best. Anyone twelve years of age or more should have very little trouble finishing this game.

Mario is Missing, Mario's Lost in Time, and now Luigi's Mansion. Clearly, Luigi is the superior of the duo, how about his OWN adventure?

Luigi's game does a good job of creating a scary-yet-cartoonish atmosphere to immerse yourself into, and it's fun to go-round sucking ghosts into your vacuum cleaner.Of course no game is perfect, and the flaw here is that the fun only lasts ~20 hours, but I figure I'd rather have a short solid title than one that pads the game with long stretches of boredom (cough - Wind Waker). Resident Evil 2 is only 20 hours long too, but I still consider it the best survival-horror game to date. It's short but solid, and so too is Luigi's Mansion.Recommended buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this game!!","review":"This game is not fun....it is hard coming from an adult.

Take it from me, I'm not a really big gamer who plays video games 24/7. So if I beat it that quick, then if you're a big gamer, than you'll hate this game. So if you have the attention span of a two-year old, or you are a two-year old, then buy this game.

Basic inrto storyline is that you (Luigi) win a contest that you never entered, and get a free mansion. It (of course) is haunted. Mario goes ahead to check it out, and doesn't come back, so you go. So then your walking around with a flashlight, calling mario, then you find a key, go through a door, and find this little old guy trying to suck a up a ghost with a vacum. He tells you his story, give you the vacum, and, ta da, you've got your main 'weapon'. Then you get used to the feel of it and go off back to the mansion to continue the search. Thats about as far as i got. Great graphics, good Nintendo-style stroyline...I recomed this game to most anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just RENT this","review":"I hope it's not a sign of Nintendo products to come. It's very short, at 5 hours, for a game that cost something like 70 dollars Canadian when it first hit, consumers deserve more, with the lack of replayability, this game is about 10+ bucks per hour (when you'll likely play just once). Resident Evil 1 however, also could be beaten in a mere 5 hours (that info SHOULD be printed on the box). Maybe, like Dreamcast, this game will hit 5 dollars sometime, then I'll probably pick it up, because even though it has these problems, part of me wants to rent it again. Maybe it's for the cheesey fun, or for looks, but I thought about it. There should have been a few better modes after beating the game, some mini-games for 4 players or a creative vacuum deathmatch to spruce things up, levels could've been rearranged. This game feels like one level out of what should have been about a 5-7 level game, and the plot is simple, too. I wish he had put that vacuum away at least once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but easy","review":"Just like all Nintendo games starring Mario or his brother, this is great, but most older games may be able to beat it quickly.

My husband and I both really enjoy it. Our only complaint is that the game was too short. We played for an hour or so every night for a couple weeks and finished the whole game.

It would get 3 stars if it didn't have such great replay value. All in all its a great game, so if you own everything in the world except this game, or just want a fun game, buy this game. Its scary how great the graphics are, and its highlighted when you see him turn a doorknob for the first time...cool! The music is very hummable, and the sound is hilarious, especially if its from Luigi. Press A in the middle of nowhere and he says \\"Mario?\\" in several different tones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Launching Game for GCN","review":"I think this game definintely was the right game to launch for the GCN. Don't be fooled by it's appearance, it's not that childish or young in the game as it looks on the cover. One thing about this game that I like is the graphics. The lighting effects, the rooms, and definintely the characters (Go Luigi!). I have never seen Luigi any more detailed in any other game. And besides, isn't it his turn to take the spotlight? His brother has always been the leader, and Luigi was usually the sidekick. The only problem with this game could possibly be how easy or tough it is. It's a bit challenging at first, but it becomes really easy and short. That's the only downside."},{"rating":"2","title":"luigi's mansion is a classic game","review":"luigi's mansion is a incredible game the greatest game in the universe a true classic the best of the best luigi's mansion rocks nintendo are gods they are the greatest video game company in the universe there true genius the best of the best nintendo rocks buy this game if your a really huge nintendo fan you wont be sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luigi gets to be a Ghostbuster","review":"You may be fooled into thinking that Luigi has been overshadowed by Mario in every game he's ever been in, but that is not the case. In 2001, Luigi got his first game all to himself, and the premise actually involves him saving Mario. The basic premise of Luigi's Mansion is that the plumber in green wins a haunted mansion in which Mario is trapped. A weird baby doctor character named Professor E. Gadd gives him the tools he needs to rid the mansion of ghosts: a flashlight and a vacuum cleaner. The gameplay works well overall, and you'll really feel like a Ghostbuster has you master exposing ghost's hearts with your flashlight and sucking them up. The mansion is basically one huge, multi-floored dungeon, so it's a great thing that you have a functional map. The best parts of the game are the ghosts where you have to figure out how to expose their heart. All-in-all, Luigi's Mansion is quite a fun game and can now be enjoyed for quite a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This was a fun game i beat it in a weekend.

The shipping time was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!","review":"Even though this game is short, and a bit repetitive, it doesn't get boring. Even after you've completed a bunch of the rooms, the Boos you release provide some replay value. I just got to the final boss, and I haven't been able to beat it. It's a lot of fun. The visuals are impressive, but there isn't a lot of music. The mansion isn't quiet however, as the ghosts pop up and holler to make Luigi yell, and there's some frantic music when you vacuum up the ghosts. Luigi hums and whistles a tune nervously as you roam the halls, and he calls for Mario when you press A. It's one of the better launch titles, and an enjoyable walk through a haunted mansion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chase, vacuum, unlock, repeat...","review":"Having been brand-loyal to Nintendo since the launch of the NES, my purchase of both the Gamecube and Luigi's Mansion was pretty much a given. While the game looks and sounds *spectacular*, the actual play is mind-numbingly boring. You chase ghosts. You vacuuum ghosts. You unlock doors. Repeat until either game is beaten or you pass out. I would suggest purchasing another game (like Rogue Leader) to show off your new system, and then picking up a copy of LM off a place like ebay in a few months-- there's going to be a tidal wave of copies of this game that no-one wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame.......","review":"this game is horrible. it is fun the first time you go through it but after you beat it, it isn't fun at all. it takes about 4 hours to beat so please, please, please rent this game for a few days.

There are 50 boos you have to capture and they are a challenge to catch. The annoying thing is that the boos keep on running from room to room and you have to go and chase it. They won't stay in one place! The graphics aren't all that great either. Some of the ghosts need to just go away because they pop up every 5 seconds. You get to defeat a boss ghost after each level. You will most likely get stuck, so I would highly reccomend buying the player's guide to help you. Overall, this is a fun game but it is a little dissapointing. It may be fun for a younger child to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward &complicated","review":"Either I am getting too old or the Mario and Luigi games are wayyyy to complicated these days. I have played my game only about 5 times and I finally have given up. The controls to run the poltergust are just way too awkward.

Why can't we just get back to eating mushrooms and saving the princess .........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the expected Mario quality","review":"This game doesn't compare to the other Mario games. Although the story sounds cool, there just isn't much exitement in sucking up ghosts with a vacuum cleaner. It's very monotonous; there aren't really any different places to go and although the ghosts vary in color and shape, they all basically work the same. It's more frustrating than challenging. I don't know - the areas and ghost-sucking may not bore you like it bored me. Perhaps one of the few good sides to this game is that it's interesting and unique. But the game play is definatly missing something. Koopas maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.....but not the best","review":"It was a fun game at first but then it got boring after doing the same thing over and over.The graphics were great I have to adimit,and the controls were too.But it's just not the kind of game for me I would recommend renting it but not buying .Overall this is one of those games that you might want to check out but not buying it,and luigi by himself is no fun !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luigi's first Starring Role!","review":"This game has excellent lighting and good graphics.

My question is: do you play the games with closed eyes or do you write reviews at random?Those two game have a COMPLETELY different gameplay, so if you expected a platformer, you are gonna be disappointed. Luigi plays in 2D (although the display is in 3D), it is a very old school game. The graphics are good but the engine slows down and glitches, and the framerate is a mere 30fps. The gameplay itself is fun and easy to pickup, but extremely repetitive. And it takes 4 hours to finish the first time.I bought this game in Japan in September before any review was out. If I had known I would not have bought it. Save your money for real games like SSBM and Rogue, you can find free 3D demos on the net for free and much better than Luigi Mansion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the part with the hose","review":"the hose is a pretty good part. the ghosts are in there and thats how you know you beat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"At most, a rental","review":"Hopefully, this isn't the new standard of Nintendo games.

You have to beat it like 3 times in order to say you have really beaten the game4)okay, saving the day and your brother... WITH A VACUUM??? That's way too \\"outside the box\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Nintendo ever speak?","review":"I bought this as a Xmas gift for my niece. But I thought I'd try it myself because I've enjoyed every Mario related game to date. This was my first experience with Gamecube. I don't see any big advantage with this game over any older NES system. I was really floored to see that the characters still speak with quote bubbles and not with a voice! Come on...get with the new age of video games! Graphics were nothing to write home about either. I was bored in a matter of minutes. I'd rather play one of the other Mario titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luigis mansion","review":"Luigis mansion is the first game for the GC, that came out in 2001. Just compare the last N64 game to this game and it is amazing that the graphics became that good in just a short amount of time. It is also to this day the only lugi game that he is used the whole game. I mean this is the first game with a luigi title and u r always luigi in the game. But anyways the purpose of the game is Luigi wins a mansion that happeneds to be haunted and u r supposed to save mario that has been kiddnapped by the ghosts and luigi (who u r) has a vaccumn that sucks the ghosts up and u get either hearts or coins when u suck them up. The more powerful the ghost , the harder is is to suck them up. In order to suck them up u have to shine the flashlight at them and when u see their heart and the health under it u have to be quick to suck them up before they disappear. Overall this is a very good stratergy game but however it is not multiplayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"boo!","review":"luigi's mansion is very scary.It has ghosts. It even have some ghosts that look like women,men,boys,& girls.You have a vacume to vacume the ghosts.There is even a gameboy that tells you what things that are. If you use the gameboy on a mirror,then the mirror will be blocked by blue circle then you will spin,then you will end up at the room you begin at each level. I only got up to level 2. That level you need to find all the boo's to unlock doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"This is a good game, and is the perfect starter game if you just bought a gamecube but once you beat it ... you don't play it again (at least for me). This and Super Smash Bros. Melee were the first games I got with the cube and it didn't take very long to beat it. It's a fun game featuring Luigi who rarely gets the credit he deserves but it's just not hard enough. If it took longer to beat or if it were as fun and innovative as the Zelda or Mario series, I might want to play this more. The main reason I got sick of this game is that the whole thing takes place in the manshion, there really is no worlds or temples. Really, it's not as good because it doesn't take that long to explore the whole place. In all, this game is more worth renting once or twice until you beat it then buying it. Unless you are a cube or Mario series fanatic like me, this isn't really worth your money just for the fact that it's too easy to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and for the whole Family","review":"Our whole family sat around and all helped beat this game. It was fun. Great game even for the younger ones. There isn't much to go back to once you have beaten the game. You get a new mansion and a rating. Everything else is pretty much the same. The kids go back and play it once in awhile usually just when their friends come over and want to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ten hours of play?! What!","review":"well, i bought this game about 3 months ago and i got bored with it after about 2 weeks. it was really dissapointing. there is only one drawback to this game but it is huge. for the average gamer there is only about ten hours of play time until you beat the game. But, otherwise the game has great graphics and good play control, but that still cannot make up for the actual game length. My advice? DONT BUY IT. its not worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts don't leave shadows but Luigi does!","review":"I think this game is perfect in every way especially the shows made by lights. Such as the flashlight, shine it on furniture then look behind the furniture. You see a perfect shadow. Also all the ghosts when they appear scare Luigi and sometimes me too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luigi goes solo, Ghostbusters style","review":"I'd say this is a fun game. It is a puzzle/adventure game in which you catch ghosts using a flashlight and a vaccuum. That's right. A vacuum. Despite the plot, there is really nothing scary here, but there is a good, medium difficulty adventure. Catching ghosts means exposing their weak spot and then vacuuming them in a fishing style. Buy it used or rent it. It's very short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to see Luigi, not Mario for once and it's really fun!!!","review":"I remember when this game launched with the Gamecube. I thought it looked childish, but to my amazement I loved it. Some of the story isn't original but its like playing Ghostbusters just with a vacuum cleaner. A very fun game but too short in my opinion. This is a must buy for all Gamecubers. Best of all its only twenty bucks!- TONY"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games Ive ever played.","review":"This is a great game.Although a little too short this game is pure unaldureated fun. Ive never played a game this fun before except for Sonic Adventure DX. There are plenty of ghosts and rooms and is irresisibly clever. The plot of this game is simple and to the point.Luigis won a mansion and it ends up to be filled with ghosts and hidden in a special room a mechanical Bowser is being controlled by King Boo. At the end of every level a boss ghost awaits and those are really fun to play against too. There are also Gallery ghosts,blue ghosts,hidden rooms and golden mice. Toad will help you save your progress and E Gadd is your insructor. I think its a great game and a must have for any fan of Mario and Luigi."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 Stars!!!! almost 4-- not finished the game yet","review":"I must say, It is a slow game to get into!! As some of the other reviewers said, it takes a while to master the controls.I'm only on level 4 and reading the cheats have missed alot so keep your eyes open!The first level the last ghost (the baby) is, in my opinion, the hardest top ghost (Don't know how to describe) to beat! It is soo frustrating.. but as you get going.. it gets better..There are SO many twists and cool things to descover...I can't give this game an honest review but so far.. It's been pretty goodLastly... word of adviceAt times you may just want to lierally kill the game but just keep on going.. it gets better!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mystrey game","review":"This game is a great game for people who love mystreys!The ghosts are fun to catch.The Boo system is cool!The portit and boss ghosts-it's fun to know their weakesses.The reson that I gave it 4 stars is knowing their weakess-it's hard!But besides that,this game is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fair game, but it won't hold your interest...","review":"This is a fairly good game, definitely worth rental, but perhaps not as a purchase. The game in itself is not difficult, nor does it require any extensive skill to beat. However, it does get very repetitive quite quickly. A simple formula of \\"Suck up ghosts+get key=unluck next room\\" is the basis of the entire game. While it is fun in the beginning, the complete lack of variety can ultimately kill any motivation of the gamer to continue playing.I DID enjoy the game, and am glad that I had the chance to play it. It will appeal to many different types of people, and I do therefore recommend it. But, I strongly suggest you rent it first, that then may be enough to satisfy you. It eliminates needlessly spending a decent amount of money on a game that may only hold you for the first few days.--Lauren"},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving Up the Ghost? I Think Not!","review":"This is the most awesome game. The graphics are unreal. The way the shadows follow the flashlight and the way you can see Luigi's breath make this game so realistic. The ease of control in this game is great. I consider myself video game challanged but managed to manuever easily. (I am an old Sega Genesis 3-button user.) I also enjoy the fact that you need to check rooms several times after they have been cleansed. It's fun just to find treasure. The Luigi's Mansion strategy guide is a must have to find all the secrets hiding in this game. The replay value on this game is high. Once you start, you cannot stop. So pop the popcorn and line up the pop (soda) before you start the game. To me, the fun factor is off the charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I probably wouldn't have bought this game when it first came out, but now that its a players' choice game, with a cheaper price tag...its worth it. Like everyone else said, this game doesn't really last too long, although I thought that it was really fun. You suck ghosts up with a vaccum device, and try to find Mario. It doesn't have much replay value, unfortunately. It was one I bought used and traded in for a new game when I was through. I'd probably recommend doing just that, buying it used, or renting it. But definitely play it! It's a refreshing change from normal ol' Mario games. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good...","review":"I bought this game two years ago. I stopped liking it after a month. When I beat it, it just got boring. If you are looking for a good game that will last a long time, this would not be a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not a game worth buying","review":"This was a rush finish so t could come out when Gamecube came out. The graphics are pretty good. It's basically the same music throughout the game. Sucking up ghosts in a vacumm gets old quick. Rent this game before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipped it","review":"I skipped renting or owning this game because it's only an hour long. I did not like what I saw when I played it in store, so I decided to never play the game again. Overall, it's just not Nintendo's best effort and is clearly a launch title that was rushed in the end so it could drop in stores the day the system did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Launch Game to get","review":"This game is the best, the detail is amazing.

There was no real challenge to it. The puzzles weren't even close to hard. For 50$ I would expect a game to take longer to beat. I think Nintendo was more concerned with graphics than the actual game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone over 15","review":"I played this when I went home over Thanksgiving and I must say I was diappointed. Sure, the graphics are nice, but the rest of the game is nothing to get excited about. The sound gets annoying, the gameplay is boring, and the entire game is far far too easy. I've been losing faith in Nintendo ever since zelda 64 came out. Their games are too simple and too easy to have any extended use, other than a few games. If you're looking for another mario 64, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer","review":"Anyone who has heard Don Carlos knows he possesses something magical inside and is able to translate that through music.

A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can I be the first??","review":"Considering Don Carlos is an absolute legend in Reggae I can't believe I'm the first one to review this album. But, don't take that as a negative sign because thats not the case at all. This album is amazing. The track list if full of classics and is definitely a disk you can listen to all the way through. The sound quality is quite good and Don Carlos just flows from one song to the next. If you are a fan, you should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"i have lived in japan for the last 20 years, having completed my doctorate in japan, and being married to a japanese woman. i feel as though i may have some qualification to comment on this book, as opposed to the neo-japanologists who may have only spent a year or two in japan. i really enjoyed this book for what it is, a light-hearted and humorous account of a bicycle trip through japan. her accounts are spot on, and i find them even more so after all this time. i cannot agree that she has a racist outlook to the japanese or demeans them in any way. it is just an author describing what she sees, not what you want her to see. i find this refreshing and do not see the need to subscribe to a politically correct format in her style of reporting. she seems a regular person who is out to enjoy a bike ride without the politics.all in all i can recommend this book for anyone who wants a great travel read or an insight into japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNGODLY WONDERFUL","review":"All I can say is that this book was soo enlightneing and interesting that I have read it 4 times. The excitment, the wonder the thrill as Josie deepens and increases her significant knowledge of China and enlightens the reader upon the kind, thoughtful and always welcoming folk who live there. It makes me want to grab my bike and head west tomorrow.If you want a good read that is quite deep, but at the same time very light even thought it is a pretty long masterpiece, I suggest you pick a copy up. You'll be thrilled excited and educated all at once. A work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a point?","review":"This kind of book give travel books a bad name, and the reputation of being written by less than brilliant wandering nitwits. Long-winded, shallow and silly, although she pretends to add depth by paraphrasing standard Japanese history lessons and listing a farily accurate Japanese vocabulary section in the rear. No new, ground-breaking observations, just the same stuff that has been said a thousand times, in a thousand ways about 20 years ago. Don't bother, unless you are some sort of a mystery of the Orient... Even then, you'll be sorely disappionted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced","review":"I bought this new at a Borders about 4 years ago and paid about $60.

Trite, annoying, confusing, and most of all boring beyond reason. I have enjoyed Shymalan's previous films, each of the last four - but this is ridiculous. Stay away from it. I am grateful to myself that I didn't spend money to see it in the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bedtime story will definitely put you to sleep","review":"This is one of the most dreadfully boring films I have seen in quite some time. It is 100% talk about nothing really. Fairy tales are supposed to be fun and entertaining stories for children. There is not a child in the world that could sit through this torture. Koreans should be furious with the director for trying to pawn this jive off on them as a fairy tale from the \\"Far East.\\" Hooey! This plays out like a 2-hour Benneton commercial. Any reviewer that lists this as fun, entertaining, inspiring, or excellent had to have been paid off. Blatant lies. Don't say you haven't been warned. I lost my $7.50 so you won't have to lose yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie, totally silly!","review":"I remember the trailor for this one. They made it look like a horror movie. It is not! I watched the movie about 4 weeks ago, and all I got out of it was disappointment. The movie is nothing but a silly fairytale. Nothing scary about it at all. The creature things don't even bother anybody really in the entire movie. Oh, and by the way, they look ridiculous. They are badly computer generated in the film. Pretty much if you are over the age of 8 or 9, you probably will not like this movie. Unless you are in to fairy tale type movies. Even then, the movie still doesn't make any sense at all. The movie pretty much bored me to sleep. I give it really a 0, but you can only go as low as 1, darn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been","review":"This is a very talky film, interesting in some respects, but script flawed and technically quite annoying. There are many long scenes of people just sitting/standing around and talking. Following the thread of the film was difficult.Worse was the SOUND!!! When a camera moved in close, the actors whispered, often barely moving their lips. My wife, with acutely good hearing, could hardly make out any of such speeches. In one early and very important explanatory scene, the person explaining was speaking Japanese (?) while her daughter translated, both speaking loudly at the exact same time! What could the director have been thinking??? Idiocy.This is becoming all too common in films over the past 10 years or so as actors, directors and technicians strive for \\"reality.\\" What they lose, however, is communication to the audience. If you can't be heard or understood, you might just as well never have been in the film or on a stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"People seem to have lost the ability to enjoy simple movies.","review":"My Mom and I watched this when it came out on dvd. Upon completing the movie, I turned to mom and said I wished these were the kind of bedtime stories she had been told. It is sad when people loss that child in them and cannot see the wonder. In my mind this was one of Shyamalans' best movies. We all need to be reminded to come together for the aid of others. I think Shyamalan didn't really get the credit he deserved.In a world of violence and hate, this was a very refreshing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I just saw this on DVD. I wanted real hard to like it, because I thought after his first three movies he had become a genius, \\"Signs\\" was perfect in ways, and I really didn't think \\"The Village\\" fell off that much.Unfortunately, everything that's been said about this movie is correct. It had zero payoff, she flies off with the friggin' eagle, so what? There were way too many characters, no wonder the tenants couldn't figure who was suppose to fill what role. And the whole thing was so complicated I didn't care if the lawn monster ate them all by the end. All in all, it (gulp) sucked.The guy can make movies, but after this let's hope he gets some help with scripts. Even Hitchcock didn't write all his own material. Well, he's still very young, we'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Healing Fantasy","review":"Right now is a perfect time for the message of this movie. It will make people think about healing, having a higher purpose and being a catalyst for change. Anyone who feels connected to the Universe, believes that every person has a purpose and is interested in healing should see this movie to decide for themselves. Please try not to compare it to previous movies by this director. Lady in the Water is very different yet contains many of the elements typical of his style. The lighting, music, acting, remarkable mix of characters and suspense mixed with occasional humor was excellent. Admirers of Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard will not be disappointed. Lovers of fantasy will embrace the story of another realm, evil creatures, heroes and mystical events. Expectations were high and critics were less than complimentary so this movie may not have initially done well in the theatre but it will find its own audience over time by word of mouth. Spread the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this....","review":"What an awful and silly movie!

This one will get watched again and again.

Also read the book about the making of (and almost non making of) Lady in the Water which intrigued. Love Bryce Dallas Howard. She being the title \\"Lady\\" I was interested to see this. LITW tries to create a new mythological story, and it is ultimately a messy failure on all levels except the acting (from all seasoned professionals at least). It is not moving, it is not scary, it is not thrilling, it is confusing and pointless. Scatterbrained would have been a better title. Whatever has gone wrong with M Night apparently started well before the making of this film. It is sad and inexplicable, but this movie does not continue his streak of hits, it is a turd sandwich from a formerly talented chef - do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flop long overdue","review":"Shaymalan's winning streak had to end somewhere, I suppose this one is it. The sixth sense and Unbreakable were masterpieces, following which was a gradual decline. If Shyamalan wants to establish himself as the Alfred Hitchcock of our time, he will have to choose better stories. I think Shayamalan is enormously capable but his success will depend on his staying ahead of viewers' expectations. If the viewers are expecting a big twist, he will have to deliver an even bigger twist! Sorry, but that's how he has ended up casting himself, and it's upto him to live upto it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Man may have forgotten how to listen\\"","review":"This interpretation of a bed time story that first introduces characters weirder than the ones in \\"Batteries Included.\\" We are lead to believe they are all in some sort of transition in life and are given a purpose. On the surface they are helping a fairytale character get back to her world.The film has a \\"B\\" movie knockoff of a Spielberg feel. Every time they look up you expect a bicycle crossing the moon.The characters and the actors look like cardboard knockoffs of famous actors more than people. Bryce Dallas Howard in make up looks like a young Tilda Swinton.Then \\"Whisper in the Noise\\" mangles a great Dylan song \\"Times are a Changing\\"Grate concept - pitiful execution.Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Giamani - GET OUT OF THE WATER!","review":"I am a big fan of Paul Giamani ever since \\"Sideways\\". He is a funny actor. I couldn't quite take him seriously in this movie. This was not supposed to be a funny movie, but I found myself laughing at the most inappropriate times. He just didn't belong in this B movie. The whole story sounded as though a group of kids had made it up as they went along with no real meat to it. I found myself asking, \\"And the point of the movie was?????\\" To Paul Giamani: You need a new agent. You're wasting your talent. There are better movies out there for you, dear! But thanks for a few laughs in an otherwise BAD movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why... you're not a wizard at all !!","review":"This is the second clunker in a row from this formerly great director who seems to be drowning under the weight of his reputation.Everyone loved \\"The Sixth Sense.\\" I also loved \\"Signs\\" and even the slow paced \\"Unbreakable.\\" But \\"The Village\\" however, left me cold.This movie was an attempt at a modern fairy tale but it fails miserably. There is no sense of wonder and you get that feeling from the major characters themselves. It is dry, flat and, at times, derivative. The title of my review is an example of that and it will be familiar to those who have actually watched the film and recognize the scene which borrows from many fantasies at once. Perhaps this was his intention. If so, he did not pull it off in a way which makes us smile. Just groan.The ending, which I suppose was meant to be inspirational, was just plain silly. Too convoluted. Fairy tales are not supposed to be like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound was horrible......","review":"I guess this one was for theater viewing only. I had to blast the sound because the character Story always has to whisper. Other background sounds and music were blasting because the volume was so high. I have no idea why this was done. M. Night Shyamalan was good in the movie. I was surprised by him but Noah Gray-Cabey was the best actor by far. June Kyoto Lu is pretty good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This is possibly one of the best examples of early success going to the head of a budding egocentric.I thought Signs, Unbreakable, The Village were pretty good and of course the Sixth Sense was great.

They will have to defeat grass monsters by staring them in the eyes, and that will be pretty much it for action. They will have to other wise clean pools, repair toilets, and make cell-phone calls for the entire rest of the movie.No action scenes whatsoever!The bludgeoning simplicity of the tale made it so silly.There weren't even any fairy creatures.(You can see more of the Grass Monster in the trailer than you can in the movie.

The story is complex, and the specifics are difficult to follow because much of the key dialogue is mumbled by the two lead actors. You can cut the multicultural political correctness with a knife. And the computer monsters are designed for people under 15. Oh, it's all so scary and creepy. But not for grownups. Perhaps the larger point to make about the film is that people are hungry to believe--in virtually anything except Christianity with its moral demands.

Determined to find some value, we watched it to the bitter end, and thus lost 2 hours of our life we can never reclaim, The whole movie was pointless, goofy and more camp than scary or realistic or even mystical, and we left laughing thinking \\"what WAS that?\\". Though the 4-5 year old girl sitting next to us was a bit more alarmed - definitely NOT a film to take a child to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewers' herd mentality","review":"When this film first appeared, critics were tripping over one another trying to come up with the most scathing review. Any positive review was seen by the critical herd as naive at best. I've seen one or two films that I would consider near perfect, and at worse I judge this one as average. However, I consider this movie better than most of the dreck coming out of Hollywood these days. Featuring some truly transcendent scenes, the story line itself was at times vague and required some insight to follow. And \\"insight\\" is a key to following and understanding this film. Like most movies, this one has it's flaws but it also conveys singular beauty and compassion. The very unique nature of this film and its fairy tale subject can open it to fierce criticism, but an open, intelligent person will find much to like about \\"Lady in the Water.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lazy day movie","review":"I thought it might be depressing at first with the setting bu, it turned out to be acute movie with original charaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"Paul Giamatti is great in this film, as he has been in every film I've seen him in. Giamatti is pretty funny and there are some other humorous moments in the film, but they are the only positives about this film, and the only thing that save it from getting a 1 star rating from myself. The story itself is just silly, I really can't think of a better word to describe it. The most ridiculous plot hole, and one of the worst plot holes I've ever seen, is the fact that every character that comes along and is told about this crazy story unfolding at their apartment complex just believes it, don't question it in anyway, and just go along with this silly fairytale as if they live in lala land and it's all perfectly normal. A really bad film with some funny lines and moments, but not worth wasting your time on in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good and enjoyable, but sound quality is occasional distraction","review":"The directing and camera work are very good in this movie. The storyline is interesting: a modern day fairy tale. Occasionally the sound was so quiet that it was impossible to hear the actors -- this was a streaming movie, so I don't know how the DVD would be. Overall it was a very enjoyable movie and I would recommend it to others. Paul Giamatti is a tremendously talented actor and gives a superb performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"i adore this movie","review":"i was so intrigued with this movie the first time i saw it and have watched it many times since then. i love the hidden messages, the mood created, the relationships, i love m. night's writing style, just everything. this is one that i go to any time i get a couple hours to just do nothing. i highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look under the surface","review":"To appreciate this brilliant film, look under the surface. Yes, the story is far-fetched and totally unbelievable, but it's supposed to be, because it's a fable.My life has been in the dumps for the last five years due to a divorce coupled with a fruitless desire for a woman I can't possess. This film is about overcoming grief, hardship, and disappointment, about finding or rediscovering a purpose for living, for going on. Very important also is the idea of looking around and taking stock of the people in your life. It just so happens that I've had people right under my nose for the longest time whom I've not taken the time to appreciate, people who care about me and want to see me become a happier, healthier person.I bought this film on a lark and I'm awfully glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Give this a Zero if Possible!","review":"I liked most of M. Night's previous films--even The Village was bearable. I have seen a lot of movies (probably too many!) and you'll have to just trust me here--this movie is terrible! It's not even bad in a good sort of way, the way Nicolas Cage's Wicker Man is bad/hilarious. This movie fails on every level--do not be lulled by reviewers who urge you to experience the perfect wonderment of M. Night's magical watery world. You will bitterly regret wasting 1.5 hours of your life on this. If you feel you need to see this utterly ridiculous film, I urge you to rent it and not buy it--you won't want it in your permanent collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I am a fan of \\"Sixth Sense,\\" but I think that M. Night Shyamalan has made the mistake of believing his own hype. This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, although the cinematography is well-done. The acting is awful, considering the otherwise mostly talented cast. The story is thin, and making (and watching) this movie is essentially a waste. The extras on the DVD aren't any improvement on the movie: they're either full of self-important silliness or just outright corny.Before you ask why I spent time watching the movie and DVD extras, I was watching it with my family, and with every passing minute, I was sure the movie would get better. Then, when the movie didn't get better, I thought the extra features would be worth watching. Wrong again.The movie does have a message, but you have to muddle your way through murky waters (pun intended) to get it, and you should just spare yourself the aggravation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable and thought provoking.","review":"My 19 year old son went and saw this movie and came home talking about how great it was. So my wife and 20 year old daughter went, and came home talking about how great it was. My wife insisted on seeing it again, and taking me with her. I'm glad I went. It is a fun, humorous, and very thought-provoking movie. Although I would agree that M. Night Shyamalan is a much better writer and director than he is an actor, I'd put this movie in my top 10 list of fantasy movies, noting that it is deeper (no pun intended) than most films in the genre. Suspend your disbelief, ignore the critics, and enjoy it. Thank you, Mr. Shyamalan, for another great movie experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i could","review":"get my money and my time back---all was wasted on this horrible movie!!!i think he needs to go back to having only CAMEO'S of himself in the movies he makes -- can you imagine, he would have destroyed the village, and the sixth sence if he decided to take on a major role!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful-Just Awful","review":"Just watched this movie.

I hope he gets his edge back as he has some talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth blue ray","review":"Its quite a nice story, but the picture is not worth the money for a blu-ray disc. - Also the sound on my DVD is not exact synchronized with the picture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"In my opinion, M. Night Shyamalan's movies have been on a steady decline since Sixth Sense. I didn't think it could get any worse after The Village, but he proved me wrong. This movie is PAINFUL. I don't know who this film was made for. It's a fairy tale to stupid and unbelievable for adults and too boring for kids. Bryce Dallas Howard's \\"prince\\" in this movie is the bald, fat, stuttering Paul Giamotti. Giamotti is a great actor, but he cannot carry a film as a lead. M. Night Shyamalan is known for having great twists at the end of his movies, but this one has no surprise ending which leaves the viewer wondering, \\"What was the point of this movie?\\"As for the blu-ray, this is the most underwhelming picture I have yet to see on a blu-ray. The colors are drab and dirty. There is no \\"pop\\". The film is grainy, flat, and dull (it is a BD-25 encoded in MPEG-2. The audio is all over the place too. I had to constantly adjust the volume on my system so I could hear all of the whispering."},{"rating":"1","title":"M. Night is Losing His Touch. Opie's Daughter Isn't Scarey.","review":"I think he has a crush on her and it is clouding his ability to direct. Or maybe his narcisism has swelled so much that he is more concerned with trying to be clever than trying to be good. This movie is so dull that I didn't even finish watching it. I would reccomend Sixth Sense or Signs in a heartbeat but his downhilll slide began with The Village and keeps getting more and more lame with Lady in the Water. And Paul Giamatti? What is wrong with this guy? In every movie he has women throwing their clothes off and he gets upset about it. And the only people scaerd of him are makers of fine merlot."},{"rating":"1","title":"biggest waste of time and film ever","review":"All I can say is that Mr. Shamalamadingdong blew it with this movie.

Terribly written, poorly cast. Shyamalan goes as far as to make himself one of the main characters. It was laughably bad at more than one point. It could have been a good movie. The premise was ok, the idea behind the story was ok, but it was so horribly executed. All I can think of is a bunch of rich studio execs flipping through dollar bills hoping no one figures out how awful the movie is before they blow their $10 on it this weekend. What a waste of time. Don't waste your money. Tell the film studios that this guy shouldnt be able to make movies anymore!*sigh*..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I've been a big fan of Shyamalan's other films. I even enjoyed The Village, which many did not like. But this movie is complete garbage. It's obvious why Disney wouldn't make it - it's a jumbled mess of storytelling with no real point and no interesting characters. The script attempts to force you to think of the characters as interesting but throwing in characters like a guy that only works out on one side of his body is not creative or compelling, it's lame. If you watch the extras on the DVD you'll see that pretty much every actor took a flyer on this movie and committed without reading the final script just because it's a Shyamalan movie. He won't get that kind of respect from actor's on his next project. Not after this embarassment. I'm so glad I only wasted 4 bucks by renting it instead of buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Believe.","review":"I hate cynics, and I hate cynicism. Nothing drives me crazier than people who can't seem to stomach a story without some sense of irony, and people who can't have a little simple faith. Until now, I wasn't sure Night Shyamalan had it in him to take a leap of faith and make a movie without a ridiculous twist ending (okay, Unbreakable's twist ending didn't betray the entire nature of the film like The Village, but I digress)..but this film shows that he can do just that.People hated this movie, I think, precisely because it frustrates expectations; because it shatters the box that viewers had put Shyamalan into prior to the film's release. He was 'the twist guy', the 'I see dead people' guy. This isn't that kind of movie. There's no twist here. There IS magic here, and dare I say--there's even truth here.I could watch this movie a million times. Thank you, Mr. Shyamalan. I believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, do not watch this movie.","review":"No I take that back. Watch this movie. I want you to buy it and fell free to invite all your friends to watch it at your place. Then when you have a house full of angry people serve an assortment of mixed drinks. Actually you may want to start serving those drinks within the first 5 min of the film and make sure you keep'em coming because your going to need them. I can best describe the experience of watching the lady in the water like this. Have you ever been with a group of friends in a casual setting and one of them farts. When it starts to stink up the room you'll notice every one is covering there nose gagging and carrying on but with a smile on every ones face as if to state that even though the odor that has emitted from ones anus is revolting and I can't breath I can some how find some humor in this moment. Yeah this movie is a lot like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time","review":"I rarely think that a movie is a waste of time, but this is just a two hour long stroke of the director's ego. There are some good performances and cinematography, but it doesn't overcome a terrible script and premise. Beyond that, M. Night Shyamalan casting himself as the visionary writer who will change the world is just insulting to the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most misunderstood movie","review":"This movie is flawed but charming, unrealistic yet touching. If you keep in mind that this is a fairy tale, I think most fantasy fans will like this movie.

I know I did, quite a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please end this movie. . .","review":". . .the actors do a fine job. The photography does not offend. The story (no pun intended) had some potential.I thought the movie would never end.In a nutshell, I would assume this is a like it or dislike it film (I can't imagine either love or hate for this.) My reason for disliking it is I could not empathize with most of the folks I thought I SHOULD empathize with. I found it, therefore, difficult to really care what happened next. There were some holes and incongruities in the story which could be overlooked, but required, in my case, that I KNOW I was overlooking them.For me, then, this story -- even though well \\"packaged\\" was too much work for too little reward.I gave it two stars because the acting was good, and the actors deserve to their due.

You know how we both complain about money then you MUST rent/buy/watch THE VILLAGE (TV) by the same writer/director/auteur M Night Shyamalan (his other films are UNBREAKABLE starring Bruce Willis, THE SIXTH SENSE & SIGNS starring Mel Gibson & Joaquin Phoenix). I plan to watch LITW again because it is so deep, complex, weird, funny, serious, eccentric & quirky. PLEASE ignore the bad reviews of LITW. Perhaps you should watch TV first to understand the themes Shyamalan delves & revels in. LITW is THE WEIRDEST search for meaning (strangest film ever I've watched wouldn't be far off the mark) in something beyond the secularity & rigours/rigidness of science, money, jobs or to put it bluntly: Western Society Inc Corp.

It has an amateurish feel throughout, and the story never very believable nor very engaging. You keep hoping the film will get better as you can sense its potential, but it never seems to take flight. It is unfortunate Shyamalan's name is on this bomb, because his other works are generally pretty good. It has a few entertaining moments, but in general this is a film to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazingly poor movie","review":"Not a good DVD to check out Blu-ray (often dark) and an amazingly poor movie.

I just didn't care what happened to the characters, so it was not frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairy tale not well told","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that the writing in \\"Lady\\" is inconsistent and contrived...which is unfortunate since the basic premise had merit: one character (the Lady) faces one set of demons to overcome while the protagonist (the doctor) has is own.

Period. The only reason the great cast didn't commit suicide yet is because they must be still spending the money they charge for appearing in this movie (?). M. Night Shyamalan writes, directs and, yeah, also act, not a simple cameo Hitchcock style as he used to do. I began to see this \\"Lady\\" three different times, and three times I quit in different parts of the movie. In my fourth I decided to finish seeing it and give it a fair opinion: yep, I lost my time, my money and my mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in the Water","review":"This movie is so stupid! It wasnt scary at all, and frankly I din't care what happened. The plot was ridiculous. That Night would appear in his own film as 'savior of the world' is shameless and shows an unbelievable degree of arrogance. ITs sad to think this could have been a great movie-COULD HAVE, but wasnt. I would only recommend this movie to someone who finds children's cartoons intellectually challenging. The plot was stupid,jumbled and confusing.The characters were uninteresting stereotypes.The momentum of the film was so poorly handled that there were no scary moments, and the monsters were not scary. I mean, a monster made of grass? Evil monkeys? Come on!! My 12 year old nephew, and I really mean this, could have written a more satisfying story. Night, I suggest you get some input before making millions of dollars worth of retarded farce.I cannot believe all the five star reviews that this movie is getting!!

Most people expect a horror film, I myself did too at first, but that's not what this movie is. The film is a tale of hope, healing and destiny filled with good characters, very nice special effects and a couple of twists (though if your familiar with movies you'll see most of them from a mile away). Both Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard do great jobs in their roles, as do the supporting cast. My only problem was the pace of the film it should have moved a little faster for me but other then that I highly reccommend this movie.Family movie for older kids, some scenes may alittle too intense/scary for younger ones (under7 or 8)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you think M.

This is just unwatchable. Anyone who ever wondered why Dick Cook at Disney tried to talk M.

And why Shamalan himself had a part in this crapfest is beyond me. When he was first introduced to the \\"sea nymph\\" he acted as if he was just reading off the back of a cereal box.

Surely it contained a moment or two in the 109 minutes worth the time even though it's gotten poor reviews? Well, let's not forget why reviews exist. They exist to warn us about movies like this, that have zero redeeming moments for 109 minutes.I can summarize the one glaring problem that derails every scene in this movie: the characters don't have a reaction to anything. If you want to watch a movie where no one asks a single realistic question about what the hell is going on, but just skips around like they are on a very special episode of Full House... go for it. It's just really lame, and after Signs and this I would say Shyamalan has made two of the worst movies I've ever seen.

I think that Mr. M. has his public fooled. It's like the story of the emporer's new clothes. None of his fans will really tell him how bad most of his movies are. The onlyfilm I seen so far, and I have seen them all, is theone about the aliens terrifying a farm somewhere.And how does he get the big time stars into his films.They had better review the old fairy tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"M's Last Chance","review":"After the critical and box office rejection of \\"The Village\\", this appeared to be M Night's last chance to redeem himself. After the failure of this film, it is doubtfull anyone will give him 50 million bucks and let him go play.The story commits the one sin a movie fan cannot forgive, it is boring. Forget about the fact that it is preposterous and makes no sense. I found myself straining to pay attention. Then silly jokes are thrown in. It was as if M was saying: \\"Ha, I got your money, now you have to put up with this crap\\".I will not see M's next film unless it is on every critic's top ten list."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN","review":"now not being a hudge fan of fiction i wasnt excited to see it in the first place but i decided to give it a chance it was horrible made no sense stupid ideas in it and u didnt know to laugh or not the ending was stupid it was pointless dont see it"},{"rating":"1","title":"another bomb 4 shymalan","review":"Another bad movie from M. Night. It is almost as bad as unbreakable, which is hard to do since unbreakable has the most anticlimatic ending of any movie i have ever seen. Anyway lady in the water is plain dumb. A water nymph needs help from some people who don't really do anything. Story, the water nymph, just sits around being pathetic and is supposed to be magical. If she was magical her powers were to be lame but cute. The story doesn't have any direction and i was just waiting for the thing to be over. Don't waste your money on this film. Not even worth the 4 for $20 isle at blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie failed in my eyes for the following reasons...","review":"I don't want to spend too much time trashing this movie. That would do it too much justice. Most people will be like me, and go see this movie despite the bad reviews, only because it is by M Night Shaymalan. To be sure, his Sixth Sense was superb, and Signs was very good. But with Village, and now this farce, it is clear that SHaymalan has lost something - the magic, or inspiration, that made his movies special.The average viewer wanted a mysterious, suspensful and sophisticated horror movie. This is a fair assesment, since a) the studio pitched the movie this way thru trailers and commercials b) Shaymalan is known primarily for creating such movies. What he gives us instead is a muddled, aimless tale that fails to engage the viewer and leaves us disappointed. Shaymalan cannot hope to survive many more such failures in the cutthroat movie industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie!","review":"I watched this with my two teenages and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was.

I would NOT recommend anyone to watch this movie, I would NOT recommend punishing your children by having them watch this movie.

After watching approximately 1,500 movies over my life this is EASILY 1 of the WORST movies I have ever wasted my time watching and I have watch a lot of bad movies.

Kind of spoils whatever the director was aiming for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful change","review":"Wow, this movie was not at all what I expected but I ended up loving it. True, a bit slow in parts, but overall, what a wonderful fantasy to get lost in, and what a nice change from all the regular Hollywood action-adventure-rock-em-sock-em-blood-and-guts stuff. Bryce Dallas Howard was the perfect choice for her role as Story...haunting and ethereal and completely enchanting. I expected this to be on the more \\"horror\\" side but I was more mesmerized and enchanted than frightened watching it. And I agree that M. Night Shyamalan was quite good in his role. C'mon, who hasn't been mystified my legends of mermaids and secret worlds below at one time or another? All in all, I think people will either really love it or really hate it, but it's worth opening your mind and giving your brain and your heart a little break from the norm. The theme of connectedness and that we all have a purpose in life was comforting and reassuring to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting poor plot","review":"I wanted to believe in the story but the acting and the plot were so poor I couldn't really get into the premise of this film. Too bad it had the makings of a good story at the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition)","review":"Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition) is a strange fantasy movie that centers around a handyman (Paul Giamatti) at Philadelphia apartment complex who discovers who discovers a naiad like creature named Story. The acting is not great and the storyline falters. The movie seems really long even though it only is 110 minutes, it seems much longer. It was universally panned by critics and was nominated for worst movie at the Razzie awards. It is not a 1 star movie but a since I can not give 1 and a half it gets a very weak 2. Not recommended. 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Could Change Your Life","review":"This movie is a love it or hate it given the number of 5 star and 1 star reviews. It was not critically acclaimed when it came out in theaters so I had low expectations. I liked this movie so much that I am writing my first movie review ever. I feel inspired now and I think that is the best thing that you can possibly get out of seeing a film. And if you end up hating it, it's less than 2 hours of your life spent. In fact if you don;t like it by the halfway point then go back to your miserable life you garbage eating parasite, because you won;t like the rest of the flick anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Film Buff's Kind of Movie","review":"You will either really like this movie or really hate it. I really like it. There are some fairly brief scary parts which make some folks classify this as a horror picture. But, it is a fairy tale in the way of a Grimm's story where you are scared for a bit and then warmed by the goodness to be found in it. There is artistry to found in every corner of this film and connoisseurs must make time to take a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but needs a better story","review":"I've enjoyed most all of M Knights films, but this one was agony to get through. I don't understand how a film can look so good visually, while at the same time having some of the most muddled, off-the-wall writing. While you could sortof follow along with the story in 'The Village' and 'Unbreakable', 'Lady in the Water' just made no sense from start to finish. It looked great, and the acting was fantastic, but what on earth was going on here? Nerfs? Shaggy, fake-looking CGI dogs? Ridiculous breath-holding sequences underwater?No. This wasn't Nights finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're expecting the 6th Sense you will be disappointed","review":"The 6th Sense was a brilliant film, Unbreakable and Signs were OK, Lady... is not even watchable. The dialogue is all exposition, it sounds like it was written by a first year film student. M. Night usually has a cameo in all his films ala Hitchcock. In this one he has a major part, a writer, a messianic figure who is doomed to die no less. A touch of ego? His stars try hard, and to give them credit they read their awful lines with as much heart as can be expected. Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor, but even he could not save this film. If you watch the \\"making of\\" feature, you are forced to think that they spent the entire budget on building a perfectly ordinary looking apartment building from scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't really say it was a dissapointment....","review":"because I had low expectations after hearing so many bad reviews. I liked all on MNS's other movies, even The Village, so I thought I'd at least like this one, especially because I'm obsessed with fairy tales. But there are so many plot holes and areas where I can't really suspend belief: mostly how everyone in the apartment building gets together to believe in a highly dubious fairy tale. The acting is quite bad, especially from the Asian punky girl who tells Giametti the \\"bedtime story\\" when he wonders what's going on...her performance is so much of an Asian characture that I find it offensive. And does anyone notice that the \\"Lady's\\" hair changes from redhead to blonde during the film, sans explination (or perchance, intent)? Altogether, it was sloppily done. There's an interesting story in there, but unfortunately it wasn't told very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A present for the whole family!!","review":"Terrific story to read aloud. Anyone who has ever visited FOA Schwartz or other giant toy store will appreciate this story about Molly and her Grampa. How to choose just one present??? You will enjoy this delightful tale, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"picture colors unimpressive, problems with stuck between modes","review":"I just went on vacation and took about 190 pics during all different lights and distances, used diff modes, and videos. I thought the camera and menus were easy enough to use, but the picture colors were just blah. Also I had 3 or 4 times in 2 days where the camera jammed with the lense open and zoomed out, but I had a black screen and it wouldn't turn on or off. I had to mess with it for quite a while and missed 5 to 10 minutes of pictures each time. I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible waste of money","review":"We have had this camera for only about 4 months and have used it sparingly since it is my husband's camera for use at work in case they need a photo of something. It is already broken. The lens won't extend and open when you turn it on- thus impossible to use. When you turn it off, the lens opens up. It is not worth even $99.00. How disappointing in this day of digital cameras that HP can't come up with something a little better than a disposable camera from the supermarket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic camera for the money.","review":"I've purchased over a dozen of these cameras for our field technicians. They are easy to use and take great photos. We have had issues with the battery cover integrity and displays that fail over time. Keep in mind these cameras are subject to quite a bit of abuse over their service life. I had one as a personal camera that was subject to a lot of shock. The display finally bit the dust but not after a couple of years of rough and tumble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personalized \\"get your fingers in shape\\" ribbon","review":"I like how these ribbons turned out, the print was not as crisp as I would have liked, but still feel the quality is worth four stars, especially considering the price. Now with that said, please be sure to read the description well.....I missed the part where the ribbon comes on a bolt and was a little surprised when I received them with 'assembly' required. I only had to put 40ct together so it wasn't too painstaking, however, if you plan to use these for a larger party make sure you have a team of little elves to help out. In the end, I really like how mine turned out and would definitely order them again for a future small event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Club Music","review":"If you are looking for Middle Eastern music with a heavy club beat to it, then you may like this CD. If you are looking for bellydance music, forget about this one. This does not even fall in to the contemporary bellydance music category, strictly club music. Taste varies, but in my opinion, a lot of the music on this CD lost a lot of its beauty by trying to make it more palatable to Western ears not used to Middle Eastern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting exploration of Pure Land and Chan Buddhist thought","review":"This book is actually a copy of a Chinese Buddhist text written centuries ago by Ou-I which explores a short but important Buddhist text called the Amitabha Sutra. The commentaries explore the sutra in depth and on multiple levels as seen through the eyes of Chan (Zen) Buddhist and delves into deep subject matters. As a late classic of Chinese Buddhism, this book is quite a thought-provoking read, and though somewhat short, worth the time. The views expressed here certainly reflect a more syncretic approach found in Chinese Buddhism than what might be found in the more popular Japanese Buddhism, but contains a lot of wisdom that can be applied by Buddhists in many areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sander, dust bag is an issue","review":"I received this sander about 3 years ago as a promo (when I bought a 12\\" Dewalt miter saw). Overall I like it A LOT! I use it for the last three grits of sandpaper prior to finishing. No issues with pads coming off etc... (I've heard of it happening with the PC brand). A real workhorse. Yeah, it has no case, but I just keep it in the box it came in...works for me (and has lasted 3+ years now!).Only gripe: The sanding bag clicks into a plastic fitting, that then SLIDES onto the unit. After a few hours of sanding (i.e. dust starting to clog the fabric, causing more pressure inside the bag), the thing shoots off, blowing fines everywhere. I just deal with it because I really like the sander regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good...","review":"I have had this sander for several yrs. now. When I first used it I thought it was better than the Porter-Cable and it was. This year I had alot of wood restoring to do. So I decided to look around to see if I could find something better in the sanding dept. You see prep and sanding is the longest part on projects such as these. Efficiency is what I'm after. I purchased the Ridgid 6 in. orbital. Variable speed/variable orbit, on and on. Hands down I got what I was looking for. Efficiency! If you think this dewalt is the ticket, you haven't shopped around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They call this a \\"book\\"?","review":"If you know anything about the JFK assassination investigation, you won't get anything from this work. This is for the greatest part a compilation of quotes from official sources. esp. the second US investigation which conluded that the murder was probably the result of a conspiracy. Otherwise, there is nothing new here, not a theory, not a piece of evidence. One would do a lot better reading Jim Marrs' CROSSFIRE, for example, or Summers' book also entitled CONSPIRACY. Both those works are book in their own right, which leave this pathetic little thing in the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurd -- but it worked!","review":"Ah - a book that recalls the days when people wanted to work for corporations! As a former employee of Bear Stearns who received some of the memos in this book, I can say that those memos created an atmosphere of comraderie and humor during the recession of the early '90s. Back then, Bear Stearns was considered a great place to work. Of course, Mr. Greenberg is not running the company anymore. At that time, BSC was one of the largest banking institutions in the world, and every level of employee was very proud of his or her role in the success of the company. I recommend this book for managers who need to remember who is really doing the work!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You may actually get the point of this book","review":"Yes, this book is repetitive, but that is what makes it so great. Ace Greenberg repeats the same message over and over again. He emphasizes, cut costs, hire people during the downtimes, forget about strategy development and he does so with humor. The employees at Bear were fortunate to have such clear communication from the top.Every leader and manager can learn from Ace. He shows you how to communicate with the troops, get your point across and get everybody marching in the same direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pithy sayings from a fertile imagination","review":"If you can weather a few cultural references that not be cheered in these days of political correctness, you will be treated to a book full of \\"ACE\\" Greenberg's exhortation to keep your eye on the ball. Mr. Greenberg makes his points to the \\"troops\\" by focusing on the smallest detail. In one case this is paperclips, and so it goes on from there. Several mythical characters live in Greenberg's memos, and so keep the reader's interest. All this is window dressing for the main point, cut costs, even in good times, and you will keep the wolves at bay when things get soft.An easy read, but worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"In sum: Cut expenses","review":"Say 'cut expenses' over and over and you get the point of this common-sense book. Also, tie knots in your rubber bands. But lick only half of an envelope so someone else can reuse the envelope and lick the other half? And did I mention that you should cut expenses? How can firms pay those absurd mulit-million-dollar bonuses and expect everyone to adopt these draconian measures. Most of us have been doing what Mr. Greenberg suggests--and more--as a matter of survival in a day when jobs come and go. BTW, to one-up Mr. Greenberg, I'm suggesting my firm go to once-a-day toilet flushings beginning 1/02. We also asked employees to only use two tines on a fork at lunch and share the other two with a co-worker, but we saw an adverse effect on our health premiums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, Unique... Like a trip back in time...","review":"The book is a inches-thick reprint from nearly a century ago, and is full of woodcuts, old poems, stories, recipes, etc. The author did his homework; there are references to folk tales and music and methods dating centuries back from there, with a prime focus around England (where Bickerdyke is from). Fortunately, it seems to have been reprinted a few times (mine dates from the '60s), so old copies are floating around.Why not a five-star rating? the info is not revised or updated with the reprints. Personally, that just adds to the charm, but you'll have to decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but SHEDS!","review":"This item is great feel-wise, but it constantly sheds its hair all over.

The book takes you from recce operations behind enemy lines to a full scale attack on the Yugoslav Federal Army near Osijek.

I remember getting this on Lp and being mystified at just how intent Klemperer is at the Bruckner thing. He never drags and moves things along, which somehow goes against everything people criticize in his conducting. The Philharmonia plays with great feeling and fervour. Wonderful woodwinds with Gareth MORRIS and Bernard Walton on clarinet. They just have the right tough of refinement for this epic music.Sadly there are few ensembles or orchestras today who could ever touch this in any way.

It could be used as a practice book for a more experienced writer.

Definitely changed my views on a lot of topics. Freire is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for a Policy Practice course","review":"Different time and place, but the issues discussed continue to impact individuals across the globe. I particulary enjoyed the introduction included in this new edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jabberwocky","review":"Like the famous non-sense poem, the book feels like it ought to make sense, but it never does. As you read, you will have the feeling of impending meaning, and that in the next paragraph, or on the next page, or in the next chapter, everything will come together and you will have your moment of clarity. Never happens.Whatever you think Paulo Freire means, you are wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly pernicious book","review":"This is one of those books that is so bad you don't forget it, because it is so misguided and pernicious. Freire thoroughly misreads Hegel and doesn't much understand Marx. It astonishes me that it is still in print: it has the dated quality of a mid-1950s Soviet textbook on Marxism-Leninism and more than a whiff of the arrogance of the messianic monsters who end up as Communist dicators. And the translation is lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-intellectual, poorly written tripe","review":"This book is like some kind of Bible to hard-core Lefties, but I think they must never have actually opened it and read what was inside. Freire wrotes admiringly of Mao's Cultural Revolution and Castro's Cuba, and quotes Lenin as a brother-in-arms. His bottom line seems to be that a pseudo-intellectual \\"revolutionary leader\\" like himself is the only sort of person who truly \\"understands\\" the \\"peasants\\" and can guide them to higher consciousness. The book is almost laughably poorly written, and incredibly pretentious and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it reads like a tract by some self-adoring Latin American left-wing dictator (like Castro) justifying his own grasp on power. A dangerous book, if only because it flaunts its own deep ignorance and if it did fall into the hands of people who didn't know any better they might actually believe some of this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Challenging","review":"I read this book for a graduate studies class. The critical padagogy Freire gives is excellent and we had deep discussions in class. The reading is challenging because some points are repeated and one wonders whether one is making any headway at times. The ideas re education are basic to understanding current educational trends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll make this short, he didnt.","review":"So many words to say so little. This book could have been three pages long and that would have been sufficient. He goes on and on on the same topics of what its like to be oppressed and what the oppressed must do to brake free from oppression. This is all very much common sence, at least it seems so to me, having taken a college class here and there. Marx is taken far out of context and this book altogether preaches a utopian way of things thats as far fetched as communism functioning in a capitalist society."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARVELOUS","review":"This was one of the hardest reads I have gone through in my young 16 years of life. And at the same time, perhaps the most rewarding. You wanta make change? You wanta be a revolutionary? Great intro to liberating yourself and those who are oppressed around you. DO NOT TRY TO COMPARE TO MARX. Though you can draw similarities, this particular work is just to different. Go read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reconstructing Gender - a multicultural anthology - fifth edition - Author Estelle Disch","review":"Used from the Miami University Bookstore; saved me money from buying new, approximately $30!

I am very satisfied with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all bad but not at all good","review":"This book seems to have been written by someone who did not want to be understood. He made some interesting points but at most times the structure and wording were incomprehensible. It is ironic that he talks about connecting with people in language they understand yet his writing is very inaccessible. I also thought he was a bit hypocritical in that he defends or overlooks the excesses and abuses of \\"revolutionaries\\". I guess in his view bad behavior is justified if it is in pursuit of an agenda that agrees with the his political views."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"Book came within the specified time and was in good condition.

If you like quirky, short ,instrumental music that is composed with some european folk, theater and circus elements in it, than this is for you. You get original compositions and an array of 'weird' instruments mixed up with 'traditional' rock instruments. The melodies are not easy to forget once you listen to them a couple of times, yet there is always a new discovery with the each listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did you ever find this DVD?","review":"Bought it as a gift, and the receiver was dumbfounded.

When he finds a pair of roller skates on a park bench, he practices with them for days. As his skating slowly improves, he also finds confidence to share his knowledge and feelings. The illustrations capture Sebastian's joy as his face and world brighten. Part of the book's charm is that change doesn't come immediately for Sebastian. He builds on small successes, and can hardly believe the wonderful changes in himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vendedor Recomendado","review":"buena entrega tal como lo decia la pagina y segun las caracteristicas q se mencionaban en la pagina ........ buen vendedor Recomendado"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odious.","review":"I couldn't wait to get the smell off of me.

Is there anyone, save the Marxian fanatic, who would argue that Karl Marx wrote with clarity and grace? English speaking readers often find even the great English political philosophers, such as John Stuart Mill, to be somniferous. Thus, a well-written history of Western political philosophy is not only welcome, but it is a relief. McClelland's \\"A History of Western Political Thought\\" is such a book. McClelland not only writes well, but he presents the story of political philosophy in an interesting and enjoyable way. Both the specialist and the general reader will profit from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional tool for rock/fossil and nature collectors","review":"I got one of these maybe 20 years ago as a present as I have been known to look for rocks, fossils, artifacts, and other similar objects for my collections.This tool is great!

The only problem is that my birds could not get the seed out. The feeder has a plastic funnel that you are to place on the bottom. The problem is that the seed gets caught up and the birds can't get to it. I usually feed my birds a fruit and nut blend and thought that maybe this was too chunky of a seed for this feeder - so I replaced the seed with regular sunflower seeds and had the same problem, the seed just didn't come down into the holes where the perches are. I then tried the feeder with the funnel flipped and all the seed poured out. I even tried it without the funnel and all the seed poured out. Not a good feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"As the famous review of Anthony Adverse went, similarly goes my review of this tedious little tape: \\"A Huge Mountain of Trash\\".

The series gets better with succeeding books and Robinson's writing style improves as well. This was a quick and easy read and not esplecially complex or difficult to figure out who did what. The fun thing about this book is learning about Banks. He is a likeable character worth finding out more about later in the series.

Sorry to say, I found the dialog stilted, the interactions of the characters not realistic or adult, and the women's lib angle poorly expressed. If it werent for the violence and sex, it'd be a better read for someone in junior high school. The professional characters, like the chief inspector and the psychologist, seem awfully inexperienced for people in those kinds of jobs. Part of the reason it seems corny is that it doesnt stand up well after 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Good introduction to this Yorkshire series of which 'In a dry season' is the best-- but this is not far behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5-year old Loves it!","review":"For a young girl with a simple fascination with horses, this is a cute game. However, I can see how horse aficionados may not be totally satisfied with 'realism' issues. It is not Pixar, but the graphics and realism are probably adequate for the intended audience.My daugher was able to complete the game with some assistance in about 1 1/2 hours. Now she's playing again on her own. She enjoyed customizing her hourse and picking outfits for Barbie.The game worked fine on my daughters Windows XP/Celeron system.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Horses+Easy Puzzles= BORING!","review":"Well, what can I say? You're supposed to be racing through a canyon against this girl when your horse can't go faster than a canter.I ride, and compared to a gallop, cantering is way slower than galloping. And the \\"challenges\\" are too easy. They are all basically the same. You have to do a thing where there are bags or objects that you can only delete if there are 2 or more side-by-side. And it always ends the same. There is a different criminal, but the horse is always in the same place. My little sister figured the game out by herself, and she is only 6! This is a very easy game, that looses your attention easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute game but for 4 to 6 year olds","review":"Based on other reviewers comments of their younger children liking this game I bought it for my daughter on her 4th birthday.Game installed without a hitch on XP.

I finished it in about an hour!! Its completely unrealistic to real riding for the older kids but for the little kids, they might like it. For example, you have to go fast to jump a fence, that's so not true (even though I only have a year's riding experience) I have jumped a pole at a trot about 6 inches off the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money.","review":"Let me start off saying this game is too easy! I was 9 or 8 years old when I got it........ but the part I remember most was that I finished this game in and hour! I'M SERIOUS! This game will be challenging and fun for the very young mind. I suggest you get this game if your under 8. Another thing is that all the barbie horse games are the same........you go on trails, jump your horse, unlock levels, blah blah blah. If you do get a barbie horse game I would get the one for playstation...though that one isn't fully satisfying either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I have to say I really enjoyed this book.

Directions were wrong for installing the loctaing pins but it wasn't hard to figure out. U-bolts are extremely long- a deep socket will not be long enough but even with using a wrench or ratcheting wrench it's not too bad. Also, the stock lift blocks will have to be notched for the U-bolts to fit properly-again, not a big deal.

This can be a great addition to other poem books, like Seuss and Silverstein. I remember giving this to my teacher to read to us. I remember the kids in the class loving it jsut as much as I did.

Not all Prelutsky's books have seemed worth bringing home from the library, but these two are really fun. My child does not like most books, even good children's poets, so we are very harsh critics.This is poetry I read to my son to expand his vocabulary - it's got too many new words to be much fun to read alone. So much so that because the 1994 paperback version of Sheriff is subtitled \\"read alone\\" I wonder if it's the same collection.

Details are glossed over for generality, hiding the range of experience of the population during the periods discussed. Summary points are close to modern folklore in their discussion. There is no consideration of the individual in his environment; instead there is a removed observation from a point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you have a dehydrator","review":"A worthy book; however, a careful reading reveals that many of its recipes require the cook to \\"dry [various ingredients] in your dehydrator.\\" This should not be a surprise to anyone who hits the trail often, but don't spend money on this book unless you have a dehydrator and are reasonably adept at operating it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that useful and perhaps not that lightweight","review":"I am in charge of packing the food for my sister and I each Spring and Fall for ten days in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

But my major concerns are weight, nutrition, and taste. I found many recipes contained WAY too much sodium and some just seemed ridiculous. I think we could all figure out that we could buy black bean mix and slap it on a tortilla or put a piece of cheese on a Triscuit. Maybe less time could have been spent on cute names and more time on food that didn't involve purchased mixes and ramen noodles.There are much better books out there, so shop around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dehydrators","review":"I should have paid more attention to the other reviewers.

The book is good. Lots of interesting ideas for backpacking foods. However, I bought the kindle edition. Kindle is great for novels and such, not so good for instructional manuals and cookbooks. I want to mark pages, be able to flip through it quickly.Oh well... maybe I can find a used version cheap.Any way, I like the book. But you better have a dehydrator for a lot of ingredients. Its heavy on the home-dried foods. I'd prefer a book that involved off the shelf food, with a lot less dehydration work. It shouldn't take me a week to put together meals for three days - that a diminishing return.The extras in the back were okay, but a bit strange for a cookbook. Trail histories I can read somewhere else. A list of food sources, review of dehydrators, etc. might have made more sense and been more practical in a cookbook (like the included tables for converting cups to quarts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"This is another of my top three favorite DotM books and milestone in the DotM series.

Before, in Greece, she was called Penelope and she witnesses The Atrox suck the life force of an innocent soldier. Then Maggie takes a vow to destroy its evil and goes to the temple of Selene. Pandia, her mentor, gives her a moon charm (talisman) with words carved into it.

It is much more than that- it is a series of tales of births, both of baby horses and of knowledge. Mrs. Westvang imparts not a little wisdom in terms of dealing with life in the world of horses, from very large sales stables to the backyard. If you are not careful you will finish the book knowing quite a bit about the process of getting a foal born successfully- and it's NOT a textbook or instruction manual. It is written in a down to earth friendly style that brings you right into the straw. Don't start it too late at night- I wasn't able to put it down.

Many themes such as anger and resentment, childhood wonderment, the loss of innocence, intimacy, and serenity in nature are perfectly captured in this collection of poems, inspiring us to delve into our own emotions and experiences. Eugenie Bisulco, the poet behind Mrs. Empty, is truly a fascinating artist, and I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy","review":"This is the first product review I have done, and the first time I have ever been disappointed in a coffee maker. Previously I have had coffee makers eventually die, or have wished for certain features or a slightly better implementation.

The next weekend, it would go into the error condition and never start up, so I called their customer service. I barely got the words out when their CSR, who was friendly and professional, offered to upgrade it at no charge to the 14-cup model. I also changed to a black one.

If it is 1/8 \\" off it will plug up the drip hole from the coffee grounds basket and then it will overflow into the casing causing hot coffee to run all over the counter. It also has a water filter that I have not been able to find anywhere even on the Kitchen Aid web site. This filter has a stick on it to tell you how much water you have put in the coffee maker and it keeps popping out of its socket. The old one that was recalled worked much better than this new \\"improved\\" model and this one holds only 10 cups where the old one held 12. If this was the only one I had experienced that was like this I would think I was the problem. I know of two other people with the same coffee maker and they both have experienced the same problem with it leaking. This is just a very bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"KITCHEN AID COFFE MAKER","review":"I RECEIVED A DEFECTIVE COFFEE MAKER.

Back in 2001, I bought a Kitchenaide coffee pot that broke 4 times in one year. The digital clock and timer kept malfunctioning. I returned it 3 times to the manufacturer for a replacement, then on the 4th time, I finally threw the pot in the trash and bought a Kenmore. The Kenmore was great but unfortunately, I broke the carafe and they don't sell replacement carafes. The problem with this coffee pot for me was that it leaked coffee out the bottom. We set the timer so we have coffee in the morning.. and when we'd go to poor a cup, we would find coffee all over the counter. We have no idea how or why it was happening. I tried to give this poor pot a chance but it just wouldn't work out. I returned the item and bought a Mr. Coffee. Do not bother wasting your money on a Kitchenaide pot of any kind.. you're paying for the name and the pots are terrible!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk! Pooey!","review":"Brew temp too low to get proper coffee extraction. Taste is hardly tolerable and you must reheat 6oz cup in microwave after a few drinks. My old Melitta made 10 times better coffee and hot. This lousy thing will get returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design = poor coffee","review":"I purchased this product after my old pot finally died, opting for a modern design for a new kitchen. While the design is nice, the coffee is terrible. Operation is fairly simple, but the rate at which the pot boils the water into the filter means you cannot run a very fine grind or the filter will overflow.Speaking of overflow - the designers built significant drainage on the bottom of the unit and I suspect they knew that there was less than 1/8\\" difference between the pot being seated for brew and not engaging the drain. The difference means that any excess water in the filter runs down the opening mechanism and on to the hot plate. I take extra care to make sure I seat the pot before each use and still run a 50% chance I will have overflow.Very poor design, very poor tasting coffee, horrible design, many clean-ups. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style without substance","review":"I received this model as a replacement because my previous coffee maker was recalled. Other than matching my other Kitchen Aid appliances, I don't have much good to say about this model.Cons (in order of importance):1) This brews coffee that lacks flavor and strength, regardless of bean quality or quantity.2) If the carafe isn't perfectly placed, I end up with a pool of coffee on the counter.3) Programming the clock and timer is tricky because the hour and minute buttons are cheap. You often have to hit the minute button several times for it to add one single minute to the clock.All things considered, this coffee maker is not worth the selling price. Even if you're into having all appliances match, avoid this machine, it will just occupy space on your counter and will NOT get used. A coffee machine has one primary function and this model fails to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Nice, thats about it.","review":"I bought this unit because I have always had good luck with the brand name.after three weeks it is now back in its box.Very messy unit.

It does not have a stop/pour feature, really something easy to have (so coffee drips all over unless every last drop has been brewed) the timer/programmable strength feature is bogus and silly; it is huge and takes up much more room than my old Melitta grind and brew (and does not grind either) and it is impossible to clean properly. It collects all this water moisture and does not dry out easily; I am sure soon it will be mildewed inside. Good riddance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color is the only good thing about it","review":"I was lured into buying this despite some negative reviews because of the color red -- which matches my red kitchen.

I've had this coffeemaker for 15 months and have used it daily with no problems. Just recently I found the replacement charcoal water filters at a local housewares store. For the past two mornings coffee has leaked out onto the counter. This coincides with my use of a new batch of beans that look really shiny and oily -- and I ground them too finely. I'm sure this is the problem as I ran a pot of water through the machine with no leakage. The manual says that the filter can get clogged if the grind is too fine. The main drawback is the narrow fill chamber, but this machine is good-looking and makes a great cup of coffee. I'd buy another one just like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"8 cups of coffee-flavored water","review":"You can't make 10 cups without the grounds overflowing into the coffee. 8 cups is the max, unless you like weak coffee and use very few grounds.

Coffee has a heavy chemical flavor imparted on it, even after filter has been removed.Poorly engineered pause and serve function causes frequent back ups and overflows. the spring on the pause and serve is too strong so rather than opening the hole for the coffee to come out it just pushes up the basket a little so the coffee just overflows. I had to remove the pause and serve lever on the bottom of the basket to make it so it would not overflow.Regrettably, I will now have to buy another coffee maker since this one is so poorly designed and makes chemical flavored coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks Like a Sieve","review":"My coffee maker is a replacement for my 10 cup previous model which I loved.

Several weeks later, the same thing happened again but this time, after the cleanup, the ERR2 code came on. I assumed that the water overflow damaged the internal computer somehow. I boxed the thing up and took it back and got another one in exchange. Well, after 2 weeks and finally getting rid of that plastic taste...what do you know...ERR2 on the replacement unit. I refuse to believe that this is a fluke!!! This product is poorly designed and of low quality. I had a $20 Mr. Coffee for 15 years before I \\"upgraded\\" to this piece of junk!

I am not even asking that they have the examples in VB in the book, just online. I know that there is not a lot of diffrence between the way C# and VB.net address the objects in Dot.net, but it is a bit of a nusiance trying to figure out things when you have to spend so much time on C#-Centric things rather then the logic of the controls.

The graphics are good which is a plus but they aren't excellent. The zombie fighting in this game is horrible and stupid. I beat this game in 3 hours!

The reason for this is the innovative concept of \\"sanity\\" that one must maintain in order to view the very good looking world as a normal person would. The enemies can be somewhat intimidating at times, and they also have digusting sounds when they walk. The \\"Magick\\" system is great, and not too hard to understand. However, I found the fighting system bland and repetative. Aim for the arm, hack it off, or you can hack the head off, which will magic(k)ly grow back eventually if you don't kill it right away. How this happens is beyond me. So, there's nothing revolutionary about the fighting system.

Haydn's scoring for several bass instruments makes for a very lush sound that never plods or sinks. The music here is vivacious and never degrades into the insipid.

It is beyond me why the seller here is asking such an outrageous price!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money.","review":"As an avid consumer of books about polymer clays, I was extremely disappointed in this one. It was basically a self- indulgent exploration of the writer's opinions. The artists discussed do NOT go in 5 directions at all. I have numerous books on the subject, every one of which is superior to this one.

This CD was very disappointing. Her voice sounds like it was done on a kareoke machine at a local bar. The actual music isn't that bad, but very repetitious and uneventful. Her music has strong ties to religious beliefs (I believe she's Jewish). Definately not what I expected. Very poorly sung and unprofessional. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive, invaluable \\"how to\\" reference.","review":"Librarians who must respond to customer requests for genealogical information or family histories will find Librarians Guide to Genealogical Research a useful reference which explains the process and identifies tools the local library will need in order to help.

For a first album to contain such spirit, talent and genre diversity is refreshing. I was moved by every song on the cd, which was also a first for me. This cd should be in every household worldwide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bluesy rock","review":"I first heard Derek Miller's \\"Call an Angel Down\\" while reading the closing credits of the indie movie \\"Older than America,\\" a movie released in 2009. The voice and melody touched my heart. I looked up the musician, then came here to Amazon to order the entire album, and do not regret the purchase. This is one impressive album for someone of little name recognition in the US and it deserves national play.This is a well-mixed album. There are four songs I especially like: \\"Wheels on Fire,\\" \\"Heaven,\\" \\"Call an Angel Down\\" and \\"Jaded are my Wings,\\" an especially bluesy song. The songs range from heart-tugging swaying to downright foot-stomping blues and emotions go through the range as well. Derek's voice is unique and well-suited to the blues.Anyone who enjoys bluesy rock should listen to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excerpt available!","review":"PocketBook's web site has more information about THE SAINT, including a few excerpted pages.http://www.simonsays.com/titles/bookpage.cgi?isbn=0671009516"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I loved this. A great story, and I definitely want to read the original works by Leslie Charteris. I almost don't want to see the movie now. I liked the beginning, where we learn what made Simon the Saint. And updated for the 90's. If the movie is even half as good, Hollywood's accomplished something"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saint strikes again","review":"One gets the feeling that Mr. Barer was enjoyed writing this book. There is intence action and suspence that keeps one glued to the book no matter what your 'suppose' to be doing. This was a fun read. I laughed, I cried and occationally cursed the book thinking the characters would actually hear me. The identities of the 'Saint' were inspired and brought out diversity and complexities of Siimon's character. I give this 2 thumbs up. A good read and worth a second look"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new angle to the abortion-debate &#65533; and salvation","review":"Ever wondered what happens to children who were aborted, either spontaneously - or by force? Do they, as catholics and many (unfortunately) lutherans claim - go straigt to hell - or does G-d in His infinite wisdom and mercy an opening for them to go the heaven? Peretti answers these questions without confusing theology - and in easy terms. The books is well-written, and easy to read. A couple of hours at the most. Bon Appetite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good product but...","review":"When I replaced the existing cartridge, I notice ink still oozing out the cartridge. Which leads me to believe the chip on these cartridges are set to expire at a set amount prints.

So I guess this item gets a five star review for working as intended although the overall product perfomance is dubious at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"As an introductory book teaching classical (and some modern) optics, this wonderful book is difficult to beat.It prepares you remarkably well for any direction in optics you then want to set off in. The explanations are mostly crystal-clear, crafted with great care. Lots of words and diagrams, not too much math, but enough math to facilitate useful calculations.An excellent under-graduate text, to my mind, the best available today."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than you'll ever need","review":"This bottle is larger than you are ever going to need unless you are very unlucky with fish, turtles, and other things aquatic. It hasn't really solved our particular problem (turtle hatchlings with scraped up arm pits... long story) but it isn't really advertised for this particular purpose - it was recommended by a water turtle web site.Anyhoo... I suppose I should say \\"I love it\\" but how can you love a medicine that has been in use for weeks while one's little guys and gals get Slowly better and there's no way to tell how much it is contributing? Not an instant fix, not allowing things to get worse, maybe holding off infection while they heal in their own slow way... I'd buy more if there were more scrapes... Except this bottle will last forever. Sixteen ounces is a lot given how little one uses, and the price is therefor cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"stopped the problems in our tank!","review":"thank you! great product. huge quantity for one to two tanks. apparently will last for ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creationism vs. evolution","review":"If you believe in creationism then read this book with caution. This book tries to brainwash you into thinking that evolution is based on solid foundation and creationism is quack. Buyer beware. I would not buy this book for someone under 18 years of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"There are two stories in this book: one by Susan Mallery--Lucaas's Convenient Bride, and the second by Maureen Child--Jackson's Mail-Order Bride. The men are Lucas MacIntyre and his brother, Jackson MacIntyre. Their uncle died and left a will stating that they couldn't inherit the saloon/ranch/mine unless they married. The women in both stories are strong, caring, and focused. They are different in that one is plain and one isn't, but they are willing to take a risk on these two guys, and work at it. I was really surprised how much I liked this book. I started it, and didn't put it down till I read the whole thing. Try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest vet book ever!

She received this book for her 7th birthday and loves going over the pictures and stories in detail.

A great buy for kids interested in this profession!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"This was a great book to read with my son, who is interested in becoming a vet. It has lots of compelling photographs and good information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very moving novel steeped in the Indian culture","review":"Maya hasn't been to her native India in three years: a teenage, she wants to spend the summer with her New York friends, but her mother wants her to return home, so home she goes - there to feel a stranger between two cultures. Her coming of age brings new challenges and divided loyalties in Motherland, a very moving novel steeped in the Indian culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different perspective","review":"There have been quite a few authors from India who have written novels from the perspective of an Indian or an Indian emigree. Vijayaraghavan's book is unique in the sense that is written by an Indian-American - someone who sees life from the other end of the spectrum.Vijayaraghavan's protagonist, Maya, is a mature fifteen year old who is sent to Kerala, India by her New York-based parents to learn about her culture. Maya's trip is an eye-opener for her, even though she has taken several trips in past summer holidays, partially because she is now at a different stage in life, and partially because she has an interesing experience while there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"It is amazing to me that this kind of stuff gets published. Why is there such a craze for good-little-desi-novels in the west? the writing is horrendous, the imagery is trite, and the plot perfectly predictable. I would say that this is the worst book I have read in my lifetime; coming from a person who reads two books a week for the publishing industry, this really is saying something. Another note, speaking of publishing: connections will get you everywhere--to all budding writers, keep this in mind. It clearly worked for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to see more by this author!","review":"Motherland is a wonderful first novel by Vineeta Vijayaraghavan. A story told in the first person of a 15 year old girl visiting with her relatives in India. The story depicts Maya's struggles with mixing Indian culture and American culture. Told in a very respectful and vivid manner this book gave me new understanding of Indian life. The most poignant part of Motherland is the relationship between Maya and her grandmother (Ammamma) who raised her for the first four years of her life. Adolescence can strain any and all family relationships at times. This story shows how special the relationships between grandmothers and granddaughters can be. Being very close to my own grandmother and losing her at age 16, Motherland brought back a lot of fond memories of my own relationship with my Ammamma."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel every Indian American can identify with","review":"Any second generation Indian kid who's visited the \\"motherland\\" will immediately identify with the author's vivid descriptions of India and understand Maya's struggle to find cultural and personal connections with the people there. In Maya's story all of us can see the reasons for why we like and dislike visiting our ancestral homes, and possibly find new reasons for making the trip again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"This is a horrid book. It is the worst example of a book written to make some money--why does the West eat this stuff up? Why can we not have an indian-american novel that does not make itself so exotic the whole time. nauseating and drab--sickly-sweet and frustratingly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn Yawn Yawn","review":"How do you say \\"Insipid\\" in Tamil? This is the worst book I have ever read--I picked this up hoping for a good ol' fashioned coming of age narrative. I will stick with the tried and true--although this is definitely a coming of age book, it is simply an atrocious one. Predictability is the least of its problems: it is simply boring. Characterization is sketchy and one-dimensional, the book is full of types rather than people. The setting could be so promising if the book were to marvel inventively at the mundane things, to give us insight; instead, all we get is description. If you're curious, buy it used, or better yet, borrow it from a friend or a library. I wasted my money and would hate to have other waste theirs on this horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misplaced Nostalgic Drivel","review":"I give this book one star only because I need to give it some stars at all in order to register this review. Aside from the clever beginning, there is very little redeeming in this book: the imagery is tired, the prose insipid, and the \\"journey to acestral land\\" plot tiresome, and utterly formulaic. Maya goes back to South India, and discovers there the magic of tropical foliage, family ties, and sultry weather--the stage is set for the inevitable family secrets, the conspicuously \\"protruding\\" and ill-fitting political sub-plot, and the inexorable and exhausted ending celebrating a \\"found self\\" and a realization that Maya can make any place her home. The reader keeps wishing that much of this book is ironic, and written in mimicry of its genre, but alas, \\"Motherland\\" follows the predictable and better-off-foresaken path religiously. The story is sheer nostalgic drivel, of the sort we have read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still have not received this item.

This one is the worst example of it--better to turn your attention to books like Shadowlines by Amitav Ghosh or Cracking India by Bapsi Sidhwa. This book is shoddily written, and badly in need of a good editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple story of a teen's growing up--","review":"I picked this book up, enjoyed it and gave it to my teenage daughter to read. It was a good discussion book for moms/daughters. Neither of us could figure out the hostility in some of the earlier reviews--what's going on in Boston? This book captured the conflicting emotions that fifteen year-olds experience. It may not be a monumental work but it is an unprentious little book--an enjoyable, easy read. It made us interested to know more about India and provoked some interesting discussions about relationships and loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"I enjoyed the book thoroughly because it brought back memories to me and feelings deep within my soul. These were feelings, that I had forgotten I had for family. Having now lived in the U.S.A for 16 years, I had stopped thinking of my childhood. Vineeta has given us a beautiful insight of her characters and the simplicity of Ammumma's life. This book is to the point, wastes no time and yet, extracts the slow pace of life in the sleepy southern towns beautifully. Keep it up Vineeta and I am eagerly awaiting your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have no idea why anyone would publish this book other than the fact that the person is now an HBS graduate.Being an Ivy leaguer means you cna get away with anythin I suppose"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally outdated","review":"This book refers to telefaxes and manual pasteup.

There is no reason to have a hy-phenated word in the middle of a line...see that example. Things like that annoy me no end(I should have been a proof-reader...I know that I would have done a much, much better job), and to that end, I just pushed the button.Honestly, I think the story could have been good...I wouldn't have bought it otherwise.If I had to give it a mark out of 10?

Shame!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"This book is so poorly written I couldn't finish it.Tedious,cliche-ridden,predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"I never heard of this author before.

It details the mental and physical torture that was employed to secure \\"confessions\\" that were in English and were never translated to the men siging them. It also details the testimonies of American officers and Belgian citizens that were ignored by the court because they were in conflict with the \\"official\\" story of what happened in Malmedy. With the help of American politicians and soldiers, Peiper and the other prisoners that had not yet been lynched were eventually released from prison."},{"rating":"1","title":"biggest disapointment EVER!!!!!","review":"I've rarely been as disapointed as I was when I found out the best scene in the Duckman series possibly the greatest scene in TV history was missing on the dvd.

Paramount and CBS you owe us all a huge apology and a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN AT!","review":"Duckman is duckman. If you've never seen it you don't have a clue.

It includes a vast collection of adapters and seems well built (minus some surface rust on the press itself).However, after using this press for the first time on my 09' JK, it's obvious the press itself is not heavy duty. Trying to press out the lower ball joint I was able to bend/spread the c-press into almost a Y shape with heavy pressure from a 1/2\\" breaker bar. I was not able to remove the joint as this thing just kept bending further and further. Returning for either the OTC or Alltrade version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accessories are great, clamp is junk","review":"I have used this set after buying it about 3 months ago. After using it about 40-50 times the clamp has begun to spread apart causing ball joints to press in crooked.

Definitely worth the money.Very pleased"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first time it was used.","review":"This item broke the first time it was used. It was one day outside of the return window, and now I am forced to pay to return the broken parts to the manufacturer and wait 4-8 weeks for them to decide whether they will replace it or not. A terrible product. I would never purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for the price","review":"This set had all of the adapters I needed to do upper and lower ball joints on my Jeeps (YJ, XJ, ZJ), including the angled adapter for installing the upper ball joint.

I will buy a better clamp at another time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak clamp","review":"Was great that the master kit had a wide variety of adapters, however after pressing in the LCA ball joint on my '99 ram, the clamp became warped.

I was told it would work up to 2004. WRONG!@ The only socket that comes close to my ball joint on the LCA does not fit into the bottom groove of the LCA ball joint slot. The socket slipped offset damaging the socket badly and warped the C-Tool way out of whack. The case is made of thin plastic, I had this shipped by air which means turbulance, needless to say the case was damaged all over the inside with huge cracks. Although this set has a nice variety of tooling sizes, it just, simply put, is not strong thick metal needed for heavy duty jobs.

This book has truly allowed me to continue to live life at the 150% level and love every minute of it. The secret: live in the moment not the past or the future. Sound simple?

Put another way, the only way we would own this bike is by winning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Frustrating","review":"Save yourself the stress and don't buy this printer. When it prints it prints beautifully. But it rarely prints correctly. If you don't use it for a day the nozzles clog and you have to clean them (of course you don't know that until you've wasted a print sometimes) That uses up valuable ink. Even in the middle of of printing a queue of photos the heads can clog - meaning that you can't send it more than one photo at a time. I'm retiring mine and just keeping it around for the few times I need large format. Wish I hadn't wasted money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printer is not for graphic designers","review":"Yes, the prints do look like photographs, they don't look like the sheet fed or web press piece you are attemping to comp or proof. The inks and paper cost a fortune. Figure on spending lots of time and money calibrating the colors. Then it has 7 inks, if one of them runs out -- it won't print. A set of inks runs costs over $80 and will print about 20 large sheets with heavy coverage. Even with all its warts the Epson 3000 was a much better printer for comps and press checking graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A totally worn out computer printer","review":"When I received the printer it was used of course.

This was the second one I have had it had great potential but it was worn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardware failure","review":"This printer produced excelled quality prints, if quite slowly. However, I had two hardware problems, one fatal. This printer was used for specialty work, so it was not used every day. As a result, I found that I had to print junk at least once a week or so or the printheads would clog, requiring a clean cycle (which wastes ink).More seriously, the printer recently just failed - when it is turned on it sounds like something is broken. The Status Monitor no longer communicates with the printer and the manual imples that the fact that ALL of the lights are flashing means it has an \\"Unknown error\\" and must be taken to a dealer (which would probably cost more than the printer is worth).Until this error, I would have given this printer 4 stars, but a fatal error on a printer which has not seen that much work has lowered my former good opinion of Epson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the bucks","review":"I have an Olympus P400 (dye sub), an Epson 900 and this Epson 2200. They are all great printers. The P400 Dye sub is awesome, but can't print the big images. Using the 2200, the velvet paper (matte) produced the prettiest pictures I've seen at large sizes using the 2880 dpi print setting. Luster was nice, but I think I preferred the matte stock.The 2200 is easy to load; easy instructions, easy set up. Easy to use. The PPDs work well with IPhoto and the Epson photo program that it comes with. Printing through Photoshop proved to be disappointing, even with the PPD. Do what you need to in PS, save and import into Epson's program or IPhoto before printing (based on OSX trials through my G4).Will need to buy a cable. Suggest getting extra ink cartridges and paper up front -- you'll want to play once you have it in your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen. If you download the optional ink reserve software you can actually see your expensive inks disappear. Granted, when the printer is working properly you can get wonderful images. If you are not constantly printing, the nozzles will clog. It is almost impossible to find anyone to work on these printers because the nozzles are built into the printer. After throwing a couple hundred down the drain on this printer, I smartened up and bought a Canon Pro9000. My new Canon is a wonderful wide format printer with easy installation and the nozzle cartridge is removable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epson Stylus 2200 Maintenance","review":"My printer is five years old. I use it for occasional photo printing, but mostly for 11 x 17 color drafts. The frequency of my printing can be a dozen sheets over a few days, however the printer will not be used (or turned on) for months at a time between uses.Not using the printer on a regular basis calls for head/nozzle cleaning and some cartridge replacement as necessary. Do perform the maintenance features for this devise, and download the Status Monitor 3 from Epson's website...it'll show ink cartridge levels which helps anticipate replacements. Before this feature was installed I had to wonder where prints went--they'd leave my computer and vanish!

I use it in La Paz, Bolivia (13,000 feet high) and I never had a problem with the printer or with the quality of the prints. The color profiles that come with most professional paper make it a snap to print form Photoshop. The only possible down-side to this printer is that the cartridges are very expensive and don't last much, but for the quality of the prints produced... this is one well though out product that will last a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional grade photos.","review":"This printer isn't for the average user, it isn't exactly \\"intuitive\\" or \\"user friendly\\". What it is the best photographic grade printer you can currently get for under eight hundred bucks. All of the professional photographers I know either have this printer or are planning to get one. I personally have printed nearly 400 images on the machine and most are at least twice as good as any chemical process photograph. As for the fabled \\"bronzing, just switch Pictorico brand paper and it's gone as well as giving you better images to boot! A friend has the Canon 9900 and it is very good but can't handle the subtle of color that the 2200 does. If you want archival prints that are better than what any custom color lab can give you then you want the Epson 2200."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2200 a lemon","review":"This purchase was a nightmare. First, the printer was incompatible with my page layout program (InDesign CS) when it came to printing custom-size (poster) pages. The jobs simply won't process. One Epson technician I talked to (and there were many calls to Epson technical support) basically conceded that the 2200 doesn't do well with InDesign-type post-script software. And InDesign CS, which comes with Photoshop and Illustrator in the CS package, is not an obscure program. I was able to get some jobs out in Illustrator (cumbersome in page layout duty) but then there were problems with banded lines and jams. It's the worst purchase I ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great photo printer","review":"Just purchased the 2200 after owning a series of Epson printers (the last being the 870) as well as a couple of Canons and one Alps along the way. For photos, this printer rocks! Using the Epson premium photo papers (I have tried the glossy and the semi-glossy) the photo prints are stunning. Initially, I was not so impressed because I printed on standard Epson glossy photo paper and the result was a bit washed out. To get the great results this printer is capable of it is necessary to use Epson premium papers, which come in a wide variety of sizes. For photos, this printer is much better than anything I used previously and has the additional advantage of accomodating large sized photo paper. I am using a Pentium 4 with XP Pro. It should be noted though that there have been some complaints about using this printer with a Mac since many of the features are apparently not supported on the Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By Advertisements","review":"I am totally disappointed in the quality of prints this machine puts out. There appears to be a fine fog over your prints, I wrote Tech support and they told me that the \\"bronzing\\" was normal with UltraChrome inks. Now that would be great to know before you plunk down upwards of $700 for a wide format printer.I guess I am too unsophisticated to understand \\"archival quality\\" is another way of saying poor visual quality. I could care less if it lasts a lifetime if it isn't what I want.Using Matte paper reduces the effect somewhat but again, nowhere in the advertisements or instructions do you find this, nope you have to get ahold of Tech Support to find out that what you get isn't really what you wanted even though all the ads say it is.Maybe Epson could consider a choice of inks for this machine.Save your money folks, stick with Canon or HP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent printer with beautiful photo prints!","review":"I used it to print some very nice posters.

The cost of ink combined with the cost to keep the printer running smoothly is a fortune. Online they will tell you sometimes waiting a day after cleaning will help but frankly when I go to print, I need to print. Basically you need to constantly print on this to keep from wasting your ink on cleanings but instead you'll be wasting your ink at the same rate on frivulous printings."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to breakdown","review":"I read review on line and brought this printer, but turn out the pigmented inks have lots of problems.

I print hundreds of matte pages a month on a Stylus Photo 820...and upgraded to the 2200 because of its touted matte ink capability. But once you put the matte cartridge in, you can't select border-free printing on the sides. And printing with the photo cartridge is indeed an inferior option, if you're looking for crisp, sharp blacks on matte paper, so \\"fooling\\" the printer by saying you're printing on photo paper doesn't work.I can only hope Epson is working on a driver update, as I'm ready to send this printer back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrations galore!","review":"I'm in college and have no choice but to use this printer to print out important projects. I work with Illustrator and InDesign, and though I resize the file image to a size far smaller than the huge matte paper that I must print with, the printer either consistently crops everything or makes the image smaller than I specified. This cost me many sheets of expensive matte paper, and probably half of the school's ink supply, just trying to GET IT RIGHT.The one time that I succeeded in configuring everything correctly, which took far more time, sweat and tears than a simple printer should deserve, the print quality was horrible. There were rows of thin white lines going across the image. I hope after I leave school that I will never see this printer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hidden caveat.","review":"Before you buy this printer, be warned: YOU CANNOT PRINT BORDERLESS ON MATTE PAPER!

Most of the songs on the debut aren't really that strong, and the choruses just seem to repeat the same lines over and over. I would have rated this release lower if not for the song \\"Half the Way Valley\\", which is pretty much the only reason I bought the album to begin with.You would do better looking elsewhere for you GNR needs. I'm gonna state this so nobody thinks i'm being a butt, i'm a huge fan of anything hard or melodic rock from the late 80's or early 90's.

Law, who is an Episcopal priest, tells us at length that whites are supposed to \\"bear the cross\\" (give up their presumed power) in order to welcome people of color who are presumed to be \\"on the cross.\\" Class, gender, age and other systems of inequality are all brushed off; only race appears to count. And all people of color are presumed by Law to behave the same: remarkably like the stereotype of meek Chinese (Law is Chinese). I really had to wonder if Law has any significant experience with African-Americans.On the plus side, Law offers a very helpful original suggestion with his idea of Mutual Invitation as a way of organizing multiracial discussions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do You Really Need to Pay for This?","review":"Don't get me wrong, I really like ThinkGeek, but you can get on their e-mail newsletter list and catalog mailing list FREE!

Instead, we get cheesy karaoke-like versions, often with a fake reggae slant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Do you like the 80s? On the off chance you said yes, do you also like reggae? Would you like it if those two things were smashed together, and completely destroyed? Creating some (...)love-child that no one ever thought they wanted, this soundtrack is an atrocity. Not only does it provide a complete insult to the Cure (TWICE), but it also has poor Mark McGrath and 311 both choking out their own rendition of what they consider reggae. Most of the album is supposed to be love songs, but pretty much all I can muster after a few listens is apopleptic rage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Good Song Is Love Song By 311","review":"Why do all soundtracks have to be crappy? The movie was alright, the sountrack is really missing something. i suggest to download love song by 311."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this CD!","review":"Oh my gosh! I haven't even seen the movie yet and I knew I was taking a chance just buying the CD but I'm a HUGE 80s fan and it sounded cool. I love these remakes and I'm pretty picky too. Yes, they don't completely sound like the originals but what do you expect.. it's 2004. I love every song on here with it's reggae/tropical interpretation. My faves are Wyclef and Eve, Mark McGrath, Jason Mraz, 311 and Seal. It's just such a fun CD and if you like the 80s, have an open mind and like some of the artists on the CD... you'll probably love it like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is Great Now where is the music","review":"I was so excited to buy the soundtrack after I went and saw the movie then I listened.. Sad Day.. The actual movie plays some of the greatest music I have ever listened too. So you can imagine my disgrace when I bought the Soundtrack. There is a song in the movie that I really want to know who sings it. It is not on the Soundtrack it starts by saying \\"Whoa everett is the color of your energy or something like that\\" if you know who this is email me reed_077@yahoo.com thank you... Don't rush to buy this soundtrack you will be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"50 first Dates CD","review":"I was very disappointed with the recordings. They did not sound like the originals or what I heard on the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Missing","review":"Add me to the disappointed list. \\"True\\", by Will-I-Am featuring Fergie, isn't on the CD.

The two tracks that I do enjoy isn't worth the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the other songs?!?!?","review":"I have to agree with Patrick....while the songs are mostly good, I am very VERY upset that some songs were left out of the soundtrack. \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" was one of the themes to the whole movie. Also, the song \\"Amber\\" by 311 is really good, and was neglected in the soundtrack. I am extremely upset about this, since I bought the soundtrack expecting these songs to be on there. I mean, honestly...how can they not have \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" on there? Its ridiculous...especially when they put songs that were very small or nonexistent on it. I am not happy with this soundtrack at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"See how Reggae Ruins the 80s!!","review":"I was so psyched about getting this CD when I heard that it was full of 80s covers that I pre-ordered it from Amazon!! Boy was I disappointed! It's all Reggae and a little bit of Reggae goes a LONG way with me. The CD is just awful and it made it onto Ebay in record time, pretty much as soon as I finished listening to it. I've heard better 80s covers from high school marching bands! If you like Reggae, then you'll probably like this because you're undoubtedly stoned most of the time anyway. However, if you love 80s music, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many covers....So few good ones!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'm sorry but there are too many bad covers on here and just about any other film soundtrack lately!!!The music and film industry of late is just out of ideas and this CD proves it.

Lets not see another cd like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive side of Sandler","review":"My husband and I always enjoy curling up on the couch to watch this film. It has about half of the normal Adam Sandler junior high humor and in its place adds a very sweet emotional piece. Every time I watch this movie it leaves a warm fuzzy feeling and makes me think....wow....now that is selfless love! I love seeing the sensitive side of Sandler. Best part: Adam Sandler singing the Beach Boys song \\"Wouldn't it be Nice\\" on his boat with tears streaming down his face!

But, and this is a big but, it does not have Over the Rainbow, the closing tune by Ike. The music on the CD is fair enough and some is good. However, where's the rainbow at the end of the CD? Maybe the enhanced version has it, but the version I got from Amazon is rainbow-less and so much the poorer for its absence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone from the TRUE 80's WILL love this CD","review":"I was sitting here reading the reviews on this CD... I just want out to get this CD... When I got it in my car I loved it... I turned it up and opened my sunroof... It is going to be a AWESOME summer CD... The fact that Adam Sandler hand picked MOST of the songs is AWESOME... He has GREAT taste... Some of the people who are GIVING this CD low ratings are TEENS and they don't know nothing about REAL music.. If you are a truly from the 80's you will like this CD...

NOT all CDs ever have EVERY song from a movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely disappointed","review":"This is the worst soundtrack ever. I don't know why every song has to be reggae.

Neither are on the cd, and I'm pretty sad about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD but missing best song","review":"I agree with the other reviews that this CD is missing the best song from the movie soundtrack. I do not know who made the decision but it is a very big disappointment to pop in this otherwise outstanding CD knowing that \\"Somewhere over the rainbow\\" is not included. All tracks are fresh and I enjoy listening to it almost daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool and Mellow","review":"If you like mellow reggae and classic 80's ballads, this is the perfect soundtrack for you. Every song on this soundtrack is relaxing and soothing but still lively and tropical. If you are looking for some pure reggae, this isn't for you. It consists mostly of newer artists like Jason Mraz and Mark McGrath covering famous songs from 80's bands like The Police and The Cure with a modern reggae twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks to Sara Core!","review":"I have been looking all over to find out two of these songs (Baby by Wyclef & Over the Rainbow by IZ) that is not on the soundtrack and thanks!!Baby by Wyclef I also heard on the two part season finale of 3rd Watch and Over the Rainbow by IZ on ER finale \\"On the Beach\\" when Dr. Green died.A lot of soundtracks do this not including all of the songs from the movie...they seem to not know really what \\"sounds\\" the viewers fell in love with as they watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"where are the songs?","review":"So I think as you can all tell, this CD is annoying because it's missing so many of the wonderful songs that are actually in the movie. And by the way, that last song on the boat in Alaska is a version of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" performed by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, an artist often referred to only as IZ. You can find him in the international section of a lot of CD stores, or probably here on our very own Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Please - it was a good effort","review":"The whole point of this album was to remake old 80s music into semi-reggae style covers. It does that, and the songs play all thru the movie to give it an easy-going, island feel. Its not perfect, but few soundtracks, and fewer covers, are.The covers are better than most that I hear, and have a very neat sound going for them. The versions here are not meant to replace the 80s versions, which are awesome in their own rights, just add a new twist to them. Sit back and relax, its a mellow cd, and that's what you're supposed to do. :)What I'm particularly happy about is that they included Adam Sandler's song for Lucy on the soundtrack. :*DAs for the \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" cover at the end of the movie, its also on the Finding Forrester soundtrack with a pile of great Miles Davis jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 First Dates CD","review":"I was very disappointed that the song \\"Over the Rainbow\\" was not included in this soundtrack CD.

Neither of these titles is on the CD. Instead there is music that you've probably never heard before or want to hear again...with the exception of Adam Sandler's cute little ditty,\\"Forgetful Lucy\\"...the only reason I gave it even one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"To answer Long's question ...","review":"Ironically, there was no music playing when they were dancing by their cars (I just finished watching this movie for the first time).

I'm disappointed with 311's cover of \\"Love Song\\" simply because they're slowly but surely breaking away from the classic 311 style. It's a nice song, but I don't see what it does for music and its advancement. 311 has always pushed the envelope as \\"the alternative band,\\" but I'm starting to wonder lately where that band went."},{"rating":"1","title":"The name of the last song in the movie","review":"The last song in the movie, does anyone know the name of it?

The graphics and wording that Amazon is providing is slightly misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Bruddah IZ...","review":"Actually, Bruddah IZ ( who did \\"over the rainbow\\" at the end of the movie) was NOT in the film. He died in 1997, due to his lifelong fight with obesity. Leaving him out of this soundtrack is a horrible mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much missing!","review":"I completely agree with Victor Catano's review. How on Earth could they leave out \\"Over The Rainbow\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\"? I mean, the Beach Boys' song was the theme for the movie. Even Henry got the song on CD in the movie! This soundtrack could have been one of the best ever put out for a movie. There are SO many good songs. I couldn't believe how few I saw listed on the back of the CD in the store. Thank goodness I looked before buying. This is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere over the Rainbow","review":"Is sung by Israel Kamakawiwo\`ole, now deceased.

I just blew 14 bucks. (...) They must know they left out all the best music from the movie. They are either coming out with yet another soundtrack like \\"More songs from 50 First Dates\\" as a money making scam, or the rights to the songs were to expensive to include them on the CD (like the millions they made off of the movie wasn't quite enough to cover it). I'm a big fan of both actors and feel really hurt that they would let their fans be deceived like this! I really loved those good songs and now can't get them. PS. I'm also a huge \\"The Cure\\" fan and still think all the remixes stink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD","review":"This is not a music CD!

I think the songs covered by 311 and Elan Atias are the only redeeming qualities of this cd.

Robin Mckinley has breathed true life into these familiar characters by making them true-to-life.

I read about half of it before deciding it was too painfully boring to continue with. McKinley clearly knew the skeleton of the story she wanted to tell but failed to give it any spark of life. The writing style comes off as incredibly passive--there is never any sense of immediacy, and the scenes that should have the most action are unwieldy and sometimes interrupted by irrelevant descriptions. Every event feels forced, as though McKinley wrote an outline based on other Robin Hood stories and followed the outline like a business agenda without any regard to narrative flow. The dialog is marked by attempts at renaissance-fair wit that comes off as neither accurate nor witty, and often requires re-reading figure out what was meant. The characters are flat, the world building (no matter how well researched) is flat. It is totally beyond me why this has so many glowing reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't care about the characters","review":"I'm a big Robin McKinley fan, but you should read something else -- Sunshine, Deerskin, or Spindle's End are all much better. In those books, with her own story line, McKinley creates much more detailed, individual, REAL characters whose struggles you come to care about. In Sherwood, the characters are of course set in advance by the classic Robin Hood tales, and they come across as flat. Not a terrible book, but not her best by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for the Outlaws of Sherwood","review":"The Outlaws of Sherwood is a wonderful book. I rate it a 5 out of 5. i think it might even be better than the Harry Potter series. I thought it might be hard for Robin to beat The Hero and the Crown but now she has really outdone herself. I think Robin Hood is my favorite legend and she has made him and is band of outlaws seem as if they were once living and breathing people fighting for justice against the cruel and selfish sheriff of Nottingham.I especialy liked how she made Maid Merrian a heroin.

Although she stays true to the traditional storyline, the story sounds new with her use of playful banter, her careful characterization, and her attention to detail. Altogether, it is a masterpiece of escapism fiction, with few parallels to modern life, but with McKinley's keen eye for description. A classic to the core, and entertaining for teens and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite versions of Robin Hood.","review":"I suppose some would consider the book a bit dry in parts, but it's the kind of book where once you get past a certain point, you get hooked.

That is what is SO great about Imaginext--finally a toy that will cause even older kids to leave the computer and video games. Luckily, I think he found the software to be boring.

Never would I have dreamed that I would be moved emotionally by a Latin operatic work written by a Japanese woman.I feel her strengths are in melody and expressive harmonies, particularly when the female voice is involved. She never fails to provide shivers of joy, and there's usually a gulp or choked-back tear in there somewhere as well.As an import, this is a bit pricy, and probably isn't a novice's best introduction to her work.

The amazing detail in the characters is obvious, but the backgrounds need work. (which is why i gave it 4 stars) And the replay value is unsurpassed, with 300 trophies featuring rare games from japan and nostalgic trophies from old famous NES and SNES characters/places/weapons/etc. The secret characters could have been better, I cant believe how much Luigi stinks at fighting, and the rest are just copies of the regular characters. This game needs a bit more variety. Nevertheless, still a classic and a must-have in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brawl","review":"This game is great really its trueley is but there is 1 problemits almost the same as the orginal.I think this is a great sucess for the game cube I give it a.pros + cons -B++ Fun gameplay+ Good graphics+ Tons of modes+ Plenty of characters- Not much different from original- Fighting needs more detailsSo now you look at the report card happy gaming!!(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Smash Bros.

It has great graphics and music. It also has a lot of new characters, items, stages, and trophies to get, which the original (Super Smash Bros. on Nintendo 64) didn't have. It is great fun when you have four people at the controllers. GREAT GREAT MULTIPLAYER ACTION. You can play this game all night and never get tired because it is very addicting. I gave the game an overall 4 out of 5 stars because it doesn't have a storyline feature. It would be more interesting and you'd understand it better if it did have a storyline. My other reason, was because it didn't have online play. If it had online play, it would rock all other GameCube games! Overall, this game is great and I recommend it to anyone who likes cartoons and fighting games."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT disappointed!!!","review":"This was ordered at the last minute for my grandsons birthday.

Very different fighting game than say the mortal combat type of game. This is a game like no other with cool stages to fight on and awesome one player modes.

Its the same as the old Smash for the 64 except with new charaters,levels weapons etc. Oh yea, not to mention the 162 bit graphics! Each charater has its own one player level mode, each one different,(unlike the original). You can also play with up to 4 players. You can fight against computer bots or your freinds.

Yoshi, Bowser, Mario, Donkey Kong, Pikachu and the rest of the gang are examples of some people. it is from 1 to 4 playors and in one mode you can have 64 people battaling.if you like all these things then I suggest you should get Super Smash Bros.

While the graphics itself are top-notch, Nintendo has added oodles of extra stuff into this game, including more characters (more of which you can unlock by completing certain tasks), more battle areas (including scrolling worlds), tournament capabilities (up to 64 people!) and even mini-games, such as a home run derby and special event games. This is a game that you will NEVER get tired of, because there's always something new to explore in the game. The real fun comes with playing with friends though, and the folks at Nintendo have made the ultimate use out of simultaneous four-player action. Mark my words, this is THE GAME for Christmas 2001, and it's exclusive games like these that will keep the Xbox from achieving popularity. Grab Super Smash Bros. Melee today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"super smash bros. melee","review":"Super Smash Bros. Melee is an amazing sequel to the N64 version. New charcters, such as Bowser, Princess Peach, the Ice Climbers and Princess Zelda are amazing fun and new modes such as Tournament mode(up to 64 players) and coin mode are really fun.

I don't really see a point to it other than pushing, hitting, shocking, and kicking the other player in the game, which usually raises their ire and they end up pushing, hitting, and kicking each other outside of the game too.I prefer games like The Incredibles and the Star Wars Lego game that has the two players cooperating in the game instead of competing with each other. I don't mind competition, but this is just like a kid's version of Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, I think.If I would have known before hand what this game was like, I would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy if you are 15 and younger","review":"this game is better for persons 15 and younger. i actually bought the game b/c i thought it was going to be an adventure game (i.e. sonic). everything moves way too fast and it is difficult to control the characters or to even understand what you are doing. bring back the days of streetfighter and mortal combat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"After reading all about this game and then getting it I was pretty dissapointed.

Boy was i wrong. Not only is this game extremely childish and boring, but it requires 0 skill and the entire object of the game is to press buttons as fast as possible. Truely a colossal waste of time. SSB is a waste of money, time, intelligence and anything good in a human being. If you are a fan, i know this is just opinion but please never play anything like this again. Bottom line: Knocking nintendo/baby characters off a platform with boxes, lightsabers and anything else a baby would find \\"cool.\\" This game simply sucks and i wish this could persuade you not to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da game rules!","review":"I give SSB:M 5 stars because this time it has more characters, a better 1 player mode with (an all new feature) side scrolling. The new modes in multiplayer are very sweet! Some Modes are: Hit Point Mode(Where your character starts out with number of \\"hit points\\" and every hit brings his total down some, and as you may have guessed when you/opponenet lose all his hit points, then that person losses the game). There is also Coin Mode, More Items and a very wide variety of new levels! All and all this game totally kicks @$$!

Most people say that the adventure mode on this game is boring, it stinks etc.. I have to admit that some parts are boring but it is fun. The level I hate the most is the one after you fight Samus. You have to go up this big tunnel thing and you only have about 15 seconds to do it. The regular classic mode is fun and the giant hand has great graphics on it. The versus mode is probably why nintendo made this game. You can either do team or just battle against your opponent(s). Most of the other reviews sometimes tell you or don't tell you that the only way to get new characters or the most common way is by doing the one player classic. I played the original Super Smash Brothers on Nintendo 64 and this game definitely has a lot better graphics. This game has a good multi-player mode and a good classic mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The First","review":"Super Smash Bros.

It's GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this game rocks!","review":"Before you get this game, I want you to know a few things. first, this game has really good graphics, (most backround things are paper 3D though) this game is only left, right, duck, and jumpish, so there's no moving forward or backward, (unluckily for me, I didn't know that) multi player is the main thing, so I recomend you have 4 controlers, and 1 player mode is only to unlock new players to play in multi player. multi player is Sooo fun, and you can actualy unlock some places from the nintendo 64 vershion!Patrick, age 9"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaash Bros Are Coollio","review":"ble blah bloo super smash bros rule this game outclasses the old game by a milenew charactersnew modes\\"mew\\" pokemon moves (thats my little joke)all and all a fantastic game(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the price is outrageous","review":"This game is 2 dollers at game haven.

This is one of the best games I have ever played. It is really fun as a single player, and the best party game I have ever played. There are a ton of game types to choose from for single and multiplayer.One thing that should be mentioned is that this game is not designed for people who only like fighting games. If you only like those types then this game will probably bore you. Smash Bros. is designed for people who love the games that these characters are from; ie Zelda, Mario, Metroid, etc.My only complaint is this: does there have to be so many pokemon? 4 of the 25 characters are pokemon, 2 of the arenas are pokemon based, plus there's the pokemon items. It doesn't detract from the fun of the game, its just that I really hate pokemon, and pickachu annoys me greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Smash Bros.

One player isn't great, so don't buy this unless you have friends or family to play it with. tournaments are fun, but only if you have 4 controlls and can play 4 to a match. It also takes too l;ong to skip the computer matches.It is fun but COULD BE BETTER"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME GAME!!!!!!!!!MY FAVORITE FOR GAMECUBE","review":"This is a awsome game. A big improvement from the 64 version.Tons of new characters and stages.If I would rate this game it would be rated E. The only thing about this game that would be scary for little kids like age 8 or younger is on adventure mode there are some guys walking around that do look quite like a mummy, its a thing walking around huntched over that lookes like it's dead.But that is only on 1 level.Great multiplayer game for everyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars isn't enough...","review":"From what I have heard about this game, it is going to be one of the best games for the gamecube ever. To tell the truth, I haven't even played the original SSB, but this game has so many cool features that I couldn't help but to beg my mom to get it for me for Christmas. I also know some secret characters:Mewtwo,(Gasp!) Pichu, Gannon,(GASP!!!) roy,(???) young link,Falco (from Starfox 64) Dr. Mario (How's he different?), Mr. Game and watch (Who's he?)and probably others. There are also cool modes of play, such as boss battles, Big-dude battles where your opponent is huge, and adventure mode. And also:DON'T BE A IDIOT AND SAY THIS GAME (...). This game deserves more than 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game By Gamemaster Jason","review":"This game is massive! The impressive graphics in this game are amazing! u can unlock alot of new characters and four new stages. I have ps2, xbox, and the cube, and this game is one of my favourites! It is a very fun game, especially if friends are over to have a little bit of multiplayer madness. The sound is very good and the satisfaction is ok. The new Super Sudden Death mode is awesome as well as the stamina mode, my favourite. My favourite character is Roy, having hit sandbag in homerun contest with him 714.9 feet! Prince Marth is also pretty good but I still prefer Roy. This game is a very stlyish fighting game for the cube and u just have to get this game if u have gc. If u don't, get one, and then get this game or Rougue Squadron 2 frst, or get both. In short, this game is incredible and is an absolute must have for fighter fans.Gratest Gaming Moment:Unlocking the powerhouse, Mewtwo!Time Played: 100+hours"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melee Rocks!!!","review":"I think Super Smash Bros Melee is the best game for the Gamecube so far. The detail and graphics are awesome, and there are a lot of levels to choose from. Also, there is a wide character selection (who wouldn't want to be Bowser and Kick Pikachu's butt all over the place?) There are also a lot of hidden characters to be unlocked, and most of them are extremely cool. However, I must warn you that the game can sometimes be frustrating on event modes, adventure modes and home run modes. In addition, sometimes unlocking characters can be very difficult. Even so, this game RULES!!! If you have a Gamecube, or are considering one, you will want to check this game out. IT TOTALLY REEKS OF AWESOMENESS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this game is better than the last one","review":"If you liked super smash bros. you will love Melee. you can collect trophies play different kinds of multi player games, you can play classic, adventure, or all star modes in one player.

Super Smash Brothers Melee on lay-by in Target. I have been Needing information for it and can't find any ANYWHERE, then my friend was given a gamecube and SSBM as a gift (NOT fair). So I got myself invited (hehe) and had a little go, now, it was the GREATEST game i have ever played, the graphics were amazing (compared to my old PS1) and I couldn't stop laughing. When you choose the character Mewtwo (after you unlock him) and hold down B to attack with a psychik ball of energy, pikacu comes up behind you and walks into it and it look like hes being electricuted. then when you let go and get him in the face he goes FLYING!!!!

What is there not to like? No blood is exchanged here either. A fighter without blood that rocks ... Nintendo is innovative. Aside from the no blood, legendary characters and crazy fun locations, you have mini-games and power-ups out the yin yang. In short, the power ups and the mini games are way fun. The power ups rule the game. From baseball bats to the SNES light gun. WOW. Finally, the unlockable characters will have you playing forever and ever. This games shelf life will be limitless. I'm on board for whatever sequel they come up with at whatever price.Bottom Line: Is it fun? Incredible game. Will I keep it? You bet. It has infinite replay value. Good for kids? Well it is just fighting. It is cartoony and fun, but that doesn't stop my kids from enacting the fighting scenes when they are done playing the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!!!! but needs even more......","review":"Well, i have to say this is the must have GCN to have.

Melee","review":"This is my absolute favorite game. The cutting-edge graphics are amazing! These graphics are so good that if you look closely, the characters show expressions with most controls. Unlike the first title for Nintendo64, ever so seldom does a button delay. In fact, they react so quickly it is almost as if they react before you even touch the button(s) pressed. There are originally 14 selectable characters, but as you go trough, complete goals, and play the multiplayer options you will recieve a chance to earn 11 more. For each character there is about 1-3 optional battle arenas(earned seperatelly). When you get to about 3/4 of the game you start to earn secret unlockables, in which give a strong advantage to your gameplay. Out of what I've told you so far, you can bet this is the game for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"just read the other reviews","review":"YUP! Just like everyone else says, the game is all that.

This one has more features than you can shake a stick at! I don't have enough room to mention them all, but I can give you an idea, the first being more characters in the game, any fighter should have a lot of characters and this one provides that one no problem. Secondly, multiplayer, the multiplayer has a four person battle royal, and will be a big party game come December. Last, so many more modes of play it's not funny, of course, yet again I can't name all but just to name a few, coin mode, tournament, Hit Point mode, and the list goes on.

The reason is the multiplayer. when the original super smash brothers was released the programmers realized that the most talked about aspect of the game is the multiplayer. It is so great because of how simple it is to play, yet how complex it can get. SSB: melee is also very unique. it is one of the only games to use items as a key element during a battle. Yet this game does have its shortfalls. the new adventure mode is nice, but the basic game has gone virtually unchanged. the classic mode gets VERY boring after a while, but the fact that there are 25 characters to fight with and unlock keeps you playing for a while. this is a fun game but not perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is better than the 1st game! i am the king of this game i am unbeatable!!!

In season one the show had some hits and misses, but in season two they found that perfect blend of what Charmed is all about. It's not a serious show, it's a fun show, and this season truly showed that the show was about family. You can see in most every episode touching scenes with sister bonding and the importance of family. Season two was great because it had light episodes (i.e. Animal Pragmatism) and serious episodes (i.e. Morality Bites). It's a great season and further develops the sisters' teachings of magic and what they are in for in the futre. Piper does a turn in the spotlight this season with her ongoing struggle to choose between Leo or Dan, Phoebe learns the hard way that magic is about protecting the innocent and not punishing the guilty, and Prue liberates herself and takes up a profession that she truly loves. Season two is Charmed at it's best and I highly recomend it for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"PhoneMate...

The problem is that on MY end of the line there is always static...a LOT of static. I've had other phones in the same spot for years, analog, 900mhz, etc... I've NEVER had ANY static on the line.

After about 6 weeks the phone developed static that started off low and rose to a crescendo that sounded like a lighting storm in the ear piece, occasionally punctuated with screeching noises. Changing the channel does not alleviate this problem, nor does coming closer to the base. A slap to the headset though, does quiet it down for a brief respite.

Cottingham is indeed a secular humanist, however he sees belief in God as a good way to attain meaning, and supports this with several of his own ideas. This may not go over well with atheists and agnostics though, since, in his mind, that kind of life-style doesn't make much sense when you consider life in the cosmos...In any event I think the best benefit of this book is the range of ideas covered in so few pages; he does it in a coherent and open manner. I didn't think he came off as completely disregarding the secular lifestyle but I do think he has an opinion which he does not refuse to express. This book is worth reading because it covers a wide range of issues such as science, morality, evolution, sociology, religion, etc. to attempt to explore the idea of what we mean by meaning and how we seek to acheive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vibes, good read","review":"A friend suggested this book to me, and I couldn't put it down.A new way of blending fact and fiction that works.

This review couldn't be further from the truth. The only similarity is that the book takes place in a similar geographic area. My entire book group agreed that the writing in Ms. Gamble's book was moving and the storyline beautifully crafted. On the other hand, Ms. Cappel's book read like a middle school book report which is probably why it was not picked up by a publisher. I now wonder if it was Ms. Cappel that wrote the only negative review of Ms. Gamble's book in an attempt to promote her own book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"I'm a teen and cartoons in the newer generations just aren't as entertaining as the classics.

Although the price is reasonable on this Polk, I was certainly not impressed with the sound produced. ALthough the CV only has one speaker and this Polk has 3 built into it, the sound on the Polk is so much quieter and less crisp. I guess I'll put it in with the tv in my bedroom. It certainly doesn't belong with my 50\\" Sony SXRD HDTV, my Harman Kardon receiver, or my JBL speakers.If you're just looking for a fair speaker at a reasonable price, I'd recommend the Polk. But, if you want a center channel that produces strong and crisp sound, you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Speaker That Could","review":"This little center channel speaker is an excellent buy for the price. I'm using it with a pair of Polk R15s and a Yamaha FSW100 subwoofer (no surround speakers) that are all hooked up to an Onkyo TX-SR304 and it sounds great! The dual 3.25\\" drivers do a good job pumping out good quality sound. It was able to keep up with the R15s and produces clear and clean dialog from a Dolby Digital or DTS material with seamless sound transition from left to center to right. The size is also perfect for my set up with a 32\\" LCD HDTV. The flat black plastic finish is made of high quality material and it doesn't feel and look cheap. The speaker came with a registration card, 2 wall mount templates and 4 rubber feet. 5 stars for this little speaker that could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Weak","review":"Speaker is small and made of plastic. 3\\" drivers are weak and not capable or reproducing lower frequencies.

Some of the graphics are extremely wonderful, while others are just so-so. Because each superhero has certain moves that are distinct for them, you will always want to come back and play the game as someone else. The game is sort of like an RPG, the way you have storyline segments all over the place. But the action is really nice and wonderful, overall.There's one battle in particular where a boss named Fin Fang Foom keeps appearing on a platform, and you have to attack him. This is a pretty fun fight, here. I bet more exciting fights are just like this one. A must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool game","review":"I love Marvel. This game is pretty good.

I think this message is wrong.The author doesn't talk much about excercise which is very important and can stop you from becoming overweight.The book also encourages you to eat foods that are very high in carbs and also high on the glycemic index. Which in my opinion is not a very good idea.French people live a completely different lifestyle compared to others and not all of them are slim. I have seen some fat ones too.The best way to try this method, is to stay in France for a couple of weeks or months.The diet is not very practical either.

You can save configurations (such as nighttime, cloudy, office etc) and access them quickly from the taskbar. I have one dead pixel, but at this resolution it is hardly noticeable. You have to buy the DVI to ADC converter to get it to work with an NVidia GeForce card ($$$). There is no loss in quality when using the converter (it is all digital). Color quality and brightness are even across the entire screen. The pixel response is fast for an LCD, but not as quick as a CRT. Still, DVDs and flight simulator rarely exhibit ghosting.

I feel that it has succeeded in teaching me everything I wanted to know about C++.One of the issues that bothers me is that, on several occasions, I find myself reading through a chapter and I'm told that I should read a much later chapter in order to understand the concepts being explained. If trying to get a well-rounded and complete education on C++, then I'm going to read the book cover-to-cover. I don't want to skip forward four chapters just to understand the paragraph that I'm on. This poor structuring of the book has resulted in at least a little frustration.I'm giving this one star to offset the 5-star review that one of the authors gave himself. Why would you do that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"For dummies, but they don't say so up front","review":"This book is far too long for the information it contains. The authors went with a light, conversational tone, which is just plain annoying most of the time. When I buy a book like this, especially one that says its for experienced programmers, I want it to be straightforward, concise, and comprehensive. This is none of those things. I was able to get what I needed out of it, so it wasn't totally useless, but it could have been a lot more useful than it was.This just goes further to prove to me that if I can find an O'Reilly book on a subject, that's the one I should buy. I've never been disappointed in anything from that publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much superficial coverage","review":"For a book of this size, I would have expected extensive coverage of key C++ concepts. However, I am very unsatisfied with this book, since the coverage of C++ is superficial at best. Too much space is wasted on aspects of software engineering. It seems every C++ topic is limited to 2 to 3 pages of glossing over; just when one is getting interested the topic ends prematurely. The treatments of the C++ library suffers the most, with language features only barely adequate.For example, the topic of C++ string is spread out over multiple disorganized chapters, which none of the chapters can do justice to this important topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great C++ book for Object Oriented Developers","review":"I am a Java programmer and needed to do a software using C++.

Only the Air Force flys F-16's, and not off of Aircraft Carriers. The Navy flys F-18's and F-14's, but not F- 16's.

Now, although you can still hear it try to open, you have to use the key to get it to open. Yes I replaced the batteries, it is a mechanical not electrical problem. I contacted the manufacturer and since it was out of warranty they offered to sell me me one for 25% off of the list price. Wow, how impressive, offer to sell me one for more than I can buy one from Amazon, without a discount.

The electronics still work, but the latch mechanism has lost its strength and can't open the door; the door's spring makes the internal hasp push too hard against the latch for the latch to be able to move out of the way, I assume. If I push the door in slightly while entering the code, it opens. But that is not called functioning for a device of this type. I lubricated it thoroughly and it still could not overcome the friction. Even with new batteries. I suppose I could try to weaken the spring somehow. And, like others here, I am not pleased by the noise of the door when opening.What's more, I saw on an online video that if you tilt this unit and smack it on the floor on its side (left side, if I remember right), it pops right open. There is no mechanism preventing a jolt from the side from opening it, which is pretty short-sighted and irresponsible. An inventor worth his salt would have made a far better device."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Don't Stand Behind It","review":"I bought this product elsewhere.

Using this book, you will not learn the necessary phrases for a short trip to Japan. If you want to learn common phrases, do not buy this book.

If you are a serious student, then take this review seriously: learn hiragana immediately. Do not buy this book; buy the kana version of this book, and begin studying hiragana while you are waiting for it to arrive in the mail. If your college forces you to buy the Romanized version (like mine did), do future students a favor by requesting that they switch over to the kana version.Although my review of this book sounds harsh, do not be mislead.

But even without knowing Spanish one can see that it is not faithful to the way of speaking. It does not show the parallel constructions when it could even without sacrificing the choice to rhyme. It adds images that are not there. It does not give the feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a try","review":"This phone had great reception and I was very pleased with the features. We have voice mail and the button on top of the phone will flash if you have a new message. It was an easy, quick way to know when you had a message waiting. The caller ID feature works fine. The problem for us is that several weeks after having this phone, it suddenly won't work. It doesn't appear to be the battery and the user's guide offers no insight. I have not looked into the problem enough to know where the blame lies. I like this phone enough to try it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Performers","review":"I just recently stumbled upon Laura from a friend in N. Jersey that knows her from New York clubs. She is a very nice listen. Sort of an Irish sounding Jonie Mitchell for today. I know there's a better example out there, but it doesn't come to mind at the moment. She doesn't seem to have a political edge (but this isn't the 70's)or even sound exactly like that, but it's the from the soul, mellow, but not boring, honest expressions with original piano backdrop that draws you in. I look forward to hearing more in years to come. She's playing in Quakertown,PA to the Arts Alive festival on May 17th (1 PM), so I am looking forward to it. It's free too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst decorating book ever!","review":"I can't believe everyone else has rated this so highly. The ideas are not inspired at all, and everything still looks like junk--junky junk. There is one (one!) good idea in my opinion, and that is the coffee table made out of an old covered playpen. Unfortunately, the chances of finding such a playpen are zero to nil.The pictures don't help. The book design is too \\"artsy\\" and the ladies have placed numerous pictures of themselves doing \\"funny\\" things into it. A complete waste of space. There is not much information to be gained from the photos.Overall I was very disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Simple Stuff","review":"I recently reviewed this book for my ladies group. Some interesting things here, but the practicality of much of it all eludes me. While this may very well be a fun hobby for the 50-something authors (post-retirement perhaps), the costs for the average person to travel around the country to find some of this so-called junk - if one can even find some of it, combined with the costs of shipping it back to your home and then more costs to transform it into newer, improved pieces of junk seem quite prohibitive to me, and overly complicated I have to think. Since many of these items appear to have similarities to various items sold by Pottery Barn and other chic home boutiques, it would seem most practical to simply go this route and spare yourself all other hassles, time , and costs. Just an opinion from someone who bends toward keeping life as simple and uncomplicated as possible. Each to their way as they say."},{"rating":"2","title":"great great great","review":"I can look through this book time and time again and never get tired of it. The book has PLENTY of project ideas and even explains how to do a few of them step by step. It's more of a place to look for inspiration than a step by step guide, though, so if you want something more instructional this may not be it. For me, it was perfect because they have SUCH unique, original, inventive uses for junk.The book doesn't just give little project ideas to drop in around the house, it actually shows how you can create several different looks and styles for a living space using...JUNK.It's just great. One of my favorite books to browse through for inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving Junking","review":"I have not been disappointed by Sue Whitney and her friends yet!!

They don't have them at my usual shopping locations, so I happened upon them at a friend's house. These little bags really do help to contain odor. I keep them in the nursery and in the diaper bag. They are handy, tie easily and have a nice scent. I have now started to use them for other things. Kitty litter, cat food cans, even unmentionable...ahem...\\"female items\\" in the bathroom. I always order them online from Amazon and a box like this lasts a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I love the idea of diaper sacks, and this one is very good, the scent is just enough to mask the contents ;-) Better than the ones you get at Babies 'R Us. Buy the biggest count you can find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody wants to smell dirty diapers","review":"I use this for both at home and when I am out. At home I only use it for diaper with #2 so I don't need to take out trash every day. Once I was out with my daughter at farmer's market and she needs to be change. I change her in the car and put double bag over it. I can't find the public trash can so I put the dirty diaper sack in my trunk. When we got back from shopping we drove home and I was glad that I have this diaper sack. It saves my life because I don't need to drive around looking for public trash can to get rid of it. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and easy","review":"We use these downstairs as an alternative to buying another Diaper Genie. We store them in our diaper bin downstairs and throw them in our kitchen trash can after use. For the most part, they hide the diaper smell. We sometimes have to use two bags in order to eliminate the smell if we can't throw it in the trash can outside right away. It's still much cheaper than the Diaper Genie and just as effective. The baby powder smell of the bags is pleasant and not overpowering. I will continue to buy these."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are a must have in a diaper bag and other places","review":"I found so many uses for these little bags after getting them. They are mainly for dirty diapers, because there's nothing worse than being at someone's house and not know what to do with a dirty stinky diaper. Now I can easily conceal the odor and move on with my visit.But there's many other uses for these bags. I put some in the laundry room for kitty litter clean ups and in my car for trash pick ups or spills. The odor is strong enough to conceal odors and the tying them are a breeze.I would definitely recommend them and get more when I run out. It's amazing how long they last though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for dogs too!","review":"I like to use these for my mini poodle.

But i like Especially for baby sacks better only bcoz they smell nicer but Sassy are not bad at all. I am just being a little picky."},{"rating":"2","title":"multi-use and well worth every penny!","review":"How anyone could rate these bags less than 5 stars is beyond me. They work for their intended use better than any other bag or system (diaper genie? EWWW!) I've ever tried. They can hold multiple diapers if you really want to get your money's worth, and like others have said, can be used for so many other things, from cat litter cleanup to car trash bags. Excellent baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super convenient","review":"Love these! Only thing I'd change is the scent. I'm not crazy about baby powder scent anyhow, and it's overpowering in this product.

She feels much more confident about traveling so I am happy with them. (I don't care for the baby powder scent but it is acceptable!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be biodegradable, doesn't hold smell that well","review":"These don't work that great at keeping our kids poop smells at bay in the trash. I found that using a 13 gallon trash bag twisted around the diaper and then turned inside-out and twisted again then tied worked far better. You can get almost just as many uses from a pack of 75 13gal trash bags and they are so much cheaper (about $2). I say this because I had to double bag the sassy bags to actually control the smells. I'm no longer using these because I've switched to cloth diapers.Another bad thing is they aren't biodegradable, maybe they should change that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragrance is gross","review":"I've been using these bags for over 3 years now. The bags themselves are fine, but the fragrance is just gross. Maybe I just got a bad batch this time, or maybe Sassy recently changed the fragrance? These bags used to have a nice baby powder fragrance, but this time they smelled like bug spray. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - toxic chemical smelling bags","review":"I've ordered these twice. The first time, they were alright and a decent price for the amount of bags you receive. The second order - the smell coming off the bags was horrific! It smelled like bug spray or something toxic - they would stink up the whole room! I returned them hoping for a better batch. NO LUCK! They smell just as bad and my husband had to put them out in the garage. We'll be using them as poop bags for the dog instead of diaper disposal bags. They smell way too strong to put anywhere near the family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"decreased quality","review":"I used to buy these bags and was very happy but recently they started making them so thin that they break even before usage. No longer a good product unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for babies!","review":"I use these when I clean out my cat's litter box, and they are wonderful. The perfect size, plus are slightly scented enough to mask any unpleasant odors. The handles are also helpful for tying off the bags. I clean the litter box every day so there isn't too much accumulation, but the bags seem strong and durable enough to handle a lot more than what I scoop into them.Don't have any kids, but I'm sure they'd work just as well for babies. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reliable Product for a Cheap Price","review":"We never go anywhere with our baby with out these bags. bought 2 and I'm about to run out.

Nothing glamorous about them. They just do the job. No offensive scents from the plastic. Easy to pull out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"they work","review":"My son's room was starting to smell. These bags cut the smell almost completely. They are thin and small, but they work. I found the sent of the bags pleasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Powder Scented","review":"I've used these sacks before in a small 50-pack and really liked them. They had a very fresh baby powder scent and worked well for dirty diapers and spit up on outfits. This 200-pack smells totally different though. Instead of having that nice, light powder scent I liked so much, these smell like someone's perfume-doused granny. The box is labeled \\"baby powder scented\\" though, so I'm not sure why. I'll finish out the box because they are still useful, but I'm glad I'm not sitting beside the open box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disposable Bags Work Well, Need Better Travel & Home Dispensers","review":"Bags have a lovely baby powder scent and work just fine to dispose of baby diaper, sanitary napkin or incontinence pad. Agree with another reviewer who felt a soft carry case would be helpful, although using a zip lock baggie works. But I also feel there needs to be a dispenser for home use. In the bathroom or changing area found the cardboard box they come in is clumsy when I pull a half dozen bags come out, not just one. Good product, but needs both a travel case and an at home pop-up dispenser. This is why I gave product 4 not 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand Name isn't Necessary","review":"We received these as a gift once, but quickly learned that we didn't need to buy a well-known name brand to get the same job done. These bags are a great product, but there is really nothing better about them than disposable diaper bags you can buy at $1 stores in packs of 100. There's no need to spend the extra money for something you're going to put stinky or dirty items in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smell great, easy to use","review":"These are a must have, you're out and about with no trash can around. These smell nice and are easy to stuff into the diaper bag. My pediatrician doesn't allow you to leave diapers in their trash, so I always keep the little baggies with me until I can dump them in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bags and a great value!","review":"We use these bags instead of a diaper pail. They are so convenient and the perfect size. You get a great value for your money. My son is almost a year old and these bags have been great for the past year. Easy to dispose of so his nursery doesn't stink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like them! I really do like them!","review":"I saw A few negative reviews, most were positive so I decided to try this product. I normally buy the Arm & Hammer lavender-baking soda bags. However, these bags are also scented and there are tons more. The baby powder scent is a bit generic smelling, but we're not eating them we are using them to throw away waste and they do conceal bad odors. The plastic is as thick as a grocery store bags. They are a decent size, as I use these for my baby's diapers and my dog's dirty pads (I double the bag for my shepherd). I will buy these from now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The smell is quite powerful","review":"I bought these to use to clean out the litterbox; however, the powdery cloying scent is quite overpowering, even before the box is opened. I could smell it down the hall when the package arrived.The scent is mentioned in the product description, but I did not think it would be so strong and artificial. It almost coats your throat.That said, the bags serve their purpose - a bit smaller than anticipated, however. I will be seeking an alternative when these run out. Ironically, I keep these bags - which I use for kitty litter - in a large Ziploc bag to cut down on THEIR scent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic bags!","review":"With my first baby, we got a diaper genie for a gift. For the first 5 months, I loved it! But then I noticed it stunk so bad in my son's room. I would have to change the genie weekly, or more, so it didn't stink. The refills were so expensive, and just not worth it anymore. So I decided to try these bags. I LOVE them. I throw all wet diapers in a garbage can in his room, and put the soiled ones in one of these bags, and throw them in the kitchen garbage (since it's taken out daily). I NEVER smell a dirty diaper. These bags are so cheap, so handy, just brilliant. My son is now 2 1/2, and I have a 7 month old. I use these bags daily, and highly recommend them to any parent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST PRODUCT FOR DIRTY DIAPERS","review":"I had a sample of this product and was pleasantly surprised to find they came in a 200 count. No more diaper pails and no more mess. I highly recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial scent is too strong","review":"The artificial scent in these diapers sacks is very strong. I was hoping we could stomach it, but the \\"baby powder\\" scent fills the room with fragrance. We ended up tossing these out in the trash. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"these thin bags don't block smell and fail to mask it","review":"These bags are very, very thin. They can't block the diaper smell, so instead the company tried to cover up the diaper smell with a scent that is so strong I can't stand to leave the box open. The diaper smell eventually overpowers the scent because the bags are sooooo thin.In addition, the way the bags are placed in the box they don't pop up as you pull one out, so I'm always struggling to get another bag out as I'm handling a dirty diaper.For this product to really work well, the bags need to be much thicker so that the diaper smell is blocked NOT masked.The one nice thing about this product is the handle ties. They are easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have in house and on the go","review":"These bags are a must for disposing dirty diapers. They have a good ties and nice smell that stops the diaper from stinking up the room. Better price and value than the Munchkin ones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a diaper pail","review":"I use these in the diaper bag and in the house. They work better than a diaper pail because the smell is contained and you don't build up an entire diaper pail of smelly diapers. The cost per use is also very close to the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It has very good smell and contains the odor. It's very easy to use. But the bag is a little bit small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"Hard to be passionate about plastic bags but these are PERFECT! the size, the smell, and how easy they are to tie. I am still using the same box for my 1.5 year old and they really do mask any bad smell until you can dispose of them. I also use them for holding dirty spoons and empty baby food jars that are messy until I can get them home to wash them up. This should be on the must have list for new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"No diaper pail needed. Dependable, good smelling, perfect size","review":"Looking around alot online, I was trying to decide whether or not to invest in a diaper pail. Previously, I ordered the Sassy brand disposable changing pads and was pleased. So when I saw these bags by the same company I decided to try them out. Once again, these bags have met my expectations. They are durable and have little handles on them much like plastic grocery bags. They fit 2 toddler diapers and up to 4 smaller size diapers. With the way these bags are working for me, I will not be ordering a diaper pail after all. This is saving me money as I would have to buy replacement bags for any diaper pail. They also smell like baby powder, which I happen to love. Will be ordering these in the future to keep my stock up."},{"rating":"2","title":"POOOFect!!!","review":"The perfect smelling bag for the horrible smelling diaper butt. I love these perfect for every home. I recommend these sacks for every household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much scent","review":"Overall the bags work fine. But the scent is too strong and the ingredients for the fragrance are unlisted on the package (the fragrance could have potentially harmful phthalates, d-limonene, etc.). Before I opened the box, I could smell the fragrance from the bags.Almost everything I buy for the baby and the household is fragrance-free. So if you typically buy fragranced soaps, air fresheners, etc. for your home, then these bags shouldn't bother you much. The other popular green-friendly, decomposable bags on Amazon have about half the scent but that's still too strong for me.I wound up using regular ziplock bags (which don't hold in odor well) and a small trash can with a charcoal filter in the lid to keep in odors. Every Tuesday and Friday I empty the small trash to go out with the garbage. There's no poopy diaper smell in the room and no fragrance, so I'm happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hide smell.","review":"These bags are good for the first two weeks of the baby life.

I would, however, say that they are convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great doggie poop bags","review":"A friend with small children & a dog turned me on to this product. Dog poop stinks & the scented doggie bags sold in pet stores are EXPENSIVE. These are perfect for cost & smell. My doggie walker came without her own bags once so she used the Sassy Sack. Now her bags are Sassy Sacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for New Baby","review":"We have used these sacks along with a cheaper diaper pail and it has worked great. We had a diaper champ with our first child, and it eventually smelled terrible. With these, you simply throw each diaper in a bag, tie it shut and throw it in the diaper pail. We only empty the pail once it is full, sometimes after a week or two. No smells. You must buy these for a new baby, unless you enjoy bad smells or want to take the trash out constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!!","review":"I have used other brands of diaper sacks but these are the best.

She loves games, and kicks everyone's but at tougher games like Monopoly. I am surprised at how much she loves this Cat and Mouse game, because there's not much to it. If you play by the rules it's over in three minutes. I find it boring, no strategy or even thinking, but the little one never tires of it. You can make your own rules to render it more interesting. It's a very high quality game structurally, Ravensburger is THE BEST QUALITY toy company. I highly recommend this toy as a first game for 3 or 4 year olds. I never would have bought it if I had played it first, but she gets such a kick out of it I'm not sorry we have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Colonial History","review":"This is not just a superb telling of the story of the Regulator movement in preRevolutionary North Carolina, but rather a topnotch explanation of colonial economics, religiion and government as it applied in the South at that time.

I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth 10 stars","review":"I agree with Ms. Abigail wholeheartedly. This Book was interesting in the beginning but the more you got in to it you just couldn't put it down. This is my first Robin McKinley book and my most favorite book of all time. I LOVE IT. I recommend all the Robin McKinley books to everyone who wants to go to imaginary places and likes a touch of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable and gloriously addictive!","review":"This is a fantastic book. I have re-read it so many times I'velost count. And I'm not the kind of person who likes re-readingbooks. There's just something about Harry Crewe and the land of Damar that keeps me coming back for more. Harry is a very interesting character who is easy to like and I found myself staying up to all hours of the night to see what happened to her next. Romance, adventure, humor, and a pretty nice looking sword, it's got it all. Read this book! You will NOT regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"Like everyone else, I think that this is one of the best books ever written. I first read it in 4th or 5th grade, and I didn't like it. Sacriledge! I found the first chapter or two to be slow so I returned it to the library unfinished. However, something drew me back and I couldn't put it down the second time. So stick with it. I also recommend the Hero and the Crown and Deerskin (although this book is quite different than the other two)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is amazing, full of action and adventure. The book is full of adventure and you never know what is going to come next. It first starts off slow and then it gets better and better.I loved this book from start to end,and I would read it all over again if I could.I'am sure th at anybody that likes adventure and action would love it.You would have to be crazy not to like this book.If you like books and good ones you would read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ADORE this book!","review":"I read this for the first time when I was 8 or 9, since then, I have reread it countless times. This book sticks with you. Whenever a I write a story, a character seems to be named Harry, Hari, or something like that. I've also just been obsessed with the desert and dogs and what I call \\"Harry pants\\" (read the book and you'll know what I'm talking about!) ever since reading this book. Please read this book. It creates a unique paradigm that will stay with you for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Pat story, anyone?","review":"I don't understand why I can't enjoy Robin McKinley's novels more. Somehow, no matter how many I read, none of them really grab me. The same goes for The Blue Sword. Nothing impressed me at all.The characters seem remote, the writing is remote, too many fantastic and unbelievable things happen, there is no real fear that the good guys won't win and there'll be a happy ending; everything about this book disappointed me. Robin McKinely seemed to be very confused, impatient, and distracted when she wrote this one. The plot was pat and the characters, well, I already complained about that.Suffice it to say, this book left me cold. As do, surprisingly and a little strangely, almost all of McKinley's stuff, which is such a shock to everyone, seeing as she is so beloved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complicated fantasy.","review":"It is a rather hard one to get in to. It manipulates half of the book in preparing for the climax. Finally when the last battle comes the girl simply strolls right to the top of the mountain, holds out her sword, and the enemie is terminated. I expected more of a fight to the end strugle, than a simple distruction.I dare not give this book a one. Even if this story is a rather dull, any one who contributes his thoughts of mind to other people deserves some form of credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I failed to get drawn into this story, and I love books about magic and strange lands. There was no real emotion surrounding the main character who gets kidnapped and eventually married by a \\"foreign\\" King--no sense of panic, no culture shock, I wasn't \\"with\\" her or drawn into her adventures or emotions. There were many boring parts I just skimmed, but didn't fail to notice much that didn't make sense, both in the writing and in the plot. For a REALLY good fantasy/adventure, read Philip Pullman's trilogy, starting with The Golden Compass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and far from believable","review":"I noticed this book is ranked in the on-line top 100 fantasy and sci fi books of all time. I really wonder who voted for it. The book is basically an adolescent fantasy where everyone lives happily ever after. The characters are flat, the world stereotyped (it's basically a poor take off of Frank Herbert's Dune) and Harry Crewe the superhero is totally unbelievable. I mean, how believable is it that a poor orphan girl who has never held a sword in her hand in her life, and is only a passable horserider, could become, in two months time, a swordsman on par with Conan who can ride like the Lone Ranger? Not to mention that she suddenly becomes endowed with the magical power of Gandalf and can see the future and start localized earthquakes. Although the authoress Robin McKinley has written several books before this one, it has the feel of a first novel. If it were just that, I could excuse McKinley, but as it stands...well, I'll pass. Oh yeah, and it was boring, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard This Before","review":"Throughout this book, McKinley gives the impression that the unfolding events are somehow inevitable. The main character does not have any real choices to make because she is led by some mystical force. This impression never leaves the reader -- even when we see the main character make a \\"surprising\\" choice. In the back of our minds we know that she was supposed to do this. We don't worry about the result because she'll be alright. No real danger ... no real peril ... ZZZZ.It's not that McKinley is writing in the spirit of Tolkien or Herbert -- she's rehashing their stuff. Did you wonder, around the middle of the book, if you had heard some of this before? You had. The bad guys resemble orcs (at least the minimal descriptions you get at the end) and the good guys resemble Fremen. This reader prefers a fresh story."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BLUE SWORD-ROBIN McKINLEY","review":"Harry Crewe just moved into the orange-growing country of Daria. But when she sees Corlath, the Hillfolk king, she knows she belongs with them. Corlath kidnaps her because he realized it too, and brings her on their journey to defeat the evil that waits across the hills. Only then will Harry realize that she is destined to carry the Blue Sword, Gonturan, and defeat the evil.A horrible book! The metaphors are likely to make you cringe, and the dialogue VERY run-on. A great plot idea, but a horrible way to do it! But don't give up on Robin McKinley, the sequel to this, \\"The Hero and the Crown\\", was absolutely FABULOUS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tale of magic and adventure","review":"If you like fantasy books full of magic and adventure, with alittle romance thrown in, this is the book for you.Harry has beenliving at a military outpost on the edge of her countries border for some month.

Unexpectedly Harry's inner urges are granted when she is kidnapped by the neighboring countries King. The king has been driven to take her from her home by a magical force of the royal line, and does not quite understand it himself. Once in the company of the king and his men Harry finds herself feeling at home, and the hope of an entire nation.I thourghly enjoyed this book and think you will too if you like other books of this genre.

Every bit as enthralling as a Patricia C. Wrede dragon book or a Harry Potter opus, The Blue Sword is older and deeper than the former and both richer and better crafted than the latter. The world that Robin McKinley creates in The Blue Sword is every bit as interesting and believable as the one Patricia C. Wrede creates for her Mairelon books. Too bad Amazon has no option for 6 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Well, after reading a lot of fantasy books, I find this has satisfied my fastidious pickings.

I re-read it countless times and was my second favorite book (the prequel, Hero and the Crown, became my favorite). 17 years later I still cherish it. McKinley uses complex, intoxicating language that may make some reviewers call it \\"slow\\", but I love the way it enriches the tale.Of the two Damarian tales, I think The Hero and the Crown has a little more depth, but I would still read this one first. It was written first and it sets up the legend that is explained in Hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"You just cant put this book down!","review":"I have always loved Robin Mckinly books and the Blue Sword was no exception. The book starts off with Corlath the leader of the Hill People going over to the house where Harry Crew a young girl was living. He went to the house to ask for help ti defeat the Northeners. Unfortunatly Corlath does not get the help he wants but he did see Harry and new she had to go back with him and his men , so he kidnapped her and took her to the Hill People. With the Hill People she learns many things like how to fight and ride a horse like Hill People do. Harry Crew also becomes a Kings Rider and is very happy. But than the threat of the Northerners grows. Harry knows she has to do somthing to help the Hill People that have become her friends the only question is what.If you want a book you cant put down you realy should read the Blue Sword.

I LOVED it, the characters are easy to understand and the magical touch in it is totally amazing. Corlath is a really cool character, I like him alot...I like Harry too, she's perfect for a Lady Hero. The way she adapts and learns to cope with her situation is very...er...what's the word?

The adventure of a newcomer into a different culture, what could be a better book for a young girl. The first time I read this book I was about fourteen. Since then I have probably read it ten times (I'm 22 now). The story of Harry going into battle and standing up for her cause just touches something in me. In addition, I love the descriptions of the horses and the fact that the Hill People ride without bridles or stirrups. This book inspires me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fantasy book that pulls you in!","review":"The Blue Sword is about a girl named Harry Crewe. She is an orphan that loves the desert where she lives, but she wants more. Corlath, King of the Hillfolk takes Harry and brings her back to his hills. She learns to ride the hill horses, speak their language, and she becomes a warrior. Soon, she becomes one of the King's Riders. She is given Gonturan, the blue sword, which once belonged to Aerin that is in the book 'The Hero And The Crown' which takes place before 'The Blue Sword'. Harry goes on a journey against Corlath's will and on this journey, Gonturan and Corlath help Harry. When she returns from her journey she and Corlath admit their love for each other. This book is a great fantasy that has a lot of adventure, but it happens in a calm way. I would recommend that you start with 'The Hero And The Crown' and if you like that, which I did, then you should like this book, 'The Blue Sword'."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found a new favorite author!!","review":"This book rocks! It is definitely one of my all-time favorites. If you read it, you might want to just skim through the first chapter. It's kind of hard to get in to. Once you get into it, though, The Blue Sword is the kind of book that you just can't put down. I won't say a word on what it's about because everything is connected, so just read another review if you want to get hints. I definitely think you should read it. It's a really good fantasy book, just as good as Harry Potter for those of you who think those books rock. Thanks for reading this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put it down.","review":"\\"The Blue Sword\\" is about Angharad -- Harry -- Crewe, a recently orphaned young lady who moves to the desert area of the continent Damar. By chance she locks eyes with Corlath, the Hill-King, who had come to visit the residency. It was, perhaps, fate, but it changes their lives forever. To tell you any more might give it away, but you can always read the book jacket. This book was interesting in the beginning, and soon graduated to compelling and then impossible-to-put-down. I was reading this on a school night and used up 2 hours of precious homework time because I just HAD to know what happened. All the right details were there, but so subtle that it the end was a pleasant surprise. The writing was so vivid that you could feel your heart racing during the exciting parts. You have to read this book at least 3 times to get all the details. Then read Robin McKinley's other books to get a true appreciation for her wonderful writing talent.--Abigail Short"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really like Robin McKinley's books. She is indeed an awesomeauthor and I love her books. In the 8th Grade, my English teacher letus choose a book of R. McKinley for our book report credit. I chose the book Beauty and really liked it. This summer, I went to the library,(I Love reading) and checked out this neat book to see what it was all about. I couldn't put it down. It was so good. Robin does use a language of her own in these books, and it is fun to read them. I can totally relate to the two \\"worlds\\" getting along and the challenges of understanding cultures and languages. I recommend this book. (I think it's specifically designed for teenage girls ages, 13-15. You'll love Harry and the story.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful McKinley novel","review":"An exciting, involving adventure, set in a richly textured country and culture. All the characters, even the very minor ones, are well-drawn and distinct. While Harry's training and adventures are the backbone of the story, the basic conflict has more to do with culture clashes than with battling demons. Harry's struggle to reconcile the two sides of her heritage is one that many people can identify with. The romance that develops between the equally strong-willed Harry and Corlath is believably conflicted, yet beautifully romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thou shalt read this book! Now!!","review":"Gods, by my troth, this is absolutly one of the best books I have ever read!! Wit, interesting characters, magic (crucial), animals, ... well, I could go on forever. I don't understand why anyone could read this book and *not* like it. If thou hast not read this book please read it *now*, if not for thyne own good, then for the troubled state of my own mentality. So go and buy/borrow it, and read it at least 14 times weekly!!! Enjoy!! Would also reccomend books by Tamora Pierce, Brian Jacques, Patrica C.

One day while I was really bored I decided to start it. Once I did I couldn't stop. McKinley creates a whole world with her characters. Damar is a world that draws you in and never lets you go. I still think about this book four months after reading it! Harry is a young girl, living with friends of her brothers. She isn't happiest of all there but it is her life. Then that life is turned upside down and inside out when the king of the wild hill people pays a visit. The king can't get Harry out of his mind and finally turns around and kidnaps her. There she is taken to a whole new society, whole new ways of life, a whole new language. She must learn all of this and must also learn that she has a reason for being there. She must save the hill people. This book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Ages, All Genres","review":"I received The Blue Sword as a gift, to my utter dismay, when I was fourteen. I had never enjoyed fiction. Unfortunately, my aunt didn't know that. I hesitantly read the first three chapters -- and found I couldn't put it down. The storyline ropes in everyone, even older readers, even those who dislike fiction or fantasy. You will find yourself swept up into this rich, gripping world which McKinley has sown so tenderly, and be glad for it. The cover of my copy fell off years ago, from loving wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 years and still a favorite","review":"I was first introduced to this book in 8th grade and i have been addicted to it sense. This strikes me as a great accomplishment because i am now in college and will still turn to this book when i need a book that will never fail to leave me in a better mood once i have finished it again. i love the blend of fantasy with things that i can connect to the real world.

Harry soon begins to feel as if she belongs in her new life and she accepts her destiny to protect Damar.The Blue Sword is the sequel to The Hero and the Crown and I much preferred this book to it's prequel. Harry, like many of McKinley's heroines, is very likeable and Corlath is given much more development than McKinley's usual leading men. I really enjoyed the beginning of the book. Harry's adjustment to her new surroundings and her getting to know her kidnappers was very interesting. The book drags a bit in the middle but it quickly picks up the pace again and the end is satisfying. I don't really like McKinley's Damar series as much as some of her fairytale books but The Blue Sword is a great addition to any fantasy/romance fan's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped 3 times all wrong","review":"I ordered two new Wagner disk brake rotors from Amazon.

I sent that back and they replaced it with according to Wagner(I checked with them) a counterfeit rotor. At that point I sent back both rotors. The folks at Amazon were very good about trying to resolve the issue and refunded all my money. I will use Amazon again for that reason. I understand some suppliers to Amazon may not be what they should and I don't fault Amazon for this because they can't police every one of the thousands of suppliers they use.

It was so slow and boring, I forced myself to read the first half and then skipped to the end. I guess I was expecting some sort of mystery, which it isn't. Started out great and just petered out, as it went nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much backstory","review":"This was my first Ruth Rendell novel. I picked it up after seeing her name appear with very high praise on a list of top psychological thriller reads.Based on this novel, I'd call her more of a literary fiction mystery writer. The action doesn't really pick up until the half-way point in the book, but then steadily increases to the strong ending.I rated the book so low because I thought too much of the book (likely half) was superfluous narration to fill in the main characters's history. I think I could have understood the position of both main characters without so much detail.If it hadn't been for the list of thrillers to read, I might not have finished the book. It began without a \\"hook\\", prompting me to read on, but I kept thinking that there must be more if she is such a prominent author.Some day I might try another Rendell/Vine novel, but I'd make sure it came with plenty of hot reviews and a quicker pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I usually enjoy the books recommended by Stephen King, even though with a few exceptions (_The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon_, _The Green Mile_) I am generally not a fan of his writing. Rendell's book was on his recommended summer reading list, so I bought it. I stopped reading it after about 80 pages. Dull, dull, dull. In spite of that and because of its numerous glowing reviews, I loaned it to a friend. (My opinion appeared to be in the minority after all.) She also gave up less than halfway through. Can't recommend this one at all, sorry.

She limns interesting situations but her understanding of human psychology (and in this case, the psychology of childhood trauma) so badly that it makes the journey painful for anyone familiar with these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sight for Sore Eyes","review":"Ruth Rendel is a master at familiarizing one with a character and then subtly surprising the reader with plot developments. It is only at the conclusion that one realizes how neatly all the little events affect each other and the characters. The reader simply gets drawn in, deeper and deeper. Such skillful writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than a thriller","review":"Ruth Rendell's bestseller offers much more than a conventional thriller, though it is that as well. The long but captivating character exposition at the beginning and the unexpected ending, indeed, make this as much a psychological drama as a conventional crime-writing piece. As little as possible is best betrayed of the plot, but Francine, our young and virtuous heroine, is at risk from the attentions of multiple twisted individuals, including an evil step-mother and an admirer with a sinister bent. A Sight for Sore Eyes might in this sense qualify as a twentieth-century spoof of a Victorian novel. But it is much more and, while this is a page-turner, it deserves to be read slowly for its grim humour, social analysis, and fine descriptive material. I look forward to reading more of Rendell's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Pychological Thriller","review":"This is the second Ruth Rendell book that I have read and I appreciate her writing ability. She did an excellent job keeping the reader interested in the story. Poor Francine was a young girl who was tramatized by witnessing the murder of her mother. She is sent to a child pychologist to help her regain her ability to speak and to learn to deal with her tragedy. The pychologist becomes her stepmother and is a real piece of work. Much less stable than Francine. Francine grows up and develops a relationship with a man. Unfortunately Teddy has many problems including murdering people and showing no remorse. It was a sad but intense story. I was not able to predict the ending but I loved how it turned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all adds up to nothing","review":"The strength of this book is the characterizations, and all of the characters are unlikeable. I couldn't find myself caring about what happened to them. Usually Rendell is good at making unbelievable situations believable, but the plot in this novel was that of a second-rate potboiler. At the end of the book, I had the feeling, 'is that it?', which is not my usual reaction to Rendell's works. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sight for Sore Eyes","review":"I've read several of Ruth Rendell's books and this is probably my favorite.

Rendell/Vine delivers again!","review":"While other prolific authors like Stephen King find themselves floundering for material in the later stages of their careers, Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine is one of those rare authors who continues to develop artistically. I am an avid Rendell/Vine fan who has read all of her novels, novellas and short stories, but I must confess that I await each new novel with a mixture of anticipation and dread. I pray for another masterpiece, but worry that Rendell/Vine has run out of tricks. Thankfully, as with The Chimney Sweeper's Boy, I was not disappointed! A Sight for Sore Eyes is one of Rendell's finest novels, combining the psychological insights and stunning conclusions which are this author's trademarks.

Stem cell research has been fought about for years now and this one makes you realize why. Where is the line drawn when it comes to altering our natural course of human life and what happens when you attempt to overstep those bounds for personal gain? In this book the main character is drawn into a clinical trail involving stem cell procedures, but as she digs a little deeper she begins to discover that while most of the work being done is having phenomenal results, other aspects of the research are disastrous and she may be the key to undoing the damages caused to others. But at what cost? And why are they keeping so many secrets from her? Who is the mysterious woman the institute is hiding and why?

Woodiwiss books. My best friend gave me the original hardcover to keep. It seems to me that most women in romance novels depend on their mates to protect them. This bothers me. Yet, Aislinn was a strong female character who had a backbone. She didn't let Wulfgar stop her. She was strong throughout the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MEDIEVAL ROMANCE EVER WRITTEN.","review":"As some other readers have mentioned, this was my 2nd romance novel too (the 1st being KW's The Flame & The Flower). Now, 20+ yrs & uncountable romance books later, this one still stands out as the best medieval romance i've ever read. The time, the characters, the events, all come to life under KW's skillful writing (how i wish she would write another one like this). The passion between Wulfgar & Aislinn is palpable & contrary to some readers' comments, there is no real rape of the heroine (i would never be able to stomach that). The story gives a vivid account of the Battle of Hastings (albeit, more from the normans' perspective) & paints a true picture of a mighty warrior - Wulfgar - i still smile when i think of him *s*, & a strong woman - Aislinn - her strength lies in her wisdom & gentleness. All in all, a wonderful book that you will find yourself reading over & over again (my original finally fell apart). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars BUT be warned...","review":"I LOVE Kathleen Woodiwiss' books but like most of them (except for A Rose in Winter), they are WAY too long. Like The Flame and the Flower, a lot happens in the beginning and then there are PAGES AND PAGES of the hero and heroine taking baths together and telling each other how gorgeous each other is. Fortunately, Kathleen Woodiwiss creates interesting characters and a setting that sweeps you away to another time and place and that is wonderful; it's what I love about her books. I just wish sometimes she would pick up the pace a bit. Also, Aislinn is a delightful heroine, but to we have to hear CONSTANTLY how beautiful she is? We get it, Kathleen: Aislinn is GORGEOUS, thanks!I can never say anything too negative how KW's books however. I almost cried when it was over...maybe it was because at 500+ pages I never thought I would finish it.

Then the \\"Elusive Flame\\" - 4 and 1/2 stars, followed by the \\"Wolf and the Dove\\" Great book. Ms Woodiwiss writes in great depth and breadth - beautifully developing her characters. Also, the books have a satisfying length packed with fascinating writing, rather than a flimsy premise stretched to a thinly contrived, and eventually boring, missive. I just finished \\"Shanna\\". Loved it. It gets at least 5 stars. Now, am starting \\"A Season Beyond a Kiss\\". Wish there was more to choose from, but when a writer starts putting out quantity, the quality is either very uneven (Betina Krauhn, Elizabeth Lowell), or is missing altogether.

I made it halfway through the book and refused to continue reading it. I have never not finished reading a romance novel even if it was a poorly written one. But this was a book of CONSTANT rape. There is no way at all a woman could eventually fall in love with her rapist or ever enjoy it. What reader would enjoy reading a book about a young woman being raped every night?? Who would want her to fall for the guy? HORRIBLE \\"romance\\" novel!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly mislead","review":"How is this one of the best romances?I'm so disappointed by the positive reviews of this supposed romance classic. SPOILER ALERT. Ok, some books began with rape and murder, however when the hero shows up shouldn't that stop? Instead he all but promises to be the next man to have her with the knowledge that she's been raped the night before. I find it unbelievable and was completely disgusted by the heroine having stirrings of lust after her father's funeral, and let's not forget having been brutalized the night before. Generally these reviews have helped me pick out some really good books, but from now on I will be extremely careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf and The Dove","review":"As an avid reader, I consider myself a connoisseur of romance novels. This was my first story by this author and I don't think that I will read another one. I found the plot slow moving, long, dull and above all, not very romantic. I considered the hero a pompous ass and not very charming and the heroine quite meek and whiney. I grew very tired of her rambling on and on about being a slave and found myself not connecting with her at all. This book claimed to be a love story however there was literally no love in the plot at all. I would not recommend this story to anyone and it saddens me greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD SEX","review":"Although reading medieval dialect was strenuous, the relationship of Aisliin and Wulgar is pretty sexy. This one can really fulfill vicariously any fantasies of violent sex. TRULY RACY. However, I must say Woodwiss has a weakness for 1-dimensional characters. To evoke sympathy for the leading man Wulfgar, she gave him a background as an unloved illegitimate child. So when Aislinn makes a comment, he goes into an All-I-wanted-was-love-from-my-mother and aw! You feel sorry for the guy. Except me, I was laughing; I beg pardon from those who said aw! I must say I skimmed quickly over the secondary plot which was something about the Saxons and the Normans crap. Instead, I focused more on the sex scenes, which were done pretty well. Other rather awkward aspect is how Aislinn is constantly compared to a passive dove and Wulfgar is the dangerously, aggressively sexual wolf. I thought the animal similes were repeated too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect historical romance, a treasure to take you away!","review":"This book captivated me, held me spellbound, I fully enjoyed every minute of it.

I saw number of five star reviews and it got me all excited. However, I was sorely disappointed. I couldn't really bring myself to fall for the hero. I saw that he had a bad childhood, but I couldn't get over how insensitive he was. I also could not fathom how the heroine could fall so easily for him after everything her and her parents were put through. I was kind of disgusted with the heroine more than anyone else. I think I am actually being generous with my two star rating, but there were a few good parts. I also hated how the mother didn't reveal the secret sooner, but what do you expect when your daughter is OK with you being cast out of your own house after they kill her hubby! This was just not what I would call a great love story. It was terrible. I do not recommend!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her others","review":"I've been re-reading some of this author's books after 20 or so years. Shanna and A Rose in Winter still stand up. The Wolf and the Dove does not. Keeping in mind things were violent in the time period this was set, I do not consider this romantic whatsoever.I agree with previous critics who state they couldn't believe how quickly Aislinn adjusted to the takeover of her home. On the one hand, it was refreshing to read a romance where the hero and heroine aren't always scratching their eyes out on the way to love, but this was awful. Wulfgar got his jollies spanking her? Yuck. I didn't care about these characters at all by the end.As far as the writing style, she is too long winded with detail. Even the books I love by her I have to do some skimming. She should shorten her books by 100 pages so the story itself really shines."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I bought this book based on reviews, however I can't suuport the majority opinion.

But it is indeed one of my favourites. Kathleen has written some other books which i like.....like A rose in winter. And i find her books a very satisfying read whatever fault people may say. Compared with many other new books in the current romance market, at least her book has the touch of a professional and will satisfy you till the last. I reread it twice. It was good.As concerned with Wulfger, i will have to say that his character is one which draws you in, sarcastic, experating, yet totally enchanting. He will draw you as one who has strength and character.The heroine: her strength and faith in love and her determination is one which provides a very deep contrast in the story as compared with the male lead. This gives a very provoking interacting between the two.Try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word....YUCK!!!!!!!","review":"Let me just say right now that THIS REVIEW ONLY REFERS TO THE \\"ROMANCE ALIVE\\" AUDIO VERSION!!!

I consider it one of my all-time favorites.Unfortunately, the good people at Romance Alive saw fit to destroy it. They took something beautiful and mutilated it, leaving out entire characters and scenes that I consider VERY important to the story...all in the name of squeezing it onto a single cassette tape.My advice to anyone even remotely interested in purchasing this version: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!

Was it that the game was so linear that I couldn't have gotten lost if i tried?Maybe it was all of the above."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it wasn't so short","review":"i really enjoyed the game itself plot and all but the chapters were so very short i feel they could of taken this farther then what they did. good thing i payed only 4.99 for it if i had payed more i would be very upset. it took me maybe five hours to beat.nikki"},{"rating":"2","title":"Renaissance of Myst-type games on the DS","review":"This game is too short, which is a pity, considering it's very well-done. The developers make clever use of the DS's unique capabilities. I recommend this game to the intellectual gamer with a long attention span"},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable experience!","review":"This a fantastic game. It's only downfall is that it isn't very long (I finished the game in under 7 hours of game play). But the story is engaging with wonderful characters, and the graphics are a work of art! Nintendo has once again made use of the DS features magnificently. It's like a good book, it's a game you will definitely want to enjoy more than once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Fun","review":"I just finished Trace Memory. The story line is interesting and the gameplay and clue solving was fun. It was fairly easy, but I think the point wasn't to be hard, but to provide and interesting story. There were times that it was a bit \\"wordy\\" and gave you info that you didn't really need to advance the plot, but for the most part it was interesting to read the story. I think it's worth the money (would be even better if it were longer) and that if you like reading a story and playing along you'll enjoy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of Myst or Nancy Drew, you'll like this puzzle game","review":"This is a fun, but short game for the nintendo ds. The story follows a 13 year old girl as she arrives at an island with a haunted mansion...on a quest to find her long lost father. The game itself is more like a movie at times....so there's lots of reading. You also look for items and try to solve various puzzles around the mansion. The puzzles themselves are not very difficult. You do have to use your ds in very unique ways at times. There is also no way to 'die' in the game, which I liked! There are two endings, to my knowledge. You can also play the game through a second time to find slight differences...however, the replayability of the game in general is not good. You can't breeze through all the talking. This would be a good game to rent for a week, since I bought and finished it in 3 days (which I am never ever able to do with games). However, definitely play it. It's unique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wait to see what's next! Wait...It's over?","review":"The title of this review sums up my feelings on Trace Memory.It had a great, interesting, engaging story that didn't last.It's as if your favorite soap opera only has 3 episodes.The puzzles were interesting, but sometimes you've figured out the puzzle before the character in the game has and it makes you want to scream as your would at the television.I'd be surprised if you get stuck, but if you do, it won't be for long.The clock that keeps track of playing time in the game clocked me in at 3:29 (three hours and twenty-nine minutes) (yes, you read the parenthesis correctly).Thank God I paid 11 bucks for it. It's definitely not worth the full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethical Tool-Kit","review":"This book is an easy-to-understand introduction to ethical reasoning. I say \\"ethical reasoning\\" rather than \\"ethical philosophy\\" because the author doesn't survey the great ethical philosophers or go book-by-book through the ethics canon. Instead, he outlines competing approaches to ethics (such as intuitionism and emotivism), and subjects them to critical analysis. He ends up defending a Kantian \\"Golden Rule\\" approach that enables us to reason consistently about ethical problems, even though it offers no conclusions about the ultimate source of ethics.Although the book handles no issue in depth, it does zero in on most of the main issues in contemporary analytic ethics. It provides the reader with the basic tools for thinking rationally about ethical dilemmas. For beginners, that's more helpful than the exegesis of Great Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE ADVERTISING","review":"This FITS the Conair Opticlean electronic brush but the packaging states RBG3X & that's what it is compatible to!

If and when I can find replacement brushes I will write an updated review on the brush itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dross","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. The beginning generated enough interest for me to finish the book mainly by inertia. The author fumbles almost every opportunity at character development and fails to capitalize on the story's set up (cyborg/bionic man), hackneyed as it is. All of this might be bearable if the ending provided even the slightest shred of satisfaction. Instead, it's as if the author reached some magic word-count. The book just ends. It's an intensely dissatisfying close to a generally mediocre book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Idea that never goes anywhere","review":"First few chapters seemed good, so i read to the end. But the author clearly had no idea where to go with the story. It ends SO abruptly, without resolving anything.There are some interesting ideas and some interesting scenes. In fact certain chapters would probably function better as stand alone short stories, than as part of a larger whole. I still remember his description of one chapter filled with shifting points of view, when the story is told from the perspective of various forest animals that are all killing each other that I found fascinating at the time. But scenes like that don't fit coherently together, they are just a bunch of random images jumbled together. As a novel, it just never comes together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information regarding this book.","review":"The purpose isn't really to review this book, but to give people some information about it.For one, this isn't a complete collection of Reimarus' writings on religion. This book only contains \\"On the Resurrection Narratives\\" and \\"On the Intentions of Jesus and His Disciples\\", two of the seven Wolffenbüttel fragments originally published by Lessing. The material is slightly rearranged, to be read as Reimarus intended them to be. The English translation of these two fragments comes from two sources, Charles Voysey and Dr. Fraser.While the majority of this book consists of Reimarus' writings, it also contains a lengthy introduction and an essay by David F. Strauss on Reimarus.To the best of my knowledge, this is as good as it gets as far as reading Reimarus in English goes. If you can read German however, I'm sure there is probably something better out there. For the rest of us, we will have to make due till something better comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bestop product I have purchased.","review":"I bought these Bestop Jeep Wrangler TJ door entry guards due to the high quality of other Bestop products I have purchased. The fit of these was horrible, so I returned them. I would NOT recommend them to anyone. Instead, I purchased some 3M Gray \\"Safety Walk Indoor/Outdoor Tread\\" traction tape. The 3M product number is 7647NA. This is not the sandpaper type stuff. It is more of a molded vinyl textured tape with a super strong all weather adhesive. This works perfectly and looks so much better. Just cut to fit and carefully apply. The gray color looks great on my silver Jeep. I think it is probably available in black as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this for my 05 Jeep hopeing to improve the looks of the door sill.

The Low Fs and high Qts are perfect for IB mounting, I bet they would work great for home theater infinite baffle subs too. Sure you could get something like an AE or Fi IB sub and get more out of it, but with a pair I was not worried about output I just wanted to get low. I had a 4x75 on highs and they have more output than I can use by far on 500rms, and I doubt I am using all that amp either going to try a smaller amp. At around 95 to my door, these are a no-brainer for the right use. Be careful if you want to put them in a box, you might want to use the other style of sub they make with a lower Qts for smaller boxes. These will not have as much bass in a box unless it is quite large like a trunk or more, maybe 4cf per 15\\" or over what Vas is. I have around 15cf for the pair. They come on at 23Hz and by 25Hz they are near flat on up.

However, Conjure One, despite all the glowing recommendations, left me cold. I've given it several listens, and it never seems to catch my ear. To me, it is terribly bland, like watered-down Delerium. So, I guess I'd recommend this to people who feel that Delerium's a little too rough for them, and go back to listening to my old Will CDs (yes, another FLA side project)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album with a few five-star standouts.","review":"As a big fan of Delerium's latest album, \\"Poem,\\" I was eager to grab this CD by one half of the Delerium duo. It's a fine album, with four tracks worthy of a five-star rating: \\"Center of the Sun,\\" \\"Manic Star,\\" \\"Make A Wish\\" and \\"Sleep.\\" Most of the other tracks are instrumentals or feature indistinct chants, and these tracks are generally nice to listen to but ultimately forgettable.

VAS for instance. Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn. Tiesto. Paul Van Dyke, and the abolsute pinacle -- Underworld. Conjure one has one fantastic song on the Gate Crasher compliation, but the rest is all very very cliche. If you like mindless uncreative garbadge this is the band for you. I love techno / ambient / tribal / rave etc. and have spent many years traveling the world going to all the greatest dance fests, but this band is a waste. Once you get further into the genre, you will be embarassed you ever bought this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was drowning in a sea of blandness","review":"I am amazed at the praise being given to this cd in these reviews.I heard nothing that stood out as being particularly interesting or inspired.The fact that it took 3 years to make really makes one wonder what ...took so long.Having the guy from the Tea Party sing on the disc takes the cake for sell-out cheese.Extreme overuse of female chants over sweeping pads.I thought it would never end.Strictly for the light-in-the-[...] Enigma/Delerium crowd....- Conjure one will leave you feeling as though you are drowning in a sea of blandness....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ersatz Indian electronica","review":"Right off the bat there are problems. The first track 'Demascus' sung by Chemda. Chemda is NOT from India. She's an Israeli. It's like listening to Sheryl Crow sing Chinese. She does her best but Indian music should be sung by Indians. All of the tracks are derivative; all have oddly familiar melodies. Like....he ripped them off! He adds middle eastern sounds to most of the tracks which I guess the Amazon.com reviewer feels are \\"spooky\\". There is far superior Indian electronica out there. Listen to 'Mondo India' if you want to listen to superior Indian/Pakistani electronica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought originally to hear POE","review":"I originally bought this CD for the POE songs but I kept listening and most all of the songs are great. Of course the POE songs stand out but the other songs weave together nicely. The other songs on the album have a rather Dead Can Dance feel. Overall this album is very laid back and fits nicely into ultrachill categories. Good intro to this band. Don't forget sales of this album help POE in one way or another. I can't wait until all that contract mess is behind her. On her website you can get the whole story and show her some love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystical, magical, amazing","review":"All I can say is that I love this album!

I've been a fan of Rhys Fulber, mostly through his Delerium work and some other projects. I guess I should have known better then to expect the deeper and darker textures and rhythms I have come to love in his work. Unforunetly, with this album, Rhys Fulber seems to be playing in the realm of pop somewhat. Don't get me wrong, this album is quite good...it's just moving in a direction that I'm not sure I want to follow...though it is growing on me. I was mostly disapointed with Sinead O'Connor's track: Tears From the Moon.

If you push the lid down hard to ensure it is latched and safe from the kids then you wont be able to get into it quickly.

You will be riveted in your chair as you single-handedly account for one-tenth of the casualties at Gettysburg, and 11 other venues. Why I expected anything more than what this game is, that being a civil war version of Medal of Honor, is beyond me.

Oh everything needed to make it \\"work\\" is there, but none of it seems to have been tested and fine-tuned.All I'll say about the graphics is that they're fair but not up to par for a next-gen system.Your allies are dumber than dirt. It's not uncommon for them to be completely wiped out seconds after joining you. Fortunately your enemies aren't much smarter; but there are a lot more of them.The really glaring flaw that should have been caught and fixed in testing is the collision detection.

I then contacted Tachikara directly, and they told me that they knew that the bags were defective, and would not get the right size till they sold all the defective ones! They then told me that the bag was only oversized by about one inch on each side. Considering that a volleyball is only 8 inches in diameter, and the bag has four sides, that means that the bag is 1 1/2 times the size of a volleyball (explaining why I was able to fit so much inside of it). Even when I put 6 full size basket balls in it, it did not hold its tube form.

I would look over them and think, \\"I wish Sir Conan Doyle was still alive, I would write to him just to hear from him what happened in the case of..\\". Thankfully now a lot of the cases I had wondered about now have answers. I really enjoyed reading this book and will read it many times more over a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"I found this volume in the library, and eagerly started reading. I'm a Holmes fan, and while nothing touches the originals, I have read some good Holmes stories by writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle. The fact that his son was writing or co-writing some of them made me think that these stories would capture much of the flavor and wit of the originals, but alas, this is not the case. First of all, the stories often feel like parodies of the originals, rather than trying to intertwine with them. Secondly, Arthur Conan Doyle always gave you all the information (as Holmes would say to Watson, we would see exactly what he saw, we just couldn't necessarily deduce anything) needed to solve the case. In these stories, I found that there were hidden bits of information that would just sort of pop out at you at times.

The characters are very close to the original, and that is something to appreciate. None of the authors try to do anything to prove themselves better than the master. I agree with other reviewers.

After all, it makes an intriguing title. I would have called it A Night at Mannions or just for us Westerners The Cowboy and the Dreamer and included more of that high caliber story instead of the blah-blah that says sweet nothings, literally.

Dont get me wrong the animals are VERY cute. I dont even mind that its a wind up mobile like a lot of reviewers do. It entertains my son and just to see his face light up and smile makes it worth it. However, I do find that the plastic arm thats supposed to hold it is very flimsy and mine broke upon putting it together. It never even made it to the crib! I had to buy a replacement arm and it took about another week for that to arrive. The replacement arm was similar to the previous one but this one seemed heavier and stronger so my goof up in getting a similar replacement part turned out to be a good thing in the long run. I hope my situation was an isolated incident.

Also, I hadn't realized before what the \\"Inside Passage\\" is, so I was disappointed there was no information on the rest of Alaska. It's well worth watching, as long as you realize it is only about that one geographical area.

Noone thinks or does anything on Broward's Rock without Annie commenting to herself that the thought or action was just like this or that fictional mystery character. While I enjoy the bit with the contest that has the characters guessing their fictional origin, this constant \\"showing off\\" of the author's mystery fiction knowledge detracts from the story.

In the first few pages Ms. Hart introduces 17 characters. I was cheerfully going along with it however, until our author had the characters quoting lines from other authors books. Suddenly we had to read more characters names and the titles of the books, and author names. All of the authors quoted were unknown to me. I couldn't keep track of the story line, and I didn't bond with the characters. So even though this author has written alot of books ( a dream come true for us readers) after trying two other books by this author I give up, I just can't read her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another light-hearted mystery!","review":"Annie and Max Darling are two of the most appealing modern-day sleuths out there, and the setting in Broward's Rock can't be beat.

This book is set around the annual White Elephant's Sale held by the Women's club. It always sounds like such fun on Broward's Rock! Annie and Max are again on the heels of a cool, caclutating murderer, but the book introduces some other unsavoury topics such as blackmail, mercy killing, extra-marital affairs and robbery.

Two years ago, after my wife came home from a graduate-level class, she told me we needed to watch Katz's documentary, Tough Guise (MEF). The documentary revolutionized the way I veiwed masculinity both in myself and in our culture. I then found Katz's book. The Macho Paradox does the exact same thing: Katz includes an amazing array of statistics as well as references to a variety of studies and cultural icons in order to prove his case--that masculinity needs a serious overhaul in our contemporary culture. No longer can we allow women to be abused in such rampant fashion. Katz explodes the myth that men are simply \\"born\\" with a bent towards aggression and violence; rather, he questions and explores what in our culture teaches men to behave the way we do.

I spent over 80 bucks for this thing less than a year ago and now KitchenAid won't sell the filters for it. I've looked all over and can't find them and KitchenAid won't give any guidance.

It happens about 50% of the time. No rhyme or reason to it. The first one we had eventually stopped working (some error code)...the KitchenAid people nicely sent me a replacement (very nice customer service, especially since we received it as a gift, without any kind of receipt.)

I gave it a few chances thinking it was user error (not putting carafe in properly), but after so many chances and floods, I gave up. This is a serious design flaw and if it hasn't happened yet, it will soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planned obsolescence","review":"The person who says the other reviewers are dummies must not have had his coffee maker very long.

I bought this one and have been happy ever since. I get an excellent cup of coffee and haven't had the spillage that others have commented on. I don't fill the coffee maker from the back, I actually fill it from the front(using the reservoir) and use the coffee pot itself to do so(there are lines on the pot to follow for this). I do wipe it down every night (on the top-where the water is put) to get rid of the condensation and any gunk that might collect where the grounds go. Maybe that might help with the spilling?The only negative I can think of is that the hinged lid on the pot is not so easy to remove and gives me the feeling that in the future might need to be replaced.Other than that...it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold in the reservoir!!!!!!","review":"I have had this coffeemaker for a little over a year now and just yesterday I happened to notice the whole reservoir was growing a nice layer of MOLD all over everything!!!!!! I yanked out that filter thingy, which is covered with brown slime, and turned the whole coffeemaker upside down. I hesitate to use a bleach/water mixture to clean it for fear my coffee will taste like bleach! I'm considering throwing this coffeemaker away and buying a whole new one. I wish there was a way to remove the reservoir in order to clean it thoroughly. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN DRINKING MOLDY COFFEE ALL THIS TIME!!! WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THAT MOLD HAS BEEN IN THERE!!!!

Kitchenaid...please re-attach the cord and send me the fire hazard back!! This coffeemaker is attractive, but looks aren't everything. Each time we have made a full pot, the coffee grinds have overflowed into the carafe, even though we use Bunn oversize filters. We have had to resort to brewing less than the maximum amount. Sigh. The water does not reach proper brewing temperature and the coffee is weak. I guess in this case, I got what I paid for. Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aesthetically pleasing, but has a major flaw","review":"This coffee maker looks nice on a countertop, and makes great coffee. However, a there is a significant flaw in the design of this machine. If the coffee pot is not precisely positioned during brewing, the basket doesn't drain into the pot, but rather overflows into the area behind and under the pot, and finally onto the counter. I've learned to compensate for this, but a person shouldn't have to make such an effort with an $80 coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've given up and taken the $50.00 buyback","review":"Like many others, I received this coffee maker as a replacement for the recalled model. The first one frequently leaked coffee all over my counter top. I called KitchenAid. They apologized and sent me a new one -- the same model, Well, the third time I used it coffee grounds were everywhere: in the pot throughout the machine on the counter. To make matters worse, the grounds blocked the opening on the carafe and less than 1/4 cup of coffee made it into the glass carafe! The other 9 and 3/4 was all over the macine and counter top. What a mess! I ended up at Starbucks that morning. I called KitchenAid later that day and settled for the $50.00 buyback. I just bought a new Krups thermal and so far, so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overflows Consistently","review":"I bought this coffee maker to match my KitchenAid blender and coffee gridner. The coffee maker is attractive but works terribly. If you make more than 1 or 2 cups it overflows hot coffee onto the counter top. There is almost always grounds in the coffee too. When I called KitchenAid customer service they said they made a revision to fix the problems and sent me another one. It has the same problems. This is NOT user error I have tried different coffees, grinds, and positioning the carafe differently. This coffee maker is just a distrastrous design mistake. Finally I got KitchenAid to buy the coffee maker back and got a Cuisinart one. It works perfectly, costs less, and has more features. I would recommend Cuisinart and highly recommend that you do not buy this shoddy coffee maker - you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Error Message Right Out Of The Box","review":"Received error message the first time it was pluged in.

If you don't rest the coffee maker on the burner just right, the coffee that drips during the brewing dprocess does not all land in the carafe! I've had several messes to clean up.

I was told that there were not other complaints. I didn't have the overflow of water problem but the coffee was not hot enough, the design was rediculous with the water chamber in the rear and the measure stick which you could not see. You would have to use the pot to pour the water in and there was residue left in the pot. Also, the condensation was enough to make a cup of coffee.

But the biggest flaw is trying to seat the coffee pot into the lip to catch the drip. It wasn't uncommon for the pot to unseat itself, 1/2 cup into brewing, and just stop.

It is clear that after reading some of the negative reviews some people don't do this. I do agree with the reviewer that mentions if you have granite counter tops the carafe can slide away from the machine inadvertently shutting off the brew process, but I have found this easily remedied by applying a grip to the bottom of the carafe.

Cleaning is the biggest problem. I don't have a problem of coffee dripping down the front, but steam coming from the pot during the brewing process causes it to collect and drip down the front of the maker. If you don't remove it when the brewing cycle is complete, steam continues to condense and drip. The steam also forms on the lid of the brewer. When you open the top, it runs to the back of the lid and drips down the back of the brewer. Another contribution to water under the base. Cleaning the pot is also a pain.Bottom line: I'd rather have a good drip maker and a good stainless carafe.

This book is for anyone teen or adult!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a lovely creature","review":"pike's Last Vampire series is the best. i read the first one six years ago at the age of 12. now i am 18 and still in love with sita!! she is the most amazing character ever written. she truly loves the human race...which i respect b/c she is not one of us! (i do know she is not real;) these books taught me a lot about life, love, and acceptence...about being diff, and that even the strongest need time to love themselves...i recommend these books!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weaves a magical web","review":"I could not put this series down. All 6 books were my favorites, I cannot choose between them! Sita is the most amazing character I have ever read about! I love how many of Pike's characters are strong females, and Sita is no different! As you read the stories you can see the settings because Pike described them so wonderfully and you can see yourself next to Sita. The series got better and better instead of really good and then failing at the end which is a vast improvement over so many of the other series I read. Anyone who like Pike or likes vampire books should read this. You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOKS BY THE BEST AUTHOR!","review":"These books make up the best series ever written. You can't read one without having to go out and buy the rest. I know, cause I tried. They are written so perfectly, it actually sounds as if it's Sita telling the story. They're about a girl named Sita, who is a 5000 year-old vampire, and all the problems she encounters and has to overcome. I was swept away by these books. They are certainly the best books on the subject of vampires ever written.I recommend them to everyone, no exceptions. Even if you don't like vampire books, you should definetely give these a try. Take my word for it- you'll love this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know everyone says that they liked it...","review":"But they're absolutely right!! Sita is the best, this book totally relates to what the world is like. And don't forget ...there's still another collectors edition ahead, Sita is like the ideal girl, pretty, smart and strong in body and soul!! It's like the best book i've read! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book brought Sita to life","review":"I knew Sita. I was Sita. After reading this series (vol 1 and 2) I felt that Pike was born to write about Sita and still wonder if he has stories stored away in his drawers about Sita. I loved Sita and miss her dearly. I have read these books over and over again; time and time again. I'm 25 now and have moved on to some of Pike's adult novels, but this one still brings me back, and I hear Sita's voice speaking directly to me from whereever she is. Thank you Pike, for this series and also for \\"Remember me\\" and \\"The Starlight Crystal\\". You have inspired me."},{"rating":"2","title":"the vampires !!","review":"this book was so great that i never liked to read until i fould this book.Sita is the best and i dont expect that when your boyfriend dies you wont cry.That part did made me cry i have to say lol.So when you read this book i hope you will injoy it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a Karaoke collection, it's a Sing Along DVD","review":"I'm a Huge Westlife Fan, and I bought this DVD so I can sing my favorite songs but It's not a Karaoke Collection, It just has the videos and the lyrics.

A few years back, my friend would always come over and bring all her Westlife karaoke VCDs to sing at my house. Good times.

It presents understandings of how to cultivate chi and make it work for you. The diagrams are simple and as easy to understand as presentation of this material allows.Pyramid Michael has been a tai chi instructor since 1985, student of tai chi chuan since 1981, and student of the \\"life force\\" since 1972."},{"rating":"2","title":"The inner structure of tai chi","review":"Well written and illustrated.

I bought it about four years ago for one cut - \\"Life is War\\" - after accidently hearing it on a college station while driving through Maryland. I had no idea she was a \\"Christian musician\\". Frankly, I find most \\"Christian music\\" insipid, monotonous, and sickeningly sweet. This record is nothing of the sort. This woman has soul. This woman has been through hell.I have since bought Big Town and You Are There simply because she is a marvelously gifted singer. Her rendition on YAT of Give Me Shelter is as good as any I've heard, including the Stones. Check it out on Youtube. Kenny Greenberg ain't a bad guitar player, either.Apparently she plays mostly in churches. If she plays anywhere within a two hour drive of me here in eastern Pa., I will be there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated!","review":"I don't know if I received the wrong version from the seller or what but this is a 2nd edition copy rather than 7th.

The pieces all fit together perfectly, and the detail in the print is amazing. The only problem is that I bit off more than I could chew with this. I worked on this for 4 weeks and ended up getting tired of it. This is a huge puzzle, and takes up too much space. I tried one of the puzzle savers so that I could roll this up, but it ended up making a mess. If you have a huge table that you could leave this on while you work you may have more luck. I will definitely buy another Ravensburger puzzle, but it will not be 3000 pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good puzzle","review":"This was a fun puzzle to work on, with some very difficult parts. If you enjoy a challenging puzzle, this one is worth a try. It took me about one week and one day, mostly evenings, to put this together."},{"rating":"2","title":"puzzle lover","review":"We did this puzzle in about 6 months. The whole family took turns participating. It was extremely difficult but alot of quality family time was spent together. My 5 year old who found many peices cried when we finished it. I glued it to a huge peice of cardboard, my husband made a frame for it and it will be hung in my kitchen to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The Ravensburger World Map 3000 piece puzzle is everything it is advertised to be.

So far I like this unit. The features it has such as an indicator of the lenght of time the coffee has been brewed as well as indicator to clean it are nice. What is even nicer is how the unit comes with about 12 paper filters as well as a permanent gold filter; where as Mr.Coffee you had to buy it.I'm pleased with this product so far and of course I will give an update on it should anything go wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee maker EVER","review":"This is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned.

At first I thought it had some buildup since it sees a lot of use, nope no rhyme or reason will just dump a load of coffee onto the counter top if you're not watching it. Amazon should have negative star for products this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"Like other reviews, I've had problems with this coffee maker spilling coffee all over the counter. The problem seems to be the level in the back of the unit that is supposed to tell if the carafe is in place (so you can remove it while brewing). The problem is that if the carafe isn't positioned perfectly then the drip will be blocked and coffee will eventually overflow.It seemed to work for me OK for a while but now it seems to always overflow.Bad design; stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is my second Kitchenaid coffeemaker, the first one was replaced with this one due to faulty electrical. (Yes, sounds scary) This consistently brews coffee all over our counter, the cleaning light is on all the time,and it does not brew a hot cup of coffee. Upside to this, is I like the signal beep when it is done and the clock showing how long the coffee has been sitting for (30, 60 90 min ) Overall, I expected a 100.00 dollar coffeemaker to last more than 8 months. I bought a Cuisinart to replace this after reading the good reviews on that. Stick with mixers KitchenAid, your coffeemakers leave a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"This makes great coffee but can be very messy. The water resevoir and the coffee grounds are placed under the same lid. If by chance you put a little too much water in or a too many grounds, the grounds end up in the water resevoir and it is hard to clean. I like my grounds and the water in their own seperate compartments.This is my 4th KitchenAid coffeemaker in 3 years. I have had other problems with this maker and it always seemed to break down on me under its warranty period.I'm very frustrated with this coffeemaker and am looking to purchase anything but a KitchenAid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent start~!","review":"I have gone through many books about riemannian geometry, only to find that most of them are playing magic in front of me. When it comes to curvature and variation of energy (arc length), most of the book are just playing around with the notations without drawing any geometric insight. When defining Levi-Civita connections, many books simply list out 4 meaningless formulae. I was so happy to read this book since it explains everything in riemannian geometry in a clear and concise way. Theoretical facts and geometrical interpretations are both having their place in this book.Only one thing to notice: This book is a basic elementary introductory text in riemannian geometry. Those who want to know more should consult other book. Yet, as a first book in riemannian geometry, this book is undoubtedly the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it job.","review":"I bought these to Dress up my DDR2 Memory.

I found it elsewhere for $4.99 but I'd already used the one I bought on Amazon.If you really care about getting that nice electric toothbrush feel, this isn't the toothbrush for you.

The sponge is nice size in the picture it looks quite small but is not.Also I purchased the double because its the same exact thing as the single one but comes with 2 sponges and a T fitting.

Thankfully the seller refunded the purchase price of the filters.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely unaffected","review":"It may be that you've got to be at least 50 years old to appreciate this book fully. Why? Because Cousy reflects on a game that doesn't exist anymore. It was a time when people did not take three steps to the basket, when palming the ball was a turnover, and when good sportsmanship was the standard. It was also a time, and this is what is so hard to believe, when a guy like Cousy, who came along just in time to save the financially failing NBA, worried each and every year about making the team. It was a time when a hard nosed Red Auerbach, who didn't even want Cousy because he thought him a showoff, coupled Cousy's playmaking with Russell's defense to make a team, the only team in fact, that dominated its sport as the Yankees did in baseball. Cousy was Auerbach's first big hitter, and despite his success as a player, coach and university president, Cousy remains humble, reflective, and self effacing. Cousy is a we guy, not an I guy. Refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best art book of the year","review":"Robert Tavernor's On Alberti and the Art of Building is a book for which every student of Renaissance history in my young day would have sold his soul, for it presents this seminal theorist as an architect of rich intelligence and aesthetic sensibility, his excitement irresistibly infectious. With Tavernor's help we see through the alterations, false completions and unfinish of the buildings and comprehend Alberti's original intentions; reconstructions, models and photographs of astonishing documentary clarity support the exhilarating text. This book will no doubt pass unnoticed except by those few art historians whose imaginations were touched by Alberti when they first discovered him in Florence, Mantua and Rimini, and stood in awe of flawed perfection, but this monograph is, for me, the best art book of the year. Brian Sewell, Art Critic, London Evening Standard, 11 December 1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive, learned book","review":"Alberti's buildings were mostly left incomplete, altered, or unfinished by others, his original intentions often impenetrable.

They were rude and demeaning saying that of course there would be 4 risers because it doesn't make sense to only buy one. Well, I only got one and it didn't even fit the dimension that it said it would. When I went to return it I got hit with a lot of fees and on top of that they said that I did not return the package.

The Bosch 97106 has a metal impellar, which should last until the next timing belt, if not longer, and at a good discount off the german equivalent.Fit was spot on. The gasket was fine.Finish was adequate. There was some extra casting flash on the outside (nothing that effected the sealing/mating surface).I would recommend this product for any E30 with the M20 engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst O'Reilly book I have.","review":"O'Reilly generally distributes well written, easy to understand books. This is not one of them. The author seems to go to great lengths to make the implementation of RPC's hard to understand. For example, he never seems to plainly describe the sequence of events required to register a server and a client. Instead he requires the user to rely on the rpcgen utility which is OK if you have a simple requirement. However, most people who use RPC's use them because their requirements are NOT simple. Further, if the reader wants to learn more about the RPC procedure he/she must filter out Mr. Bloomers' convoluted 'C' code. In his very first example (downloaded from the O'Reilly web site), Mr. Bloomer forces the reader to muddle through code like: \\"char *result; char *(*local)(); local = (char *(*)()) add_record; result = (*local)(&argument, rqstp); \\" without any explanation of what he is trying to accomplish. I wish I could get my money back from O'Reilly on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and in need of Update","review":"I feel that this book needs to be updated. It makes so many statements that even a newbie such as I can tell are outdated, that the entire content of the book is cast into doubt. How can I tell whether or not I should believe any given sentence? I find myself in the position of needing to independently verify almost every statement, and who has time for that? I came here hoping for a newer edition that I could feel more confident about, and am very disappointed not to find one. Judging from other references (e.g. the Solaris 8 \\"ONC+ Reference Manual,\\" at docs.sun.com -- on the topic of using RPC with threads, for example), the technology has changed over the last 12 years, to the point where I for one don't trust this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book for RPC beginners","review":"The presentation is very informal and brief.

It is simply amazing if you can study it and understand that it goes deeper than the words, way deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Sublime: American Glory","review":"The Hudson River painters were the first coherent school of American art to help shape the National view of the American landscape. The artists that came to maturity during Jackson's presidency defined the aesthetic of a nation who, until that moment, maintained its roots with courtly Europe. In American Sublime: Landscape Painting in the United States, 1820-1880, the reader journeys through this new art movement by moving through the landscape--feeling the optimism and awe which defined a nation's identity. The book's \\"catalogue\\" chapters will visually captivate the reader with framed, dramatic vistas brought to life by each represented artist's bold colors, sense of movement and atmospheric lighting. The major Hudson River painters are all well-represented here. The book is most certainly an invaluable reference to both the art historian as well as the painting practitioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't just look at the book: see the exhibition at PAFA","review":"This catalog of the exhibition presently at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts is an excellent guide to carry with you as you view the paintings -- particularly since the printed material on the wall adjacent to the paintings is printed in tiny type and posted way too low. The book is well organized, by theme, matching the layout of the show. There is excellent material on the artists and the events surrounding the paintings, and a some bibliography for each artist at the back (too bad many of the books are out of print). The reproductions are OK to good, but in NO WAY do they give you a sense of the actual paintings, which are awe-some, they way we used to mean it. If there's any any way you can possibly get to this exhibit, go. Then, if you wish, buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind Resource","review":"Religious Signing, by Elaine Costello, is a great resource, especially for those who are beginners in Church signing.

This 2007 production of the opera at St. Margarethen fulfils these requirements admirably. The amphitheatre provides a suitable setting, the period costumes are interesting and the mass movement is well conducted. The singing ranges from high quality to fair levels. Baritone Morosow in the title role supplants some lack of vocal power and timbre with superb acting but soprano Morigi as Abigaille is outstanding vocally and interpretively. There are few sopranos who may challenge this difficult Verdian role with the self-assurance which Gabriella Morigi shows. I like both bass Yang and tenor Ribeiro's engaging timbres and I am very impressed by the sure and well developed voice of mezzosoprano Kulman as Fenena. The DVD is beautifully filmed in colour, the sound is excellent, the sync perfect and the accompanying booknote informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST hummingbird feeder","review":"This is the best hummingbird feeder ever.

Paid retail. The singing is terrible, she has some voice inflections that dont fit the music, similar to talking funny instead of singing. The music itself is ok. Song selection is poor, the same old iconic nuggets (good songs but nothing surprising or thinking outside the box) Would have love to hear some different stuff like Zero The Hero. You'll probably be surprised by my recomendation to buy it. Buy it used, and only if you are a completist Sabbath fan. Otherwise, give it a pass.

Where did she get her PH.D from a Cracker Jack box? Her book is page after page of stereotypical cliches! I CAN NOT believe that made a comment about Tommy Hilfiger appearing on Oprah saying that he didn't want black people wearing his clothes. If that isn't the oldest urban legend. Come on! Was there no fact checking involved in this process? Then she says that black women need to learn to embrace themselves as God made them and then turns around and says if you don't like your hair alter it!What a waste of money!

Thereby, making you into a beautiful person. The last chapter on prayer and looking for guidance from the Almighty was very good. I am a bit surprised that no one has written a review of this book. I only hope that this will encourage you to purchase or borrow it from the library.

Year after year, the number of mergers and acquisitions climbed. Mergers between large companies make headlines, but companies of any size may find it beneficial to engage in mergers and acquisitions. Author H. Lee Rust explains the basics of acquisitions in clear, simple prose for companies that are too small to make the evening news. His book will be most useful to small- and medium-sized firms whose leaders lack experience in acquisitions. He provides sound, practical advice, easy-to-use checklists, and a CD-ROM workbook with spreadsheets, calculations, sample letters and more. If you manage a small company, we suggest reading this book before you get involved in your first acquisition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Small Companies - Learn More - Read This","review":"Acquistions are not only for large public corporations. But, if you are a smaller private company, where do you start? This book explains the entire acquisition procedure from how to locate the right acquistion, negotiating a price, to structuring and closing the deal and every step in-between. If you WANT TO LEARN EVEN MORE about Mr. Rust's approach to expanding your business through acquistions and you live in Florida, plan to attend an upcoming seminar in your area. Seminars are being held in Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, and Fort Lauderdale.

They both write very very good prose, and they both write about hunger other than the visceral. However, there are differences. At times, Fisher's writing seems exclusionary, and Thorne's never does.To clear up a point of potential confusion: \\"Matt\\" is a nickname for Martha. They are married. She acts as editor, and does add an occasional essay or aside. Her contributions make a good writer even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm finally bored with John Thorne","review":"I really enjoyed John Thorne's other books, but when I read this one I was bored. He has been publishing for a number of years, and you'd think he would grow and change, expand his awareness, try something new. Instead, I get the feeling his life is shrinking and that he is becoming a miserly, curmudgeonly northeastener who is living a narrow and deprived life out of choice rather than necessity. He moved from a small town to a bigger city, but he hasn't changed much, still the narrow anal focus on the details of simple recipes. Living with him must be mind-numbingly boring. I wonder if his wife ever wants to scream and run out of the house? So obviously my advice is, skip this one and reread one of the earlier ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM","review":"I bought this album because I was a dedicated Bill Hicks fan - THE COMEDIAN Bill Hicks. What I got just about killed me. This album is a combination between a squirrel being run over by a truck and a wounded pig who has just received a 10,000 volt electric shock. The only way I struggled note by whining note through this entire album was due to the fact that it cost me $12.99 plus postage and I was damned if I was going to waste the hard earned money I had saved in order to hear a Bill Hicks cd. So for the love of all things good, which this album is definitely not, DO NOT buy this album, instead buy Rant in E minor, Shock and Awe, Arizona Bay, Love, Laughter and Truth, Dangerous and Relentless and really appreciate the real Bill Hicks, not this pathetic excuse for music if it can indeed be called music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"I love this book.

I am not opposed to steamy sex scenes, but this was just the same description time after time. It actually became a little boring and I couldn't understand why our heroine was so impressed.

For example:\\"Could you hurry up with those Ramen noodles?\\"\\"Sorry I pushed past you to get on the Bullet Train.\\"\\"I believe I am the next to be allowed entry into the Royal Palace.\\"Essentially, I needed a phrasebook for busy people in busy situations.

It's pretty amazing how over the years Mongoose has transformed itself from selling top notch bikes to selling rather cheap bikes. The pegs on this bike are just a waste. They're extremely heavy and just get in the way. Also, the gyro on this bike is pretty useless because it prevents the bike from braking effectively. Actually, the brakes are pretty useless because of the gyro mechanism. This isn't a freestyle bike to get for those parts at all. Weight wise, this bike is heavier than my big beach cruiser...

Unlike books that aim to popularize math, the book does not pontificate a mystic view of the meaning of mathematics; rather, it gives a sober perspective of what has happened in mathematics and what can be expected of the field.The book requires somewhat serious mathematical thinking.A great strength of the book is the diverse mathematical concepts that it presents: homology groups, group theory, Turing machines, undecidability, Monte Carlo method. In a compact book, you learn a little about some important ideas in advanced mathematics.Important!!

The jokes are ok, and at times the hidden humor is quite good and even clever, but over-all I can only give this a one star.On a side note, my four year old made a tough connection with one particular scene.

I didn't remember the graphics being that bad and as this was the 2nd film, So therefore, I thought the graphics would be better of course. After reading a couple other review about the graphics being \\"unfininshed\\" I knew it was not my TV, My DVD player, or my eyes, my son said he could not tell anything was wrong (9 years old). I actually thouht I was \\"seeing things\\" the graphics were so \\"unfinished\\" and \\"rough\\" on this thing. On that aspect I was very dissappointed with this movie and found it very hard to ignore once I spotted it. I let it ruin the whole movie for me as I coulnd't shake it. The story was OK and I think my son still enjoyed it. But I really appreciate the artistry of CG movies like this one, so I was sorely disappointed. Hope this review helps.

However, where Shrek was hilarious, Happily N'Ever After doesn't. The story is irreverent but the plot and characters are pretty childish. The Snow White disco scene at the beginning was a bit too far. The princess act like a bunch of Paris Hilton wannabes. Moreover, the animation is pretty lousy compared to the standards of Shrek and Pixar. It looks like animation for a Saturday morning kid's show. Overall, not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS ELVIS STILL ALIVE?

It wasn't a one size fits all plan of letting your child cry for x number of minutes for x number of days a 'poof' your child is sleeping through the night. The book offered many suggestions to many of the common sleep problems. It took us about 6 weeks of trying various suggestions in her book but we finally moved out 3 year old out of our bed and have him sleeping through the night by himself most nights. We still have a few night wakings, but overall our experience is much more pleasant and we are all sleeping much better!!

He showed no sleepy signs due to being chronically overtired. He cried MORE often and for longer durations after implementing most/all of the books suggestions and got up even more during the night! This book is best for those who nurse and co-sleep, and are willing to be up nights for months on end. It obviously worked for many, but not me! I found that it made all my son's problems worse which were only cleared up after implementing the steps from \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.\\" My son is napping pretty regularly now after only a couple of weeks, and his disposition is markedly improving!

I was almost in tears every night it was so stressful. Everyone was telling us that we had to let them \\"cry it out\\", put a lock on their door or at least a gate. I felt there had to be another way but I was skeptical of a \\"no cry\\" solution. I read through some parts (I'll admit it, I was desperate for answers so I didn't read the whole thing) and came up with a plan. IT WORKED THE FIRST NIGHT!! Since then there have been nights where the boys have tested limits and have not gone to sleep right away but I'm not getting 1/2 as upset as I had been.

In one week I have already had some success with the ideas found in this book. Besides the ideas, one of the things I like best about Pantley books is that 1)she's been there and 2) she doesn't make you feel like you have messed up your kids by not forcing them to sleep through the night (using some neanderthal method) before they are a year old. It's not a three-day plan, but it's better for your kids AND it works! Isn't that what we are all looking for???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I thought this book was very helpful.

That is not what I am striving for in a bedtime ritual!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"I don't think it was really that different from her book pertaining to infants. Honestly, I didn't learn anything new. I already knew about having a consistent schedule and bedtime routine. However, it did make me feel better to realize I'm not the only one still struggling. My daughter is 2.5 years old and I'm still up 3-4 times a night with her. Not having sleep for this long is draining after a while. I'm still searching for that perfect solution...Great book for someone that hasn't looked into helping their child sleep before...but after this long I can't imagine that is the case.

I really enjoyed Eugenides' Middlesex, when I read it with my book group several years ago. I tried to read his latest novel, The Marriage Plot, this month, but found it impossible to follow or get close to the characters or plot underneath all the obscure literary reference and detail. The Virgin Suicides, his first novel, is completely different, in all aspects, indicating his skill and dexterity as a writer. Still, there is such a sense of remove from the characters, it is difficult, if not impossible, to connect with them or get fully-engaged in the story. While the events of the story, and the tragedy, is compelling, it is empty and emotionless in the way it is told from an outsider's perspective, so far removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"POORLY WRITTEN","review":"Miserably failing the 40 page rule, it's simply not possible to become engaged with anyone in this poorly written drawn out 'story'. The writer is going for some of the vibe in Salinger's family stories but while those are very hit and miss, this fails utterly. Where is the editor? Everyone in this book is very smug, very self-satisfied, very self-absorbed and honestly it's very difficult to make a story set in the suburbs engaging. But it's a little unnerving that a 'grown-up' wrote this. There's a pervy aspect to this whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensory Detail","review":"I took an educational opportunity to read this book and would now like to read more of Eugenides' works. The title would indicate a gloomy tale, but rather, it is one filled with sensory detail and emotion. The way that Eugenides captures the action of story though appealing to all five senses gives the reader even more of an image than the movie can do justice. I was drawn into the action of the plot and just wanted to keep reading more. The novel is entertaining and filled with a different, yet appealing, kind of action and drama appropriate for the youthful characters of the suburbs. I would, though, recommend this novel for the mature reader because of it's content and subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and haunting, but I don't know why...","review":"And that is the beauty of the book. The answer to the question as to why the Lisbon sisters killed themselves seems readily apparent--their mother was an unreasonable, overprotective witch, and the girls could not come up with another viable option for escaping the house. But Eugenides makes us wonder if there is more to it than that--that maybe we the readers and the neighborhood boys who pined after them were missing something about the Lisbon family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book, Keeps Audience Guessing","review":"I couldn't put this book down. As I read the book, and got to know the Lisbon girls through the eyes of their neighbors. The one thing I didn't like is that it listed several \\"examples\\" and whatnot, and never talked about them again...it was sort of odd. As these sisters gradually take their lives together, I found myself on the edge of my seat, waiting to find out if they'd really move out, or if they'd do what they did... It talks about the 5 girls as one person, and their parents seem to have forgotten that they are human. All in all, a wonderful book. I only wish it were longer and explained more, maybe from the girls' point of view. I guess that's part of the book's charm though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one -- read Middlesex instead.","review":"If you haven't read anything by Jeffrey Eugenides, skip the Virgin Suicides and head right to Middlesex. VS was slow paced and dull. The characters were merely charicatures -- shallow and unrelatable. By the end, I couldn't wait until all the girls were dead -- just to put this painfully boring story out of its misery.Thank goodness I read Middlesex by Eugenides before I read this one. Middlesex was a very interesting story -- one of my recent favorites. If I had read VS first, I wouldn't have even bothered with Middlesex.My recommendation -- skip The Virgin Suicides and head right to Middlesex. VS should be put to rest. It's going right into my Goodwill box -- not even worthy of passing to one of my many book-loving friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Male author clueless about teenage girls minds","review":"Guys love this book. Why? Because the female protagonists are depicted in guy-think. Dream on boys. I read this book before it took on a cult-like persona and thought it was trash fiction. (My husband loved it.) The girls were cardboard, non-thinking beings. They were endlessly subjected to male dominance without minds of their own - and unfeeling male readers love it!!!!!

It was boring and not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please find something else","review":"The Virgin Suicides is a story of five daughters living under the strict and strange religious rule of their dominant mother. As the girls begin to experience teenage freedoms, the unbelievable suburban nightmare begins. The story is told from the perspective of neighbor boys who, along with their parents and the girls own father, watch in impotence. Did anyone ever hear of social services? Pick up a different book, this one is just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at points, but never hit its higher goal...","review":"I actually enjoyed the movie much more. The book strived for philosophical, and ended as an obsesssive rant...the comedy totally missed me, and it hung as a black cloud in my things-to-finish list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, What?","review":"I think I'm missing something. After reading some of the headlines of reviews here, I think I'm missing about 300 more pages worth of actual plot, indepth characters, or at least well-crafted, interesting words. Maybe my book came lacking some important pages, because this book was an utter waste of time. It's nothing. How this even got printed and swirled up in hype is beyond me. If you want to read the book, read the first chapter and stop there. It does not progress beyond that."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting","review":"I do not understand why others gave this book such a high rating.

I was really disappointed, and sadly, now on page 172, I give up. I don't often give up on my books, but I decided that if the only reason I was finishing this was to say that I had finished it, it wasn't worth the effort. I agree with the other reviewer that said that she had no connection with the characters or their movitives for suicide (or researching the suicide, in the case of the boys). I came to Amazon to see if the ending made the rest of the read worth it, and most people have suggested that there are no answers. Alas, I'll move on to other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"As I'm working my way through the audio version of Middlesex, I picked up The Virgin Suicides. Jeffrey Eugenides creates an intriguing tale of five suicidal sisters. It's definitely not a book for people who want things spelled out with crystal clarity, as it leaves a lot of, I believe, intentional loose ends. Although the core issues that lead to the suicides are never blatantly presented in black and white, Eugenides lets the reader delve into their own mind, or knowledge of the mind, to construct meaning. Overall, a great book, and the movie was fairly decent as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"writing style just not for me","review":"So the plot is very interesting. I was desperate to find out the whys around these girls.But the writing style was just not for me. The author has a very descriptive style and at times I found myself aggravated by the pages and pages of descriptions of the weather, the seasons, the bugs, and the leaves. I just wanted the plot to move forward.And finally big spoiler alert you get no real answers for why this happened to these girls in this small town......irritating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Suicide Swan Song","review":"In what is one of the most beautiful explorations into the teenage psyche Eugenides provides the dark and often morbid truth. In viewing the five Lisbon girls every reader can see a part of themselves. From the first pages you are drawn into a world of prom dresses mixed with meloncolly thoughts, a teenagers struggles for freedoms combined with a mothers domineering ways. You helplessly watch as the once lovely and cheerful girls slowly deteriorate into nameless oblivion. I eagerly await Eugenides next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting but beautiful...","review":"Eugenides really bursts onto the scene with this magnificent novel (adapted into an equally amazing film). The novel captures adolescence from the male and female perspective so perfectly, the awkwardness, the obsession, the rebellion, the temptation. The novel's use of 70's musical references works greatly to Eugenides favor. It's not a pick me up by any means, but it is truly a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iriskid gobsmacked!","review":"My good God...I bought the book less than 24 hours ago and have been absolutely encapsulated by it. This is the first book ive read in less than a day, why?, its completely masterful, a book of exceptional truth and clarity, merging parts of almost gothic eeriness and evil foreboding to areas of extreme romanticism and deep rooted anxieties of a global youth culture with no where left to turn. I think whats best about it is the way the Lisbon sisters continue to be shrouded in mystery even (and i think more so) after their deaths.I seriously urge you to read this unbelievably creative and almost epitaph esqe book...chillingly dark and genuinly mind-blowing.

While I found the book easy to read and beautifully written without superfluous detail or drama, the stark simplicity often made the book anti-climatic. Throughout the novel I continually waited for a single sentence that would make this book worthy of the amazing amount of praise it has garnered. Unfortunately I was never able to reach such a point. I doubt anyone ever will. The beauty of this book does not lie in a single moment, or any distinguishable action but in its entirety. Everything this book does is very subtle yet effective. Like the book, my reaction was also subtle and never distinct. The overall effect however is very, very powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read it just because you liked Middlesex!","review":"Having just finished and loved the book Middlesex, by the same author, I ordered and quickly started reading this one. Thank goodness it was a much shorter book. Unlike Middlesex, it was vague in both plot and character development. It was difficult to finish, and I was surprised to hear it was sucessful enough to be made into a movie. But then the reviews of the movie don't appear to be very positive either. Just a warning...these two books don't have much in common...read Middlesex instead, it's great and was justly honored by the Pulitzer Prize!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential","review":"I was intrigued by the idea of this book, yet when I got to actually read it, I was disappointed. Eugenides has a charming style of writing but it wasn't enough to pull this story out. In fact, the story itself wasn't so bad but I feel it would've been much more effective if it'd been told from another point of view. The story lacked alot of forward motion and never really answered any of the central questions to the plot. I felt that the characters were left terribly shady and I couldn't care for them as much as I'd hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth reading","review":"The fact that it has been recently made in to a film prompted me to read it. It is a really good read. it tells in flashback of a group of boys who are obcessed with a family of girls who live across the street who all committ sucide. There parents are (over)protective and this adds to the mystery which grows around them. Although the ending can be seen from a mile off it adds to book. At the end of the book I wished that it would last longer"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my time.","review":"After the hype over the movie, I did what I usually do, I read the book before considering seeing the movie. It was a waste of eyesight in my opinion. Too much needless detail and not enough story will kill my interest in a book pretty quickly. I kept on reading hoping I would \\"get it\\". Still can't even figure out a point to this book and do not understand all the rave reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Debut","review":"Never before or since has there been written such a profound and hauntingly beautiful debut. Eugenides has crafted an intense novel exploring the lives of five sisters through the eyes of a group of friends, all of whom have been transfixed for years, even after the girls' suicides. The singular narrative voice for the boys/men is an interesting device, unique and surprisingly satisfying. While many have expressed opinion, usually negative, regarding the authors' lack of detailed motivation for the girls' suicides, the open-endedness is perfect, as any offering of such details would have appeared as simply providing an unnecessary closure. Thatvery lack of explanation lends the novel a lingering sense of melancholy, one that stays with the reader days after having taken in the last pages. Engrossing, fulfilling and appropriately chilling, one can only hope the forthcomng film adaption captures the novel's gothic sensibility and overwhelming impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boring? hardly. Genius? nearly.","review":"I did like this one. I don't think the style was anything breathtaking and I didn't think this book was deep and pensive but it told a nice story. Eugenides makes light of a rather serious topic and pulls it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely good","review":"The Virgin Suicides at first struck me as odd, but then I realized it was because you weren't meant to understand exactly what the sisters were going through. In that way you take the absolute position of the collective narrator, having no knowledge of the facts that they didn't have. I suggest reading this book because you get to feel as the narrator feels, only having hints of who the Lisbon girls were. I subtracted one star because you only got a picture of who Cecelia and Lux were; Bonnie, Mary and Therese were left without real substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and memorable","review":"It was just a beautiful book (despite not so glamorous subject matter) in describing how the girls were, or how nobody really knew them, and how they were seen by the boys obseesed with them. The way you learn about the characters little by little kept me reading and it really seemed like a memory, and some actions are never really explained so i kept thinking about the characters long after i finished it. definetly a great book, one of those you just have to read to understand. without that, its just \\"oh yeah, they die right?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Liquid Poetry","review":"This book was excellent. If you liked the movie, read the book and you'll understand so much more. The author describes the scenes to every last detail in this depressing but real novel. Teenage obsession and how far it will go."},{"rating":"2","title":"my second favorite book","review":"this novel is just awesome. taking you through i lives of these five young ladies and their deaths. euginides makes it as if i knew these girls, with sharp detail. i haven't yet seen the movie, but i hope it is as outstanding as book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey Into Suburban Mythos, But....","review":"From the very first paragraph, even from the title, we know what happens: five beautiful sisters commit suicide. The question is, why? The answers are sought, in retrospect, from the point of view of the men who were once teenage boys obsessed with these girls. Eugenides' lyrical, entrancing prose creates a fascinating world within the minds of the boys, and in the process involves the reader in a long lost, innocent suburban world that only ever existed in retrospect. However, what seems so mysterious to the boys, i.e. the reason for the girls' seeming madness and subsequent suicide, is blindingly obvious to the reader, and some of the plot twists seem completely unrealistic and even superfluous. It's a book I enjoyed reading once, but not something I'll pick up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare,disturbing,marvelous,depressing masterpiece","review":"This book tells the sad tale of the five Lisbon sisters,who are fated to kill themselves through the course of a year. It explores the relationships between parents and children and boys and girls. After the death of Cecilia, the remaining sisters are slowly suffocated out of existence by their mother and their only hope for salvation is the neighborhood boys. The all too human truths and emotions that run rampant throughout this novel are what make it as genuine as a news article; they are what make this novel the darkly shimmering tale of a family's descent into a dark unending abyss of misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I fell in love with the movie and knew I had to order the book as soon as possible. The item arrived in perfect condition and sooner than expected!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"I read this for my monthly book club and while it made for great discussion, most of us just wondered why? Why would the author choose to write in this style of narrative and *spoiler alert* write from the perspective of balding middle aged men obsessed with 5 girls they barely knew? It was just so drawn out and pointless. We thought a much better twist would have been the parents on trial for neglect... or to find out someone was responsible, but maybe that is just because I love a good murder mystery. I'm just not sure what all the hype is about here although I will say that I haven't watched the movie & those that had had stronger reactions to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"A++ story. Got the book after seeing the movie. Books are always better so I gave it a try and i'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!!!","review":"While I love the author's command of the English language, I thought the plot was pointless and depressing. His vocabulary is astonishing but the content was disapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"Eugenides first novel turns out to be a great accomplishment! It's a story about the Lisbon sisters and how they leave earth one by one. Why? Maybe their wacko parents? Their sheltered lives? The story is told by a teenage, girl obsessed neighbor boy and his friends and how they interact with the sisters.It is a very odd and strange novel that is not for everyone...it has a slight black humor around the edges yet very delicate. It a true work of fiction and very different which sets it apart from other great works of fiction. A must read for any true outside the ordinary (or box!) fiction reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work","review":"Well-written and haunting, the beauty lies in the narration. I found myself never getting quite close enough or intimate with the subjects of the story, never truly becoming a part of their world - but that's the point. One feels like an outsider peering in. It's a sad tale, from the first sentence, but oddly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRIPPING","review":"From the moment I picked this book up I could not put it down. Even in some of the slow parts I knew I had to keep reading because I was so intrigued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing writing style and plot . . .","review":"Eugenides writes well (you knew that). The story line has interesting quirks. Despite the fact that the outcome is entirely predictable, I found myself caught up in the perspective of the young boys . . . the mystery of the girls' lives .. . and the larger question about whether we ever know what goes on behind the closed doors of somebody else's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful writing...","review":"I for one read the book, then immediately watched the movie, hoping to gain some kind of understanding into the ending. Of course, don't do this. Because the movie itself mirrors the book exactly, untila few short things at the end.The book is written wonderfully, and you find yourself completely enveloped in the beginning and middle, but kind of getting bored at the end... especially when the ending leaves you thinking \\"huh?\\"I recommend this as a book to read... But it's not on my top ten list. And the movie doesn't help matters any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly literature","review":"I had to read this book for a college class and I couldn't believe the professor would assign such trash. The book made Catholics look bad, trivialized female emotions, and was just too depressing. Literature worthy of study? I think not. This read like a bad Lifetime movie. Wait, that's not exactly right--Lifetime movies are sometimes entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer pseudo literature","review":"I should have known. When a novel (or its author) has Pulitzer Prize status, chances are good I'm not going to like it, and so The Virgin Suicides proved to be the rule and not the exception. It's the usual dirty, creepy, weird, dark, perverted mess that passes for \\"serious literature\\" today. As for the characterization of the Lisbon girls and their parents, nothing about their personalities or character was developed beyond the most surface of observable actions, so who could bond with them? As for their admirers, the \\"we\\" of the narrators, the same can be said about them, and there is, in addition, nothing in the realm of realism to suggest why the admirers would ever have developed crushes on these bizarre sisters. I found myself not ever caring about anyone in the entire book. However, I could clearly \\"smell\\" the decay he insisted we experience, or was that my own brain decaying under the trauma of trying to absorb this miasma of storytelling?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly was that?!","review":"I recently finished The Virgin Suicides. I absolutely hated it. I saw all of the great reviews and figured I couldn't go wrong. I never got into the plot what so ever. Despite the fact that it is slow moving, boring, and lacks anything substantial, I pressed on trying to get to the part of the book that made so many people love it. Personally, I never found it. Wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone, it's got the excitement level of a piece of cardboard, save your time and money. I couldn't wait until they finally off'd themselves so I could be done with it. I know that sounds cruel but once I figured out that this book wasn't going to get any better I figured I may as well finish it. A complete waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"the virgin suicides","review":"This short novel is a sad and believable story about a family of teenage girls and the distance between who they are and how they are perceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored in Bethesda","review":"I must be too old for this book. I agree with the readers who found the plot flimsy, shallow, and unsatisfying, with characters like paper dolls (especially the five sisters). The suicides never rise above a plot gimmick, allowing the teenage boys to romanticize the girls, who we never get to know. We read this for our book group and I considered reading it to be a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read \\"Middlesex\\" first and was disappointed by the \\"Virgin Suicides\\". I did not find the sisters as engaging as I had hoped and struggled to get through this. I wouldn't spend the time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a stretch...","review":"I have only cried while reading twice in my life - during \\"A Summer to Die\\" and during this book. \\"The Virgin Suicides\\" is extremely frustrating and depressing to read because the reader can't help but want to reach out and help these girls. I did think the way it's portrayed (from the perspective of all the neighborhood boys) was a bit of a stretch and detracted from the overall story, but it's still a great book.Definitely worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly crafted","review":"Although Mr. Eugenides tries to carefully craft the characters of the Lisbon sisters, he leaves much to be desired in crafting the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon. Very little is said to or about the couple who have lost five daughters. Our book club (about 16 members) read this and the majority feel this book was not a good read. A few people really liked the book, but more felt that the book was a very slow read. Many of the tangents that Mr. Eugenides went off on did little to contribute to the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written book by Eugenides","review":"This is a book in which style at times trumps content. I found the narration and lyrical style of writing to be mesmerizing. The basic story is about a family of girls growing up in very restrictive household. As they are gradually allowed to interact with children their age, the story unfolds into tragedy. I enjoyed this book for its beautiful writing and a compelling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"After listening to Middlesex (What a great story and the reading was fantastic) I was pretty excited to try the Virgin Suicides. I was extremely disappointed. The reader had little to no inflection and just trudged through it, slowly. I finally gave up. Any humor was lost by the unenthusiastic reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing saga","review":"This work thoroguhly depressed me. I know it was a hit movie which I happened to hate. The major flaw to this effort is that it provides very little motivation for the characters to commit mass suicide. Yes, the parents are very domineering and controlling but i can't think of 5 people who would kill theseselves because their parents were rotten, much less five sisters.If you are depressed or unahppy in any way, don't waste your time on this. There are far better things to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Virgin Suicides","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The story line is shallow, and the characters flat. There was a tremendous potential for a great book with the material, but it never really made it past the outline stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"can you spell B-O-R-I-N-G?!!!","review":"After reading several reviews about this book, I decided to purchase it. I have never experienced anything so boring in my life. The endless pages of descriptions, and paragraphs that lasted just as long made me want to throw this book across the room. Although I found the storyline interesting, I could not get past the author's boring style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virgin Suicides, not good","review":"I don't know how this book made the best sellers list. I carried on reading it thinking something would happen, or maybe a brilliant ending, but nothing got me absorbed into this book. It gives the view from outsiders watching the teen age girls, which doesn't shed much light on their feelings from the inside. This is the worst book I've read for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Sleeping Pill. Hope its flammable","review":"This book was recommended to me by Amazon.com, and after reading the great reviews, I could not wait to dig in. I am glad there are books for anyone;s taste, but this book was consistently boring. I have ordered many books which I have enjoyed on the recommedations found at Amazon.com, but I am saving this one to start a fire next winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I just finished reading Middlesex and rushed out and bought the Virgin Suicides. I am very glad I bought this book at an outlet for 70% off. This book did not even compare to Middlesex. Hopefully, the next time Jeffrey Eugenides writes a book it will be more like Middlesex, and less like the Virgin Suicides."},{"rating":"1","title":"**","review":"The success of and reverence for this novel mystifies me. I thought it was half-baked, with no great psychological insight or originality, frankly, and, despite a lot of prententious writing (or perhaps because of it) found the narrator(s) to be, underneath all the \\"thinking,\\" surprisingly unreflective. The boys seemed detached and cold. And a few incidents were strung over many pages. Also the \\"symbolism,\\" the pagan metaphors and Catholic references, seemed contrived and geared to make the text seem \\"literary\\" rather than add genuine heft and depth to the story. Such things should be organic, and not placed in a narrative merely for the sake of giving it literary cachet."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame lame lame","review":"i found this book to be a lot of words in search of a plot. after the first suicide, it bogs down and while it could be exploring the sisters, bringing us to understand them, the reader is left looking in the windows at strangers like the young men across the street. we are never given a clue to the parents' obsessive overprotectiveness or how they are able to get such co-operation from 4 teenage girls in what is virtual imprisonment. i suppose that is the \\"mystery\\" and allure of the book for some, but i found it a waste of time. the most interesting character is the sister who kills herself in chapter 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"good start - weak finish","review":"The first half of this book was a great read with an original premise and interesting writing. However, halfway through it became very tedious and slow moving. There is no story build up to the end and the reader really doesn't find out any more about the characters than we knew in the beginning. I was hoping for more and it made it even more disappointing because the beginning and writing were both very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to the hype","review":"I read this book for my book club and found it to be enormously over-rated. The characters were seriously underdeveloped and as a result, it was extremely difficult to invest in the flimsy plot. Although the writing style was interesting, the author wouldn't know subtlety if it hit him in the head. Eugenides had a great idea, but the development was poor and I was left feeling like little more than a rubber-necker at an accident scene with no real conception of why I had bothered looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overwritten Mess","review":"I was seduced by the overall great reviews, and my huge admiration for \\"Middlesex\\". This was not in the same realm.The writing was beautiful, but there was entirely too much of it. It got to the point where I just felt like reading the ending to see how it all played out. There were so many unnecessary descriptions and events that they ceased to be relevant. After the first few chapters, the rest of the novel just left me with a profound disappointment that I would have to listen to these same voices over and over without truly finding out what made the characters tick. I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious exercise in magic realism","review":"The author has chops but VS is a let down. Instead of character and plot development, the book offers a tedious exercise in \\"magic realism\\", or how many tragi-comic, ironic, goofy, voyeuristic, farfetched, twisted scenes can the author pile up before you heave the book into the nearest trash can?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes there aren't answers","review":"I'll agree with the previous reviewer that this books gives a lot of questions without answers, but I found that to be one of it's strengths. It made the book more realistic, we were struggling for the same understanding that was haunting the boys years after the suicides.It's amazing how the author seemed to understand girls without really understanding them. You can see the girls are struggling, but at times it seems like they don't even know themselves why they are struggling. Again, I found that to be realistic. Maybe it's hormones.It's not an uplifting book by any means, but I think it puts you in the place of troubled teens in a very emotional way. And emotions are often void of reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Obviously, Doctor, you've never been a 13-year-old girl.\\"","review":"I saw the film when it first came out, and while I found it beautiful, there was something about it that bothered me, that kept me from really LOVING it. Once I read the book, it came full circle for me; everything that made me \\"question\\" the film made sense and made me REALLY appreciate it. The book is perfection, playing out like the dreamiest and most delicious (and often times intensely dark) surreality; it's an almost ideallic suburbia. The Virgin Suicides is one of those books where you underline and highlight and copy down passages wishing you'd thought of them. Jeffrey Eugenides has mastered the english language and I would easily recommend both this book and Middlesex to anyone who loves fiction that you can't put down and can never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"One fantistic book","review":"The Virgin Suicides is a difficult book to classify because of its many faces. Is about growing up, finding out who you are, and realizing that death can be preferable to life. Overall, the book is one of the best that I have ever read. The last twenty pages are the most powerful words written in modern literature. The book plays with your mind with its humor and brutal truth and honesty about life and emotions. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"narrator is a psychopath!!!","review":"plenty of people have reviewed the substance of this novel so far, so no need for that. what nobody seems to note is that the narrator is an obsessive, stalking psychopath. You have to wonder if his (and his friends, if they weren't imaginary) stalking had something to do with the girls going nuts. Probably not, but it's interesting to think about. This dude is scary. I mean, he was keeping stuff from the girls long before they started killing themselves. He was a freak. Scary.Oh and I can't beleive how many people don't seem to get the point of this novel: if you lock up teenagers, you will kill them (figuratively, and maybe literally on occasion). They need to act a little crazy and experience the world. if you stifle them, you will make it worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I'm always amazed at the praise this books receives. I read this as a teenager and I couldn't even identify with any of the characters then. I tried watching the movie and it was even worse! The premise has more shock than substance, but there's really no story here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suicides: A great subject for a novel","review":"A friend asked me to go see the author when he came here to Houston. I thought he sounded very interesting so, I immediately orederd his 1st two books, The Virgin Suicides & Middlesex (from amazon.com, natch). Suicides was a r-e-a-l slog, but I was determined to get through it. I did, but I really cannot reccommend it. I've now got Middlesex to get through (it won the Pulitzer Prize) & things do not bode well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suicides why?","review":"I read Middlesex before this one but it's easy to spot Eugenides trademark themes like genes and how they influence life. I read this book in one day, it was that easy. It was gruesome but never tried to evoke big emotions. Great debut book."},{"rating":"1","title":"poetic but falls short as a novel","review":"Jeffrey Eugenides' \\"Middlesex\\" is one of my favorite novels, and so my expectations were high for The Virgin Suicides. I wonder if that's why I was so disappointed in this tale of the suicides of a whole family of adolescent girls. I listened to the audio-book, and the reader was quite good, but I never was engaged by the story or characters. The writing was beautiful. It really was mysterious and poetic, but that was not enough to sustain me for a whole novel. While I enjoyed bits and pieces very much, this story just never grabbed a hold of me. About a third of the way through, I decided that I didn't care enough to continue. Maybe it picked up later, but I'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing....but good","review":"This book is about a family with 5 daughters, and how the suicide of a daughter (Cecilia) effects the family and the entire neighborhood. I don't want to be misleading though, this book is not the tale of them overcoming the tragedy, but dwelling in it. Do NOT read this book if you don't want to be depressed, because it is a very sad story, and parts of it are very disturbing.One thing that bothered me was i could never decide the narrators exact place in the story, but i did enjoy the descriptions, they created wonderful imagery.this book will definitely teach you to appreciate the life you live"},{"rating":"2","title":"The thing about suicide is........","review":".....that you never really can know \\"why?\\" because the one person who can answer that question is now dead. That is really the underlying theme of this powerful, timely and depressing book. The characters were well-developed, the plot was strong and the group narrative was unique. You never knew which one of the neighbor boys was telling the story at any given moment. My fear is that maybe this book romanticizes the act of suicide a little more than it should. In the hands of the wrong teenager this regretful solution to life's problems could look appealing. This is a must read for every adult, but I wouldn't recommend it to my children until they are in their 20's. If they choose to read it before then it will end with a very open discussion with their mother and me. SAD, is the one word that best describes my feelings after finishing this book, but it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plagues You","review":"Eugenides has the ability to create such hopeless story, with no moral or theme, no meaning no matter how deeply one reads into it, and yet still leave the reader incredibly moved. His vivid writing pulls the reader into the story and thus allows their journey to parallel that of the neighborhood boys who loved and obsessed over the Lisbon girls. One finds oneself analyzing every peice of evidence, and still finding no sense to their death, feeling bewildered and distant from the girls, and almost experiencing the same torture as the boys. The purpose of the novel is not to mourn for the death, or for the pain that drove them to it. The novel intends to leave the reader in confusion, teasing you with facts that have no significance, in the same state in which the Lisbon girls left their admirers. The novel is truly unique in its structure, especially in its lack of conclusion. Every aspect of it is truly magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, poppy club song","review":"This song's distinctive, infectious beat made it a huge hit worldwide. This song is a great follow up to her first hit, \\"Goodies\\" featuring Petey Pablo. The lyrics aren't especially clever or thought provoking: \\"Rock it, don't Stop it, everybody get on the floor, crank the party up we about to get it on, let me see you 1,2 step...\\" but that's ok because it's a song to dance, not philosophize to! Jazze Pha's introduction and Missy Elliot's verse at the end blend in nicely. By the way, it's funny that so many people here are calling Ciara a one hit wonder. She's had three hit singles so far and is featured on Missy Elliot's latest hit, \\"Lose Control.\\" I think she definitely has a future in the fickle music industry, partly because she's Missy's protégé and she works with tons of huge names such as Dr. Dre and Ludacris."},{"rating":"1","title":"More garbage","review":"This music is dying and being shown for what it really is: lip sync, no talent trash......thank GOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1-hit-wonder on white kiddie chart & 1 hit on urban....","review":"shes a one-hit-wonder on the charts because of her untalentness, so she had to make this single for the whitey kiddies so they think its hip! her career is over! ciara, your an official 1-hit-wonder! now since \\"oh\\" flopped like the album did, we can indeed celelbrate that this baby star is GONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"these songs are decent at the club,but Ciara's vocals are really lightweight&the Grooves are all the same. it's cool to be at the Club dancing to them,but after a while He limited vocal range comes rather quickly than later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, at least it's better than Goodies...

Jazze Pha provides a pretty decent backdrop for Ciara's surprisingly ON-key singing and Missy Elliot spits, uh, 4 bars, in her extremely brief verse. I guess 1, 2 Step is an alright joint for the clubs, but can Ciara pull off a single on her own? Her next one features Ludacris, so we'll have to wait and see if Ciara can hold her own as an artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"We will rock you?","review":"Never has this phrase been uttered with such absence of conviction.

This book did not help me at all. It is a good book, but it is targeted at US America. There are a lot of weapons covered that are only thinkable under the liberal laws of the USA.If you are a non US citizen you will find a lot of facts where you will think 'What a crazy country that this stuff can be legally purchased'. But it will not help you with questions like: What kind of my self-defense weapon can I hide how ?It was interesting to read, but I felt, I should have spend my money on another book, because I am not living in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low bucks horror classic","review":"If you and your sweetie have a hankering to sit down to a Friday night horror movie, Mr. Hell is a must for your list. It's not so bloody that it'll turn your date off, but scary enough to keep her jumping into your arms. And you might jump into her arms as well, if you are like me, who is spooked by threats to your eyes. This is classic Steven KIng territory, picking phobias most of us have. I won't give away the plot, except to say it involves stealing souls via plucked out eyes. But I will say it has some of the funniest scenes I've encountered in horror movies - where humor is a must. For example: when the bad guy bends over a sink washing out stollen eyeballs while humming, \\"Three Blind Mice.\\" Like the very best \\"grindhouse\\" features, Mr. Hell features super writing and clever dialogue that lifts the film up to the very top of its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic horror movie!","review":"This is an entertaining movie! The title is clever and the plot line was good for this genre of movie. This one has something for just about everyone...scares, action, gore, and humor mixed in. I was also surprised by the quality of the stunts...falls, fire, explosions, fights...that rival much larger budget movies.NOTE ABOUT THE CAST Contrary to the previous reviewer, Tina Cohen is not the lead. The lead is veteran actress Tracy Scoggins, supported by Pavan Grover and Danny Kamin. If he had paid attention, Tina Cohen was far down on the credits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be sub-titled","review":"Sound is so bad, of such poor quality that this film should be sub-titled.

One of the best thing about this series is that it uses faces of real children (ages 5 to 6 approximately) to depict the characters in the book,therefore, making it very eye-appealing to readers. There is something in the book for very young children as well as early readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Led to some good discussions","review":"I have used this book with children in social skills groups to teach them how being mean to other kids can hurt them. Even though the kids found some of the book funny, and loved the illustrations, they didn't entirely understand the point at first. The book is rather complex, and most young children won't get the underlying message without some adult coaching to help them understand it. I do believe the book is worth it, though, because what the author is trying to teach is so important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: nightmares","review":"Definitely not a story for younger ones. Over-promoted &/or marketed. We viewed the 'Bunch of Munsch' DVD which included this story & it gave my 5 year old nightmares, & left my 4 yr old unhappy. Both were confused. Only one of the stories was really appreciated by the kids. A friend who watched with us summed it up: \\"Weird. Why?\\" In summary, Beware: some Munsch are better than others, skip the 'Bunch.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of Glenn Cook's authorship","review":"I have to admit this book was a page turner but only because I was so anxious to find some trace of Cook's previous writing style. Though I have become accustomed to Cook adding new characters and relegating old ones to the background, I am particularly disappointed with his treatment of One Eye, Goblin and Soulcatcher. Has he grown tired of these characters and indulged in some pettiness by portraying them in manners inconsistent with past storylines? Mr. Cook's writing style also contains more profanity and sexual inuendo than before. I am no prude but this all adds up to a significant departure from previous Black Company novels. It bears more resemblance to his writing style in the \\"Garrett\\" series (ie; \\"Petty Pewter Gods\\"). Please Mr. Cook, examine your writing style and how this latest installment is a glaring departure from previous volumes and not for the better. Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing but Depressing to an extent.","review":"I readily absorbed the huge dose of answered questions and history of the Realm.Spoilers ahead... My dissapointments were the fact that Croaker and Lady had relatively nothing to do with the book at all, except for being there stuck on the plain, white crow notwithstanding.I gave four stars only because I felt let down by the ending, as it related to Lady and Croaker, who after all were the main reasons anyone travelled up the plain anyway, in my oh so humble opinion.After putting this book down I felt like I won Lotto, but my dad who picked the numbers for me died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"Cook has written a bad ending for some interesting people.

I'm a great fan of the Black Company and I'm really waiting for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!","review":"This is a company which does not stand behind its questionably built products. I received this as a present and charged it up and used it less than 10 times --- the battery appeared to need recharging but it wouldn't recharge -- the red light wouldn't come on and when I called them to let them know, they couldn't have cared less. They acted like it was okay to have the board that recharges it stop working within 2 weeks of using it. They had a surly attitude and said that if I wanted anything done I'd have to send it in at my expense and they wouldn't reimburse me. Additionally, it looks like the company's sticker on the back of it is the only thing that keeps the two halves together. I'm sending it back to my parents and they are taking it back to the store. My recommendation: find a well-known company's product and not this unpleasant business."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever mystery that had me guessing right up until the end","review":"I suspected and eliminated each character several times, but didn't see that ending coming at all!

The setting was very good and had a great beginning, but the characters just seeemed to be miserable all of the time. I did enjoy the visiting niece, but she was too little too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelangelo's Mountain: The Quest for Perfection in the Marble Quarries of Carrara","review":"An early reference to marble work in Lee, Massachusetts caught my attention and drew me deep into this unique and fascinating account of the marble quarries that provided the raw material for the genius that we all now know as Michelangelo. I glimpsed the quarries from a train window on a trip to Italy a year ago, mistakening them for snow at first, and it's an amazing sight. I highly recommend this book - the stone that inspired the Rennaissance is still there and this story of the mountains of marble is told with a passion that reflects the emotion of those times. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"I'm a college student, and my roomie, from Australia, read this book to me.

I particularly like the author's emphasis on how livable the style is, and find this to be true too. Buyer beware however that French country may look a lot different in an American ranch house: a lot of the charm comes from plastered stone walls, old beams and well-worn tile floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thousand Years of Good Prayers-Mandarin/English version","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much. It really was heart-felt and expresses a good concept of relationship between a father and a daughter. The father from China and the daughter becoming Americanized.

Never again will I buy from this source."},{"rating":"1","title":"14804 Sears Kenmore Humidifier Replacement Filter","review":"This product was horrible. I purchased two to get us through the next few months and neither filter lasted longer than a week. The issue is that it looks like they are put together with some type of glue gun or something. The glue melted into the humidifier basin so there was a white film in it. Then the filter itself formed a goopy barrier (again the glue) where it hit the water in the humidifier which blocked the filter from working at all anymore.Just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-standard replacement filter","review":"This filter is not a genuie Kenmore filter but rather an no name brand replacement. The filter did not wick the water as good as a genuine Kenmore filter nor did it last as long. It virtually stopped wicking after about a month of use while I got a full season of use out of a Kenmore filter in a second humidifier that I have. This filter was much cheaper so I guess you get what you pay for. I would not buy this product again, not a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed with these filters","review":"I've used many different brands of filters for the Sears humidifier and these are not good. They do not have much wicking material, large \\"honeycomb\\" holes, thus they do not produce much moisture. With less fabric they silt up with the minerals very quickly. After about a week it was hard as a rock (lime) and do not wick. This price was good but you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"filter","review":"I can't stand having to put a minumum of 15 words for this review.

This book is an absolute treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Parenting Book We've Ever Found!","review":"These kids tell it like it is -- straight from the heart and right on target.

It's the perfect gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every new parent should have one","review":"This is the best primer for new parents I've ever seen. I buy one for every baby shower I'm invited to.

It kept my son cool while protecting him from the sun. The neck hole was a little tough to get over his head, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Lost Chord","review":"\\"The Terezin Requiem,\\" a surprisingly short novelization of a performance of Verdi's Requiem in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, provides a succinct but devastating image of the power of art even in the sordid horror of the Nazi world. Raphael Schaechter, the conductor, flies elegantly and engagingly by the seat of his pants to assemble and maintain his ensemble, and the many minor characters who move through it are brilliantly and all-too-briefly drawn. The irony of the Catholic Requiem's reinterpretation by doomed Jews is piquantly stated. As a semi-professional singer, I was inspired by the characters' embrace of a classical work as a bridge between real life and the slow dying of the camp. My only complaint was that the book ended too quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and to the point","review":"Mr. Choe's treatment of the subject matter is very clear and helpful to anyone interested in learning more about one of the hottest real estate markets in the world.While some sections of the book needs bolstering (e.g. new housing allocation system), overall, this work provides a solid introduction to the Korean real estate laws and practice in English.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better Books On Style","review":"This book is very useful. When I found out my style, which I think is a \\"classic\\" with a \\"trendy\\" accent, it helped me to understand what kinds of clothes I would look good in, feel good in, and continually reach for in the morning to feel pulled-together, not the victim of the latest fashion-du-jour. In this way, knowing your style type, and improvising (you're free to do that) allows you to make better choices and SAVE MONEY on your wardrobe at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the concept of personal style!","review":"This refreshing offering in the fashion genre is outstanding because it genuinely treats of personal style. (Too many others, ostensibly doing the same, repeat the same tired exhortation to the look that is termed professional - which usually means dowdy.) The presentation is enjoyable and fun, and readers should appreciate the both useful and lighthearted approach to colour."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE Do NOT Buy this Book!","review":"I would HATE to think of any publisher or author getting any kind of money whatsoever out of a book like this. \\"Fabulous You!\\" is by far the silliest book I ever have read. Not only does the author attempt to stick each individual into six misnamed and misrepresented catagories, the author also has no basis in the fashion world besides being a petite model... just because she may have picked up a couple facts here and there while modeling does NOT mean that she is qualified to come up with her own nonsensical fashion system. Please save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for the new millenium!","review":"This is a beautiful book that shows how our preconceived notions twist and make ugly a child's innocent desire to practice being a father.

I'd recommend it to anyone with a memory problem, including me! Also, it is reassuring that many of the things, ie forgetting names, forgetting where my car is in parking lot are not signs of serious memory loss. Also, this book emphasized to me the effect of depression on memory problems, which is comforting. The book is very caring and hopeful filled with practical advice to share with your doctor. I hope it is updated and reissued though. Valuable to read and helpful overview for people with loved ones bewildered with memory problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Reversing Memory Loss","review":"I thought this was a very well-written book about Alzheimers and dementia related illnesses. It gave some worthwhile suggestions and explanations.I think anyone dealing with aspects of this illness would benefit from reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting; but lacks practical advice","review":"This author's take on memory loss is very different from other books I've read. I thought his discussion on negative conditioning and its effect on memory was very interesting. He demonstrated how he is able to differentiate between a conditioned memory loss and real disease by taking an in-depth patient history. He maintains that these conditioned memory losses are reversible; but he never actually reveals his memory enhancing techniques, aside from a few relaxation methods. After reading this book, I left with no practical advise and nothing new to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but never like their first CD","review":"If you are into something easy to listen this CD will be better than their first one.If you are really into melodic gothic rock, Cast Away is a huge disappointment.No more fast and melodic metal.

This book really followed the time lines and experiences of a Russian adoption. I do think the info for Russian adoptions would be extremely helpful but for myself it wasn't what I was looking for. The info is also dated, though I should have looked at that before I bought the book. I think the date was 94-94.The resources provided good info, but now adays the internet provides just as much if not more info.

Unless you are a big fan of Sherrie McGraw I suggest avoiding this book. It's full of sweeping generalizations about what an 'artist' is, and the correct way to go about studying drawing and creating 'art'. I love drawing and learning about drawing, but there was little information to be gained from McGraw's 'insights'. Instead of encouraging study or discussing methods, McGraw is an advocate of 'creativity' and concerned about people studying too much. The book is full of platitudes and is of little use to someone interested in learning more about drawing. If you're looking for one long op/ed piece from McGraw's viewpoint, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb, comprehensive dictionary at a reasonable price.","review":"Singleton's Dictonary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology is wonderfully comprehensive, very current and a bargain at $62.

The only standout tracks on this CD are: \\"The Way We Ball\\" and \\"I Shoulda Listened.\\" \\"The Way We Ball\\" is kinda stupid.... \\"I Shoulda Listened\\" is more like a slow type of rap, almost like r&b. Besides those, the album is off the chain and will keep the songs in your head even when you're sleeping. I just hope Lil Flip keeps making gangsta albums.

Not much on this CD you want to skip, Lil Flip really makes quality music so much of the CD i slistenable. Remix with Juvenile is great. Bizzy Bone was on the album but did very little, David Banner produced some great beats but adds little rapping talent. Young Buck from G-Unit appeared and was okay.

Its a shame that Houston doesnt get much credit for its music scene but I think Lil' Flip is going to change that. Houston is a great city and I think Swisha House make it even better.

The next few issues in, Jean Paul Valley modifies the Batman costume into armor complete with helmet, gaunlets, a cape and shuriken that gives the character a decidedly 90s twist. DC comics attempted to boost sales by crippling Batman and killing Superman, following similar stories with Wonder Woman, The Green Lantern, etc to possibly return the character to their origins as gothic. They didn't bring in many new readers such as myself but did sell some extra copies. The God of Fear theme is from the Scarecrow villain character, saying later on there has to be a god of fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Novel ever","review":"Well, I just wanted to say, I fell in love with this book. I am generally a PERN fan, but this book has captivated me so much, that I couldn't put it down... it was just that great.I hope you make a sequel to this novel, and I look forward to buying more of these novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"McKiernan's Crowning achivement!","review":"I have read many a fantasy book in my day and Dennis L. McKiernan's books stand out above the rest. McKiernan is the only author that canhave me buy his books, read them in three days and have me bitingmy fingernails for the next year waiting for the next book to be published.Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling, mundane adventure tale.","review":"This was the first work I've read by McKiernan and while there is much worse out there, there is also much better. This is your ordinay quest adventure, in which the author moves the reader around as a small heroic band seek out a magical object which will save their world. Sound familiar? The heroes and heroines are humans and elves that all pair up at the end, the enemy is an evil wizard, and the world is populated with trolls and dragons. I could live with all of this if the story offered anything new or was well told. But instead the reader spends a lot of time in tedious travel or recounting plots thread worn by anyone who has ever played D&D or read Tolkien. It's not that McKiernan doesn't know how to write, but simply that he doesn't seem to be able to breath any freshness or life into his story. Look elsewhere unless you're simply looking for a way to pass the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...no.","review":"I've read some of Dennis's work before, the into the Forge set, and I thought it wasn't so bad for classic fantasy...though it dragged a little. So I decided to pick up an earlier book to see how much better it would be. I was horrible surprised to find it was worse. The book's beginning wasn't too bad. You can't help but mutter at the characters' unbelievable stupidity in solving the riddles. Even the long lived elf Arin is pretty clueless. Another problem, is Dennis describes everything in WAY too much detail...600 pages of nothing is a little much. I was kind of disgruntled after reading this book, because the ending wasn't epic in any way. The drunk that doesn't really accomplish anything for the whole book dies (and believe me, I'm not giving anything away). Wow...I could care less about a guy who drags the rest of the party down with him. If you want epic...read David Gemmel's Winter Warriors. Now that is some truly epic stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is missing part of a chapter","review":"I normally like McKiernan's books but this one is missing at least part of a chapter. Near the climax there is some interation missing between the people on the quest and the dragon guarding their objective. The text refers to a promise the dragon made and one character's opinion that he won't keep his word. I looked back twice to see if I missed anything but there was no convsersation. One of the chapters is very short, less than a page and it appears that it may be incomplete. I like his stories but bad editing is inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"McKiernan Sells Out!","review":"One of the great things about McKiernan's earlier works was an aire of believabilty about a classic fantasy epic, i.e. the assertion by McKiernan that the stories are taken from ancient and recently found manuscripts written comtemporarily with the events described; the maps used in his books roughly approximating modern-day Europe, etc. However, when he makes one of his central characters a sword-wielding 5'2\\" girl who is unstoppable in battle, his credibility as a writer snaps. I assume McKiernan, wanting to be accepted by the liberal, feminist elites in the literary community, thought he better do something to show them he's on board. Frankly, I was sorry to see him sell out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"I've been reading fantasy novels for 15 years and this story lacked excitement and creativity. Not only did it start slow it ended slow. I forced myself to finish the book because I spent 6 bucks for it. Stories like these can usually end in 200 or less pages. This one had close to 600. If you need any help falling asleep, then this is the book for you. (Oh yeah, a Nympho/Nutso queen?...please)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover has nothing to do with content","review":"Blah. Torture.I love this genre, but the names were like razors in the mouth. The characters superficial. The pace plodded on, while the characters plodding along from port to port.Barely a dragon in sight and none of the characters were noble. Not even the elves.The only reason I didn't give this just one star was because, well, there were a few scenes with elves and some with dragons, so just seeing those words makes it a little better than a text book.I was really disappointed - even the bad guy was beyond predictable. YAWN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blimey, this is bad","review":"I've read most of McKiernan's works, starting all the way back to the Iron Tower Trilogy. I have to admit they are getting progressively worse with each new release.a) As many posters have said, he pads the books with repetitive meaningless description.b) His characters are stale.c) Someone must have told him that he needed to increase his readership with women, because he insists on pushing poorly written romances on ALL of his characters. Put a man and a women together in a chapter -- guarantee they will hook up. No matter if they are completely different races and have only just met.d) Finally, the stories are becoming less interesting. I could put up with a and c above if the story and the characters made up for it. Not the case in this book.May be the last McKiernan book I read. Time to move on to a new author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give 0 stars","review":"I picked this up since I wanted to try an author that I have never read. I now wish that I didn't pick up this book.I will say that I did not finish it, after reading up to page 74 I gave up. I could see where the plot was going already and like many others have said the character are just cookie cutter characters.The worst part, in just the short bit that I read, was the author's description of an area. 71 words to in one sentence to describe an area. That was just the latest one. There were others.If you like boring fantasy novels that go into the minutest detail of describing an area this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BS","review":"I am sick and tired of these \\"moon hoax\\" people and I wish they'd all go away to fairyland where they belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is part of a conspiracy","review":"This book was written to cover up what is REALLY happening:NASA and the UN are secretly working on a plan, using the newest technologies (based on a combination of fibre optics, nanotechnology and genetic engineering), to cause the moon to be re-absorbed into the Earth from which it came. (I think the Pacific Ocean is where it came from, exactly, but maybe it's the Atlantic, I'm not sure.) Then they can found an Anti-Freedom State there, with a new combination of Extreme Islam, Communism, and Left Liberalism (this is where the genetic stuff comes in). It will be new land, you see.

For introverts, being with other people is draining. Too much time with others and not enough alone time will make an introvert exhausted and stressed out. The author never brings this up, despite the fact that introverts make up approximately 40% of the population.I felt that this book did not apply to me, and if I followed his advice, I would end up stressed out, less happy, with occasional meltdowns where I was not my best self and possible hurtful to myself or others. This issue aside, there was not much substance to the book. I feel the author could have expressed his complete idea in an essay or magazine article, instead of stretching it out into an entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good points but not for everyone","review":"A great read. Very thought provoking. However, I was taught from a very young age that you never, ever casually open someone else's refrigerator and take food without asking. It doesn't matter if its the refrigerator of close family or your best friend. It's bad manners and very disrespectful. So the idea of \\"Refrigerator Rights\\" doesn't resonate with me AT ALL. Though the points in this book make sense in today's world, not everyone enjoys being around a lot of people and that doesn't mean such people are \\"limited\\" in how much enjoyment they get out of life. I took exception to the author's apparent belief that self-reliance is bad. You can't always lean on others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Bottle","review":"I purchased this product based on the reviews. The first bottle arrived leaking in its packing.

You do not have to wet the dog down first with water before using the product. The instructions say to wet the dog's fur WITH the product. I use this when I notice my German Shepherd scratching for too long at a certain spot. I immediately spray the spot until it is fairly wet, then hand brush it in to get down to the skin. The whole process takes less than 30 seconds. My dog likes the product because it seems to relieve the itch. He doesn't have fleas--I think he just has dry skin. This product doesn't eliminate the need for the occasional full bath, but it does leave the hair clean and silky. And again, my dog seems to like it. The product has a very pleasant smell--very fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summary of the complex issue of enterprise systems","review":"This book is a good overview of all of the issues related to the selection and implementation of enterprise systems. I have purchased several copies of the book and distributed them to potential clients. I use the book as a gift during my seminars.The book, however, does not go into a lot of details on such critical issues such as change management and business case development for the project.This is a good introduction book and is an easy read. I recommend it for readers who want to understand the issues of ERP at a high level."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time and money","review":"As someone involved in the consulting area for many years, I was unable to find any new idea that would make worthwhile to spend money in this book. Almost everything that is mentioned here can be grabbed from free articles availables in Internet,about this subject. Additionally, there are a good number of books that will help you much more to plan and implement ERP's. Last, but not least, the book only have a handful of small pictures and tables. Unacceptable for a modern book about business and technology topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very broad and superficial review of ERP implementation","review":"It covers ERP implementation in very broad strokes, and gives a superficial overview of each step.

Don't have time to watch during the week, so love watching TV shows on DVD. I just wish I had been as spunky as Veronica when I was in high school. All the characters grow and change throughout the season. I love all the plot twists and turns. Each week, Veronica solves some \\"minor\\" mystery and chips away at solving some season- lasting puzzler. Big and small cast parts are played wonderfully, and Veronica frequently gets to exact revenge over someone who had 'wronged' her.

It is another season-long mystery slowly solved over the 20 something episodes, with smaller mysteries and reveals strewn throughout the season. This recipe worked great for the first season, and works just as good here. While the ending seemed just a tad overdramatic (not much more than the first, though, come to think of it), there is very little to dislike about it. If you enjoyed the first season in any way, you can't go wrong with watching the second as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad video","review":"From about a minute into the episode, something goes wrong with the video and you can't see a thing.

Can't wait for the season 3 DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the show, but I need my subtitles, dammit!","review":"I enjoyed the first season of Veronica Mars immensely, and was looking very much forward to season two. But the lack of English subtitles has prevented me from watching the season even though I bought it. As a non-native English speaker, I very often need to rely on the subtitles to follow the snappy dialogue, and while every tv series I ever bought to this point has had them they're apparently disappearing (missed them on the new Gilmore Girls dvd set as well). The choice is now limited to French or Spanish, neither of which I understand. Please, please put the English subtitles back in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great show with no subtitles, which were announced...","review":"info first, the announced subtitles are not on the discs...again, like on NUMBERS SERIES 2.no question, seeing veronica mars can you lead to an addiction of this series...all joking aside, this tv-show is one the few which is interesting for all age groups. the humor is fresh, a litte bit provoking and straight.the story is intelligent (you don't know until the end, who let the bus crash) and the actors are stunning especially Kristen Bell was born to play that part.The only negative aspect beside the missing (and announced) subtitles (producers, please, don't do that again, o.k.?) is the long time to get season 3.But, fortunately, there are some other good tv-shows to fill the waiting time before verconia mars is investigating again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No English subtitles for Deaf/Hard of Hearing???!!!!","review":"I love this show and watched season 1 over a weekend - I started season 2 and to my complete shock and bitter disappointment discovered there are no English subtitles for deaf/hard of hearing. only Seasons 1 and 3 have them.

Another slap in the face for the handicapped, boo, hiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no English subtitles?","review":"I rented Season 1 from the library to make sure I liked this series. I was hooked and it became my \\"workout\\" video. After completing Season 1, I bought all three seasons for my collection. I anxiously popped the first DVD from Season 2 into the machine to begin my usual workout and much to my dismay found that even though the shows are in English, the subtitles are only in Spanish and French. Season 1 and Season 3, however, have English subtitles, furthering confusing the issue of \\"what were they thinking?\\". What is with that? Considering it was intended to be my entertainment while I worked out on a treadmill (which is noisy), the lack of English Subtitles was significant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Season 1","review":"This season is wonderful, leaps and bounds better than the first, which was also phenomonal.

I buy many tv shows on DVD because I love the backstory. I want to hear why the producers and writers made the choices they did, I want to hear about the arcs and all the background on making a tv program. The extra with Kristen Bell was great but there were no commentaries. I am still a big fan of the show but there wasn't enough extra on the DVD set to warrant the price. I can record the show on TV and have pretty much the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the subtitles?","review":"I'm deliberately giving this release 1 star for one reason only. The DVDs do not include English subtitles. If you want to back up and figure out what someone mumbled, I hope you know Spanish or French.

Warner Brothers and CW will be getting a letter from me.It's a great show but they're not giving me or other hard of hearing/deaf fans the opportunity to enjoy season 2 as much as others do, so I'll go and spend my money on something I can actually watch and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veronica Herself!","review":"One of the most pleasant recent developments in the modern world is the availability of DVDs with entire seasons of TV shows.Veronica Mars is a true classic.The Neptune High kids are much nicer and kinder than they whereI went to High School but Veronica is a delight!Highly recommended unless you don't like smart, highly capable, attractive, young women."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't stop watching!","review":"I would stay up half the night watching episode after episode!

Second season was a huge disappointment. The mystery is extremely convoluted with a lot of plotlines that end up going nowhere. Season one was one of the best seasons of any television show ever because the character relationships were compelling and believable, the mini-mysteries each episode were fun, and the season-long mystery was brilliantly plotted out so we made progress each episode toward an extremely satisfying ending.In season two the dialogue is still sharp and the acting is good, so it's still kinda fun to watch. But the season-long mystery is a mess that gets so complicated you need a spreadsheed to keep up and the character relationships feel tired and phony. If you haven't watched this show, just get season one. If you've watched season one, be warned that you'll be disappointed by season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gasp!","review":"I cannot tell you how disgusted I was with this show!

It's funny, moving, and entertaining in a brilliantly foul mouthed and arrogant package.Along with Plastic Man and She-Hulk, this comic books bridges the gap between what comics are today and what they can be on their best day. Simply put Winik's work is genius and should be experienced by everyone who has ever picked up a comic book.I can't recommend this and every other Barry Ween collection enough to you.One side note, this is not intended for children in any way. Look for other alternatives, like Plastic Man or Power Pack for young reader appropriate choices that are still enteraining for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry Ween Rocks","review":"This is perhaps the funniest comic book I've read in a long time. Not since Bisley's Lobo have I laughed so hard and loud at comic characters. Barry Ween has a dry wit, and he lives in such an absurd world with oblivious adults and ignorant children. Barry possesses an unparalleled genius mind, and he gets wrapped up in bizarre adventures to the merriment of his friend Jeremy.

Rex Carroll (Whitecross guitarist) wanted to go in a different musical direction so he left. But to my surprise this CD really impressed me. It is different from Whitecross in that is is more like Night Ranger, Survivor & journey than Ratt. Believe me this cd has no fillers. It is the album that Scott Wenzel wanted to make.

Do not miss this cd it is awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly good","review":"While Don Dokken was never one of metal's strongest vocalists, he could always write good music. Even without Lynch, this record holds up with the best of Dokken's catalog. This is one of the better recoords of their career. They had a series of missteps that led to Lynch leaving the band. Levin holds his own with the best of them. This record is not terribly hard. It's rhythmic and melodic and it just plain rocks. Letter to Home is probably the most interesting song but not for the lyrics. Musically, it sounds like they put a sixties song and an eighties song in a blender. This is really good. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOKKEN Lives Again! With Music You Will Feel!","review":"I have to admit, I had almost given up on Don Dokken. But...He has put togethter his best sounding band line-up in years! DOKKEN is back, and the music is really good! I have always listened to the 80's version of Dokken, and this new Album takes us back to the best of what Dokken used to be. Great guitar and drum riffs will wake you up from the \\"Blink 182 and 311\\" stupor that we have been lulled into by the candy-assed radio industry for the past five years.

Everyone else has done that already. \\"Hell To Pay\\" is, in actual fact, a very well-written rock record with strong vocals and superb musicianship, regardless of who's involved. There isn't a weak track to be found. Listening to this over and over makes me apppreciate how important and relevant this band is to the their genre and todays music scene. \\"Hell To Pay\\" ranks high as one of the BEST rock releases this year. Do yourself a favor and give this record a chance. You will not be disappointed! Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"With all the 4 & 5 star reviews, I really got excited about this Dokken release. Just goes to show that the majority of people don't know what they are talking about. This album has like 2 or 3 OK songs. The rest is just incredibly boring and lifeless. I've listened to this album a few times in the hope of it growing on me. Didn't happen. It has way to many slow, melodic songs on it. That's a shame b/c the guitarist seems like he could hold his own with Lynch. Also, Don just seems to be bored and sedated. I remember when a Dokken album didn't have 1 filler song in the whole bunch. Even the songs that weren't singles were awesome. You could listen to the CD front to back and have a helluva ride. Since Back for the Attack, it seems that Dokken has been on a slow, sleep inducing downward spiral and that's disapointing. Don't even get me started on the disater called Shadowlife. At least I can take solace in the fact that I bought this used for around 4 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album sucks","review":"Im a dokken fan, but i tell you it seems their heyday really is over now. Lets face it, Dokken really needs an excellent guitarist and they just dont have those killer leads anymore. There are maybe two good songs on this album, Escape and The Last goodbye. The rest range from mediocre to bad. If you want to hear good Dokken, then Back for the Attack is as good as it gets, Under lock and key is pretty good as well, and the first Don Dokken solo album is great also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it Dokken or Brokken ?","review":"The old Dokken was better musics, this album is so Pop. Well, I never liked so much Dokken, but this album looks like Beatles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this album,Do not buy this album!","review":"This album is by far nowhere near as horrible as Shadowlife but compared to the excellent Erase the Slate and equally impressive Long Way Home this album is slow and boring.There is not one song on this album that rocks as hard as Sunless Days from Long Way Home.And the song Prozac Nation is about the worst song Dokken has ever recorded hands down.I know that Don and his band have better music in them and hopefully the next release will be better.If you want to hear stronger albums that have better rock songs and ballads get Erase the Slate and/or Long Way Home and save this cd for the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Farfel, farfel, pipick\\"","review":"A Hope comedy classic, ranking right up there with \\"Ghost Breakers\\". Bob's performance as Pipo Poppolino, \\"a miserable tailor's miserable apprentice\\", is almost flawless, and the supporting cast (Vicent Price as Casanova, the great Basil Rathbone as Luccio, Joan Fountain as the Widow Bruni, Hugh Marlow as the brother of the bride, Arnold Moss as the evil Doge of Venice, and brief appearances by Lon Chaney, Jr., John Carradine and Raymond Burr), is excellent. Hope is at his bumbling, cowardly best as the commoner impersonating Casanova, until he finds the courage to overcome the Doge and turn the tables on the devious Luccio. The sword fight scene and the finale (with Hope in hilarious drag) are side-splitters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casanova's Big Night the Review","review":"Casanova's Big Night was a hysterically funny movie. I have always enjoyed BoB Hope and Dorothy Lamore; but Joan Fontaine was a most worthy co-star in this comedy routine.In this movie BoB Hope plays a gentleman who really has nothing to offer in the royal presence he is in the midst of. I don't want to give away the entire story, but basically he has been asked to pretend he is the geat lover Casanova to woo the queen and save the country.It is a rare, in these times, to find a movie with comedy and cleanliness. I find myself constantly returning to the \\"fore fathers of comedy\\" to find something decent to laugh at. The is one of my first choices for family entertaiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"This is typical Bob Hope comedy at its best. It has a little of everything for everyone.

Honestly, I was really looking forward to some interesting tidbits about life on Patuisset Island which is a beautiful place. What a disappointment.If you don't toss this book in the can after the first two chapters, then you and I can respectfully disagree on our tastes. The chapter about his 'fear of dying' while crossing the Buzzards Bay Bridge is indicative of the entire book - the stories are so contrived it's laughable and his subsequent childhood reminisces seem aimed more at developing a framework for 'acting career' namedropping than for portraying actual memories of childhood at the beach.I'm quite sure Trafford Publishing made sure the author paid in full before printing a single page.What a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome imagery","review":"This book had some of the most novel ideas and though-provoking imagery I've seen in a while.

The music on this CD are beautifully played, but they aren't and won't be my favorite pieces. Mediocre pieces at best. If I get to preview this album on amazon, I won't have bought it.

When my mom bought the books and read them to us, I was transfixed. I re-read them several times and wondered at the courage and strength these amazing girls showed.

One stormy day she runs. This novel tells all about her adventure. You really need to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naya Nuki: Girl Who Ran, A Book Review","review":"When my teacher told the class that we were reading Naya Nuki: Girl who Ran I thought it was just going to be another ordinary book. Well, it turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read in school.Naya Nuki is a bold Native American from the Shoshoni tribe. She is captured by the Mattinae while on a hunting party and forced to walk across the prairie to the Mattinae's village. Naya Nuki makes an escape to her people. Read Naya Nuki: Girl Who Ran to find out if she make it or not.I think the author, Kenneth Thomasma, made the theme rather obvious in this book. I think it is \\"never give up.\\" Read this book and see if you agree with me. Kenneth Thomasma does a great job of describing the life of this young, determined Indian girl.So, if you want to learn more about Indian life this is the book for you.4th grader, Matthew Lambert."},{"rating":"1","title":"He says, she says.","review":"Much dialogue back & forthing, thin in the mystery dept.

It is rare that I consider a book a complete waste of time to have read, but such is the case with \\"Cozy\\". I found the dialogue, the characters, the \\"plot\\", the logic/illogic of the police and PI's sleuthwork ... all utterly maddening and absurd. At best, the book could stave off extreme boredom and provide a few moments of very mild amusement. At worst, the crime is not within the book, but the book itself. The four \\"glowing\\" reviews that precede mine completely baffle me and were surely written by Hall's family and/or publishing staff.

It works ok if two conditions are met:1) The cable has hard vinyl type insulation, and2) the conductor inside is perfectly centered and perfectly round.Unfortunately I was using 1/0 AWG cable with a thick rubbery insulator, and the strands were not perfectly round inside the cable. This lead to the not especially sharp blade dragging the cable rather than slicing it, and damaging many of the conductor strands. I was able to do a far better job with a simple jacknife blade.The description states \\"extra BLADES\\".

I tried to stay with the book thinking I would get into it more, but I didn't.

These are ALL photocopies that don't transfer worth anything to the page. All are black and white, some are absoluteley indecipherable. Surely in the original printing these were real photos; what happened?

As wonderful as SAS is, this book is even more thorough textually. Final rating: 4.65 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable","review":"This book, by the Janowsky's, is chock full of good advice. Unlike many of the genre there is much useful information given regarding being lost in the wilds. Additionally, often there is given more than one way of accomplishing a goal with the author's opinion as to the correct method. The diagrams, mostly, support the text, however, the photo's leave much to be desired. I would buy this book, in fact I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival","review":"Excellent book.

I played almost everyday taking son to pre-school, he can't speak yet. I like most of the songs and they are fun song. However, there are few songs in there I thought it was kinda weird. There's a catchy song about a cat that came back [...], it was kinda dark lyrics. Another song about not so nice stuff in army,[...], what are trying to teach the kid?

The first thing that really stood out was THEY ENJOYED MAKING THIS RECORD!! The material is excellent, the song structure and bluesy-country tones makes me yearn for the country. The backup vocal were especially good. The guitar work and supporting instrument work was far above their previous release.I've always been a big of JOC. Yeah, they had a couple of \\"not so shining moments\\" with The Eleventh Hour and Furthermore, but this is a definite HIGH! I truly enojyed: Trouble Is, Faith Enough, Show You Love, Lesser Things, I'm In The Way, My Heavenly and the remake of Lonely People. The rest is good too, but every song can't be a fav.In my opinion, this record should go platinum, like their predecessors. Welcome back JOC - it's been a long wait :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad album for Jars of Clay","review":"I found this album extremely boring. Now, I love what Jars of Clay did with their self-titled and Much Afraid. Who We Are Instead does not compare to the past in their lyrics and instrumentation. The first 6 songs I would not listen to in the car because they are so slow, and I will fall asleep. They have a folky/country sound in this album, without the stunning acoustic guitar and rhythm I am used to. I bought As I Left the Zoo and was horribly disappointed. I got this album, and yet again am longing for more. Repetitive lyrics, twangy sound-- I give this album 1/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of \\"Jars of Clay\\" and was in the habit of purchasing any new CD that would come out by these artists, without even a preview. I find them multi-talented and find their music to be uplifting as well as inspiring. I love their angel voices and their music. I bought the CD \\"Who we are instead\\" and I was most disappointed. The style, format, all were unlike their usual style of music. I hope that these wonderfully talented men will go back to style of music that many of us have been drawn to. I am not in the habit of making unfavorable comments however I felt led to share this personal insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am not a critic, so I will just be honest here...I have loved every other JOC album they have released, but this one, just isntmy style musically. It has a much more acoustical, folksy, countryish sound to it, and it was really hard for me to get into. I have always especially enjoyed JOC's more upbeat alternative rock sounding songs and found none of those on this album. All the songs are more contemplative, slower songs...nothing that really makes you want to tap your feet or sing at the top of your lungs. The lyrics are great as always. but the musical style on this one, just isn't quite up to par...If you are thinking about buying this one, and you like them becuase of their alternarock, upbeat sound, this one is probably not going to be one of your favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Jars of Clay...","review":"Honestly, when I first played this cd, I thought to myself, \\"Who on earth is THIS?\\" This is NOT the Jars that we know. I'm not sure if they decided to go country, or if they all suddenly got depressed, but this cd is awful in comparison to their earlier releases. I truly am disappointed; they used to have this fantastic harmonizing/slightly edgy sound that was really moving. This cd is mostly ballads and songs I'd rather not listen to. I guess I'll just have to stick with Much Afraid and their first release. Sorry, Jars, but honestly, what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of Jars of Clay, but this album didn't do a lot for me. I thought \\"Love in Any Language\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" were both good songs, but they didn't grab me like the songs from their 11th Hour album. The cover of \\"Lonely People\\" is maybe better than the original - screaming to be done in this new acoustic, almost bluegrass-y feel. But (and there always seems to be one), the rest of the album was really uninspiring to me. The Jars of Clay debut album was the perfect fusion of their great acoustic sound with challenging lyrics, but this album just doesn't compare. Although The 11th Hour had a very modern rock feel to it, but by taking back the artistic oversight of the production, Jars was really able to put their own soul back into the music. 11th Hour took me back to excitement I had for the band when the debuted. This album didn't take me back to anything but my older cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music that isn't available","review":"I have a Mac and my entire music collection is on I Tunes. To many conflicting programs confuses my 60+ mind. I assumed, incorrectly which I quickly found out, that the Amazon MP-3 could not be downloaded into I Tunes; where I have about 500 ablums already. So... I haven't heard the recording by Jars of Clay yet to review, but I will definately give Amazon a 0 star rating on the incompatability of their MP-3's with I Tunes. I think you are losing some of the older generation Mac users."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Surprise","review":"Ever since a friend gave me a copy of their self-titled album back in 1995, I've been a fan. I LOVED Much Afraid, loved most of If I Left the Zoo, and was not impressed by the majority of The Eleventh Hour. I just saw them in concert at the beginning of this month (soulFest in New Hampshire) and was amazed that they had some new songs that were GOOD. So I bought this album and Redemption Songs.Show You Love is my favorite song on the album. It's cachy, sweet, and VERY Jars. If you liked their Much Afraid album, you'll love this song. The chorus is I'm gonna show you love in every language/I'm gonna speak with words that need no form/I'm gonna give you what you never had before. Dan's poetic lyrics merge so well with the music.Sunny Days has to be my second favorite... it's got a nice hook.The whole album is pleasnt to listen to in general, and I'd put it up there with their first 2 albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done it again!","review":"Being a Jars fan, I didn't know what to expect. They always come up with something fresh. Before getting Who we are Instead, I went to their website and listened to the clips. I was not impressed. I wasn't even planning on getting the album it just so happens it was a gift. I stuck it in my car CD player and I think it'll stay there for a while. I guess you can say I \\"grew\\" into it ( just like I've done with most of their albums). At firt it was a \\"yuck\\", then a \\"hmm, not bad\\", not it's more like a sing along. I think it's got more of a If I Left the Zoo flavor (blues and such) The only reason I took off a star is because of the Country influence on some of the songs. Once again, they've produced some excellent music! Oh, have you heard their arrangement to Peek's \\"Lonenly People\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but...","review":"I have to admit I am a big fan of Jars of Clay. Their lyrics are so honest, deep, and effective to me. Their musical style is also right up my alley, simplistic oddity. Although \\"Jars of Clay,\\" their debut, is a classic, it isn't my favorite. My personal opinion is that their best album remains \\"If I Left The Zoo.\\"One thing that kind of is irking me about Jars is the tendency they have to write melancholy songs. Don't get me wrong, they do it oh so bittersweetly! It's great when you're in the mood or feeling the same sentiments. But their leaning toward the sadder/mopey side of things is getting a little old with me.I think that \\"Who We Are Instead\\" is on my 'best Jars CDs' list. Despite its return to the heavyhearted nature of past albums, it is very catchy and a good listen. There are slight and miniscule hints of gritty country-ish sounds in some songs and I like it.I would say that if you consider yourself a fan this album is definitely necessary to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop, Won't stop","review":"Jars of Clay is one of the few bands that I can follow throughout there career. They evolve enough to be different each album, yet are still able to catch that platinum sound. The best song on the album hands down for me is Jealous Kind. But all the songs on here are completely listenable. Excellent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to Rock!!!PLEASE!!!","review":"I don't ever like dissing a good band and that is exactly what Jars of Clay are, besides being class acts they have made some great music, enjoyable to all people. But this acoustic/mellow/folk thing has to go. I commend them for trying something new, but the majority of this CD is boring, i like only 3 songs. The single \\"lonely people\\" was an excellent song and would fit well on a typical rock album as a taste of something different. The lyrics \\"taste the silver cup... Ride that highway in the sky\\" seem kind of empty though. All in all im sure some would love this disc, but i was HUGE fan of the eleventh hour and want that rock, aggressive style back. Just one guy's opinion though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good exploration of sanctification","review":"Who we are Instead is the best album Jars of Clay has released since their first one, or at least since Much Afraid. The album is an exploration of sanctification, and living as a Christian in a secular world and a secular church. The songs on there explore everything from our tendency to forget the Gospel (Trouble Is) to loneliness (Lonely People) to trust (Sing). Humorously enough, I sort of think of this album as the little brother of Caedmon's Call's 40 Acres (which was an exploration of salvation and justification).Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to my first Review?!","review":"Reviewed this movie at length once already.... I am looking forward to more Rarescope releases based on this first purchase. A serious positive (for me) is that it is in the orginally Mandarin format (with subtitles).

They actually look better than the picture and look considerably better than the plastic ones offered by RV accessory suppliers. In addition, they hold more and are half the price!

Extremely hard to assemble.","review":"All the parts were there, thats about all the good I have to say about this mess of a drawer. Cheap? Yes! Very poor instructions? Absolutely! A mess to assemble? Darn right! I assemble a lot of mail order furniture and this little drawer has been one of the most awful to deal with. Directions make so sense. Drawings are not accurate. Basically its hit and miss. And after assemble is painfully completed, the drawer is very noisy to operate, metal scraping against metal, and not sturdy at all, plus very ugly. Usually drawer slider guides are plastic coated for quiet operation, but not these sliders.

Price has gone up about $25. I just plug it in and turn it on anywhere I receive a satelite signal! Also works great with my laptop and Sansa mp3 player. Battery life with rechargeables has been impressive. Dual speaker system has limited controls though - just on/off, volume up/down, and enhanced stereo mode buttons. One improvement would be for Creative to include a power adapter. There's a jack, but the power adapter doesn't come with it. If a power adapter was included, I'd have rated it a 5-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"on this book, unless you wish to follow the mindless politically correct rewritten version of history that you find pretty much everywhere these days. I am a teacher, a historian, and a woman whose ancestors fought proudly for the Union Army. That said, I recognize this book for what it is. If you're really looking for something historically accurate, then you would better spend your money on books which detail - even for this age group - the War Between the States in much more realistic and honest terms. They are out there. Though I'm not quite as passionate as some of the reviewers below, I agree with their sentiment entirely. This book is simply fluff with almost no historical value - actually, it's worse than that, because it does perpetuate false stereotypes. It's especially bad because it's done in the guise of educational fiction.

Northerners didn't give a damn about slaves, and some Northerners kept slaves as well.Lincoln even used the issue of enslavement to gain popularity for the Union to make the Confederate states look bad. \\"If I could save the nation by freeing all the slaves I would do it, and if I could save the nation without freeing any slave I would do it\\" ~ Abraham Lincoln"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Book","review":"This book is nothing but propaganda.

I've been a large fan of KISS since '76 and stayed with them through the 80's. I think Gene and company lost their way though some 10+ years ago. And this solo is proof. I didn't expect a \\"KISS\\" album here, but shame on you Gene, for scraping the bottom of the barrel on this one. Probably why we haven't seen any solo work from you in the past 5 years. Abysmal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's over Gene, face it you ahole","review":"What a waste of time and effort. What are you thinking?You invented Kiss!! for Goodness sakes. Your making a mockery of the band and your self. Don't bother with this one folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage...","review":"I've been a hardcore Kiss fan for many years, but I'm not the least bit biased in my review. The title of the CD alone pretty much sums up Gene Simmons to the letter! In plain English, this is the work of a greedy, middle-aged egomaniac trying to sow whatever wild oats he has left, and bleeding his fans dry in the process. I'm really glad I decided to listen to it first, because after that, I wouldn't have bought this piece of crap with someone else's money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene Simmons - The Retard Sessions","review":"How could one describe this album? Well, for starters, we can remind ourselves how much Gene Simmons mocked the 78 solo album effort by former band mate Peter Criss. Then we can put this cd in and ask ourselves if this guy is serious.. Let us conclude by saying that Gene puts no effort into the vocals on this album whatsoever.. he sings through his nose most of the time and sounds like a flat old man. The music sounds like Gene hired a bunch of wasted hippies off the street who just banged and slammed out some crappy chords. And the background vocals, well.. they sound like a bunch of retards screeching and moaning behind the rest of the jumbled mess. It was Gene who said that there was a sucker born every minute and I think this album was put out just to turn a quick buck from the suckers who bought it. This album must have been thrown together in a week or less and then flung out into the market.. and I must say, the crappy rush job shows in the final product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sounds like it came from his A**hole !!!","review":"I've heard better flatulance !! This album is just awfull. Definatly not a KISS album. I can't tell if he's trying to make political statments, getting ready for a Vegas career, or getting ready to write songs for Britney Spears. On one song I think he's even trying to rap!! I'm hoping I can sell back my CD before word of this record gets out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better.","review":"This is a damn good album. But it could've kicked ass. A**Hole is an odd album. I think Gene was trying to be more modern. But that's not how people like him. They like the 1977 toungue wagging, bloob spitting, fire breathing demon. Don't get me wrong this is still a good listen but i was disappointed. But the title track is great. Black toungue is also a great track. But most of the songs on this album aren't very catchy. You should buy it but don't put it at the top of your list. I suggest his 1978 solo effort. Now that's a frigin good album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"this a very embarassing cd. gene is trying very hard to be current, but hes only caught up to 1993. i didnt think it could get any worse than \\"carnival of souls\\" but wow...there isnt even close to one good track on this, and the lack of effort put in makes me wonder why a solo album was even necessary anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic...Interesting...Fun.","review":"If you are entertained by music (and a KISS fan would help), this is a good listen.

Kiss has gone through every trend from disco to rap to recently wearing make-up on stage, but now we're back to where only the strong survive: the man Gene Simmons is leading Kiss into the new millineum! \\"If I Had a Gun\\" is a great follow up to \\"Love Gun\\"; \\"Dog\\" does \\"Beth\\" one better: no Peter Criss! Utter trash like \\"Two Timer\\" and \\"She\\" is revamped with a 2004 Groove in barn burners like \\"Sweet and Dirty Love\\" and \\"Shandi\\". \\"Firestarter\\" has got to be the best cover since \\"And Then She Kissed Me\\".

Whatever money hungrey loser ok'd this (...) to be released and put out in stores outta be drug out in the middle of nowhere and not only verbially abused but physcially as well. I simply cant get over how just straight up BAD this is. Kiss never had a lick of talent anyway and now he has the gaul to go and do a solo record.

This is the best album I have ever heard. I cried at the end. A pure masterpiece. Don't listen to what these other goofballs say. Gene is one of the best lyrcists of our time.

Through the years I have followed his carreer closely and some of the projects that Mr. Simmons has done over the years are not likely to have made him even richer than he already is. Last Xmas I got the KISS-Symphony DVD from my girlfriend and that I have to say was one magnificent musical masterpiece. In my mind, a full throttle KISS in make up Live on stage is the ultimate rock and roll experience anyone can ask for. When I got Gene's new solo album I was excited and open minded but after listening to it I have to say that this must be the lowest that the 'God of thunder' has went in his whole musical carreer. As a true KISS and Gene fan, I feel it is my duty to say what first comes to my mind after listening to this album, shame on you Mr. Simmons!Regards,Hjalti S.

What on Earth was going through Gene's head when he was making this? I know what I've just put down must've been said by many other reviewers, but for God's sake, this is the blood-drooling, hell-raising demon guitarist in KISS!All this does is show how much of a dollar-chaser Mr. Simmons is! All of the songs here sound like jokes, okay, Gene knows how to make fun music and also knows how to HAVE fun, but c'mon! THIS???In KISS he was brilliant! He, Paul Stanley, and, well...thingy & thingy always knew how to make excellent glam-rock music! But none of that is shown here!Oh, and by the way, I DO know that it was Peter Chris & Ace Frehley who were the two other original member's of the band, but since then I could care less about how many drummers and guitarists they went through as the years went on.Buy some KISS albums instead fellow CD buyer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"No solo KISS album except Paul Stanley's first one and Ace Frehleys have been any good. That still stands true this sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, an album worthy of comparison with Peter Criss' Works!","review":"...And would you believe Gene's album is even worse than anything Peter has put out? That type of BAD takes dedication, money and ego to bring to life. What's worse is that we can blame Peter's bad albums on alcohol, drugs, go, lack of money, lack of songwriting skills, and an ego to rival Donald Trump's. But since Gene does not do drugs, does not drink, has plenty of money, and has written some very good KISS songs in the past, the only equalizer here is the EGO. KISS is not equal to the sum of its parts. Without KISS, all 4 members are but pale and weak components of what once was the greatest band in the world, and one that is very dear to me. This is to music what Gene's viral sex tape was to video: Embarrassingly BAD, and outrageously funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???????????","review":"I usually like to remain a lil classy in my reviews but all I can say is Gene sounds like he was taking a dump when he recorded this.I've made better music stubbing my toe!Please don't buy this...show there is hope for the music industry.Even Paul Stanley alluded to the fact that this album was crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got screwed....","review":"All I can say is I'm truly shocked and dumbfounded by this record. I got screwed out of 16 bucks - plain and simple. It's truly amazing what a turd this disc turns into, and while you're listening to it, in fact!! It starts out well enough; Sweet & Dirty Love, Firestarter, and Weapons of Mass Destruction are pretty decent tunes... Now, keep in mind that Firestarter is NOT an original - it's a tune from \\"The Prodigy\\" and in fact - sounds almost *identical* to the original version. But it's tolerable... Then, the disc turns into some kind of sick joke with Waiting for the Morning Light, only Gene is serious when he sings it. The next track, Beautiful, isn't. And then by the time you're put thru that torment you get to the title track and you just CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE!

But not this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene, Gene, Gene...","review":"Where can I start about this cd? First of all it sounds like Gene did the album in 24 hours. Second of all he is trying to be current. Third all Gene wants is a BUCK! I LOVE KISS! To me they are the greatest rock n roll band ever (beside Led Zeppelin). But Genes new solo album seems like all he wants is to make more, more, and more money. That man trys to do anything just for a buck. Now don't get me wrong, I love Gene, but he needs to start focusing on the music again instead of the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sh*t from an a**hole","review":"I would give this album NO STARS (if that were possible).What was Gene thinking when he put out this album? Who would buy this album if not loyal Kiss fans - yet with this horrific offering, Gene seems to be mocking them. The lyrics are idiotic and ridiculous, insulting to anyone's intelligence. The music itself is uninspired, monotonous, and downright bizarre. It is not at all clear what audience he was aiming at. Apparently not Kiss fans! Although I hate to completely condemn anything, I can find no redeeming value in this work. It is a piece of garbage. The album title and song of the same name really say it all!Just like all Gene $immons' RiP-OFF waste of time and money projects he sells (*ie: KiSS merchandise, magazines, TV cartoons, movies, books, etc.) ...this SUCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really awesome job by Mr. Simmons.","review":"I'm a huge KISS fan and I was looking forward to this album from Gene, and I just got home with it. I think it is one of the best albums of the year. It has everything from heavy rock to soft rock ballads. The highlights of the album are \\"Sweet and Dirty Love\\", \\"Firestarter\\", \\"WOMD\\", \\"WFTML\\", \\"***Hole\\",\\"Black Tongue\\", \\"Carnival Of Souls\\" and \\"1,000 Dreams\\" ( equipped with Steel guitars!!) Thanks Gene for this awesome album that I will be listening to for years to come. Also Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer play on 2 of the songs, \\"Sweet and Dirty Love\\" and \\"WOMD\\". Bobby Dylan also wrote WFTML with Gene. The late Frank Zappa is featured on his song Black Tongue and it has the Zappa family band plus Frank's vocals and original riffs. Buy this album NOW! You will not be disappointed, a KISS / Gene Simmons fan or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad!! But better than his first attempt","review":"I wasn't expecting Kiss, I wasn't even expecting a good solo album from Gene - and I was still dissapointed, it's better than his first solo album(which really sucked) Do not buy this unless you hear it first and like it. Gene is once again trying to sellout. I think the title track was written by a 2nd grade retard. If anything, Kiss needs to make another album. The best song on the cd is one written by Frank Zappa. Gene is no songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Review","review":"I love this CD.However anyone expecting a Kiss sound,DON\\"T.It's similar to his 78 solo album in that there is a wide range of music styles.I found the title track to be hilarious.It's just Gene being Gene.What else could a fan ask for,besides a new Kiss CD of course"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait until his GENE SIMMONS 100 boxed set comes out","review":"That'll b 100 more songs that we could make fun of ....I am a ninja"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crotch Creature","review":"A couple of songs on this Cd are OK but most are pretty bad.

It's not even worth downloading for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you!!!","review":"No, it doesn't sound like a KISS album. WOW! It isn't a KISS album, it's Gene Simmons' SOLO album!!! (MORONS!) Some of these reviewers need to figure this out. The only two songs on it I don't care for are Wepons of Mass Destruction and Carnival of Souls. Sorry but the \\"Round and round it goes\\" sung off key by the background singers is terrible. \\"If I had a gun\\" might be the best song on this album. \\"A**hole\\" is great and so is Firestarter. So, this is not a KISS album (DUH!) but it's pretty good. And why would you say Peter Criss is better? Play \\"That's the kind of sugar that papa likes\\" off his 1978 solo album. Pure CR*P!!!

The rest is lame","review":"I say the song \\"Firestarter\\" is a classic great song, but 1 song doesnt make an album, the rest is just loud trash.But the one song \\"Firestarter\\" is better than ALL of the songs on th new KiSS album \\"Sonic Boom\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honesty from a huge Kiss fan","review":"I've been a huge Kiss fan since 1977. So, forget all other reviews, I'm about to tell you the 100% truth. Put the CD in, press play, and the first song \\"Sweet And Dirty Love\\" will totally kick your ass. This should have been recorded by Kiss. Second, \\"Firestarter\\"...a little bizarre but decent. Third, \\"Weapons Of Mass Destruction\\"...the heaviest song Gene has ever done, and it's good. THE REST OF THE CD IS F**KING HORRIBLE!!! As a Kiss fan, songs 4-13 are embarrassing! As a footnote...the two extra songs on the Japanese release are very good songs. It's a shame that most people won't hear them. They should have been on the American release and replaced two of the crappy songs. Gene was my childhood hero, but, by NO means, do I recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"To quote songs from the CD (and I use the word CD loosely)","review":"\\"If I Had a Gun\\" I'd shoot myself if I paid for this CD. I apologize to anyone who bought it, but I think Gene is trying to say if you bought this CD you're an \\"A**hole\\" and every time you look at the CD, it will remind you of that.A sample of the wonderful, deep and thought provoking lyrics on this \\"If I had a gun, I'd have me some fun.\\" My 2 year old daughter can write better lyrics.I'm VERY disappointed, Demon. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"what do you expect?","review":"I'm ashamed to say I was once a very big fan of Kiss. Gene Simmons is the reason I'm now ashamed of that fact. If you've bothered to watch any of the interviews or monitor Gene's activities over the past six years, you know that he's made it blatantly obvious that he cares about one thing only, and that is taking other people's money. He put this album out knowing that enough die-hard Kiss fans would buy it to put some more money in his pocket. He doesn't care about the fans, and obviously never has. He's taken what was once my childhood inspiration and reduced it to a crude reference to the human anatomy. Thanks, Gene. Your selfishness has made me appropriately suspicious in this day and age."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got screwed....","review":"All I can say is I'm truly shocked and dumbfounded by this record. I got screwed out of (...) - plain and simple. It's truly amazing what a turd this disc turns into, and while you're listening to it, in fact!! It starts out well enough; Sweet & Dirty Love, Firestarter, and Weapons of Mass Destruction are pretty decent tunes... Now, keep in mind that Firestarter is NOT an original - it's a tune from \\"The Prodigy\\" and in fact - sounds almost *identical* to the original version. But it's tolerable... Then, the disc turns into some kind of sick joke with Waiting for the Morning Light, only Gene is serious when he sings it. The next track, Beautiful, isn't. And then by the time you're put thru that torment you get to the title track and you just CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE! I mean this disc truly saps your will to live.I guess what I'm trying to say is - save your money and buy some WASP or Rob Zombie or ANYTHING ELSE... But not this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten to the core....","review":"Anyone else buying into his ego? I, like the rest of you are probably HUGE Kiss fans & were figuring not to get another Kiss-type record from his solo project, but this is the most lackluster offering I've ever heard. Worse than Carnival of Souls or This Left Feels Right by Bon Jovi. I have to give it 1 star just to bring the overall rating as much as possible. If you are dumb enough to buy this, buy it here, because it's cheaper on CD Universe. Might as well go big & waste your money along with your time listening to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene $immons","review":"If you're a Gene Simmons fan, you have to know what you're gonna get as far as a solo record goes; a big, egocentric mess of an album. To me, this one has the same vibe as his first solo album in 78'...it's just Gene being Gene. If you want to hear strong songwriting from Gene, listen to the first few records or Creatures of the Night. It is what it is. I have a feeling Paul's solo album will be a lot stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truely made me ill","review":"Wow. I borrowed this CD from my brother, who found it used for like $2. I knew it was going to be bad, but I could not possibily have imagined how bad. I'll be right back.... I have to vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Gene, No more solo albums, just stay in the Brothel","review":"well at least the album cover is cute , because the songs on this are aweful. I was so disapointed by Gene's solo album. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the KISS albums. So my expectations were minimal at best, but I at least expected to like it.This album is so bad that I found myself wondering if Gene himeself ever listen to it before he put it out. I mean this album is embarassing.I did like the title track. Bit the rest of the album was a disaster.this album isn't artistic, it isn't inspiring, and most of all it isn't even any good.In the mid-to-late 1980's Ace Frehley embarked on a solo career with his band called \\"Frehley's Comet\\" that was rediculed by Gene Simmons. Although Frehley's comet wasn't all that bad, they weren't really great either. But as mediocre as Frehley's Comet was, Gene's album is so bad that it makes Ace Frehley's Comet look like Devine Greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so bad at all, but very uneven..","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that this album apparently was put together in a rush. It's very uneven and has some weird choice of songs.Anyway, if one puts aside all the JUSTIFIED prejudice against this self-proclaimed greedy and nasty man, at least we'll see that he did not try to release a KISS album, but an album with a lot of differente material. More often than not, the result was a tragedy, but a few good tracks survived here. Nothing enough, be advised, to spend your money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A**hole, smells like s**t to me.","review":"WOW, what a sorry excuse for an album. Gene is clearly out of control. The $ sign has taken control of this once rock legend. Now let me say, I am a HUGE KISS fan. I had the honor of seeing KISS on the first farewell tour with Ace and Peter, front row center. However, much like KISS of today, this album is nothing like what KISS was in the 70's. Gene needs to take off the make up, hang up the bass, and spend his time counting his money, and staring at Ms. Tweed."},{"rating":"1","title":"genes cocky ego strikes again!","review":"worthless album! everything on here is a complete waste of time,no wonder kiss is putting out such lame albums these days,gene is way to obsessed with himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly an....","review":"Gene Simmons tries to build a fanbase beyond KISS with this attempt to please several demographics at once... although it seems none of this has anything to do with KISS (he already has that market cornered)... so what do we have here? when the title track and first single is an industrial cover it tells you plenty about what this will be like... gene's voice is suited toward that genre of music but who really wants to hear an old rockstar doing things that people like trent reznor and the prodigy can't really pull off anymore... most of the disc consists of MOR ballads and soft music for soft men... terrible... there are a couple of signs of life on the record but they are few and far between...much better to listen to the current stars that are creating this music rather than hearing gene making carbon copies in order to keep his career going beyond KISS... a mid-life crisis in digital sound... and a boring one at that...badlatino"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to hang it up.","review":"Poor singing, poor sound quality. I'm a Kiss fan, but I have to be honest. This is one of the worst performances I've ever heard. Gene's solo album from 1978 blows this one away. Gene's a good business man, but he is exposed as a musical fraud. I think I'll save my money for Paul Stanley's solo album. Maybe Paul will record his in a real studio instead of a cheap tape recorder. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the......?","review":"what we've got here is a failure to communicatei was hoping for a cd like sabbath's iommi's cd u know have a bunch of metal artists guest on your cd making metal sound great...nope instead we've got thisgene..26 years of waiting and you still are tryin that wish upon a star stuff...maybe the other kiss guys will put out something cool"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Ran It's Course...","review":"It pains me to say this, but I think Larry David's clamouring for storylines here.I'm a huge fan, and maybe I was caught up in all of the rave reviews I've read elsewhere, but I feel massively let-down.Having said that, I've only watched the first three episodes, but there hasn't been a single laugh-out-loud moment for me so far... Just the occasional chuckle at Larry's 'incidents'. But even then, it's a little bit obvious when the punchlines come.What I'd give for another episode like the one where he gets his managers daughter drunk; 'I thought she had a speech impediment.' Or the episode where Larry finds out his mum's dead... Pure comedy genius.I see nothing of that here, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"back to his roots","review":"after a lacklustre season four as funny as it was it didn't make its mark for me ,but now larry is back offending just about everybody. This is a pretty pretty pretty pretty good thing in this day of global conservatism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Bowl of Wrong","review":"This is the season where it all goes off the tracks. The subtle genius of the previous seasons is out the window. It was to Season 1-4 what the Mad TV sketch was to CYE in general. Larry almost ceases to be a human being in Season 5. He's not just insensitive, or refuses to suffer fools gladly, he's socially retarded. He does things that no SANE person-- not merely no politically correct person-- would do. In previous years, he's the one who's put upon at least half the time, here, it's over the top self parody of a guy with the social graces of a warthog. There are about 2 episodes funny enough to make seasons 1-4, the rest just don't work. They have a certain can't take your eyes off the train wreck quality, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Has Not Arrived...","review":"I ordered this dvd on November 4th.

As far as the DVD itself the fifth season of Curb is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you've seen -- and liked -- the show first","review":"If you're a fan of CYE, then you will likely enjoy this DVD set, and this review won't be very useful to you.However, if you don't know much about the show and find yourself on this page, my suggestion is that you watch a few episodes first (it airs on HBO). Chances are, you'll like it, but I recommend you do check it out first as it's not for everyone. Larry David's dry sense of humor has won over tons of fans everywhere, but lots of people get aggravated and want to punch him through their television set (count me in that bunch).As everything in TV and movies, some will like it and some won't, but this guy stirs up more dislike than most, so go ahead and make up your mind about the show before picking this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Larry David moment.","review":"I didn't want to rate this because it's not the quality of Larry David's comedy that is an issue. Actually, we had to laugh at the appropriate nature of this DVD glitch. I gave this set to my son-in-law, (whose name is David), and when he tried to play the second DVD, he learned that although the labels say \\"DISC 1\\" and \\"DISC 2\\", they are actually both the same disk. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning the discs in the hopes that this is not just a typical Larry David joke and that there really are two different discs. Can't you imagine him turning this into a detail on one of his new episodes? It's great to have access to a season of programs, but this is taking deja vu too far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Show","review":"Larry David manages to do it again. Every time I watch this show I laugh uncontrollably. If you like the past seasons, you will definitely like this season as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Change of Pace","review":"I was worried that this show was getting too predictable. After all it seems to cycle through Larry getting in trouble for some awkward reason, someone getting pissed at him and then he's forced to apologize in his own way. I thought this season picked up when Richard has to get a kidney transplant. You already know that Larry won't want to give it to him but it's fun to see how it plays out.If you're ready for more of the good comedy we saw in season 1 and 2, pick up season 5.Oh and the cameo of Dustin Hoffman in the finale totally surprised me. I kept saying \\"Is that Dustin Hoffman?. I think it is\\" and it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not nearly as bad as the naysayers tell you. Don't Listen!","review":"3.5 stars is more like it, but there aren't any half ratings. I've been a HUGE Curb fan for a while now and do not understand all the criticism heaped at the show this season. Last season, I would have understood. But Curb came back in a big way for its 5th season. The 4th was ruined imo by the Producers storyline which really didn't fit the show at all. But this 5th season, though maybe not as good as anything done in the first 3 seasons, still had me laughing quite a bit. I'm hoping Larry doesn't take to heart the criticism of the addle-brained (probably many of the same people who denigrated the unfairly cancelled Lisa Kudrow vehicle \\"The Comeback\\" before giving it a fair shot). And there's no word yet on whether or not there will be a 6th season, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I usually roll on the floor laughing with this show, but this season offered only a few really good laughs.

(and apparently this series is not quite at \\"the end\\" yet after all...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The definition of situational comedy","review":"If you enjoyed seasons 1-4, there's no reason to stop there. Larry and the crew provide more laughs than one thought possible. The low point of the season may be the goofy season finale, but at the same time, it makes sense they would do what they did and it is in fact, quite comical. In contrast, I think that Kamikaze Bingo may be the highlight of the series. Between wishing for a man in a coma to die, being angry that his sandwich has capers, and accusing \\"you people\\" of being to loud and obnoxious, this season is a great ride. And the moral of the story is that you should invite sex offenders over on the holidays. Go get your copy and watch Chicken Teriyaki Boy in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry Rules","review":"I really envy people who get to enjoy shows like this in a straight run through after the hype dies down. Shows like Curb, along with it's dramatic HBO equal The Sopranos, suffer unfairly by fans who overhype them in their minds. Once the smoke clears they can be appreciated for what they are.This season of Curb is no exception to that theory. When it was on, people blasted it. Now it can be seen just as cringe worthy & hilariously uncomfortable as previous seasons. Stand out episodes include The Larry David Sandwich, The Bowtie, The Christ Nail, Kamikazee Bingo, The Ski Lift, & The End (if they really wanted to stop the show with this episode it would be the perfect ending).If you've never seen Curb though, do yourself a favor & go back & watch it from the beginning. Get to know the Larry character. He has to grow on you. You may love him, you may hate him, but either way you still may have a good laugh. Enjoy! Being uncomfortable has never been funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cheap Imitation of an \\"Album\\"","review":"The recording engineers apparently placed some microphones around a hall, where Rieu and a handful of musicians were performing, and obtained a cheap (in terms of costs to the producers and in terms of quality of the music and sonics) so-called album for Rieu fans.

I have read the books by Steven Lawhead (that these CD's are supposed to be based on) The Song Of Albion, three times though and I did not get the idea of music like this. The Song Of Albion invokes in the reader a feel for true Celticness and mysticism and with these Cd's you find yourself flung not into the Steven Lawhead Otherworld, but more into that of Xena, Warrior Princess. Not good.

Within two or three months, the battery will be worn out to the point that it will give me a low battery signal when I've been talking for 1/2 hour or less. And (presumably because they need to be replaced so often), I have had difficulty finding the replacements - even on the Panasonic website. I am going to replace this phone soon. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery is AWFUL and phone too complicated","review":"I've had this phone for over a year and the battery life is awful. It has a very short battery life; it will go dead during a conversation even though the handset says it is fully charged. It is also too complicated and scrolls through the menu very slowly. Panasonic's customer service was poor. This phone is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I don't get why other reviewers rate this phone 5, 4 or even 2 stars... This phone and its \\"brothers\\" (silver & white color) are just good looking and with some kind of good reception, BUT, the BATTERY is useless, it doesn't work for more than 20 minutes of conversation, or if you leave it out the charger, it will loose its charge in 3-4 hours max. You tell me, a phone is useful if its battery is dead? Noooooo.. Unless you like to talk and hear over the speaker phone..I hate to be the only one who rates this product like this, but, what can I say, it is USELESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stock up on extra replacement batteries!","review":"A friend of mine bought this phone and raved about it. So, I purchased the same one. I had to return the phone within two days of purchase because I thought the phone had a defect. The low battery - recharge alert beeped almost every time I was on the phone for more than one hour, even if the phone had just been sitting on the charger for ten+ hours. So, I brought the phone back and got another {same model and such - remember, I thought it was a product defect}. Needless to say, I ran into the same problem with the new replacement phone. The battery life on the KX-TG2593B is way BELOW expectations. The other problem has to do with the delete function on the answering system. If you hit the delete button accidently while listening to a message, the message is GONE. There is no way to retrieve it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE...PHONE INTERFERES WITH WIRELESS NETWORK","review":"I purchased two of these at the same time and they work perfectly EXCEPT they know out my wireless (WiFi)computer network every time they are used.

So, wireless network users beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Panasonic's Best","review":"Positives? Good cordless sound quantity even at greater distances.Negatives? The mic on the speaker-phone is reported as sounding like I'm speaking through a long tunnel, there is no MUTE on the speaker-phone, battery talk-time is only about 90 to 120 minutes daily, and saving numbers into the directory is much hardware than their older single-line cordless phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and Readable Review of Composition Theory","review":"I have found this book to be well received by students preparing to teach HS English classes, as well as people already in the classroom. It covers thoroughly all the major aspects of composition theory in a succint and careful way, with lots of examples and good bibliography. For anyone who really wants to know what we have learned from comp theory in the last 25 years, this is a good book. It is not a how-to, and does not offer detailed ideas for the classroom; it is based on principles and research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple","review":"The problem with this book is that it takes a fairly simple approach to teaching writing, even though teaching writing is quite complicated and difficult. Also, the book doesn't say enough about ESL writers or writers with dialects. Finally, I couldn't find any discussion of the fact that writing skills in our schools have declined even as research in writing has increased.

I installed it on my 1979 GMC 4x4 snow plow. The pump worked through the winter as advertised. Just guessing, I would say I used the pickup about 10 times through the winter X 1 hour per use = 10 hours running time. This spring I unhooked the plow and parked the pickup. Next time I went to start the PU (2 weeks later) my trusty GMC would not start. After much checking, I finally realized that this pump had stopped working. Took it off and tested and retested -- it sports an internal rattle (when connected to 12 volt DC) and it no longer sucks. The pump is 'kaput', no doubt about it. For me, this pump was a bad investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd like to give it 10 stars","review":"I arrived at this page somewhat by accident.

Henry Mcgee Is Not Dead is my favorite of the November Man books and that is high praise indeed as every single book is exceptional.

The book is geared towards faux finishers more than muralists. The simplicity of Dostal's techniques are admirable. I felt the design of this book a bit distracting (a lot of pics are angled and surrounded by dotted cut-out lines????), although there is a good amount of information scattered about, especially in regard to material usage. I was most dissapointed with the void of finished, whole room photos. The obvious staged and propped beauty shots lack inspirational value.

I think it is the worse book I have read in my entire life. Some of the writing was just letter thrown together. There was not real filling out of the characters from the movie nor was there anything to fill out the missing details of the society that the movie is centered around. I have to say that I think that the money I spent on this book was a waste as is the paper it was written on other than what not to do when writing a tie in novel or any novel for that matter. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they need a negative example. Watch the movie a few times or read the script it is online.

This product could be awesome, but Janis Boehm should attempt to update the size of the book to a 12 x 12 format. Okay, so it was designed in 1997 before 12 x 12 was a standard size. But if the opportunity arises, consider tweaking the design. If all of the original non-12 x 12 books are sold out, considering changing the size between production-runs.I'm impressed with the graphic design of this book, but structurally it could be improved upon to allow the pages to lie flat and to allow for non-side loading page protectors.

Articulate and fairly well written, as you would expect, and not without some self-deprecating humor (e.g., his one liner about introducing himself as a \\"southern baptist preacher\\" to squash unwanted in-flight conversations). However the logic behind most of the arguments is breathtakingly twisted and full of non-sequiturs. The title is accurate to be sure, most of these \\"truths\\" are indeed outrageous. If you already believe these assertions, you will undoubtedly find comfort in Jeffress' arguments. However expounding any of this over the watercooler is unlikely to win any converts. Hard to find much Christian love or compassion anywhere in these pages; so much for loving the sinner, he seems to have as many harsh words for fellow Christians as non-believers (who are all going to hell anyway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever written!","review":"Reading this book for some 3 hours was a total waste of my time. Jeffers is a hardline Christian fundamentalist who has a peverse view of God and salvation alltogether. He thinks that it is just for someone to burn in hell for all eternity just because they didn't accept some stupid religious doctrine about Christ paying the penalty for your sins. God would never be so narrowminded and cruel, as Jeffers potrays him to be. I hope Jeffress will be the one who suffers eternal punishment for writing such a horrible book that blaphemizes the true nature of God and Jesus.

We've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages. The manual's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this. Also, we've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out. For the price tag, this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker. We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model (NOT KitchenAid). Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems. I wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured, no doubt, in some overseas location.

The Cuisinart DCC1200 that I owned previously couldn't make a coffee as hot as this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor flaw in design","review":"This product brews very quickly and quietly. The maximum line should be black instead of white which makes it difficult to read. Problem when closing the cover if the basket is not seated firmly and level before brewing.

Otherwise, I am enjoying this coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of false advertising?","review":"Given the bevy of poor reviews, I'm hoping my new unit will be an exception. Right off the bat, however, I have to say it is not truly a 14 cup coffeemaker. Well, 14 4-1/2 ounce cups, perhaps, as disclosed in the manual. When you know that 4 ounces is a paltry 1/2 cup, then you do the math. Actually, the 14 cup carafe holds exactly the same volume as my old 12 cup Black and Decker. So much for extra cups when company is over. Additionally, the reservoir is difficult to fill from the front, as directed, without spillage. I wonder if people who design appliances ever actually use them.... Well, it's a pretty little thing and I hope it proves to be worth the money.Several months later I have to say, the coffeemaker is working perfectly. No spills, no runovers, great slow brewing for smaller amounts, cleans up well. The filter is a bit useless and it proves tricky pouring water into the reservoir from the front. Still, I'm quite happy with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good maker, false warranty","review":"I purchased this same coffeemaker in SS for myself a year and a half ago. 3 mos. after I started using it, it began to leak, called Kit.Aid and they replaced it with a brand new one.

We called Kitchen Aid because we knew of the warranty (one year replacement, etc). They told us they had no more red in their replacement program (but they are still selling it on their website)...They could give her a 10 cup replacement or she could purchase a professional series for $[...] more (a 12 cupper)...

I like the permanent gold filter basket, it eliminates finding grounds in that first cup of the day, even the large counter footprint is not as overwhelming as I first anticipated.

There is a non-removable place in which to put the gold filter or paper filter. The grounds go into one of those 2 filter types.

Now I am not someone who does not take care of her appliances. I would run white vingar through maker every month and would unplug the machine when i was not using it. Suddenly an Error 2 message popped up. I googled what that meant..it meant death to my $140 coffeemaker. I called to ask what they could do for me. I was told pretty much \\"Sorry idiot, you paid us 140 dollars for something that is worth 20\\". I have had Mr. Coffee Makers longer than this one. Stay away from this product.

It's designed for larger quantities, so making less than four cups isn't really recommended (or easy, since the \\"minimum\\" water line is four cups).

The first time I set the coffeemaker to auto for morning coffee, I woke up to coffee all over the counter and on the floor. It happened at couple more times. I called Kitchenaid and they said you must have the decanter set perfectly positioned on the warming tray with the handle facing the middle (not stated in the instructional booklet). Tried that and still had problems. Like Paul from Naperville said in his review, the pause device is the problem, bad design. My other complaint was coffee grounds every other day in the brewed coffee. KitchenAid sent me a replacement coffeemaker thinking that mine was faulty yet the grounds continued. The coffeemaker has too many design problems. Kitchenaid was great to work with and I hope they are rethinking their design. I am now getting a refund from KitchenAid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk...Save your time & money!!","review":"I was so excited to get my new Kitchenaid coffeemaker until I started reading the Amazon reviews.

The warming plate is too shallow and the lipped edge of the pot too small so it slides back which triggers the sneak-a-cup feature causing the basket to overfill.If I hadn't been standing right next to the machine I would have had 14 cups of steaming hot water all over my hardwood floors.

That is tremendously better. I think it is the best book for studying the material on the test. Also, don't forget to get the Trancender exams and flash cards. They too are also very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeping it Real","review":"Definitely this book contains some useful material. The first chapters make a good impression, but as you go further you start to see that something is wrong. The author was facing an aggressive deadline and did not take into consideration anything.The book will be thrilling to read for someone who already knows and have a hands on experience with .NET, because the book will make you think by making you try to resolve the unclear material. The author definitely knows his stuff and demonstrates that fact to you, but don't hope for any explanations they are beyond the scope of this book.Also you will enjoy the wonderful late night \\"I WON\\" feeling, after succeeding actually to RUN the most of C# examples.I kinda regret reading this book, because I have to read now an other one to pass the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Book","review":"Don't waste your time and money buying this book and preparing the exam using this book.

I found significant coding errors that a novice would find very frustrating. If you are new to .NET, I believe this book will do more to confuse you than teach you. If you are preparing for the exam, many of the exam objectives are not adequately covered. I expect the exam to have in-depth questions about DataSets, Server Controls and ASP.NET web site design scenarios. All you get is error-prone code examples and one or two generic overview. I highly suggest bypassing this book and look for alternative means to studying the exam objectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good For Nothing","review":"This book just covers the basics of all topics. The examples in the book are not fully explanatory and the Exam test provided on CDROM does not give any explanation of the answers.

Other than that, though, it's not worth a lot.Microsoft should be ashamed of publishing this book.As you struggle through it, you'd better have other references or online doc at the ready to help you navigate through the unexplained terms, the incomplete tables, the inconsistent use of terms, the out-of-context code fragments, the persistent MPC (Microsoft Politically Correct) terminology, AND the completely wrong statements. Wow...It does have a pretty cover, though. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one.Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I regret buying this book. It has been very frustrating to use. There are frequently small bits of code missing which result in things not working as they should, if at all. I know enough (from OTHER ASP.NET books) to have a general idea of what is wrong, but it is still quite frustrating. I've been particularly disappointed by the ADO.NET chapter. I wanted to use this book as a study resource to prepare for the MCAD web apps certification exam, which the book is supposedly a training kit for. Instead I feel I've wasted time and money. I'm just glad I didn't pay full price. Personally, I recommend Stephen Walther's ASP.NET Unleashed and the O'Reilly ASP.NET Nutshell book.

Iraq has completely imploded--even CENTCOM has acknowledged that we are fast approaching \\"chaos\\" and total anarchy there. Bush's occupation there is effectively at an end.As for Afghanistan, the military now admits that the Taliban is making a major, widespread resurgance, and now controls much of the country. Our recent bid to push back at their growing offense ended in failure. In fact, we now only control the capital of Kabul, and that only tenuously. Of course, Bin Laden still runs free, laughing at those he killed on 9/11.No, the sad, plain truth is that Bush is not in any way, shape or form winning the war on terror. This book has simply become a pathetic relic of a bygone era, useful only as an object of sarcastic mockery and derision. Bush, like those who believed in him, has become nothing more than a very sad joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"This book is a big disappointment mainly because there is only enough material here for one good magazine article. The author goes on about tangential issues like the political atmosphere in Spain after the 3/11 bombings but has precious little to say about al Qaeda or the war on terror. It's only about 200 pages of large print, with maybe 3/4 of that in actual text, of which maybe 50 pages addresses the book's main theme. The author should have taken a little more time for research, maybe on the war in Afghanistan or the battle against the terrorists in Iraq now rather than rushing into print.

The actual writing barely takes up 160 pages of wide spaced type with nearly half the book consisting of appendices, notes, bibliography, index and an absurdly smug 6 pages of acknowledgements. Other than being between two covers, the six chapters have little to do with each other and look like a collection of standalone articles the author could not manage to get printed in a periodical when they might have been relevant. While Miniter claims these so-called blockbusters have been ignored by the media, it becomes clear in reading them why this is the case. Unfortunately for Miniter, news events in Iraq and elsewhere have overtaken the stale theses he presents in this book. It is beyond me who is buying this outside the conservative foundation bulk purchasers. I have read papers from my community college students that outshine Shadow Snore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"It always irks me to pay to read a book that is supposed to grace you with insider information only to find that nothing new is delivered.

The title most definitely is attempting to sway the reader to think as the author does, rather than weigh facts based on independent thought.If you are a fan of Bush and looking for a book that repeats everything you already believe as opposed to an objective analysis of the facts, this title is for you. If you are looking for an non-biased examination of the facts, keep looking because you haven't found that here.This title is better described as propaganda than intellectual reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Someone please 'Review'?","review":"My hope is that someone will boot my comment off.

I would say that I have gone down the list and especially the ones that have 1 star. Their attacks are not on content, on writing style, on evidence, on the book. They are political attacks on the writer.

Any success Bush and Rumsfeld have ever done is because of Clinton and his advisors. Bush and Rumsfeld have never served in a war, nor have they seen combat. Does anyone really think they could battle terrorism ? Not on their life and not on any of their rich relatives lives either.

I won't spoil the story by telling you the end, but it is not what you expect. I shall definately be looking out for more of Victoria's books to read in the future. She is a fantastic writer.

I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews and I regret it. I really didnt even understand when the two fell in love. I also found Tessa's language to be kind of over the top. I honestly dont think a real modern day person speaks with that much slang. The writer was kind of pushing it. Tessa kept calling Galahad \\"BIG GUY\\". That really bothered me. It was like as soon as I was starting to feel the emotion of the character she said these words and I felt like she wasnt talking about the love of her life. She was talking about a dog or something. I even found myself scanning pages to see which ones I could skip without missing to much information. I give this book a 2 just because I think that when she had to leave him in the end was kind of touching. The way they loved eachother. I am not into the magic stuff. Its just not realistic.

I love medieval, time travel and obviously romance. Didn't look to see if this was a re-release, but that wouldn't have mattered. I can't believe some of the five star reviews. I really tried to get through this book but finally gave up. For an ass't professor, our female character was a little off the wall and her language , as others stated, was very immature.

The main character, honestly, I can't remember her name, talks low-class and acts so dumb. This book could have been so much better if she didn't talk the way she does. Did the author really 'believe' that an academic at a college speaks this way? In the opening pages I couldn't get past that she mentally rolled her eyes at college students who would ask a question. How dare they ask questions?! I think she is supposed to be the disappointed-by-life modern woman.

Romance - good. Ha! This particular mix is not good. It has its moments - the character of Merlin is particularly memorable. However, the whole premise has faults - Camelot? Galahad? Hunting for the Holy Grail? It's all so fabled already that it would take greater talent than Ms. Alexander's to add to its mythology.I particularly couldn't believe the main character, Tessa. She's an assistant professor of literature, yet she behaves so juvenilely about her clothing and the inconveniences of the past? Please - grow up. I liked Galahad for the most part; although, what's the poor guy supposed to do with that name in the 20th century?I have yet to read more Alexander books. I hope the rest are better.

This show peels back the inner workings of a sitcom and the life of it's main character (Valerie Cherish)with hilarious results.What made it so compelling was the feeling, that it was drawn form reality with a dash of tongue in cheek thrown in; to keep it from becoming sad.The story is about an aging hollywood actress who made it BIg at one time and then faded into obscurity.She is cast in a new sitcom and is excited to revive her flagging career, only to find that she is in a supporting role and not the main character. what is worse, she is stripped of any good lines and as time goes by she becomes frumpier and frumpier.Valerie tries to fulfill the role of a sexy aunt, to the main character but they cover her up with variations of velour tracksuits instead.If you want a laugh that pokes fun at sitcoms, then this is it. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely hilarious","review":"This was one of the funniest shows on TV -- EVER!

Frankly, these pieces didn't require excessive amounts of creativity.If you are only looking for some background sound to play in your yoga studio, this is the ticket.

Attanasio - What happened?","review":"The Dragon and the Unicorn was nothing less than mind-blowing in scale and ambition. In contrast, The Eagle and the Crown was ...not. It maintained the same character names, and some of the same vocabulary, but without the worlds-spanning grand vision of the first book. The very chapters were longer and more majestic in the first work.Instead, this book is just a chapter at a time view of some greatly diminished characters, with comic relief at times by Merlin and others. The difference is night and day - as if Frank Herbert wrote the first book, and Brian Herbert cranked out the sequel.This book was OK in the \\"I want to know what happened to the characters\\" sense, but definitely did not scratch the same itch that the original book of the series did."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Eagle and the Sword' drags on and on and on","review":"'The Eagle and the Sword' is an incredibly heavy-handed dull book. Attanasio uses a running narrative for the entire 340 pages, so that instead of feeling like a part of the action, the reader is treated to a history lesson. (Example: This happened, then this happened..and then this happened..That's the basic gist of it)At several points I found myself wondering whether English is Attanasio's original language, or whether this book had been translated from another tongue. It's hard to believe that this is the same author responsible for the stunning Adam Lee 'Dominions of Irth' trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time consuming waste of money","review":"Save your money and don't buy this product especially because there is no one available to provide any help.

This book is great in referencing firearms I didn't even give thought to.The stories from history are engrossing, and the technical write-ups are good too.

The book describes Rickover as dominating, selfish, obsessed, power-hungry, dictatorial - but of immense value to our country because of the way he directed his ambitions. Interesting: How he exploited Congressmen to support him; how his superiors and peers despised him, yet envied his brilliance, how he interviewed and selected staff. Not interesting: Endless details on appropriations; differences between various sub propulsion designs. The book is solid and well-written, but unless you are interested in this arcane area, you can find more interesting biographies. And beware: Because this was unauthorized, Rickover and his staff did not participate and many of the inputs from others are of the vicious, jealous type, so the whole man does not come through in this book very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love Daniel Cohen's books as an adult, even though he tends to write for and his books are aimed at the 9 to 12 age demographic.The books are very straightforward and simple but not withoutcreative, charming , interesting writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"JJ's Review","review":"JJ's Review ofRailway ghosts and highway horrorsBy Daniel CohenI do not like this book because this book is not scary at all! The back says that it is a scary book but it is not.I picked this book because I thought it would be scary. It is a book that is not real. The short stories are about dead people and monsters that haunt people!This book is not scary. When the ghosts come they go quickly. The author does not tell you why the ghosts come. The ghosts have no story! The pictures are very boring. The headless guy is so stupid because there is nothing scary about how the author describes him. The book should say there's a bloody, murderous, freaky, headless monster. The book should have more information about the ghosts and monsters!

The sound is gorgeous and never agressive, yet the music never drags or becomes merely pretty. There is depth and heartfelt emotion on every page-and the colors virtually jump out at you. Scriabin was truly a genius-a magician who invites you to enter into his fascinating visions of other worlds. Pianist Le Van obviously understands this-the playing here is simply magical. Without a doubt,this is some of the best Scriabin playing I've heard in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Musical Striations!","review":"Having heard about Eric Le Van, my wife and I attended one of his concerts at a university concert hall in Southern California. My jaw was in my lap from the time the first delicate piano notes began to tease the air till the last. His manner with that instrument was a marvel to watch.

Bob Larson, who never managed to graduate from a divinity school, feels he's in a position to question and ridicule the late, great Dr. Carl Sagan. If you want to learn about the possibility of UFOs would you want the insight of someone like Dr. Sagan, or would you question a fundamentalist pesudo-Christian radio broadcastor with no credentials? It's your call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propagandized Self-Righteous B.S.","review":"If you look at what Bob says above he states that, \\"this book resulted from my 20+ years of interest in the issue of ufo's\\". Obviously he didn't do any research in those 20+ years, instead he watched a few episodes of Star Trek, watched the movie ET, went on Oprah, and read an article in Time magazine. Wow this man is a learned ufologist.What makes me most mad is that he thinks popular culture is to blame for increased UFO interest during the past few decades. He blames Star Trek, Star Wars, ET, and whatever else might be on the TV. Well if he knew anything about anything then he'd know that Star Trek isn't about ufo's or government conspiracies. After all the first UFO sightings occured well before any Star Trek episode ever aired.This whole book is just one big attempt to falsify or debunk the UFO phenomenom. No facts, no research, no logic, no rationalization, just his jaded Christian opinion of aliens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigotry is taken universally!","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews here first before I purchased this book. The author doesn't believe that (his) god would have created any other life other than here; how self-centered. But if there is, surely it is satanic. It is sad that with all the unrest we have here on this planet the author wants to go to war with someone who may or may not exist. This book upset me, but then I realized that it is only trash. With this bigoted attitude...and he wondered why Cabot and Strieber were upset!

Too many ad-hominim attacks...tisk, tisk. Is it any wonder that the world largely veiws christians as kooks? I think that Bob is confused and that this book is a sad attempt to fleece the flock! On page 19 he asks, \\"What kind of power caused people to ignore all reason and scientific data?\\" Perhaps Bob could give us insight into what power causes him to do the same. Could it be ......SATAN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Larson's best fiction, presented as fact","review":"Bob Larson claims that he saw a UFO, and that somehow qualifies him to write this book. He has also claimed on his radio talk show that demons have physically impersonated him, which makes you wonder whether he shouldn't be locked up in a padded cell somewhere. Adam Rideout is right: Bob's no Carl Sagan.What I really want to know is how Larson even got to be a \\"best-selling author,\\" when he can't even write a grammatically coherent review of his own book. (Uh, does the name \\"Milli Vanilli\\" come to mind?)

I figured they would also credit me for the cost to ship the item back. Wrong! They don't refund returning shipping charges! I don't think it's fair that I have to shell out more money to ship the damaged item back. This was their screw up.

Unable to find this book when the one I had began to fall apart, I had my copy rebound in leather. About the best thing is the organization: from the early facades, to streets, to panoramas and portraits. Looking at these paintings brings my mind into focus like nothing else.One of the strangest experiences I've ever had was visiting the site of Estes' \\"View From Twin Peaks,\\" 1990, in late 1996 and showing the painting to the vending guy in the white hat (his name is Mike); he had no idea he was in this great painting!Estes' artistry is absolute perfection. I have never thought much of most \\"photorealists,\\" but Estes is a superrealist who not only captures the urban landscape in both its vastness and minutest detail, but stylizes the paintings with a perspective that is lucid and clear.

From 1947 to 2004, Sri Lanka's military has searched for a mission. When its initial worry of an invasion by India did not materialize, the miliary turned its focus on internal insurrection. With an expected end to the 20-year conflict between the Jaffna Tamils and the Sinhalese government, the military's mission will return to external defense. However, without signficant external or internal threats, the government will neglect the military and it will again become incapable of defending against any threat. This book exams all aspects of the three services (army, navy, and air force).

The reader's monotone voice with no interpretative expression, like a dramatic pause or inflection of certain words, made the audio book boring and often times irritating to listen to. It sounded as if he was reading the book for the first time.

Sorry, but I'm not willing to invest thousands into the equipment that he is pushing which is why I opted for the book in the first place.

I have been following the pilates mat routine for a few years and have found this book to be the most complete. Mat exercises are explained in a clear concise manner and equipment exercises are also shown. The Pilates method of exercise is incomplete without providing information beyond the mat. No other book (that I have found) explains the equipment and the exercises that can be performed by using the various pilate tools. In addition, the authors provide alternatives for some of the equipment, for example- one may use a ball for the Magic Circle or pillows for the barrels. I do not believe that this book is merely a way to sell expensive exercise equipment as mentioned in another review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"This book might help reinforce things learned in the studio, but is not a substitute for good instruction. It would be practically impossible to read this book and do the exercises correctly.

Thus the book is more of a guide to Kramer's sexual fixations than it is an objective guide to beliefs of the time. And when doing historical research it is to be remembered that in the pursuit of an agenda (namely the agenda of blaming the Catholic Church for a historically unsubstantiated nine million deaths), any book can be held up as \\"THE\\" definitive guide to what happened when hundreds of years have passed and nobody is alive to prove you wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent historical resource","review":"As a student of archaeology and history, this book is an amazing resource into the materials used during the inquisition.

Both volumes are essential reference for anyone seeking the myriad and potentially catastrophic scenarios, both manmade and natural, facing modern civilization. In Life After Terrorism, Clayton presents a realistic if frightening view of the global threat posed by a multitude of terrorist acts. His in-depth discussion of exposure to various biowarfare agents is especially chilling. Following the common-sense suggestions in this book can increase your chances of survival in the event of a terrorist attack.

It's also superb for extremely chapped skin such as dry, cracked heels or fingers.The pluses:- It's cheap, and a tin of it will last for years.- It works beautifully.- It can be used on pets, livestock and humans!The minuses:- It contains lanolin, so avoid it if you're allergic to wool.- It's greasy, and has a pungent medicinal smell (you're not going to want to wear it out as a moisturiser)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for dog calous!","review":"My dog developed a calous on his \\"knee joint\\" and the hair was falling out.

I'd set the alarm (on any setting) and within 10 minutes of setting the alarm, I'd hear a light static noise and the clock would lose its time -it would go to midnight and keep blinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"false information about product","review":"I ordered this because it wanted the earphone jack as stated in the product description.

Very flimsy, can't switch from night to day without completely resetting the mirror. The company I bought it from had a lot of double talk about refunding my money and I never got a settlement other than being stuck with junk. I would suggest looking somewhere else unless you want to have to do as I did and buy this one and throw it in the trash and then go and buy another one somewhere else to actually use. Save your time and money and avoid this trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Likely will need glued","review":"Description allows you to search the model of your car to make sure it fits.

It was unsual in that villains were the protagonists. However, for this sort of thing to succeed, the villains must be both bad and sympathetic. Unfortunately, Forward succeeded only in the latter. I was expecting the main characters to break out into song about getting along at several points in the novel. The good guys (antagonists in the book) are more evil than the villains! The premise is good, that too much good destroys the world's balance and threatens to destroy everyone.

The plot of this story may seem old but Forward puts a new tiwst on it where it no longer really seems old and worn out.

I have read many books that are out there. Most people I talked to would agree that \\"The Hobbit\\" set a standard in fantasy writting. However, most people still agreed with me after reading \\"Villains By Necessity\\". This book has many exciting features. It has to be the best ever fantasy book. The story it tells is one that, most people would agree with, should happen in a fantasy story. With everything that gets said about fantasy. The winning of one side, good or evil, never gets told. That has changed with this book.

It is an ingenius story line and screams to be a series and/or a movie! I highly recommend it for anyone who is into Fantasy or is thinking about it!

Then second thing is, the stupid part is why is it someone who just moved into town wants to start digging up a past that doesn't have anything to do with them or even have any affect on their future what so ever. It's not important let the past be the past. And lastly, I think the characters contradict their personalities.

Perhaps this is because it is fairly short, but I think more due to the author's writing style. Strand weaves his way between pearls of wisdom about writing, autobiographical snippets and pointers to haiku practice with fluidity and ease. I read half of this book in the bookstore where I found it - I just couldn't put it down. In fact one of the many factors that kept me reading was the author's self-revelation. With remarkable concision he tells us a great deal about his own spiritual journey, in and out of Zen monasticism, in and out of depression, without a single word of self-indulgence. If you want to know everything there is to know about haiku, this book is only the start.

That's what makes the Schwager books so good. His book is written for traders by a trader.The second problem is that no strict documentation of trading success was required.The third is that the interview is all rehashed by the author and so you don't get the real dialogue which makes you wonder what's getting lost in the translation.Having said all that, every book has some value so if you have the money go ahead and get it.

In episode 73, \\"Clash of the Super Powers\\", Goku uses his Kamehameha attack underwater because Freezer cannot see where he is. Then, Freezer tries some more attacks on Goku, but Goku avoids them so the two decide to start fighting for real.In episode 74, \\"Frieza's Boast\\" , Freezer declares that he'll fight Goku without using his hands. Elsewhere, Captain Ginyu finds a way to switch bodies with Bulma.In episode 75, \\"Bold and Fearless\\" Frezzer powers up to 50 percent of his powers and really starts to beat Goku. Goku tries to use the Kaioken but it is rendered useless.This is a great video. The music is now being done very well asa are the voices.There are some real good one liners from Goku in this one such as when Freezaer asks Goku if he wants to fight on land or in the air, Goku says \\"Grounds good. Sure why not? I'm a ground kinda guy\\" Otherwise the diolouge is done very well.

I didn't like the hero and he didn't seem all that sorry for what he had done during their marriage. I am just not a fan of 'realistic' romances.

I was impressed that he was the only outside expert invited to speak at this conference. His book is very informative. It is probably one of the best books out there in terms of understanding terrorist networks, and how new members are recruited. This is a must read if you need to know or are just curious about what drives someone to become a part of such an organization. Be prepared to put aside your preconceived notions as he dispels many myths about what motivates such individuals. You will be surprised to find that the common terrorist is not some mentally disturbed religious fanatic but a fairly ordinary family man. Marc makes plenty of disclaimers regarding how general his conclusions are due to the limited sample size of his study, but I think that one can safely draw several general conclusions from his excellent research and insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Detail on Muslim Terror Networks: For the Adanced Reader","review":"This is a very detailed book on the rise and make up of Muslim terrorism that covers the subject very well and challenges the stereotype of what type of person makes up a terrorist. Through detailed analysis of known terrorists utilizing charts and graphs, the author clearly indicates that the assumed sterotype of a terrorist is not valid. However, they are virtually clannish making it very hard to penetrate. The author also covers how the various movements particularly from Egypt and Al Qaeda merged and expanded globally. The book is compact but is relatively technical and the detail and complexity of the organizations may require one with less familiarity to take notes to refer to as you go along in regards to names and organizations.

The book brings a keen sense of history, a respect for nature and an armada of helpful resources that one could spend countless weeks investigating prior to a visit to this wonderland.Georgia's coast is best discovered by boat, but having a capable \\"road map\\" will certainly enhance the journey. Whether you're a yachtsman, fisherperson, naturalist, or history buff, this book offers much for its reader.I would encourage anyone that wishes to visit coastal Georgia to buy this book.

If you pick it up in the bookstore, it's fascinating. If you you sit down to read it, it's infuriating. It's at least a third longer than it should be, due to incessant repetition, contradiction, lack of editing, & general incoherence. Was this book ever edited? It's stream of consciousness history, & it doesn''t work. Nonetheless, the author's thesis, that the defeat of Japan occurred in the Southwest Pacific air battles between spring 1942 and spring 1944, is worth something.

It details the many mistakes made by both combatants and demonstrates the truth of the old adage that he who makes the fewest mistakes wins. One thing that shows through the entire book is the Japanese inability to work as a team or to make any realistic plans for war. Unlike the Allies the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces did not work together at all well. This cost them dearly. The Japanese decieved themselves by their easy victories in China and before Guadacanal had really never faced anyone who could fight back. A really good look at why Shakespeare said \\"Beastly, Contumelious, Mad Brained War\\"My only criticism of this fine work is that it could have benifited from some editing to make it a bit shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"The maroons are just fun, contemporary, and bring us to moments & experiences that are real. They posess the qualities to influence their contemporaries in a sincere way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid acoustic tracks....and one not so solid electric track","review":"I picked up this CD today and listened to it in the car as I drove around town. I was thouroughly impressed with it. My only gripe is that the guitar seemed to be mixed WAY down compared to the vocals. Being a guitar player and trying to hear that part so I can play it myself is a bit difficult but I'll do. As for Highway to Hell...well, its definetly headed in that direction (more of a novelty really). PS If you havent picked up Songs About Jane yet, take up amazons offer and get them both for $20. You wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have CD!","review":"I really enjoy this CD. I could have done without the covers, as I don't enjoy those particular songs, but that is my only complaint! If you are concerned about how Adam sounds live . . .fear not . . . he and the rest of the guys do a great job on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Condition","review":"Was really looking foward to receiving this item and this product did not disappoint me. It came ahead of time and was in very good condition. Would order from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam's Vocals","review":"Adam's voice deserves 5 stars all on its own. It's just so gorgeous. He's also a superb lyricist and his band members are also great. They do extremely well together. Acoustic or studio. These versions showcase Adam's voice without other instruments drowning him out in any way. So, if you're really into his voice like I am, this album is a sweet buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooooo","review":"This CD is definitely not worth it. It's a complete disappointment. I thought Adam Levine's voice would be impressive recorded live but it isn't. And there's nothing special about it, the songs sound just like they do on the radio except slightly lower quality because it's a live recording. Sadly the most amusing thing on the CD is the cover of \\"highway to hell\\" that made me almost pee my pants laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I have the studio recording Songs About Jane and it's amazing, but now I'm listening to this album with acoustic versions and I just don't like it at all...I was going to buy it, but thanks to the Amazon Music Sampler, because I heard 15 seconds of This Love and I got bored! It's really a waste of money, and it's definitely better to buy the studio version than this...other thing. I give it 2 stars because the songs included here are great in the normal album."},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"i really enjoyed harder to breathe and this love AT FIRST, but due to them being overplayed they became a bit dull so when i heard bout this accoustic album i thought it would bring a new freshness to the songs....instead it is just like the album vwersions of the songs,they have not dared vary their songs. The only difference is that Adams voice is a lot more fragile, and the interesting quality to it is replaced by out of tune whining.sorry if people do not agree with me, this is just my opinion.they r definately an album band not a live one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Scott must be rolling over in his grave.","review":"i don't really like Maroon 5 (too popular), but some of the songs are ok, as my friends made me listen to this album (torture). Highway to Hell is an insult to AC/DC members. It is a nice song with a truly memorable riff. The guitars here, though, have too much bass and sound as though someone has too much phelgm in his throat. Dums are too punkish, not metal enough. Now, if you want to play music by a band in the rock n roll hall of fame, which is heavy metal, but don't sound metal enough, why play it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"UNPLUGGED\\" style - not pop studio overproduction","review":"...but if you enjoy actually hearing the lyrics and riffs (for a change) without slick studio editing this is a great departure from radio versions"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Harriet, too little help","review":"For someone running a small business or thinking of starting one, emotional strength can prove as important as a business plan. Harriet Rubin is on to a great topic here, but she ruins the book by her staggering self-indulgence, name dropping and bragging about how much money she makes. Someone who wants insight into what being in business for yourself is really like would do better with Spare Room Tycoon, by James Chan. That book has the advantage of drawing on the experience of dozens of other entrepreneurs, and it's better written besides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"As a freelancer, I'm always on the look-out for books that can help me. Unfortunately, this isn't one. It's mostly the author's own self-indulgent musings, along with a few conversations she's had with others. There's no real research and the advice is mostly obvious things like saving money before you go solo. Maybe I had too high expectations given the author's background, but the book seems like a rush job. It doesn't even have an index, which made it even harder to find what little useful information the book contains. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few insights; a lot of attitude","review":"This book did offer some interesting psychological insights about breaking away from the corporation to work on your own. Unfortunately, the book was marred by repetition, uneven writing and most notably, the arrogant tone of the author. It seems as if first and foremost, the author is concerned with letting the reader know what a special human being she is. She tells us that people in the middle to upper range of experience shouldn't offer their services for less than $5,000-10,000 a day, and inserts an unnecessary chart showing us all the money she made. While she does this with an outward tone of \\"you can do this too,\\" she is intelligent enough to know that most of us won't be commanding this money. I was offended by her condescention. Nonetheless, I admire her shrewd self-marketing. I just wish I hadn't bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it but Rubin's boyfriend did","review":"I read the journal diaries in Inc. that make up this book. I agree with most reviewers that the book lacks substance and is sadly self-indulgent. I have nothing to add except that I couldn't help but notice that one of the Amazon reviewers actually figured prominently in the text. Avram Miller (who you will see below) is, according to the author, her significant other. It's nice that he stands by his womam but is a review by him appropriate?What's next? Peter's Senge's mom chiming in to tell us what a nice boy he was?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless, redundant, and badly edited","review":"Ms. Rubin's book is shamelessly self-indulgent and just plain pointless. I had hoped to get some solid ideas about working for myself and realized that this book was pretty much useless for anyone who doesn't have Ms. Rubin's golden parachute. Not all of us have the option of asking our former employer to give us a bailout. Although she repeatedly insisted that she had to start from ground zero because she was going into a new field, it was very obvious her contacts from her former career came in oh-so-handy. She couched the one or two good points she had in endless poorly-edited prose (I couldn't even make sense of some of the sentences), randonly placed quotes, and pointless \\"insights\\". Don't waste your time.Ms. Rubin's REAL secret to soloing is convincing people to pay money to read her mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I have never before read a book that fills 340 pages (well, I sorta gave up after 200 or so) and manages to say absolutely nothing at all. Unlike some reviewers, I wasn't expecting a freelance how-to, I assumed the book would be about the emotional fallout of soloing and offer insights for handling the ups and downs of a solo life. Well, it does attempt that at some level, but falls flat time after time. Rubin just can't hide the fact that the main reason for her success is her ability to maintain her cushy, \\"I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine\\" relationships with big money movers and shakers and power brokers like Jim Moore, Nina Brink, and of course her main squeeze, Avram Miller. The message of this book is, to live a life like Harriet Rubin's, just go out and get Harriet Rubin's friends! Easy, huh? That little tidbit of info will cost you $.... But nah, you're not about to get suckered into that deal....like I was....are you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this book would help me in my solo business. I was wrong. Really wrong. The author has done almost no research; she offers no insights at all. (For example, her tax advice is to save your receipts. Duh.) My uneducated guess is that she's just trying to cash in on a big trend without really understanding it or having anything of value to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it from a friend","review":"My husband gave me this book for Christmas because I have been a soloist for 10 months. I applaud Harriet's courage and belief in herself to write a book and share what she has learned. I came away with a handful of good, solid insights. Now, the constructive criticism, I'm surprised that such a stellar editor/publisher would have such a wordy book. It would have been much better if it was condensed to half of its current size. Additionally, after the third or fourth reference to Avram, I was completely convinced that they were a couple. Thus, a tremendous amount of credibility was immediately lost. I love my husband very much and he has been my #1 supporter, but, I don't think it is responsible to pass him off as some kind of expert or sage and cite pithy quotations that he has spouted in our conversations. A wise soloist (and author) should have more integrity than this. Worth skimming, but borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save money; don't buy this","review":"Rubin's writing style makes the reader feel as if she's talking down to her audience. The entire book was disorganized and kept saying the same thing over and over. \\"We get the point,\\" I wanted to say. She needed a good edit (duh, she's an editor) on her chapters, which seemed to be repeating themselves.Rubin's book is not a product of a great thinking. Be ready for generalized comments and suggestions that seem to go on forever. Save your money and buy some books from leading business gurus: Drucker, Maslow, Wheatley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very self-congratulatory; borrow it, don't buy it","review":"This isn't a book about really making a soloing career happen. While Rubin may have found a catchy title, her content is vague, and the tone is very self-congratulatory and condescending.I have become a \\"soloist\\" myself and thought this book would provide useful information or, at the very least, comaderie for those of us who are out on our own. It provides neither. Rubin spends almost all of the book congratulating herself on her accomplishments. She also makes totally arbitrary divisions between soloing and entrepreneuring, as it this is really somehow relevant.In summary: a waste of a good title."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's a heck of a caveat, Bobby.","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather read a book by someone who really went solo rather than by someone who went solo to write a book.Welcome back to the land of expense accounts, Harriet. Thanks for your brief fly-over of our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much babble, not enough meat","review":"I usually will research a book online[...] before buying. The title caught my eye and after a quick preview decided to take a chance. The first couple of chapters and the table of contents got me pumped, but after that I could barely finish it because of the babble and musings. There is some good information in the book, but not enough to justify buying. A much better book is \\"Kiss Off Corporate America\\" by Lisa Kivirist. It's also a motivational type book for going solo, but I found it more practical and a much easier read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"Having recently made the transition from a major corporate/Wall Street role to becoming an advisor to Internet companies, I was delighted to find Ms. Rubin's book-an unabashedly self-revealing description of her own very real transition process that provided an open, honest viewpoint unlike many books written about this topic today.Ms. Rubin's unique perspective on the importance of the role of work in our lives, the psychological and social impact of workplace transitions, and her own recipe for becoming a successful soloist is worth reading.She aptly titles her book SOLOING, but Ms. Rubin has now provided a companion for other soloists to take on the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"I was disappointed in this travel guide-- Lonely Planet's is far superior. I didn't find much of the information I was seeking in the index-- as an example, there's no index entry for \\"Monteverde\\"-- one of the most popular destinations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connecticut Foreclosures 4th edition is now available","review":"2004 saw the release of the 4th edition of Connecticut Foreclosures, Caron and Milne, which added chapters on the secondary mortgage market, including MERS, the federal truth in lending act, and new developments in Connecticut Foreclosure law.The text is available and in print.

I recommend this to anyone who loves Lucy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start for Beginners!!","review":"I got this book to help get a start in Arabic, and really feel like the book is helping a lot. I'm just trying to teach myself and I think the repetition is great. Unfortunately I don't have the CD or tape, but I'm sure it would help to hear it at the same time as I'm reading. Some of the phrases and sentences in the beginning are definitely over my head, but I'm glad for the early exposure. The book is well organized and clearly written. I can't wait to finish it and use what I've learned as a bridge to become better acquainted with this beautiful language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"This book is very well-written and organized. The lessons start with learning the Arabic alphabet, normally a daunting task but beautifully explained and presented by the author. By the end of the book the learner will be able to both write and read the script and will know hundreds of beginning words as well as many helpful phrases. The author takes great pains to explain the many differences between English and Arabic and instill in the learner an appreciation for the intricacies and beauty of the language. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a solid foundation in learning Arabic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Textbook for Teaching","review":"This Arabic textbook is constructed extremely well. A beginner can easily follow the lessons that are laid out in the book. This book is a wonderful refresher for students that are relearning Arabic or for students that are just are beginners in Arabic. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very technical","review":"the idea for the book is excellent, a version of secret history from one who was there. I am very interested in WWII era so I looked forward to reading the book. Became bored half way through aa I thought the book would be more designed to be on the exciting side of espionage. Found it too overwhelming with the political problems and underwhelming in the telling of the work done by the agents in enemy territory. Of course, he wasn't behind the lines himself so perhaps my original thought of new stories about the OSS was out of line. From Casey's viewpoint, the book was interesting, but not compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful book for anyone suffering from IC","review":"I purchased \\"Solving the Interstitial Cystitis Puzzle\\" three years while doing as much research as I could in order to find relief from the severe IC symptoms that I had been suffering since 2004. I had known for quite some time that approaching IC as a full body disease and not simply as a bladder disease was probably a better explanation for IC, and this book confirmed my suspicions, as well as provided well researched and well thought out information about how to alkaline your body in order to prevent chronic inflammation and therefore help eliminate the pain from IC. I am forming a Colorado Springs based IC support group next month and Amrit's book is at the top of my list of recommendations for anyone newly diagnosed with IC, or for anyone suffering from IC who is fed up with conventional treatments.
