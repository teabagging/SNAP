I am a 27 year old white girl, but found that I could relate to both October and Vergie and even to some of the male characters. I laughed, cried and was uplifted by this immacutate story. Ms. Clair is a gifted author who turns the reader into more than just an observer to the story. She writes you into it.

You have renewed my love for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Read.","review":"Maxine Clair did a superb job of providing us with a slice of life and weaving a rich story line.

A young woman thinking she found love, finds herself pregnant and hopes against odds that he will rescue her and find happiness ever after. Ms. Clair gives us a wonderful glimps of life in the 50's/60's, blending Harlem, St. Louis,the age of jazz and life in the mid-west. Her language is pure sweetness. I savored the sweetness of her language, the rhythm, characters and story line. A wonderful read that ended too quickly.

Everything this author taught me about confidence, persuasion, powerful speech writing, and even controlled breathing, may be found in these pages.

I finally realized the cause of the confusion (the guts are DRU-710) but because of Sony's laziness and/or incompetence I had to chew up valuable time trying to figure out if a DVD-Writer problem was due to what turned out to be an irrelevant hardware designator.Second, after installing all of the updates (up to and including BYX5) the drive still takes 10 minutes to write a DVD. The media is not the problem: other drives are writing on the same media (ridata 16x) consistently at 16X.The 2 stars are because:1. It seems to reliably burn DVD Data disks, albeit slowly2.

If you have (say) an internal CD-RW drive, and you're running Nero for it, this Sony DVD burner comes with its own version of Nero that wipes out your other version. And, this version of Nero will REFUSE to recognize a non-Sony burner of any sort. So, that's the end of your internal CD-RW drive! I bought this Sony for an office, intending to move it from machine to machine as needed, but this awful feature means I can't use it that way, because I would end up incapacitating everyone's CD burners. So, I have to keep it dedicated to a single machine. Might as well have bought an internal! What a design flaw, in an otherwise wonderful device!

It has nice algorithmic steps for the application challenged and it provides nice examples to help ensure that you are using the appropriate tests. Since the SPSS program is so user friendly, students may go pal mal through the program and not fully understand what tests they are running and what their output means.

It is also very cumbersome to fill as the pots are too close together. For this price, it is not worth it. I am very surprised at Delonghi for having the nerve to put an expensive coffee maker on the market with so many flaws. Wish I could return this. Or better yet, have them recall all and fix the issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"The coffee pot worked fine for 30 days and now its dead","review":"I am unable to contact the vender for this coffee pot to return for a new one.

I will never buy another thing on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this coffee maker","review":"This coffee maker has three key features that set it apart from other dual coffee pot makers:1. Lids come in orange (decaf), red (hot water), brown (flavored coffee) and black (regular coffee)2. Thermal pots to keep the coffee hot (though Krups does offer models with thermal pots -- but with other deal-breaker design flaws)3. Does not require paper filtersHowever, the pots are designed in such a way that coffee pours all over the counter when you pour yourself a cup. After a lot of experimenting, I realized that the only way to avoid having coffee pour all over the place is to take the lids off entirely and pour slowly -- a design flaw that makes this coffee maker useless.

What Spare Parts?","review":"The idea of a coffee maker that brews two separate pots of coffee was very appealing to us, because my wife and I drink different coffee (she is a decaf drinker). It works just as advertised. Inadvertently, I chucked one of the permanent platinum filters in the trash along with the paper filter, not discovering my loss until after the trash was taken away. I called DeLonghi support and they advised that the only spare parts that they carry for the Delonghi DD1000TCB Caf�� Duo Dual Drip Coffeemaker was the carafes.

Full assembly was required, but it was not difficult and can be accomplished in less than a half hour if you have an adjustable wrench and a socket wrench set. My shipment included \\"revised\\" assembly instructions in the packing slip. I didn't realize that until I called the shipper for help.The finished product is very sturdy, moves smoothly, and can be adjusted for position at several locations to ensure a comfortable and effective workout.I'd have given this five stars if the two grip bars weren't constructed to be so far apart. There are six different grip options, and I'm too short to use one of them due to the wide spacing.

I think you could do just as well, if not better (for the price) at a local Ross, Tuesday Morning, or Marshall's. Prob. won't return it just because of the hassle. Just okay - don't get your hopes up too high.UPDATE: I've downgraded my orig. 3 stars to one because after one day of use, it no longer works - I put the light on, and it just pops off.

Be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!","review":"I really like these as a snack for both myself and my children. First off.. they are really good. They taste great, are all natural and the bags are the perfect size. I like the honey graham flavor. There are 120 calories and 2.5 grams of fat in one bag. None of this two servings in one bag. I often find that many \\"individual\\" bags contain more than one serving and are too much for one child. I don't want my child eating two or three servings of cookies! And trust me mine would if allowed. So they are perfect for school lunches or as a snack or treat during the day. I will be buying these again.

I tried really hard to enjoy them because I paid for a higher price for this, but every time I ate this, I just like - wish I didn't order this. I was hoping my hubby would like them since he has a sweet tooth and he'll have to finish those for me. He didn't like it either. Now my son (2 and half yr old) - the only person I bought this cookie for, who also likes sweets like his father, sorry to report - he does not like it either.

I had heard some buzz about it a little while back, but i had forgotten ever sicne.

My favorite scene in the movie is actually the first action scene when dolph demonstrates that guns arent the only effective way for killing his enemies. Overall i would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an incredible adventure in both action and choreography.

A quick read that isn't so quick: and old-fashioned post-modern tale, a paradox by it's very existence. Dr. Johnson said a book should either help us enjoy life or endure life: Cerebral Cyanide does both, in a completely unsentimental style. This is definitely worth a read, and it's something you just might want to reread from time to time, like a Richard Brautigan. It has a dream-like hyper-real quality, and is alternately disturbing, comical, subtle, jolting, and philosophical. It made me realize how complicated and simple life can be.. . . oh, yeah, and what a great title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I had owned the Optio S4, and it was a great camera.

Had the camera a couple of days and the lens stopped retracting. Sent it in (under warranty of course). Pentax told me it wasn't working because it got wet. The camera was never even near water and was always in the case when not used (for about 3 days). I was taking a photo of my sleeping husband and son when it happened. I did some research and found numerous other people who complained that Pentax did the same thing to them. They lie so that it is not covered under warranty and you have to pay the couple of hundred dollars to get your camera back! Very poor way to do business. Would NEVER buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Optio S4 was MUCH better...","review":"I have both an Optio S4 & an Optio S6. I spend most of my time out at night. Concerts, clubs, raves, etc. The Optio S4 took AMAZING low light & night setting photos. The Optio S6 fails miserably at them. Even in situations where all stage lights are on and the room is well lit, you must repeatedly hit the button to even get it to try and take a picture and half the time the photos come out blurry.I must say, however, in daylight & very well lit scenarios it does take great pictures. But it does not suit my nightlife purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest renditions of Over The Rainbow ever...","review":"This entire cd is a gem, and was one of Day's best all around long playing albums that she cut for Columbia(the other was \\"Duet\\" with Andre Previn). This finds Day relaxed and swinging, and sincere as ever. She gives one of the most heartfelt and natural renditions of Over The Rainbow ever, the only version that might be better is Al Bowlly's version. When it comes to analizing Over The Rainbow, it seems people are \\"showy\\" when they sing it, like Garland or even recently Monheit, however the song is simple and prettiest when sung directly like here. Also Day does splendid versions of The Way You Look Tonight and I'll Remember April.

I borrowed an SD700 IS from my daughter to go on a three week vacation. I thought it was perfect. The Image Stability system let me take nighttime skyline, low light and telephoto pictures with no blurring. It is so small I kept the camera in my pocket the whole time and took hundreds of pictures. Virtually all of them came out great. It does not have aperature or shutter priority manual modes but I didn't miss them at all. The automatic and special scene modes did everything perfectly. Plus the shutter is fast. There is no significant delay to take the picture after the button is pressed. I never had to charge the battery the whole time I was away. I loved this camera so much I bought one as soon as I got home. It is one great camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera","review":"I am not much of a photographer. I found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great. Believe me, it's the camera. The stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time.

You do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb. memory card when you buy the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the hefty price, this camera takes excellent photos","review":"After owning an SD600 for 3 months, I decided to sell that cam and purchase the new SD700. I didn't think another multiplier of optical zoom and image stabilization would be such a big deal, but after taking photos WITH IS on and reviewing them on my computer, I was shocked. I never knew that a little image stabilization (no matter how steady my shot was) would improve the image quality in normal and low light conditions. I do have to admit though, the 'noise' levels are almost identical to the SD600. Pics taken in low light conditions under ISO 400 and 800 are still a tad noisy. After taking about 3 days worth of pics and reviewing them, I have to admit, this camera is a perfect compliment to go with my Nikon D50. Basically, it's great as a secondary camera if I don't feel like lugging my D-SLR and not sacrifice image quality while doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but a few early bugs","review":"This camera is near perfect. I love the ability to have a compact camera that does great image-stabilized video (and pictures).The big negative, as others have mentioned, is the noise issue. It is coming from the lens image stabilizer, which inherently makes noise. That normally wouldn't be a problem, but the microphone is too close and picks it up. All my videos have poor, crackly audio, which is a shame, since that's the main reason I bought the camera... great videos.Also, two controls are very awkward to use - the On/Off switch and the mode selector (they are better on the SD 630).All in all, very good camera, but still needs some of the initial bugs worked out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good credit card camera","review":"Canon SD700 is a cool camera which would suit anybody who wants to shoot whenever time allows.

I strongly recommedn it to anyone who is looking for a simple solution to taking nice pictures. The only down side is that for night time pics, the flash is kind of weak and it does not have a battery meter, and eventhough the baterry last for a good number of pictures, it doesn't let you know where you stand.

Its great for what I need it to - take family pics etc. The only thing I'd like to see is the ability to take good pictures in low light. Its better than many other cameras, but not still as good as I want it. For this reason alone, a point and shoot that supports a hot-shoe flash when necessary would be very helpful. Hopefully manufacturers will make that one day. Until then Canon SD700 is the best out thereAlso, the menu and preset options are very helpful. I like the slideshow feature on the camera.

From the start, many of the pictures had round whitish spots on them, whether the pictures were taken on land or underwater. I've followed Canon's suggestions below and my pictures still end up with spots. Not only have I invested in the camera but the underwater housing. I will not buy another Canon camera for this reason.This is Canon's answer to spots that appear on the pictures. \\"This may occur depending on the shooting conditions, but is not a malfunction. To prevent this phenomenon, please follow these steps.- Lighten the area as much as possible and shoot without using the flash.- Avoid shooting in dusty areas.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money","review":"We bought this camera to replace/upgrade our 3.2MP Olympus Stylus. However, we have been extremely dissapointed with the qaulity of the pictures vs. the older camera. One of our biggest frustrations is the amount of Red Eye in all of our pictures taken since we bought this camera. We use the \\"Red Eye Reduction\\" setting but this doesn't really seem to help. The Olympus simply took better pictures despite being a lower MP camera.We are now going back to Olympus. Not only was this camera a waste of money but, more importantly, we wasted those precious moments since we bought this that we did not capture with a better camera. We have shared our frustrations with others and were surprised to learn that many others have had similar complaints (especially with the amount of Red Eye in Canon cameras)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, Defective Failed camera","review":"Camera delivered today after appx 25 photos lens failed to retract.

My research was based on Amazon, Phil Askey and CNET customer reviews as well as Gail's Canon Powershot SD700-IS Blog. Everything that annoyed me about my old camera (slow recovery, poor flash, big and bulky) is now ancient history. I've been interested in photography for the past 35 years, but have never been an equipment fanatic. I have always preferred a film camera over digital, but this camera is making a digital believer out of me. It's simple to use. It recycle time is great. The flash is fast and powerful. It's extremely compact. It has a 140mm equivalent zoom. Of course the best part of this amazing camera is that the photo quality is nothing short of amazing. For its price, the SD700 is arguably the best digital camera you can buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent compact!","review":"while i think the actual photo quality is not as crisp as it was in the canon s410 i had prior to this model, the sd700 takes excellent photos for a camera this size. it takes nearly as good macros as the s410, and much better than many other cameras of this size. (this is an important quality to me.) it is also small enough to put in a jeans pocket or purse and have pretty much everywhere you go. (the number one reason i wanted a compact camera.) the battery life is much better than the s410 was, although there is still no meter. all-in-all, a great camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannon SD 700 Digital Camera","review":"Excellent Camera.

Great camera to carry around for any snap shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"I've had this camera for a couple of months now; it has performed flawlessly under a variety of conditions. I've been able to get good shots at night, at dawn, under dense forrest canopies and in the bright sunlight of the altiplano. Also, the camera captured great shots from moving buses or cars.I found SD700 to be an excellent pocket camera and with extra memory and a spare battery one can go on using it for a long time.The only potential issue for me is the sensitivity of the LCD screen. I'd recommend using a screen protector for shots on-the-fly, and a carrying case is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry Pictures","review":"I had an SD550 that I was very happy with, but broke the LCD. I ordered the SD700 as a replacement and was very excited about the 4x zoom. I have to say that I was very disappointed in the picture quality in this camera. No matter what setting I used (auto, manual, scenes, flash/no flash, etc.), most pictures came out blurry. Even the ones that weren't blurry, we not crisp. The camera also produced much, much darker videos than my SD550, depsite using the same lighting scenarios. I use my camera mostly to take pictures of my toddler and outdoor nature scenes. My daughter's face in almost every picture was blurry, even though the camera was focusing on her face. I returned it and am going to try the SD900 - hopefully that will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice camera, but listen to the zoom before you buy...","review":"I really love a lot of things about this camera.

Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This camera does exactly what the product description promises and more. The battery life is very long (I have only charged it 2 times in the last 3 months that I have had it). Canon makes an excellent powershot camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera in a small package","review":"I bought the SD700 because I wanted a pocket sized camera with a lot of megapixels and zoom. It is all that. It's easy to use and the pictures are terrific. The only problem is that the red-eye delay is a bit long causing the scene to change sometimes before the second flash. That's OK if you are taking landscapes but not for small children who don't stay still very long. I often don't use the red-eye because I can eliminate most red-eye with computer software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good upgrade","review":"I've been a fan of Canon's cameras for some time. My first purchase was the A300 a few years back. The three problems I had with the product were battery duration, lack of optical zoom, and its bulkiness. Come time for this past holiday season I decided it was time for an upgrade. I was home on vacation for a month and only had to recharge the battery on this camera twice, and it was utilized a great deal. The camera itself has a good build - slim and light weight (Fits quite well on the PSC-55 on one's belt I might add). The optical zoom is good for the size of the camera. Photo and movie options are plentiful and while they take some time to master can benefit a beginner to an experienced photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for average person who loves taking pictures","review":"I've really come to love photography but don't want to spend thousands on a big souped-up camera. This one is really perfect: fast loading, lightweight, big screeen with viewfinder, easy review & picture setting capabilities and looks very cool. My only complaint is that major areas of sunlight (big windows, etc) tend to wash out to a big white square rather than capturing whats outside the window (trees, sky,etc.) but that could be my ameteaur photog skills getting in the way. Anyway, this is a great camera, really fun to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera, great value","review":"We chose this camera because it appeared from reviews to be one of the best compact digital cameras, and the price is reasonable for the quality. The LCD display is huge and the menus/settings are generally intuitive and useful. It's a great size and has lots of useful features (e.g. it goes to sleep if you haven't used it in awhile to save power). Not thrilled with the red eye reduction, but I think you'd need to go to a pretty high end camera to fully take care of this. Like most cameras, the card it comes with is really small so you'll need to buy additional memory to take pictures that are large enough to print well. Overall we are thrilled and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything a point and shoot camera should be","review":"This is a great camera. I research everything I buy to an extream degree and this was my hands down favorite. I own a Canon XT and this camera is the perfect complement to my larger heaver SLR. There are times when I want the high degree of control that a Slr offers and times when I want a small camera that I can throw in my pocket to take pictures and not feel like I am sacrificing quality. My wife loves it too because the image stabilization produces sharp pictures more consistantly and also helps in low light situations. This camera is really designed for point and shoot and delivers consistantly good pictures with very few bad exposures and out of focus pictures. The camera is well designed and has a quality feel to it. My biggest gripe is... well there are none. After shooting hundreds of pictures, I would buy this camera again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter camera","review":"I've had this camera for about three months now. So far, I am happy with it. It takes sharp pictures, and the menu functions are easy to use. For under $300, its a great buy. The best part is the stabilization feature.

The regular coffeemaker is easy to use. I particularly like the fact that the water reservoirs can be removed and filled right from the tap. Even if there's residual water, it doesn't leak out the bottom if you pull the tank out of the coffeemaker. And we like that the coffee grounds holder swings out away from the machine, making it easy to fill. The steamer works fine; I turn it on first thing in the AM and it's always ready to go no more than 10 minutes later. Our only challenge is the espresso maker. We still haven't figured out the technique for making an espresso that's not too strong or too weak.

Luckily I'm still within the Amazon return period, so it's going back to them for a refund. Definitely not interested in a replacement. I had read the other negative reviews here, but assumed they were from heavy users. I make 1 or 2 pots of drip coffee a day on weekends and that's about it, so figured I'd be okay.

De Longhi were not in the least bit helpful or interested, claiming they could do nothing as I bought it in the UK. Also De Longhi US would not deal with me as I was a UK customer.

I had to take it to one of their authorized repair facilities to get it fixed. I have been without the coffee maker for 1 month now and they still don't know when they will get the parts from Delonghi. I do not drink coffee and my wife drinks maybe 1/2 cup a day.

But now the replacement, some 3 months later will have to be sent back to DeLonghi for repair. It too exibited the same dying motor behavior.

It was a little confusing with its lettering system rather then numbers for cups, invisible plastic arrows on clear plastic to line up, a ground coffee drawer that fights back, etc. Also, it would not grind Peets UNflavored coffee. Peets said it was the oils in the fresh roasted coffee. If I stored it a few weeks and then froze the beans you could get it to dry out. (Makes sense, huh?)

The amount of ground coffee for any given setting---make that \\"coffee dust,\\" for this thing is the antithesis of coarse grind---varies considerably. I bought this grinder and passed along my cheap blade grinder to my brother.

No way it would be suitable for a French press or percolator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogs much too often","review":"This grinder looks great and has lots of settings, but it clogs and won't grind most of the coffee I use. I use Starbuck's or beans from our local roasting company, which are often more oily than those from the grocery store, but I would think that most people who grind their coffee at home use this type of bean. If it weren't clogged up all the time, this would be a great grinder. But if it won't grind, what good is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"We bought this grinder because we wanted a burr-type grinder, this one looked pretty good, and the price was right. Bad idea!1. So much static electricity accumulates in the thing that you can't take the lid off to fill the coffee maker without coffee grinds flying everywhere. A mess all over the counter every time.2. It got stuck and wouldn't grind anymore after about 1-2 months of use. We complained and asked about getting it repaired, but we were told we'd be sent a new one instead of repair information (only after cutting off and sending in the plug from the old one, though!). Communications with DeLonghi through this replacement process were inconsistent, though reasonably polite.3. The replacement grinder broke, in exactly the same way, after about the same amount of use!We're back to our blade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"works great for about 2 months","review":"truly terrible product. Great style, but no substance. I got one and loved it, so a month later I ordered one for a friend. Mine completely died at the 2nd month, then my friend's died right on the same schedule. Thing is fussy when it does work, jams and clogs frequently. Spend your money on anything but this--amazon should stop carrying this lousy product, and I would like my money back for both of them.

I've had two specific problems: One is that there's a micro switch that keeps the unit from turning on when the grounds carrier is removed - which is fine except that every time I remove the carrier to get the ground coffee I have to really struggle to get it to seat properly again so that it will run. Coffee grinds naturally collect in the area of the micro switch preventing the carrier from seating properly against the switch. It's really frustrating. The other problem is on the top end where the whole beans feed down into the grinder. They regularly get into a little log jam such that the grinder is still whirring away but no beans are feeding down. I have to try jiggling and knocking the whole unit until the beans start feeding again. Overall, I've found this to be a REALLY disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable motor","review":"The first one I ordered from Amazon arrived DOA (dead of arrival).

My grinder cannot grind for espresso on either of the fine espresso settings without getting plugged up every time (at which point you have to clean out the feeder hole by hand which makes a big mess!). It also has problems feeding the beans. I think the grinder probably works OK for settings other than espresso, however, if you do intend to use it to grind espresso I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not better than a blade grinder","review":"I've used this grinder for a few months, on loan from a friend.While it does grind coffee beans, it's loud and the grind quality is very inconsistent. Decent enough for drip coffee, but I get lots of sludge in a french press.I ground 35 grams of beans on the drip setting (middle of the selection range). I sifted the ground beans through a fine mesh screen which only allows powder to go through. From 35 grams, 15 grams were pulverized to a fine powder (which causes overextraction of bitterness, etc). From the remaining 20 grams, I estimate that 5 grams were larger-than-desired chunks (which cause underextraction). This means that only 15 out of 35 grams were in the size range desired.The grinder also clogs frequently.Either spend more money to get a better burr grinder for french press or spend less and get a blade grinder (e.g. Bodum C-mill for $20) which will give you the same (or better) grind quality for drip coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, but...","review":"Got this to replace my Mr. Coffee grinder after hearing how great a Burr is compared to a blade type.It worked for the first few grinds, but has some drawbacks.1) Does not feed beans correctly into the burr blades. Takes a slight \\"shake\\" of unit for it to operate. Now this was on Tully's beans. Worked Ok once in a while with other brands of whole bean coffee.2) Choice of grind setting is incorrect on unit. I'm in agreement with others who have posted this. Tried many different settings and it was consistent in grinding a bean to dust, which is fine for espresso but not good for a drip brew.I ended up getting a Cuisinart Burr grinder at Costco after giving up on the DeLonghi. And it was less expensive to boot.Maybe it'll do better on whole pepper...who knows.Steer clear in my opinion. Waste of $ on this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal!","review":"This was absolutely awful. We bought this for light use in an office, the thing worked great for about a week. After that nothing but problems. We had to constantly clean it, the blades refused to grind the coffee and had to basically disassemble it everytime we wanted to ground coffee every morning and afternoon. We got great at using thin knives to clean out the mechanism. Please don't waste your money on this. Steer as far clear from this as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, consistent grind, moderate static","review":"I like this burr grinder, both for its operation and looks. Like most, it is noisy, but it grinds consistently and doesn't get the grinds all over the counter. It does generate a moderate amount of static, so there's some waste when you try to empty the lower container of grounds. My only gripes are that the coursest setting is only moderately course (but that is sufficient for all but a plunger-type coffee maker) and because it runs at fairly high RPM, there's some fine grounds. However, the result is still a much better cup of coffee than my blade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Espresso.","review":"If you're thinking about grinding coffee for an espresso machine with this grinder: forget it! The finest (\\"espresso\\") grind is coarse enough for drip coffee! I even disassembled the thing to see if I can manually adjust it, but no such luck. By the way, I also noticed the componenets are cheaply made while I had the machine open. I am giving it one star because I can't give it less, and also because it looks cool, but it will ook even better in my garbage can tonight ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for espresso","review":"The machine does make a consistent grind without heating up the coffee, but it does not produce a fine enough grind for making espresso, even at the finest setting. You know how finely ground coffee stains the fingers?

(And don't even think about making Turkish coffee with the grounds from this machine...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogs Every Other Use","review":"As others have mentioned this grinder clogs too often. In my case it clogs every other use. Even if I take the burrs apart and clean it very well it still clogs. This is due to a poor design in the distribution spout being too narrow. If you ever look at professional grade burr grinders you will notice the spout where ground coffee comes out is very wide. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design, Save Your Money","review":"I would NOT recommend this unit.I have had my unit a little over four months. I love the look. I love the concept of dialing in the grind and amount and letting the grinder do the work. When it all worked, I loved it.The burr grinder gets clogged easily, especially if you use flavored beans.

It was a stocking stuffer for a very old BOY. He remembered them from his childhood. The only issue is that the ball is advertised as a \\"Spaldeen\\" ball - which is what he specifically asked for. However, the ball itself comes as a \\"Spaulding\\" ball - likely the company that now owns/makes them. Therefore, it wasn't quite what he wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price","review":"$5.95, for how many? One? Cost was 25 cents when I was a kid, cost today should be around 2 bucks.

This was awesome because even though she never could manage to throw it and just drop it, it still managed to bounce enough to entertain her. Doesn't work so well for kicking especially on carpet but she loves to bounce it, and the noise she makes when rubbing her teeth on it makes her laugh so she loves it, which means I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little for too much","review":"I know I'm supposed to read, but when a pair of products is pictured and only one arrives - I feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Only 1 ball comes with this order","review":"I was about to return this item because they only sent 1 ball for $5 when the picture showed 2.

I spent an hour prepping my skin (bathing, exfoliating, drying properly, adding moisturizer to knees elbows..etc) for my what(I thought)would be tan. I squeeze out a generous amount to apply to my skin.. and I see millions of tiny little sparkles in this \\"lovely\\" tanner. They are very very obvious, and honestly.. its not remotely attractive. Thousands of tiny little sparkles that don't wash off in the shower are covering my body. I look like my 4 year old daughter that just spilled glitter all over herself. Next, I notice after applying that it is drying a dark orange color and that its flaking off! I had patches bigger than quarters flaking off.. and the areas that did not flake off were stained this creamsicle orange color. Great job L'Oreal! BUYERS BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent price and great color after a few uses. Very pleased.","review":"Good tanning towel.

I've used the Sublime Bronze tinted self-tanning lotion for years, and these towellets are far superior since it's so much easier to smooth the tint all over, evenly and quickly, rather than tube-to-hand then hand-to-body. The color builds slowly over 2-3 applications but lasts about a week and fades fairly evenly, at least in my case. One towelette does indeed cover face, upper body and legs. Just clean your hands after application as with any tanner and even if a little too much color gets on elbows, knees, or something, it's easy to even out the color by rubbing with a damp facecloth. The price isn't bad considering the convenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best at home self tanning product I've used","review":"These are really easy to use and not messy. Just be careful to cover the area fully because you do get a nice dark at home tan with this product and if you miss a spot it will be noticeable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and Easy","review":"I'm a naturally pale self tanning junkie and have used everything. I love pricey salon sprays but can't always find the time to get them. That said, these are the best things out there-they are easy to use, dry quickly, have a great tone and are portable. One packet tans my entire body (5'3) very well. SO much easier and less messy than sprays, they are easy to maintain (use 1 a day)and difficult to mess up. The only drawback I can find is that in the sun, the tan looks a tiny bit orange on me. Even my salon spray-tanner praised them for how well they maintained me between visits. They have a light spray tan smell-way lower on the spectrum than other products I've used-and even have a faint l'Oreal scented smell. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streaks, smells bad, looks orange","review":"I have very fair skin. Used this last night following instruction, woke up this morning with streaks and big spots on my legs. Okay, streaks I can understand because maybe I missed applying, but spots? How is it possible to miss such a big spot on my leg? OH,and my co-workers said they can smell the tanning lotion on me. The tan also look really fake. I should've just used my neutrogena spray tan instead of this. Will not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take Any Other Guide Book","review":"Just returned from my second six week trip to Brazil. I own practically every guide book on the country and foolishly brought along this one. The information in the latest edition seems not to have been updated for a couple of years and I wasted a good amount of taxi fares or time walking to recommended places that were no longer in business. Even in the major cities, English isn't often spoken by the people outside of the tourism infrastructure. This can be frustrating without some preparation. Fortunately, I speak Portuguese and found many of the best restaurants etc. from the local people or through the particular city tourism authority. Another thing that I didn't like about the \\"Rough Guide\\" is that it doesn't include locations of internet cafes like other guidebooks do. For the price of the book, I give this particular Brazil edition one star.Take my advice and take any other guide book with you or you'll truly have a \\"Rough\\" time with this \\"Rough Guide\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a Rough Guide aficionado but I'm disappointed by this book. I have the 4th updated edition (December 2000) but to me it seems as though this is a rather messy update, especially on the part of accommodation. Places that have moved 5 years ago (according to the owner) are in the book still at the old location. Or a pousada that is described as \`charming place build right on the riverbank' has almost all of its windows broken and must have been closed for years. On the other hand a lot of nice budget options are not in the book while others that are in the book have been closed. And the thing that bothers me the most is that in several occasions addresses of tourist information offices are wrong. Fortunately for the editors the \`things to see and do' doesn't change to much over the years so they don't have to update this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply terrible.","review":"I just spend 3 weeks in Brazil. I too decided to veer from the Lonely Planet to check out a new guide. They're all the same, right? WRONG. Rough guide is terrible for Brazil - maps are horrid, exaggerated descriptions of supposedly cool places that actually are a dump (especially for fortaleza), and simply a lack of good info (Salvador, the islands nearby/excursions; Fortaleza - beaches and routes; Sao Paulo generally with important/updated bus info and airport info). If I didn't speak Portuguese like a goofy gringo i would have been in serious trouble. The only reason why I still have the book is because I intend to burn it when winter comes-the only true death for such an abomination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventures in Brazil","review":"I found this book very usefull and other travellers I met thought it was better than the Lonely Planet guide. Rather confusing were the facts about bus services in some cities, but on the other hand the city transport in Brazil is confusing itself. I am a budget traveller and the book provided me enough information to save in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time great polkas","review":"I found this an enjoyable cd. Its sound may not be what it was on vynal, but sometimes when converted they don't sound as well. Go ahead and dance to it anyway, enjoy whats here, its good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-horror movie","review":"This is supposed to be a horror film? I'm sorry I wasn't scared throughout the whole film. I was expecting a horror master not a boredom master. This is not a horror movie people. This is a suspense movie with a who-dunnit type feel to it. This movie has a science fiction ending and the Avatar aliens make an apperance in this film. I know it was probably scary for some but not for a horror fan. If you are a true horror fan this will put you to sleep. If you are not into horror movies and scare easily than this is for you. I'm sorry I expect a horror master to bring on the horror and gore. This movie had Brandon Walsh from 90210 being a killer. I'm sorry Brandon your not scary, bring Dillion he has potential to be scary. Stay away true horror fans this movie has nothing for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING","review":"This hour long episode had some blood, but wasn't a slasher film. A little sex and nudity, but wasn't a softcore production. It had some mystery and suspense, but not enough to make watching it a chore. It has humor, but wasn't a comedy. The acting was good with another fine performance from Gould. Nothing like a liberal family faced with the final solution and being forced to survive like red necks. Try not to get too attached to any of the main characters as most don't make it through the movie. The line I liked most was when the the teen girl says, \\"We should just nuke those f***ing ragheads.\\" To wit the feminists reply, \\"Don't say ragheads.\\" That one line is what separates real liberals from the rest of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...","review":"The acting is overdone. To a laughable point. Each actor reads his or her line like they are standing up in the middle of a high-school class and reading their essay for the teacher. The concept of the movie ought to have been brought down to a realistic level. Really? All men turning into lewd sexual and aggressive creatures? The film is funny, but not intended to be so. I don't even think a Valerie Solonas would enjoy this film. I'm giving it two stars because everyone involved actually made this film and put it out on Netflix. They got somewhere, at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a nasty little gem of a horror flick.","review":"Love the way the horror sneaks up and rips the visceral trust out of the man/woman relationship! Beats all hell out of flyswatters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, terrible acting","review":"It was like watching a cheap \\"Movie Of The Week.\\" Absolutely horrible acting. I realize the plot and circumstances that lead to the behavior of the characters, but the reactions of the onlookers were something of the nature of \\"Shawn Of The Dead.\\" - almost comical. Even Elliot Gould and Jason Priestly seemed like they were reading off a script. The supporting actors weren't any better or convincing, which took away the effect of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting horror","review":"The screwfly solution was rated R18 in Australia.However it doen't have too many gory scenes to justify such a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LITTLE BIT SCREWY","review":"This entry in the compelling MOH series is a little strange, mixing social commentary with a small dose of horror. The world is suddenly going mad, at least its male population...sexual arousal is leading men to murder the woman responsible...and soon it's just men murdering women. Two scientists offer a solution, as evidenced by the control of the dangerous screwfly population. But no one listens, and of course disaster ensues.Director Joe Dante doesn't do anything compellingly different, and the acting by Jason Priestley and Elliott Gould is merely adequate. Not a sterling entry in this otherwise good series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the story instead","review":"The story from which this is supposedly adapted is genius. Read it.

I really like that it has multiple levels so it can grow with them. I believe my son received it for his 3rd birthday. My almost 4 year old now plays with it though my almost 7 year old hasn't been interested in a while (though he's not a game kid). I have bought it for birthday presents because my kids enjoyed it so much. I love Cranium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another thought on durability","review":"Since so much has already been written on this game, I'll add my two cents. I agree with everyone that this is a great game, both my 3&4 year old sons love it. However, the younger son easily broke the clasp on the treasure chest when I wasn't looking and now the game is useless. The treasure chest won't stay closed. I'm not sure its worth it to buy another one and try to keep a very close watch to see that they don't break it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game for kids, tolerable for adults","review":"I got this as a game for my daughter who just turned 3. She has lots of fun with it. My husband and I can tolerate the game. It's pretty repetitive so I don't recommend playing game after game of it, but it is a good addition to our game closet. The best part is that it has multiple game play levels so it grows with your child. There's a simple version which my daughter picked up right away and a more advanced version for when she gets a little older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is such a fun game! My son received it as a gift for his third birthday. He knows all of his letters so we were able to play the advanced level. He loves the anticipation of whether or not the ball will be in the slot he chooses. I would highly recommend this game for learning the basics...letters, counting, colors. I hope it will continue to hold his interest...it is more interactive than the classics like Hi Ho Cherry-O or Candyland, etc., so I think we will continue to play and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun AND Educational","review":"This is a great game! It teaches number and letter recognition, counting, colors and sportsmanship. The game also grows with your children, giving beginner and advanced cards and play.My son loves to play this game and as an adult I enjoy playing with him.You pick a card and get either a letter, number or color. you then have to pick a box with the matching letter, amount or color. you have a little \\"key\\" and open the box. If you get a ball you put it in the treasure spot and when all the treasure spots are full you get a little treasure.It is a nice game and fun to play and from playing this game my son can now recognise the numbers 1 2 and 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for a 3 year old","review":"My son received this at his 3rd birthday party several years ago and now I give it to 3 year olds as gifts because it's perfect for that age."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun for the 4 year olds","review":"I bought this game on sale for my 4 year old twins. They played it for about 5 minutes and then figured out how to cheat. After that, it was no fun and they play with the balls but do not play the game as it was intended. A waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Game but Key Broke After a Few Plays","review":"We purchased this game for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He LOVED playing the game. He would play with the cards as the instructions directed with an adult and he also enjoyed playing by himself simply finding the hidden balls. It was a very easy game for him to understand and lots of fun (I even enjoyed playing it). My only complaint is the key used to unlock the hidden doors is very cheap. After a few days of play, the tip broke off and we could no longer play the game. A big disappointment for a [...] game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful game!","review":"I have to completely disagree with the one star reviewer. I find it delightful, and I like to play it. I think the hidden balls and key action keep kids amazingly engaged. The mystery factor is unique to this game, and it never feels like a boring review of numbers, letters, shapes and colors. NO batteries, and two levels of play! If your child knows every single lowercase letter and can count groups of objects to ten, then it is too easy for them. But most 3 to 4 year olds are working on these concepts (and some of this age range are still counting to 4, learning shapes, and the basic colors which is the content in level one). To me the only con is that the cards on each trap door should be laminated, because when children flip to level 2 play (the lowercase letters) they get too bent. I am here to buy this (yet again!) to give as a gift to a nephew who just turned 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got kids of different ages? Then buy this game.","review":"I have a 4 year old and 6 year old. Both boys. This is just about the ONLY game they have which they will both play together, for long periods of time, without adult input.The only downside? The balls included with the game too often find their way to other uses ... or under the sofa.... but if you've got two young children of different ages, I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"I bought this game for my daughter and she has enjoyed it quite a bit. The game is based on matching colors, shapes and numbers of items with two decks of cards for easy or more advanced play. The end to the game is very satisfying and it is one of the few games that seems to keep the child eager to finish. Its a relatively quick game, so you can play it multiple times or use it to fill a small wait. I am very happy with having bought this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun...","review":"We got this for our three year old for Christmas and he loves it. He wants to play everyday. Even our 6 year old likes to play although the beginner side is to easy for him and he peeks to see where the balls are. I highly recommend this game to anyone with young children. It's alot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Cheaply-Made Game That Is Completely Uninspiring","review":"My daughter got this as a birthday present. It seems like a waste of money to me. There are so many more interesting and inspiring games to play that involves colors and numbers. This one didn't even pass the 2 week test for my four-year-old. And no adult in our house would honestly want to play it. School Zone's cuteCrazy Eightscard game for $[...] is a better bet for a game with two play options. Or have some real family fun withOrchardorSelecta Piccobello Laundry Gameor Corso Cannelloni. Those all get 5-star recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it","review":"At the start I found this game to be dumb, but it has since grown on me. We love to play it with my daughter (She loves it).Very educational for the little monkeys.The biggest weakness of the game is that when you open a door, you can see under the adjacent doors. My daughter loves to cheat by looking under. My wife \\"modded\\" the rules to close the door after opening it. (Thus all doors are closed at all times). This has made the game more challenging because of the need to remember previously opened doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun at first but not very challenging for my 3 1/2 year old","review":"My son loved the game the first 3 times he played it, but he has already lost interest. Identifying colors and letters? The age level for this game of 3-8 is insulting to older children. I think my son would have liked the game better if he played it when he just turned 3 but he will be 4 in a few months. OK for children who are learning colors and letters but otherwise a bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Review of Scandal S 1","review":"What's there not to love about the 1st Season of Scandal.

One of the things that I love best about the series are the twists and turns that the writers provide you as they keep you in suspense throughout the season.

A matter of seconds and the product was mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I gave it a chance, and they won me over!","review":"This show didn't impress me at first. The lightning pace of the dialog seemed designed to camouflage the superficial character interaction. Also, Olivia's character came off as completely schizophrenic: one minute the power woman, the next all girly and vulnerable. Yes, people can have both aspects but not usually with the changeability of a strobe light. Then, around episode 3, the characters gelled, the story became more intense, and I was hooked! I'm glad I gave the actors and writers time to get to know their characters and to become comfortable in these new skins. This show is on my must watch list for the new season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as on TV","review":"I am very pleased with the quality of this DVD. Very clear, no complaints at all.

Most of the information is culled either from government sources or from the corporations themselves, as printed in publications like Business Week, Fortune, and the New York Times. And when there are comparisons made they're relevant; for example, comparing industrialized nations and developing countries exclusively.What's best about the Field Guide is that it's a clever resource for fighting off all those people who would tell you \\"I don't believe it.\\" As the title would suggest, The Field Guide provides you with the tools so you too can find and understand economic information yourself. From pages 194-212 you'll find the 'Toolkit', which has neat things like explanations of how to collect your own information and make graphs. Fun stuff.The Field Guide helps fight the obfuscation of corporate shills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great supplement for an economics class","review":"For an economics professor, this is an excellent choice to use along with a more traditional economics text, such as Schiller or Mankiw. The viewpoint of the authors is left-leaning, which balances out the conservative/mainstream view of most popular economics textbooks. It is a good resource for student papers or presentations, and I have encouraged students to look for both updated data and data that supports a more conservative view. There is a web site that goes along with the book and has suggestions for using it in a class. The only downside of using the Fieldguide is that the numbers go out of date, and I hope a new version is issued in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economists openly taking a stand! GREAT!","review":"\\"Economics\\" in the US is usually code for \\"why 'free enterprise' is better than the tooth fairy.\\" I get sick of so-called economists and many other social scientists telling us that being \\"objective\\" is somehow possible and desirable. Whenever someone in the U.S. says they are being \\"objective\\" about a subjective subject like economics - they really mean they are for the dominant capitalist status quo. This book makes no bones about being critical and NON-objective - and its refreshing and much needed. I teach high school economics and I can't get kids to put this book down. It may not be scholarly work - but it makes important HUMAN issues graphically clear in its pages. Every American should read this book. Excellent stuff. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A distorted view of the economy","review":"This book is a childish attempt to get people upset about corporations and all the economic \\"unfairness\\" there is in the world. This is a book pushing a Liberal/Socialist agenda and it selectively picks out statistics that help it advance that agenda. For instance, statistics are compared across countries without any effort being made to control for important differences such as education, age of population, etcetera. And count yourself blessed if you can find a reference to where these quoted statistics are taken from.As an economist I am amazed by this. There are rational, economic based arguments for Liberal causes, yet this book opts to present facts out of context instead of trying to encourage readers to think and formulate ideas. Of course this shouldn't surprise anyone given it's a comic book published by Popular Economics (as oposed to unpopular) and reviewed favorably by the self-annointed economist Noam Chomsky."},{"rating":"1","title":"My econ professor has always told me to...","review":"My econ professor consistently instructs us to approach the topic of economics from an objective standpoint. This is the most slanted economics text I have ever read. No way people actually use this book in a classroom setting! I got through half of the book before I had to toss it out because it totally distorts the rational economic theories that I have learned throughout college. I am neither liberal or conservative, but a realist who understands enough about economic history to know that there is more than the one-sided arguments that are presented here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is sensationalism at it's worst!","review":"While this book may be well researched, the author's deductions are based on her own religious bias and have absolutely nothing to do with fact. She seems unable to distinguish between symbolism and Satanism and is obviously under the impression that anything not taught directly from the Bible must, therefore, be Satanic in origin. This book ultimately is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to justify the author's pre-determined conclusions, as is another of her books wherein she concludes that Alcoholics Anon is also occult-based and Satanic. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathos settles in this pit.","review":"I expected to learn something from this book and was let down with every revealed secret. Unfortunately her bias is too obvious and in the spirit of Fleet Street instead of our loving Creator.Because I was able to buy some copies at a distress sale, I shared her research with a dozen friends.

However, I quickly realized this book was written to convince you of what those from the outside looking in believe the Order means. Things & stories considered to be displayed as we study is far from how we are taught such teachings.If you choose to still purchase, do so as awareness of how shallow writers think, not as knowledge to expand your deeper understanding of who we are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this about OES or Masonry?","review":"The author spends more time talking about Masonry than OES. The author is going in circles, trying to turn every event in past history to being paganistic (when the basis of most Christian holidays are paganistic - not to mention the names of the days of the week, the months of the year) and anti-Christian. The beauty of these organizations is to promote fellowship without religion, politics or race being a barrier. Even those who were quoted are not considered to be authentic sources for ritual history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly researched and documented.","review":"One negative is that this book at times seems to deal with Freemasonry more than OES. But then again it's understandable why the author had to spend so much time on the Freemasonry angle. A key part of this book is to show that OES and Freemasonry are intimately connected. Then she shows that Masonry has demonic/occult roots, thus OES also has occultic/demonic roots by being an outgrowth of Freemasonry.The parts that deal mainly with OES are interesting. But the parts dealing with the occultic roots of Freemasonry are absolutely riveting. The book's hundreds of footnotes show that the author put a lot of effort into putting this book together.Of course, hardcore masons and the like will hate this book for the most part. Those who are open enough to read this book from cover to cover might find this book eye-opening, as I did. This book is written from a Christian , anti-Masonic perspective, so those coming from that perspective will find this book most useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy on Editorial Description!","review":"if you are looking for an unbias book of information on the Eastern Star -THIS IS NOT IT!!!

There was far too much speculation and heresay. The sources are vague and inconsistent. It seems like any time the author came close to making a point, every source was either a second or thrid hand perriferal person and leaves us with very little true knowledge of Jackie WIlson's career. However, it was very sad to learn that after Jackie fell ill in the mid seventies, Lynn Guidry (the woman who CLAIMS she was his last wife) vanished for 2 years with whatever money jewels,furs and cars that Jackie owned. It leaves the reader curious in what may have been her involement in Jackie's demise.

Sounds like the reviewer who said it was a good price compared to other sites was mistaken, or maybe the price has dropped because the machine is not worth more. My KitchenAid pasta attachment extrudes pasta that sticks together unless you dust pounds of flour on it as it comes out.

It was there, despite the scratches and pops, that I first gained an appreciation for the unredoubtable, unmistakable, unbelievable talent of Johnny Mathis. And of all the music this man has made, like so many other artists, when he had his full legs early in his career, he was at his unbelivable best. The songs themselves are wonderful, but supported by an orchestra with unbelivable arrangements that add, but do not overshadow. This album could play forever and you'd never have a dry eye. This music makes you sad for today's generation as they have NOTHING that even comes close. Do yourself a favor. Buy the album.

No doubt the author spent time on his subject, thus the two stars, but his personal views (interjected throughout the text) were offensive and unnecessary tripe. I am a Jackson fan and I believe that he is a true important American hero to be admired and understood IN HIS TIME. So often authors are biased from a position of their own era - which surprises me since historical happenings must be viewed relative to the era in which they occurred. I also read New Orleans 1815 by Tim Pickles: another book that was written with the author's bias. I got the book to pass on to the kids, but thought that I would read it first. I definately won't pass it on. I am still searching for a good Jackson book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unresonable and biased view","review":"ALthough his writing is fair, I have found Mr. Remini to be a biased bigot who injects Jacksons already tarnished character with further polution. Not a fan of Jackson myself, I am appaled by Reminis worshipful attitude. Any author that encourages the annihilation of the \\"savages\\" (Indian) does not belong in the 21st century, and his books do not deserve to be on paper.

This book is essential to my bullying prevention work with children. Students easily connect with the characters and story line. When reading the story, students realize that they are not alone in their experiences. It is terribly confusing to be bullied by a friend. The early childhood years are training ground for relationships that children will develop later in life. It is essential that children learn the difference between positive friendships and abusive friendships. Relational aggression is a common experience in childhood and with the love and support of adults it can be a learning experience as children learn to choose their friends carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for kids 8+","review":"This book helped my daughter tremendously.

Very short story (pitched at about a 2nd grade reading level) with only one practical suggestion about what to do. There was a list of 8 tactics at the end, but they were so generic (tell the bully to stop; report it to an adult; use humor to deflect bullying...) and so lacking in examples that my daughter's response to every one was \\"I tried that; I already do that.\\"This type of bullying typically occurs when girls hit fourth grade through middle school, yet the content of the book comes across as something you would read to a much younger child. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"I purchased this to use in my 4th grade classroom. It really helped to open a dialogue amongst the students.

Currently I use a pretty good mid-level Solis machine, but figured it might work out to have this back up for whenever my current one died.First of all, I was completely disappointed with the quality of espresso. There was no crema on top, which is the hallmark of any pump-driven espresso machine. The espresso was also weak and watery. In addition, and I think this is INEXCUSABLE, there is nothing in the instruction book that warns you to prime the pump before use, which basically can fry your machine if you don't do. Luckily I knew this from owning previous makers, and called their support line to verify that it needed to be done. And the woman who I spoke to seemed barely to care!WORTHLESS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the price","review":"My old machine bit the dust and I needed a quick replacement. Ran across this one at a local department store and it looked good. Seemed to be well made and was pump driven so I bought it and took it home.Took a couple of test runs and it quickly became obvious that the cup that holds the espresso is too small. I was only able to pull a single shot at a time at full strength. I could get a double shot but it was weak.I thought maybe I just needed to experiment so for the next week I experimented with different grinds, tamping, etc.. Nothing really made a difference, the cup is just too small for a double shot.In fairness, if I ran it twice to produce a double shot, it did great. But that was too much work for me so I returned it and bought a Via Venezia Espresso Machine By Saeco from Starbucks. It was twice the amount but has a standard size cup and works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Machine for thr Price","review":"I bought this espresso machine because I wanted a decent machine at a fair price. This machine did not disappoint. It makes great espresso and cappuccino. The espresso has perfect crema every time due to the unique design by delonghi.

It was a nice upgrade from my existing machine.Well, it's been less than 2 months and I'm glad I didn't toss the old machine when I got the deLonghi because without it I'd have no morning brew. The rubber grommet that holds the screen snugly within the filter head has completely fallen apart rendering the EC140B unuseable for want of this little piece of rubber.I've visited deLonghi's website, but it's incomplete (doesn't appear to have been updated since it went online in March 2004) and the Customer Service phone number in the documentation that came with the machine is \\"No longer in service.\\" I'm willing to accept a percentage of product failure, but deLonghi can't or won't stand behind their product quality.

And in all my years, I have yet to come across a worse deal than this right here. If the only exposure to coffee you've ever had is a mid-day cup of joe from the local gas station, this machine is border-line acceptable. The shots it pulls are weak, thin and bitter. When I contacted Delonghi regarding the matter, they told me I was more than welcome to pay $14 to have it shipped to a repair shop in Florida, but that they were not responsible for defective merchandise. In its defense though, the milk steamer works quite well. So if you're looking to pay $100 for a milk frother, I cannot recommend a better product than this. Just hope that it doesn't malfunction though, or you'll be left holding the tab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to say about this one...","review":"For $80, you should just buy a steam driven $20 machine, or a stove top. I couldn't tell the difference between this, and a steam driven machine. Mediocre amount of crema, mediocre plastic build. Nothing noteworthy or remarkable going on here. You can get an entry level Italian made Gagglia for $200 that makes this think seem like a toy. It's made in China, and it looks and feels like an underpaid oppressive working enviroment.

The trials and tribulations of a boy, which are seen in greater detail in German Boy, appear in lesser detail and intensity throughout the profiles of other children. Yet, in their collective memories a common thread is revealed, a golden thread if you will, of all the positive qualities necessary to succeed. It is most significant that amid the horror and setbacks, and in spite of it, the children behave with prime elements of mental health. There is a common display of flexibility under stress, recognition of individual assets and limitations, and a commendable quality of productive activity. The War of Our Childhood is a showcase of the human spirit at its best. It is beyond admiration that such human spirit appears in children during circumstances that may be unbearable to so many adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"personal experience","review":"It was interesting to learn of people who had similar experiences as I had.

The new island drifts first towards America then South; at one point it rotates; but for the most part it just seems to be adrift. Of course, the oddest thing about all this is that the book was published just as Spain and Portugal were formally joining the European Community and officially ending their years in the wilderness.If Mr. Saramago has a coherent point here it was too nuanced for one as literal as I. And since I didn't much care for the group of characters that he follows, I did not care for the book.

I found the book exceedingly boring, a chore to read every step of the way. As the Iberian peninsula physically separates from Europe, several unengaging and underdeveloped characters (the most interesting of which was a dog) wander from one destination to another with meager purposes, certainly none I cared about. While the book may have been intended as an allegory for Portugal's relationship with the rest of Europe and the European Union, it failed to strike a chord.

Yet, as I got to know the character, the position she was in was more and more understandable. She's a pretty strong chick.There are great gothic qualities to this story, but the only romance, really, is between other characters in the book.

Writing a celebrity bio of such a young guy must be tricky: how to tell the story without fawning, and what to say that might be worth reading a year from now. But this book is prosaic and tendentious, meandering pointlessly: the exact antithesis of Beck's songs.The book is also irrelevant, except for the most gaga of fans. Beck tells his own story captivatingly. He connects with his listeners, not always emotionally, but in some dark, smokey recess of the brain. What more can his audience expect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm a pretty big Beck fan, but this book rambled on and on. The author put in so much detail about people I slightly cared about, that I skimmed a lot of the material. It felt like a magazine article that had been padded up to make a book. I feel like I know very little more about Beck than when I started reading. I guess if you're into statistical information with regards to who played on what song and who directed which video (this information takes up half of the book) and what songs Beck played at each appearance, you'd like this book. As for me, I expected to learn more about Beck as a person and have more insights into his songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like all filler...","review":"The first few chapters of this book were good, Jovanovic had material on Beck's childhood and how he started as a musician. Then as soon as the book gets to the part when Beck releases Mellow Gold it gets boring. I, personally do not like Jovanovic at all. He acts like he is a music buff. He says Cake copies Beck. If anyone has heard Cake, then they know they sound nothing like Beck. They're completely different and unique. He needs more information to back up claims like that. I didn't flip through the book before I got it, and the 2nd half is all boring nonsense about individual songs, videos and art. It wasn't about Beck as a person at all.A tad boring, but If your a hardcore Beck fan, then it's worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not enough close ups to see how fingering should be.

Martyn Bedford's ambitious Houdini Girl is therefore the most anti-climactic novel of 1999, since it deals with the questions of deception and magic but desperately fails to conjure up any kind of wonder in the reader. There is a interesting subtext on how the mastery of magic is akin to male dreams of mastery over women in general, but it cannot make up for weaknesses in plot (ludicrous) and language (crude)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Mystery","review":"The Houdini Girl is an excellent novel that trancends the mystery genre.

If you use mostly light roasted dry beans, it may be OK. I clean the thing well and attempt to grind coffee and it is clogged before I have enough for a single cup brewer! I suppose I could clean it out several times during a grinding, but that is also very messy and is the last thing I want to do in the morning when I want some fresh brewed coffee.

It's a good idea to not put it on the table until food is actually served to prevent baby from tossing it before. Once the food is there, my son leaves it alone until he's done eating.The placemat washes up well in the sink, but every piece of lint or pet hair sticks to it because it's made of rubber. I just sprinkle a little baby powder on it to get things off of it.I would recommend this product because there isn't anything else out there that I have found that actually covers a table and almost stays in place.

It cleans easily and there are no icky chemicals in it.I can even attest to fabulous customer service from Kiddopatamus.

I recommend the Table Toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done. They stay in place better, and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table.

It works so much better than disposable plastic table mats at restaurants and folds up nicely. the crumb catcher works well. The only downside is that it does stain slightly if you put any pasta sauce on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as I expected","review":"Yes it stains easy, but with a lil vegetable oil it comes out easy too. Just let a few drops stay on overnight.Suctions are as good as any other, gives you enough time to stop the toddler from typical toddler things.Overall, impressed enough I paid full price for one to stay at home and put first one I got from consignment store in the diaper bag for on-the-go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attracts dust, dirt, etc.","review":"These are terrible. They don't really stick onto the table well; the little trough becomes a handle for the baby to pull the whole thing up, and worst of all is that the material attracts dust & dirt like a magnet, so unless you are just taking this directly from washing it in a sink, it will be covered will debris by the time you want to use it. Just bring some cleaning cloths to wipe a table instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, but doesn't work for my daughter.","review":"I bought this placemat because the idea of a tray that catches the food appealed to me. However, the tray is extremely flexible. When I used this for my daughter, she would press her body against it, put her hands in it, or bend it and the food would get all over her clothes. This was especially a problem when she would eat messy foods such as applesauce or spaghetti."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory","review":"I bought this thinking it would be great, but have been VERY disappointed.

Yet it has more table sucktions. It is so easy to wipe and clean off. I usually just run it under the sink water and throw it in the dish drain to dry for the next meal. It does dry quick. About once a week I put it in the top tray in the dish washer. It makes meal clean up real easy and the \\"catch cup\\" that hangs off the table is GREAT! Even food can slide or go past the bib onto legs, clothes ect. The catch up does stop falling food right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the active baby!","review":"Good concept but it doesn't have enough suction cups to hold it in place when a curious 14 month old tries to play with it instead of eating off it. As long as your child doesn't tug or pull at it then its okay but even just the littlest tug and the mat along with your childs food is all over! Its more of a hassle to use this thing than it would be to get the disposable table toppers that stick flat to the table! Do not recommend this to anyone with an active baby... especially a toddler!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The material has changed - no longer useable","review":"I bought a pink one of these for my daughter about eight months ago. It's wonderful and I don't know what I would do without it. I use it so much, I decided to get a second one. When it arrived I thought it was defective and returned it for another. The third one is just as awful. Unlike the first beloved one, the new model doesn't lay flat, doesn't keep it's shape, can't be washed in the dishwasher, and doesn't stick to the table. I am so sad that they ruined a product that I liked so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A baby enthusiast from Hayward, CA - United States","review":"As a first time mom I am very cautious of my 9-month-old son touching anything outside of my house. I give my son cheerios and a rice cake when we dine out and this product is fabulous......I love it!!!!! My son loves playing with his food....so he can rub his rice cake all over the tablemat and I don't have to worry about him picking up any germs with this mat. The food catcher is great....he looks for cheerios and rice cake crumbs in it.The only advice I would give is that before you put the mat down and push on the suction cups, you should use a wet one or wipe to wet the suction cups and then place it on the table. I found that it holds in place much better and the box that it comes in says to wet the suction cups as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing better out there","review":"We've searched everywhere for something our daughter can eat off of when we go out to eat. We tried using a napkin, but she'd either end up eating paper or pulling it all off into the floor. And those disposable placemats work basically the same way. We were thrilled when we found the tiny diner! Yes, occasionally the suction cups won't always stick completely down depending on what the table is made out of. But, the weight of the rubber, plus the texture of it alone, keeps it from sliding more than anything else would. But any cons are well out weighted by the pros! This is easy to carry, easy to clean and fun for kids to eat off of. A must have, as far as I'm concerned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Placemat","review":"Fairly useful.......helps to keep baby from getting to the \\"table germs\\".

OK Product","review":"My 11 month old is asserting her independence these days and wants to eat on her own. I like this product which works great in restaurants. It covers a large enough table area, I have no problems rolling it up and washing it later on at home and it fits perfectly into the insulated lunch box we use to cart around her finger foods. My only complaint is the \\"trough\\" as we have nicknamed it. It does well at catching dropped food bits, but it's also a perfect place for my daughter to grab on and pull the the whole placemat off the table! We're considering cutting it off ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baby Product Ever","review":"I found this randomly in a catalog and ordered it. I am not a germaphobe but I couldnt help but wonder what else my daughter was eating when she ate off a restaurant table. This solves the problem. She is eating on a clean surface. Easy clean up. Roll it up and walk away. Wait staff loves it. I will buy this product for a baby gift every time from now on. It's awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stick","review":"I bought this thinking it would be handy to take to restaurants, but it doesn't stick to many different types of tables.

We wanted to save time on the after-the-meal cleanup, but it has not changed. Our 18 month old is more concerned with taking the thing off the table or trying to fold it back up and play with it, than he is with eating his food. It is just more of a mealtime distraction for us!Besides, the suction cup only sticks to one of the textures of our tile topped table!"},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful with wood tables","review":"we use this with a portable chair that mounts onto the table. When we clamp the chair down over the mat on our wood dining table it leaves marks from the clamps. The chair by itself makes no marks at all, so it must be some type of reaction with the placemat and the wood. be careful...... have put some heavy card stock in to separate from the table and seems to do fine. other than that it works great. easy to travel with and easy to clean (if you take it off the table and throw it in the sink... doesn't wipe off real well with a damp rag)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Collecting Dust","review":"I bought this thinking it was a great concept. It ended up not being practical at all. It does not stick to many surfaces for starters. I originally bought this for my son when he was about a year old and he was able to scrape it right off the table so all the food on it ended up a big old mess on the floor. Now I decided to try it out with my younger son recently and same thing, ripped it right off the table. Now it sits on a shelf in the closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if you baby doesn't pull it off the table","review":"My son figured out during the first use how to pull it off of the table. He was trilled with the little crumb catcher and kept pealing it back to look underneath. He wouldn't even eat with it. I may just cut that part off with a pair of scissor and see if that works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I can't believe we didn't have this product SOONER! Instead - my husband and I would wipe down the entire table at a restaurant with disinfectant wipes from home. We must have looked NUTS!

We have 2 now: one for home - and one for going out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have","review":"We use this when ever we go out. It is easy to clean and easy to fit in the diaper bag. Only drawback is that my babies can pull it off the table really easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay suctioned","review":"This thing would not stay suctioned to the table. Period. Took it back the very same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap!","review":"the suction cups work for about 30 seconds. it is tough to get clean if your child eats pizza or spaghetti. i do like the spill cup in front but it just doesnt stay flat. i bought a $10 dog food mat at target that works better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The mat didn't lay flat or stay suctioned to the table. Milk cups repeatedly fell over due to this and rolled off table. It wasn't very easy to clean without soaking it everyday. We liked the thickness of it and thought the part the hung over the table was a good idea, but it just made a worse mess when the kids leaned over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on our table","review":"Didn't really think about whether the suction cups would work on a porous surface (they don't) so that's my fault. I've tried it on our bench top and it's ok, but because of the way it is packaged/rolled up it doesn't lay very flat. My baby can just pick it up and rip it off.The colour of the product received is much brighter than the pastel green in the image provided.Will probably re-sell or give this one away, or just keep it for traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work on my table","review":"I actually bought this at Baby's R US. I tried to use it on my oak dining room table and the suctions cups didn't work. The table has some texture to it, so that may be the problem. I will be returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has made dining out SO much easier!","review":"We regularly eat dinner at local restaurants and have been using this placemat for the last 6 months for our soon-to-be 2 year old. It is very easy to use- just unroll it, suction it to the table, and you're done! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the top suction cup often comes off the table (I think it's because of repeated rolling of the mat). But, even if it comes off the table, it doesn't interfere with my son's usage of the placemat. We often have people come over and ask us about it and the servers at our local restaurants REALLY appreciate it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Toddlers","review":"I bought the placemat for travel purposes for my 15 month old who loves to self-feed but will throw plates around if they are in front of him. In theory, this placemat is a great idea but the suctions are not strong enough for a toddler; he had this thing off the table in 15 seconds. Now it is sitting in the closet. I hate wasting money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money!!!!","review":"This is by far, the WORST $10 I EVER spent. The product comes rolled up and has yet to \\"settle\\".

Please do NOT waste your money on this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for eating out!","review":"I hated the messes that my daughter made in restaurants, and this was very helpful. Although it didn't eliminate it completely, it reduced the problem. WE used it for about 6 months before she got to where she pulled it off of the table all the time. Only problems are that it doesn't stick to all surfaces and it shouldn't be rolled up wet. I used a paper towel or napkin in it each time after I washed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, compact and easy to use","review":"We just used the Tiny Diner placemat for the first time last night. It worked great. It gave me a place to put down my 10 month old son's food since he doesn't use plates or bowls. Despite his best efforts, he could not pull it off of the restaurant table once I had attached it with the suction cups. When fully rolled out, this gave us plenty of room -- even with his typical goofing off, all of his food remained within the confines of the mat. Yet when rolled up, it's only about the size of a paper towel tube, so it fit easily into the diaper bag. I felt a little frivolous about this purchase when I picked it up sort of on a whim, but I am so glad I did! We will not dine out without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"We tried this placemat along with the disposable ones and neither worked for us. This one was just too bulky to carry in her bag...it never folded back up to the size it was in the box. We also had trouble getting it to stick to tables. The least little bit of moisture or texture and it wouldn't work. On the rare occasions that we could get it to work then we had to deal with cleaning it. Wipes didn't work and napkins were even worse. Most times my husband or I had to head off to the restroom to try to get it clean enough to take home. It honestly was more trouble than it was worth. We finally just opted for cleaning wipes in her bag...we clean the heck out of her area of the table and then just let her have at it. When she's done we clean up her mess.I understand the theory behind this product but it needs works before it's a real benefit and must have item."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge dissapointment","review":"the only thing that stands out on this album is gza and rass kass and rza's biochemical equation which by the way was all him because MF Doom killed it with his weak verse, if only deck and gza were on biochemical eq it would of been way better even classic status, rza kept it alive though.

A great album with tight lyrics represented from the finest heads in hip hop. To me, the stand out tracks are the ones by Aesop/Del, Rza/Mf DOOM, and the stand alone track by Del. The rest of the songs are tight and worth listening to, but there is really nothing new or inventive about this album. The songs featuring the GZA and Rass Kass are tight, but most of the album is classic street/hardcore hip hop, something which I cannot relate to. Granted anything by the Wu is worth listening to, and this album is worth buying, but as far as this album goes, this is classic hip hop at its finest.

In The Cleveland Orchestra Story: Second To None, author Donald Rosenberg reveals of the of how this came about, beginning with its origins under such memorable founders as the iron-willed impresario Adella Prentiss Hughes (the first woman to manage a symphony orchestra; shrewd patrons like industrialist John L. Severance; and eccentric, talented, dedicated musicians like Artur Rodzinki and George Szell. The Cleveland Orchestra Story: Second To None is the fascinating story of how these musicians and maestros, managers and patrons, repeatedly and successfully met and matched every obstacle in their way and makes for a gripping, complex, sweeping, highly recommended story of true drama and high achievement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosenberg's writing is as sweet as orchestra's sound.","review":"As a young Clevelander, 21 years of age, I remember vividly elementary school trips to hear the Cleveland Orchestra. One can never hear a school bus as quite as ours leaving the concert. We were all hushed by the sweetest lullaby we have ever heard.Rosenberg in jarring detail movingly shows both the high and low points of this great orchestral machine. His sources are both primary and secondary, leaving no stone unturned or untouched and leaves the reader completely at awe of how great this orchestra is.

There is minimalist work that has aged better than this; for example \\"Tago Mago\\" by Can, and some pieces by Philip Glass and Arvo Part. In the realm of early electronica, Jean Michel Jarre's \\"Oxygene\\" blows Riley's work away despite being only recorded 5 years later.The second piece (Poppy Nogood) is significantly more interesting than Rainbow imo, although both lack any real emotional depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly constructed chest","review":"First off let me just start by saying that this item arrived very quickly but unfortunately arrived damaged.

I can't imagine anyone being able to keep this for years of use. If it didn't arrive damaged, I'm sure my son, who is 1, would have this destroyed in a few days. I would def. steer clear of this product. I liked the idea that this was microfiber instead of painted wood which was what attracted me to it in the first place.

I've read through many of the reviews, and per usual, Madonna's lambs rush to save face and proclaim this her \\"best single yet\\". (In Madonna country, this has to be the lamest, most overused phrase.) Every single Madonna releases is \\"her best yet\\"--at least, that is what her lambs would say.I am still waiting for Madonna to follow up Ray of Light, which was brilliant. But, as long as her fans continue to be satisfied with the kind of mess on American Life, I am afraid Madonna's complaceny will continue.

Almost all mixes presented here are longer than 7 minutes, thus great to play in every disco.It is worth to mention that one of the best mixes here is done by Stuart Price (man responsible for bombs like \\"Hung up\\" a few years later).There is only one weak moment on this maxi single and it is track no 3.

The shoddy, inadequate elastic at the sides begins to tear out at the first wearing. The indicated sizes are nearly a full size too small. Still, even when ordering them a size larger so they'll fit, they're nearly impossible to get on because of the way the tops are designed.When items are closed out at long discount, there's usually a good reason.

Even with a shoe horn, it's very difficult to put them on. I'm telling myself that the material will become more pliable after I wear it a few weeks. Basically there's no shoelace.

A little bit of electrical tape under the clamp should take care of that.It doesn't shine to the sides as much as I'd like.One nice thing is the on/off button: You don't have to cycle through the different flash patterns to get to \\"off\\".

Both in terms of brightness and the increased visibility that comes from it's flash patterns, it blows the doors off of the cheaper lights that simply blink.

The class is children's literature and Mr. Roger Samples teaches it and he keeps it interesting the way he teaches the class. The book Madeline I did not like because it reminded me of a military school the way they had to eat and walk in squads every where they went. It also reminded me of an old boarding school where you had those mean teachers hitting the kids with a ruler when they answered a question wrong. I did like the rhyming words and would read this to my class. It tells you that her friends want to be cut up just so they can have a scar just like her. It does not tell they pain she had after the surgery or the painful recovery of rehab. The book makes you believe that having surgery is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic start of the Madeline series","review":"A short children's story about a young girl who lives with eleven other girls in a home in Paris and who has to go to the hospital to have her appendix removed. It was a 1940 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a book for children. This book, and others in the Madeline series, have become classics in children literature and every serious student of children literature should have it on their shelves.

The twelve girls' ordered, convivial life is well portrayed in unique illustrations and skillful writing which emphasize dramatic action rather than description. The great drama of this story is Madeline's appendicitis and subsequent visit to the hospital. The story ends in humor, with eleven little girls returning home from a visit there, and crying to have appendicitis so they can enjoy the candy and toys that Madeline received.The Madeline books have been loved by children for seventy years, for good reason. Their engaging illustrations, careful writing, and subtle humor combine to present a secure and romantic world that is very appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Children's book","review":"I wanted to have this classic in my library--especially after I was given a parody of it called Frankenstein--I thought the littlest grandchildren needed this one to understand a lot of the things in the parody.

But I do not remember such a specific event (you may recall, I have a memory of a thousand elephants) so I wanted to read it and experience this well loved classic picture book.Certainly Madeline, the character, had spunk. A lovable Anne of Green Gable spirited quality that is likable. Madeline stood out among the twelve children and put fun into a rigid routine. She initiated the spirit of being a lovely, carefree child which later the rest wanted to emulate.This is a wonderful and simple rhyming book for young children. The illustrations were a great compliment as well. The setting, a treat. Overall, a read that was whimsical and invited this reader to see Madeline's sweet outlook. It gave me a bit of a homesick feeling for similar innocent times in my girlhood.Simply a charming book.

Many significant engineering properties of soils are beneficially modified by lime treatment. Altough lime is primarily utilized to treat fine-grained soils, it can also be used to modify the characteristics of the fine fraction of more granular soils. Lime treatment can expedite construction, modify subgrade soils, and improve strength and durability of fine-grained soils. Lime-treated soils have also been used as modified subgrades, subbase materials, and base materials in pavement construction. The location of the lime-treated layer in the pavement system is dictated by strength, durability, and other design criteria. Railroad subgrades have also been successfully stabilized with lime.

Nor has he been a conventional rebel. He simply has focused on making nice music, rebellious, differente, sometimes, simply traditional, and on ocassion, straight-out comical. And his videos come across just like that. They are not conventional, but without beaing groundbreaking, they are nice to watch, fun for repeated viwing, and utterly enjoyable.That's why this DVD collection deserves five stars, although it contains NO significant extras: for the qualituy of tthe videoclips included here. Encompassing all of Brad's clips off his four platinum selling albums, the clips here are:1. Two People Fell in Love,2.Wrapped Around,3.I'm Gonna Miss Her,4.I Wish You'd Stay,5. Celebrity,6. Little Moments,7. Whiskey Lullaby,8. Mud on the Tires,9.

Within a few minutes of booting, it is uncomfortably hot on the bottom side.It is slow.The screen is just very average.The keyboard is OK...typically cramped.The USB ports are, unfortunately, on the back...as are other connections.Relative to my other portable (at 4 pounds) this is just not sufficiently lighter to convince one of the inconvenience of not having the CD ROM etc.I am sending this back."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks great, performs poorly","review":"I bought this computer after having used two sonys one ibm and one compaq. By far, this is the lightest and best looking of them all. However, the performance is so poor, its slower than the sony I used two years ago. It takes about 3 mintues for the computer to load and another three minutes to shut down. This may not sound like much time, but considering that this computer is less than one week old with no new programs installed, its really slow. The speakers are not so great either. And with only two usb ports, I will have to buy an extension if I want to run a mouse, an external CD and a video camera simultaneously.Overall, its a good buy, considering its super low price. But if you mind the speed, or lack thereof, purchase something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly slow to the point of being nonfunctional","review":"This is a very slick computer -- light, good looking. But it simply doesn't work well. The processor and hard drive are SO incredibly slow the computer is almost unusable. It takes SEVERAL MINUTES to open Microsoft Outlook or similar programs, the computer freezes constantly, the hard drive never stops spinning, the fan is always blowing, but the poor thing still overheats all the time. Get one of the similarly small Sony Vaios instead of this computer -- they have a fast processor and several times more ram. I only wish I'd figured this out in time to return mine ... now I'm stuck with a computer that looks good, but does nothing but slow me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thrilled","review":"I bought this, thinking that a metal card file would be nicer than a cheap plastic one. I was wrong. It's a cheap metal box. The sides aren't straight, and are not well put together. The lid does not close straight. The picture shows tabbed dividers with the cards. Don't be fooled - if you use tabbed dividers, like I do, you won't be able to close the lid completely. I ended up buying a plastic one that actually has room for all my cards, and the dividers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Plans for birdhouses","review":"I purchased this and one other book for my Dad. He loves them both. Well laid out plans. Easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Boone was a Man... A Big Man!","review":"I enjoy reading biographies, and have read several very enjoyable books. This is one of my favorite biographies.I enjoyed the way the author has clarified truth from probable fiction. He adds several stories that are likely not true, but prefaces them as such. Even the stories that are true are almost beyond imagination.Daniel Boone was a man that looked on life as an adventure, and never saw quitting as a possibility, even though he had some very difficult things happen to him and his family. There is a lesson for us all to be learned in Boone's resilency.I enjoyed learning about life in Boone's time. I am amazed at what both the men and women did to survive. The daily routine of Boone's wife would be enough to make most modern folks long for an extended vacation after one day.The book is well written, easy to read, and very compelling. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I did really enjoy this book; I think it gives a complete view of Daniel Boone life. While I have not read a lot on this subject, I do think this book will give you a nice overview of Daniel Boone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Man","review":"Great book about a great man. Anyone who grew up watching the tv show needs to read this book. Daniel Boone would make a great movie for the big screen. Listen up Hollywood. This book shows Boone as a real person. I would high recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to disagree with the other reviewers. Overall, this book was dull. While the subject is anything but dull, Faragher managed to lose my interest several times. Daniel Boone lived a fascinating life and was a legend but I struggled to finish the book. I probably should pick another author to read about Daniel Boone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Drake would be Proud","review":"Ben and Jason have fortunately knocked Belle and Sebastian those disingenuous indie layabouts into a cocked hat with what can only be described as a phenomenal album. The arrangements are intriguing yet melodic while the vocals are simply beautiful. I can't really imagine a better debut being released in the near future. An album to make you glad you are alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new original accoustic rock band","review":"It's an album which manages to keep your attention from the top to the bottom. Very talented musicians, a very promising debut. This a bit radiohead style but less \\"rock\\". Good experimentations with strings. Nice riffs and different guitars are used,which make the album quite eclectic. Anyone who likes radiohead, jeff buckley..should listen to it or buy it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book","review":"An excellent reference for the physician who cares for hospitalized patients. Just enough detail to care for patients of every severity and type of illness, yet not so much that you are bogged down in unimportant trivia and esoteric controversies. The book is up to date, and the authors obviously know their stuff. Things like indications for ICU admission and indications for discharge make this book invaluable for physicians who care for hospitalized patients. Now if only someone will write a similar one for pediatrics...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I loved this book when I was working as a hospitalist. It is a great reference book. Covers every aspect of hospital medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flat Screen TV/Monitor wall mount","review":"I have 2 of my 32\\" TVs mounted with this system. They are rock solid when mounted into a wall stud. They are made from heavy aluminum plate not flimsy sheet metal. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Did They Do It?","review":"How did Albert Murray and Dan Morgenstern manage to write an uninteresting and at times boring book about the great Count Basie? This is a sanitized and unemotional look at Basie's career. It is full of details that can only be of interest to a Basie historian- and that's about the only good thing you can say about it. I guess The Count wanted it that way. If you want to read everything about Basie that's ever been written, then buy this book. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one....","review":"Here it is folks.Another bland been- there-done-that romance film.Telling by the critics reviews and the ones on amazon, I will not be seeing this film anytime soon. Why do you ask? Well, one thing for sure, it has Hilary Duff in it. I'm no fan of Duff's-Lizzie McGuire was enough. It's a great show, actually, but Duff didn't want to be known as Lizzie for the rest of her life, so she left the thing that made her famous and went to something mediocre.Bottom Line:Duff, stick to TV and avoid music and movies. You will be saving a third world country. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilary Duff Fan","review":"I can't wait until this movie comes out. I am a hilary duff fan and I usually go and see whichever movies she's in. This one looks quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Best I've Seen From Hilary...","review":"I just saw this movie at a local movie theater. It was not as good as I thought it were to be. However, the movie is still good. This film is meant mainly for adults, but anyone at any agewill enjoy it. The film is about a family who moves from Wichitato Brooklyn because of their single mother's love life. When Jean(the mom) finds the love of her life, Jean's older daughter, Holly, doesn't feel comfortable with him, so she makes up \\"the perfect man\\" who is currently off in China so Jean will stray away from her current date. The film shows the consequences of meddling and the meanings of family and friendship. One of the reasons I gave this movie four stars is because it frequently goes back and forth between one man to another and I don't knowwho's who. Overall, this movie was a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So let me get this straight ...","review":"Heather Locklear is being romanced ... by her daughter?Does anyone else find this kinda creepy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"would give it 0 stars if i could","review":"this pathetic excuse for entertainment was so stupid and putrid. i had to take an enema after watching. avoid at all costs.all copies should be burned."},{"rating":"2","title":"could hear a pin drop","review":"I had seen this movie before. I walked into the waiting room for my MRI today, and you could hear a pin drop. There was a peremable silence, and I wondered what was going on. Then I saw the movie being played, and the attention of the people in the waiting room. The movie ended as I was filling out paperwork. I have never seen this reaction before. So...I ordered it from Amazon, and counted my lucky stars that it was still available. Good chic-flick, from what I remembered. I have never seen a movie not available anymore...weird. Glad I ordered, and can't believe the price I got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluffy, Cute, and Heart Warming","review":"If you go into this movie expecting it to be fluffy, cute, and heart warming then you will be pleased. If you are expecting a dramatic masterpiece then be prepared to be disappointed.I needed a good chick flick to sit down and have a good time with. This movie was just that! Hillary Duff is too perfect and it worked have Heather Locklear as her mom. They make a good team. The supporting cast is great and enhances the movie. Zoe, Locklear's youngest \\"daughter\\" is adorable and I can't wait to see her in more movies.It's a good heart warmer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"same old fluff","review":"an obvious variation of movies like parent trap and other films where kids try to hook up their parents with someone.

It was so bad that I couldn't stop watching it and that it the only nice thing I can say. Whatever were these people thinking when they wrote and read the script? It is cheesy. Choppy and not at all cute, which is what normally saves a chick flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"This is a cute movie. I'm fans of Heather Locklear, Hillary Duff and Chris Noth so it is good to see them all in a movie together and Carson Kressley from Queer Eye for the Straigh Guy is great too. BTW; ignore the review by the dude who calls himself John Q.

I checked a movie screening site, screenit.com, and it said that in the movie their neighbor is gay. I will not be supporting such behavior. I hope that Hilary's next movie is much better. I am usually a fan of hers, but I choose not to support this latest endeavor.If you absolutly just have to see this movie, then if I were you, I'd rent it instead of paying theater price, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, whatever....","review":"I am actually a Hilary Duff fan. I was actually really looking forward to this movie, but after discovering what this movie has to offer through reviews, I probably will never see it, not even when it comes out in rental stores or the dollar theater.I'll give you my reasons:1. After reading the review on www.screenit.com, I came to the conclusion that this movie should be rated PG-13 and is not really a family film.2. There is a gay guy cast as one of the main characters and this kind of behavior should not be endorsed.3. From what I've heard about this movie, it sounds bland, boring and a movie that should be skipped.So there are my reasons. Please save your money and don't go see this movie. Instead, see one of Duff's other movies such as Raise Your Voice, A Cinderella Story, Cheaper By the Dozen, Cadet Kelly, or Lizzie Mcguire. I hope that the next time Hilary Duff will not compromise and be in a movie as terrible as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rental Only","review":"This is the weakest Hilary movie I have seen. Suggest you rent it before considering purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, AWFUL MOVIE!!!","review":"It was absolutely terrible, horrible, hideous, and disgusting! Hilary Duff and that bitchy little girl make me want vomit all over the people who love that movie and the movie itself. Such bad acting! What is Hollywood coming too? But the guy from the Freaky Friday movie is hot I'll give you that. But no no!!! Not ever!!! Never ever in your dreams watch this terrbile film! I'm warning you kiddies! You'll be sorry later!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BE WANRED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mermaids Redux","review":"Very similar to the 1989 movie Mermaids with Cher and Winona Ryder. This teen romantic comedy stars the genetically blessed mother-daughter duo of Heather Locklear and Hillary Duff. Mom moves every time she breaks up with a guy and when the trio arrive in Brroklyn, Duff's character wants to stay now. Her and her new friend create a fake online beau for mom to stay in town until the gag goes out of hand. Turns out the friend's bachelor uncles is a perfect match for mom while a cute classmate jsut may be what the overprotective daughter needs. A cute comedy about playing around with match.com and how running away never solves your problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"Looks like another winner from Miss Duff! I can't wait to see it. Not only is Hilary Duff in it, but also Heather Locklear. Looks like a promising movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"Although overall on the cute side, the story is a lot better than expected. First of all, it gets points for being upbeat and having a good message (unlike so much other trash etched onto metal). Some parts are almost philosophical in how the mother has to come to terms with her opinion of herself. Some interesting twists and symmetries in the overall arc of the story, although the ending was a bit too \\"perfect\\". Refreshingly, apparently nice guys do still exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD","review":"Awesome movie. I loved it alot. It's very interesting and funny. Funny for the whole family. Buy it. It's definitely worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real punch","review":"It's hard to tell if this movie is meant for kids or for adults. It suits neither. In the ends it's boring and just a rehashing of past romantic comedies. It's not even good, and as far as Duff movies are concerned, it was pretty bad. It tries to please the adult and the tween, but manages to please neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad movie","review":"When are these Disney chicks gonna get a life? Do kids even understand it's close to impossible to getting a decent apartment in NYC? Do they have any idea that moving is really expensive? Can a mom work at a bakery to support 2 kids like that? Obviously Hilary likes some kid at school and the mom isn't gonna go out with the dad because he dosn't really shine until the end. \\"Oh yeah by the way, before the credits come on, will you marry me?. And some of this material is from other shows.Did it hurt?\\" was from a Jimmy Neurton episode on tv. And a bunch of these that go on in this movie seem so familiar it's not even funny. Hilary, get a life. Nobody sees her movies so why still make them? Looks like her singing broke a couple windows..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duff and Locklear are so annoying....","review":"There may have been movies where mothers and daughters were cast well, this was not one of them. I can not say which is worse. Duff who sounds like an airhead, or Locklear who tries to be a serious actress and comes across in this movie as little more then a wooden tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"War as it really is","review":"The best thing about this book is its honesty. It presents war as it really is: brutal, dehumanizing, miserable and painful. There is no attempt to justify anything, or to explain the history and politics of the time. There is just a description of one man's experience in war.Willy Peter Reese wanted to be a writer, so he wrote about his experiences. The first part of the book is over-written, as if he was trying too hard. But in the second half of the book, Reese matures as an author as he matures as a soldier. There are some powerful passages that will awaken memories and feelings in anyone who has been in circumstances where life has lost its attraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"first rate","review":"reese's book is a collection of personal writings never intended for publication as they appear in 'a stranger to myself' (some of the other reviewers may want to read the book's preface.). not a history book, not a collection of anecdotes about slaying the 'russian hoards', not even a memoir but rather the thoughts of an individual knowingly trapped in death's grip w/no hope of escape. little of the 'flash, boom, bang' most war memoirs offer but 'astm' far exceeds any other title in putting us in the \\"secret chambers of the soul\\".a book of what the author thought and felt rather than what he saw or did.absolutely first rate..."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUTHOR TOO INTERESTED IN PROSE NOT HISTORY.","review":"The deceased author was by his own admission a writer. His accounts of the war in the east suffer from his desire to be literate rather than detailed in his account of his experiences on the eastern front during the second world war. The majority of the his recollections are of such a general and vague nature you wonder whether the author truly experienced these events or just an expression of his imagination through prose.If you are seeking a detailed day to day account of the war in Russia this book is not for you. After reading this book I did not gain any increased sense of what it was like to be, or the motivations of a common German soldier, or the war in Russia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Lacks details. Reads like a poetry book","review":"I found this book to be quite boring. It lacked detail. The author never wrote a word about any of his comrades as if they didn't exist. It was like he was the only one there. It was very surreal as if the author was in a constant dream. If you want to read a great first person account try Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer."},{"rating":"2","title":"war captures the soul","review":"The Greeks accorded Aries in their pantheon: a jealous, spiteful god that promotes a self-generated, ever thirsty desire for risky assault, destruction, and revenge - elevating (like the most powerful narcotic), and simultaneously abysmally sickening. Accorded power, Aries assumes complete control in a cycle of destruction, wounds, pride, and revenge.The lesson of this work is peace and normal life become abhorrent to one (even the most artistic and promising) who tastes combat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine...If You Like Poetry","review":"I was excited to read what sounded like a fascinating memoir from a relatively rare point of view: a German solidier on the Eastern front. What I ended up with was a rambling, at times barely coherent attempt at writing memorable quotes. By the time I was 2/3 of the way through the book, I found myself pleading, \\"Just tell me what happened! Quit trying to sound so poetic!\\"Toward the end of the book, Reese finally starts describing what he was going through in a less-flowery manner. Then it became pretty interesting. It just took a LONG time to get there.Reese's story is a tragic one, but there are more informative war memoirs out there if you want actual information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and poetic","review":"A young soldiers diary of his years on the Russian front. Ending near the time of his death it recounts the price humanity pays for war."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE I COULDN'T GIVE IT ZERO","review":"There are two types of writers...one writes to inform the reader, the other writes to try to impress other writers. Mr. Reese tried the latter, but didn't acomplish either.Reading this book is like trying to understand a sloppy drunk stranger explaining why his wife left him....it doesn't make sense and it's b-o-r-i-n-g.It's ironic that a Frenchman with a German mother, who also spent WWII in the German Army on the Eastern Front and who never claimed to be a writer (Guy Sajer), wrote the book that is everything that Reese's book wanted to be, and isn't.If you are looking for the ultimate \\"can't put it down\\" memoir of a soldier that brings home the horrors of war along with humanity at it's best and worst, get \\"Forgotten Soldier\\" by Guy Sager.Like Coke, it's the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"soldier-poet wannabe","review":"This book has a great cover and not much else. If the actual combat could be condensed into a smaller book, it would be about 15 pages long. Unfortunately, one has to painfully sift through some pretty bad prose or attempted poetry. He's like the Bonnie Parker of the German Army. His references or image to us wearing a mask were so redundant I could have screamed. I'd bet he used the \\"mask\\" image no less than 20 times, and in a small book that's 19 times too many. I only wish it could have been a true combat memoir and not a failed attempt at a Hemingway/Sasoon legacy. I truely wish for his sake that something better did book-wise come from his experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shel Silverstein: Poems and Drawings : Slipcase 3-Book Box Set","review":"Very creative and interesting reading for my students and myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A purely enjoyable read","review":"I purchased this book with the intention of reading a few chapters here and there over a week or so.

They're perfectly sized for baby's hands to explore. The variety of textures on the toys seemed to fascinate him, and he loved to swing them back and forth, suck on them, and play with them while in his car seat. His fave is the elephant -- great for distracting him for a few minutes! It's also handy that you can attach to them to a baby gym, but frankly, I rarely did; they are handy in the diaper bag for when we travel, or (now that he's creeping), roll-around-the-floor time.They've held up well and now -- at nearly 7 months old -- my son still thoroughly enjoys them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toys!","review":"I recieved these as a shower gift and my son loves them!

She's 7 months old now and every time we go riding she pulls them off the seat so she can have up front and close play. She especially likes the butterflies.

Thought it was good and I ordered 2 brand new sticks. Tested them and they were defective. The joystick seems to have fallen off from the base. The other stick problem's weren't recognizable until you get to test a game out. I've been playing SF2 games since 1994 in the arcade and have been throughout my life.

I bought it thinking that it would be cheaply made and the reception would be poor. However, after using it for a while, I have found that it holds up well. I've also not had any reception issues, and that's also with going through a wall to the base unit. The receiver doesn't require any additional power, but the stick requires 3 AAA batteries. I haven't had to change them yet, so I don't know how long they actually last. I'm sure there are some fighting game masters that could find a better stick, but for this amount of money and the fact that it's wireless, it gets 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I am unsatisfied with this product.

But this is honestly my least favorite.Track #2 \\"Gleichschaltung\\" is a cool spoken word piece with an artsy, jazz/noir feel. Unfortunately it's the only vocal track on the album. The rest is squealing saxophone improv with various sounds mixed in. Honestly, it's quite grating after a few tracks. There are some amusing/creative moments, but overall I didn't care for it (To be fair I've only listened to it twice, maybe it will grow on me). It's worth a listen, sure. But I'd make it a low priority among this artists work.So, If your looking for some art/noise/jazz fusion go ahead. But beware there is little poetry or vocals. For that, I recommend EVERY KING A BASTARD SON (it does not disappoint.)Every King a Bastard's Son"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sumo 'death' tube","review":"We purchased this 'wearable' towable last summer (2006) during our lake vacation. I was the first one to try it. It submersed me under water to the point that I couldn't breath. I never came back out of the water and when I let go of the rope, I further torpedoed down. I had to struggle quite a bit to get back out of it so that I could get air. Two very strong men with us also tried this item. They had to hold on and hold their breath for quite a while until they finally came out of the water at high speed.

When I first took it out of the box I was amazed at how real it looks and feels. It's a fairly weighted ring, does not feel cheap. Once I put it on, I fell in LOVE with it! I actually like it better than my real ring! I have read other reviews that say the center diamond is to small or set low, but in my opinion, thats what I love about it the most, it gives it this modest yet expensive look. I didn't want a fake ring that looked to unreal for me to be wearing or too REAL that I get mugged! (meaning HUGE& SPARKLY) Overall I'm very very happy with my ring, and I would recommend it to anyone! :)UPDATE:01/10/11I am so sad, after wearing the ring just a few days one of the stones fell from the solitaire.

I wore it for the day, took it off that night, and realized that it was scratched where the stone on the engagement ring meets the wedding band.I am sadly disappointed in this purchase. It was cheap, and now I know why. I was unsure of whether or not I actually wanted a fancy diamond wedding set, and this answered my question, at a very inexpensive price. I now know that the traditional wedding set is not for me. I'm glad I purchased this ring first before I purchased something far more expensive.At a glance the ring is beautiful.

The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 was because the center stone should be set up higher to allow the two rings to nest.

It's been around since the 60's, (then on vinyl) but that's what makes it so endearing. It has played in the background of so many past Christmas' in my life, that it's become a tradition.

While you might expect \\"traditional\\" readings of holiday favorites, and Williams sports a conservative image, there is exceptional energy and daring in several of these interpretations and arrangements. My personal favorite is \\"Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells\\", a breakneck pop/rock variation on a worn-out theme featuring Williams climbing the scales (as he tends to do) and some welcome alternate lyrics. \\"Happy Holiday/the Holiday Season\\" is an upbeat anthem that finds Williams sounding particularly bouyant, and \\"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year\\" is perhaps the most celebratory holiday song ever recorded. This is a sincere album featuring a very versatile and talented vocalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Holiday Album by Andy Williams","review":"I heartily agree with the reviewer from PA. No Christmas music collection would be complete without Andy Williams' wonderful yuletide crooning. Having grown up in the 1960's, watching Andy's annual holiday specials was a real treat.

Like another reviewer mentions, a large portion of the book contains photos that don't give a feel for CT at all and one wouldn't know these photos were taken in CT, if not for the brief description telling one so.

The saga of life in a nutshell; how long till it achieves the classic status it deserves? If Animal Farm was the classic of totalitarianism (if it now seems 'bleeding obvious' we've partly Orwell to thank) Viskovitz is surely the classic-in-waiting for our own unidealistic era, the continued existence in which of the Darwin-deniers only underscores the absolute centrality of Darwinian ideas to our world-view.And guys, the biological language is intended to bamboozle, to 'blind you with science' - some of it's even made up (real or not, I loved the fauna in the penultimate chapter). Another must-have for schools - a fun read and a good starting point for debate philosophical, ethical, scientific.An equally jolly-but-deadly-serious read is Gwyneth Lewis's Hospital Odyssey (it rhymes, but let that not put you off - like Viskovitz's, her travails are Everyman's)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal, amazing!","review":"it's true that I started studying Biology, and then switched to Design - maybe that's why I still have an interest in the animal world.

It's a decent tune, although it's on \\"Californication\\", so it's unlikely anyone would buy it for this.The b-sides on part 2 are a pair of live tracks-- \\"Me and My Friends\\" and \\"Yertle Trilogy\\". It's certainly interesting to hear the band tackling a pair of later songs, but by and large neither are particularly exciting-- \\"Me and My Friends\\" comes off better live than it does even recorded live, and admittedly \\"Yertle Trilogy\\" is a lot of fun, but more goofy than anything else.Invariably, collectors will want this, but more casual fans can skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to Understand People Better","review":"If you want to know people close to you better, this book is a very good reference material.

Dr. F. de Jong, as usual, has pulled off a coup with this collection on Sufism and its nasty enemies.De Jong's writings are clear, concise, and weighty with original research.

Her songs are fine; it's mostly everything else in this movie that bothers me.The script is bland with nothing of interest for the older viewers but some mild innuendos and celebrity references. As much as I disliked it, however, I did think that it was nice that they had a few extra tidbits from the book.Oh, and I'm all for making Dorothy stronger than the original movie but why a wannabe star? Miss Piggy is amusing but not enough to block out the blah performances of the usually wonderful Muppet cast.

This is -- by far -- probably the biggest Muppet fiasco since Jim Henson died. It's really sad, and really pathetic.Obviously low-budget, the plot reminded me of something I might have written as a 9-year old in 3rd grade. Ashanti's acting was absolutely terrible.

And my wife and I repeatedly exchanged glances as we could not believe the inappropriate humor that was throughout this movie.Jokes about being sexy... jokes about nipples... jokes that do NOT belong in anything with the Muppet name on it.With Muppet Treasure Island, the storyline stuck close to the story we know and love. With Oz, the muppets put a modernized twist on the story that sucks in all the cynicism of modern day living and leaves the innocence of the muppets in the dirt.A HUGE \\"Boo!

I love the muppets, two of my favorite movies EVER are the Muppets Christmas Carol and Muppet Treasure Island. The acting in this one was incredibly weak, the few songs that they had sounded like TV sound tracks, canned and lifeless. Many of the jokes and visuals were supposed to be funny for adults but went over the line for young kids (e.g. the female \\"wizard\\" with her big gazambas hanging out), and too mean or violent (the prolonged showing of a bloody buzz saw over Dorothy's legs). Even Kermit looked fake. If I could rate this in the minus range I would.

I don't know who is turning over in his grave faster, Jim Henson, Walt Disney or L. Frank Baum. What could have potentially been a good idea ended up a total bomb. Many of the jokes were inappropriate, the modern storyline was uninspired, and Ashanti couldn't be a worse choice for the role of Dorothy. Add another person to the list of people turning over in their grave - Judy Garland. The saddest part was that I waited over a year for this movie after first hearing about it being in the works, only to lose interest before the first commercial. Shame on you Disney, you can do better than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Muppets are better than this","review":"The Muppet Wizard of Oz has taken all of the elements of wit, style and clever insanity that have in the past made the Muppet show and movies to be timeless classics and completely disposed of them. The director, producers and writers left the selling point of the movie entirely up to classic caricatures of Kermit, Rizzo, Gonzo, and the rest of the Muppet cast to carry the story line along and all the while leaving out things like good storylines, or writing new materials in their humor. The only new humor that I detected at all was in cheap innuendo, not in wholesome family humor. I say all of this with the utmost respect, not to ridicule Jim Hensen studios, but as a big Muppet fan myself to encourage them on to greater masterpieces, and to play the Muppets out to the capacity that we all know and respect them for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I love the muppets, especially their spoofs off of classic movies and books. THis however, was a disaster and I think it gives the muppets a bad face. The comments and jokes were pretty crude and the acting (Human, that is) was absolutely terrible!But the thing I was most disappointed about were the songs! I was looking for great renditions of the classics, but go stuck with disasterous mock ups that made little or no sense at all!Don't buy this shadow of the muppets greatness. Get the classics, like \\"A muppet's Christmas Carol\\", or \\"Muppet Treasure Island\\". THose are the best by far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So very sad...","review":"I love (love, love, love) the Muppets, and checked this movie out from my library. I don't think I made it past 10 minutes- the point when Rizzo makes a comment about \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" movies. I'm an adult and was completely appalled. It's one thing to make a subtle joke in a kid's movie that adults can titter about, it's another to blatantly refer to an adult film production. How do you explain that to a curious child? I see from the other reviews now that the rest of the movie is garbage, and I'm glad I didn't continue watching (or buy it for that matter). What a shame that this movie wasn't done the way it should have been. I'll go watch the Muppet Christmas Carol and try to shake off the awfulness of what I just saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would turn back if I were you.","review":"This movie is bad, I am truly sorry that I rented it. It scares little children into not liking the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" story. The adult innuendo is not entertaining. The Characters ALL have bad scripts. What was with Miss Piggy's wicked witch character? She was genuinely frightening to 3 and 4 year olds, and to adults campy, and boorish.

Although this is an official Jim Henson Company release, it seemed more like a cheap knock off of a Muppet movie. As if the idea behind this film was only to make money by using the Muppet name. The Muppets were just the supporting cast to the human actors. Lacks the cleverness and timing of the other films. Three year old children and people who are not tuned into the real art of Jim Henson and the Muppets will love it. Rent it don't buy it. Like buying a $25.00 Rolex from a city street vendor - It may look like a $4000.00 wristwatch, but it isn't the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!

But offensive?If you're going to be offended be offended because of how lousy the entire thing was. Be offended by Ashanti's (lack of) acting. Be offended because of the mischaracterization and the tepid pacing. Be offended because it looked like it was shot on VHS tape. Be offended again by Ashanti's acting...Don't be offended because Gonzo has nipples.

While what I've seen doesn't compare to the older Muppet Movies, I just wanted to interject to parents everywhere that the \\"Muppets\\" were never made for children. It was a primetime variety show in the late '70s, definitely geered towards adults. I think parents confuse the Muppets with the Sesame Street characters which Henson did make for Children. Anyway, if you watched the original movies (Muppet Movie, Muppets Take Manhattan, and Great Muppet Caper), these all had numerous sections of adult humor that kids would not understand and is actually inappropriate for some children. But this was never the aim of the Muppets, to cater to children, as I mentioned before. So if you want wholesome viewing for children, stay away from any Muppets alltogether. But if you want to watch some genuinely funny Movies, yet still adult oriented, watch the original 3 Muppet Movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Muppets' Wonderful Wizard of Oz","review":"Our family of four thought the movie was excellent. The only bad parts were the commercials and we can't wait for it to come out on DVD. My husband and I still laugh about the nipples line, that is just funny. \\"What do these do?\\" \\"Nothing, those our my nipples.\\" I chuckle now. And for those who may be misled Rizzo said \\"witch slap.\\" The running gag of Pepe being a King Prawn and not a shrimp is classic Muppet humor.

They picked the right cast members as well. Every mupet was choosen carefully and was the perfect ideal for their role in the movie. One example: Miss piggy was the wicket queen....Gonzo was weird hopeless scare crow/romatic just as he was in the muppet babies orgianl cartoon. Fuzzy became the fuzzy but cowardly lion, much like his orginal character on mupet babies saturday cartoon show.......I really dont understand how some reviews would not think 100% of the show. The soundtrack is pretty great too. My kids watched it again and again. We even took it to a slumber party and the kids loved it too.* Nwk NJ Sista*age:30-35"},{"rating":"1","title":"The curse of \\"Muppet Treasure Island\\" returns","review":"As a major Muppet-head, I am disappointed to say that I will not be adding \\"Muppet's Wizard of Oz\\" to my collection (just as I never added \\"Muppet Treasure Island\\"). Why? Because they're just not Muppet-worthy. Despite \\"Wizard's\\" few saving graces (Piggy in biker gear and eye-patch, Pepe's irresistible adult humor throughout) the movie fails to entertain and meet the Henson standard. Ashanti as Dorothy is lack-luster at best (and her choreography is embarrassingly bad). Many plot concepts at first seem clever but never quite gel. Worst of all, Fozzie sounds like Piggy!Put this one in your Netflix queue for some Pepe and Piggy laughs, but beware of spending $15plus on a copy to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo Disappointed!","review":"I love everything that has the Henson name stamped on it and I have loved the Wizard of Oz since I was a kid.

My expectations were set very high but it was beyond bad, it was probably the worst movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muppets a Huge Disappointment","review":"The Muppet Wizard of Oz was a film that didn't have any magic to it whatsoever. It is highly inappropriate to have sexual references, even in regards to Gonzo's nipples, it is not appropriate for little kids to listen to this sort of garbage. What the hell is up with Brian Henson? Apparently Disney is just trying to follow with everyone else in this sex crazed world. There is no more creativity left and that is just wrong.In response to someone who left a comment saying that in the old variety shows of the 60's and 70's was there any references to nipples back then? I think not, and references of any kind back then was so hard for a little kid to figure out on their own, they were very much more hidden and more dryer. Nowadays it is just like sexual references are the only thing that is funny out there and it is just sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quit the human race","review":"This has got to be the absolute nadir of so-called \\"family entertainment\\".

Well I have news for these bozos; They want what they've always wanted; charming, witty and decent entertainment. If I sound a bit angry and annoyed over this P.O.S. I have a very good reason. This is not only unfunny, cheap and badly made, lacking any hint of the wit and charm of the Henson films, but it's vulgar to boot. Nipple pinching gags? There are so many things in this video that are unacceptable for small children that you might even find copies of this thing in the dumpster at a trailer park. Jim Henson and the Pixar people had the sensitivity and intelligence to realise you could entertain the parents of their intended audience with wit and charm. \\"Hipness\\" and sewer humor is a pretty pathetic substitute for quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to the Muppet name.

This movie gives the Muppets a bad name.When my 7 year old daughter came home from school today she burped and I said \\"ugh\\" she replied, \\"What do you smell it or something?\\" I was appauled and told her never to repeat that rude comment again, only to find out later she was quoting a line from MUPPETS WIZARD OF OZ!!!There is no reason to tear apart the acting, the script was to blame for most of the trouble.I not only don't recommend watching it, I recommend avoiding exposing your children to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney finally gets it's hands on OZ and this is what they come up with?!?!","review":"Disappointment doesn't even begin to describe my reaction to the film. It all starts with the writing, obviously this was written by someone who knows little about the Muppets and their humor. There is absolutely no charm or class in this entire film. Ashanti is passible at best, the muppets have no real personality, the effects are an atrocious mix of bad lighting and \\"Sesame Street\\" like sets. It also would have been nice to have the music composed by someone who knew what they were doing. If you're going to make a musical, get someone who can do some catchy tunes.

Really nice use of common tempo.Perhaps my favorite track is the pairing of Dancing in the Dark and Dancing on the Ceiling. I must sound like a broken record in my praise of this music, but this one is enchanting.This album was made in the early days of stereo recording when engineers took pains to separate the \\"right\\" content from the \\"left\\" content ... and that shows up nicely on some of these Conniff Singers early recording ... at least if you listen carefully.The only disappointing thing about this is that Conniff is gone now so he's not making more like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing Back Memories!","review":"I had the LP back in the 60's.

Each song is a story into it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topical, but still relevant","review":"On his third album, and first of all original material, Bob Dylan chose to focus primarily on protest songs in the vein of \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" from his prior album but more refined. This may make the album less striking and timeless than its predecessor, but it's still a good album by any means. Some of Dylan's greatest protest songs are here, including the legendary title track, \\"With God on Our Side,\\" and \\"Only A Pawn in Their Game.\\" There are also other types of songs: the long, tear-jerking narratives \\"North Country Blues\\" and \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol,\\" the romantic yet bitter \\"Boots of Spanish Leather,\\" and the world-weary \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" and \\"Restless Farewell.\\" All in all, this cannot be considered one of Dylan's very best albums, but it is certainly very good and a must for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This CD is so pure.

Words are inadequate to describe Dylan's work on this album. I purchased the vinyl of this album and listened to it in glorious monophonic sound. The first three tracks are beyond incredible and listening to them you realize that Dylan, only in his 20s, seems to have been around since the dawn of time. His wisdom regarding war, poverty, injustice, depression and hope is timeless. This work epitomizes the possibilities of the youth movement in America in the 1960s and the possibility, if one listened to Dylan carefully, that progressive and liberal change in America could be successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album - well recorded","review":"Sounds so natural. The packaging also was first class. feels like being in the show at that time. will keep buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The height of his folk style protesting","review":"This is a great album. all the songs offer insight to the period and Bob's own thoughts. Personally, I like just about every song, but if you're into the electric Dylan, skip this album. He sticks with his acoustic and harmonica and doesn't make exceptions. But as I said, all the songs are great.

TT lived several months each year alone in a tent unarmed for more than a decade in prime bear country in the Alaskan wilderness. One day, probably too late, we will drop our hardened exteriors and try to really love our fellow creatures as many of us instinctively did as children. To me TT is a Gandhi of what is euphemistically called the environmental movement, which is nothing else but the slow demise of the human race because we are species-centric, loving first family, then country, then humans.

The movie in black in white is not appealing, and I lossed interest because of it. Elizabeth Taylor plays a rich girl, while Montgomery Clifts plays the role as the poor lad who is drawn towards Taylor. The plot is simple, based on Clifts desire for Taylor and his desire to kill his current love for this passion.

I was appauled at the beginning when George Eastman started having eyes for the wonderful Angela Vickers, but the chemistry between them made you want him to do everything he could to be with her. I think Shelly Winters character could have been better. They dressed her in the worst clothes and made her completely undesirable to George. This movie forced me to put myself in each character's position, I got caught up in George's dilema.

There are infinite subleties in the elaborate construction that is 'Place in the Sun', gorgeous cinematography and a smoothly luxurious cutting technique that, for a while at least, makes you think you are following a rather artificial love story about two beautiful doomed people, where in fact the tragedy unfolds in a relentness, downbeat manner that makes you almost choke with pain. Elizabeth Taylor (and I was never a fan to put it mildly) is brilliant, and Montgomery Clift overcomes the limitations of method acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is my favorite movie! Montgomery Clift plays THE American role. Everyone is tempted my money, power, and beauty. Shelly Winters was excellant and I believed every line she said. Elizabeth Taylor was great too! I think this is the difinative movie on greed and wealth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Place in the Sun","review":"Veteran director Stevens adapted this Academy Award winner from Theodore Dreiser's \\"An American Tragedy\\". This cautionary tale of a doomed love triangle holds you captive, buoyed by charismatic performances from both Clift and Taylor. Yet the young Winters shines brightest in the most unglamorous of parts, stealing the movie from its photogenic stars, and netting herself an Oscar nod. (Stevens actually won for Best Director)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about the American aristocracy of weath","review":"A classic American novel about the striving of a poor relative,his mistress and his true love, becomes high drama.The acting of Montgomery Clift with his wide ideas and flat deliveryis very believable.Elizabeth Taylor is the rich girl that would be everyman's love.The success of this movie changed the lives of everyone involved.I think that Shelley Winters as the mistress gets less of the credit for the success than she deserves.This movie is very close and moving for young people who are poorand caught in a system of wealth and privilege that resembles more the British system at timesthan the democratic institution we are lead to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged dvd","review":"received the dvd, and it was damaged upon arrival.

At first look, it seems that George Eastman is a shy, dimwitted man, who wants to mooch off his uncle. As the story progresses, George captures our hearts with his secret love relationship with Alice. The seemingly beautiful Angela Vickers soon entrances George, taking his mind off everything except her. As their relationship progresses, Alice becomes more and more distant-disgusted by George's actions. The spellbinding relationship between Angela and George is romantic. But as the world knows you can't have your cake and eat it too, as George realizes in the end. He ends up paying the price for his careless actions as he finds his own Place in the Sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Elizabeth!","review":"Time has taken away some of the edge off this film .

It's an excellent premise for a historical novel, and appears to have inspired Stew, whom I met when he was briefly in the Progressive Labor Party in San Francisco in the 1960s. The rest of his \\"revolutionary\\" adventures are imaginary. He's clever enough to have waited until most of the famous people he fantasizes about knowing are dead, and cannot refute his claims.

The rest of this CD is forgettable, a few songs are simply irritating. A great example of how many musicians like playing but really have no clue regarding how to put it all together. These guys need a better producer who knows \\"what to leave in, what to leave out\\" (to quote Bob Seger). It's not surprising you can buy this CD, used, for 1 cent (plus shipping) on Amazon right now. Not a bad work, just nothing particularly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Where to start? Poor disjointed script? Home movie camera with feeble attempts to be artsy?

I actually didn't know how it was going to turn out until the very end. This is a low-budget, independent film.

I really had no feeling one way or the other. I was very surprised by it. Although it was made in 2006, it is even more relevant today, with the fight for gay rights against the religious right. It shows that people can and do have different feelings, but that no one should try and force their believes on someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid story line, with significant current implications","review":"This is a nicely done story that could easily be about major U.S. politicians of today. While most of the acting is monolithic, Matt Newton presents a gut-wrenching emotional scene that \\"made\\" the film for me, while Karen Allen supports the entire film with a character having many facets and plenty of depth. Michael Lerner's character is easily hated, and rightly so, for a stunning portrayal of a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do, belligerent, self-absorbed politician."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD of the year and hardly anyone knows it!","review":"This is a CD others pretending to be singers wouldkill to be able to do and would die for the voice this woman has.

I don't care for Middle-Eastern music. I find it to be as nauseating as Oriental Music. Each cut on this album prompted me to skip to the next one in hopes of finding something reminiscent of her other works, but every cut was the same...nothing.

Her verson of St. John of the Cross' \\"Dark Night of the Soul\\" alone is worth the cost of this album.

A must for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never heard a sound more inspiring than her voice","review":"Every piece of music on this cd is enchanting. \\"Full Circle\\" brings you home, \\"Dark night of the soul\\" is a tranquil, powerful, beautiful love song that was brilliantly adapted and put to music, where it seemed to have been all along. Listen to \\"Prospero's Speach\\" at night, in a quiet room, with your eyes closed, her voice is like the mist in the trees, and the dew on their leaves. Loreena McKennitt inspires one to think, sometimes the questions mean more than the answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably one of Loreena's best CDs","review":"From the first time heard The Mystics Dream I fell in love with the CD. This CD is less Celtic then The Visit, and is alot more special, it is very spanish/ eastern oriented and the combination is not forced, it is very smooth and nice to hear (although some of the songs take some time getting used too like Full Circle). The sound comes out very 'mystic'. My personal fav is the last track (Prospero's Speech). The vocalic work is as wonderful as ever. It is very interesting to compere betweem The Bonny Swan and Clannad's Two Sisters, which is also based on the same legent"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"Loreena McKennitt's 'The Mask and Mirror' CD is a relaxing mix of celtic and near east music.

Loreena's voice is so pure and beautiful, I didn't even realize she was singing in English. This is a wonderful piece for bellydance with its strong doum-ca-doum-tek rhythym using middle eastern drums, you can follow the drumbeat for rhythym accent or her voice for flowing movement and veil work.Another middle eastern piece is Marco Polo on her album The Book of Secrets. It has a rather slow beledi rhythym with zils as accent. Good for background music between sets or for slow movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"this is the best new age cd i ever heard. i first started hearing it in dance class. and now finally we are doing a piece to bonny swan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mask and the Mirror","review":"In all, this is a very good album but there is a twist in The Bonny Swans; *drumroll* the electric guitar!

I like that you can order them with either the silver or gold metal part.They are well made and the beading is lovely on them. I feel they will add the perfect touch of sparkle to my hairstyle without being overly 'blingy'.I gave them a four rather than a five star rating because the comb part was a little misshapen upon arrival, which means they might be a little more flexible than some people might need, such as those with very thick hair. It was no problem to straighten them out though and they work just fine in my medium thick hair.I look forward to wearing these to my formal function."},{"rating":"2","title":"He was great from the beginning!","review":"Just bought the remastered 'Bob Dylan'.

Many books increase the contrast so much that you can no longer see definition in the dark areas of her painting, but not this one! Likewise, many books only show a few of her more popular paintings, but this large volume dug many up from obscurity and presents them in vivid, full-page detail.If you would like to own one book that covers all of Frida's works, this is it--look no further!

However, the quality of the DVDs themselves is very poor. The image is terrible. It was so fuzzy on my LCD screen that it hurt my eyes. And when the characters moved rapidly, there was a bunch of horizontal lines, and sometimes columns and things that should be vertical, looked curved in the middle. While the source material is not done on the best quality tape, there is still no reason the images on this DVD should be so bad that vertical images are deformed. I know this has nothing to do with my player, as other things look just fine.

I was only nine years old when I started watching, and I remember watching it with my grandmother. She would laugh hysterically at so many of the episodes, and, watching it now as an adult, I can completely understand why. The chemistry between all four women was amazing! I think that if they started showing this show again now, I'm pretty sure it could be as popular as it used to be. Just look at the latest success for Betty White. Still as hysterical as ever! (Although, it would be interesting to see reactions about the very 80s fashions, lol)All of the DVDs in this series collection worked just fine for me. I really enjoyed the bonus features. And, because I have a disability where manipulating a remote control can sometimes be awkward, it was nice to be able to just press play and it would play the entire disc which was roughly 6-7 episodes.

I admit, when they were on tv the first time round, I was in college, and wouldn't have been caught dead watching this show. Now if I am flipping the channels, and happen upon a rerun of this show - I watch. These shows are great. This set is great, because after my dad watches them, I'll get to watch. I think the show is more popular today than when it first came on. Either people consider this show a classic, or most of the tv reality shows and such, make us long for shows like the Golden Girls. For about 1.00 per show you have hours of laughing to do. Great set. Hope to get all the years when they come out. why did I give it four stars? I'm sorry, I do not like the way the disc are set up, putting one on top of the other (over-lap) - I know it doesn't hurt anything.

It is a treatise in/on nuclear physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough slog that's more about quarks than jaguars","review":"I picked this up because I thought it was going to have some information about Ecuador (the Jaguar section) in it. It does--about one whole pages worth. The rest of the pages concern Gell-Mann's ideas on the inter-connectedness of things. Gell-Mann, for those of you who don't buy the Nobel prize-winning scientist collector cards, was the identifier of the Quark, that object that is smaller than what had previously been thought of as the smallest element (electrons are made up of a collection of quarks). This book is interesting but rough slogging at times as Gell-Mann tries to give you an instant understanding of the last ten years of modern physics. This should appeal to fans of Richard Feynman and Douglas Hofstadter, although the style isn't as smooth as either of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The basics of information theory as relating to the science of emergent order is clearly presented","review":"This book gives valuable information on how complex systems arise out of a simple, natural ground. Gell-Mann's theories are useful in understanding chaos theory as well as many branches of quantum physics. A description of Gell-Mann's ecological explorations and efforts to maintain the biosphere is also given. The magician and student of physics will be well rewarded for reading Gell-Mann's work. The processes of consciousness and so magical phenomena may be understood in this light."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointingly dull, and lackluster work.","review":"Gell-Mann writes that this is his first and only book -- and that he came to write it to express to a wider audience his ruminations on \\"complex adaptive systems\\" (a phrase he seems happy to repeat again and again ...) and their relation to the fundamental world of physics. In this he fails, for his main points (which he has a hard time presenting concisely) are -- quite frankly -- rather obvious. (In this dismissal of his ideas I might well be mistaken; there may indeed be a treasure trove of ideas here. But if there is treasure to be found, it is buried well).What this book does offer is a concise summary of the complex world of particle physics which Gell-Mann helped to discover. This summary, taking up only a few short chapters near the middle of the book, is excellent. If Gell-Mann had maintained this level of precision throughout the book, it would have helped immeasurably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big and tall my azz","review":"13-15 in the land of tiny narrow feet people.

The price of this dvd is a real surprise. Amazon Verfied Purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay your own fare!","review":"After seeing this movie, one may not ever look upon Jennifer Aniston in quite the same way again. It's obvious that she's trying to break away from being stereocast as an actress for comedies. Looks like she's got her wish! This is a remarkably different role for her, and she pulls it off nicely.The premise of the movie is how two people meet up on a train heading to work. Both are married but end up fooling around anyway. It turns out to be the biggest mistake they'll ever make, and not JUST because their spouses might find out.What ensues is a chaotic nightmare that seems to just get worse & worse. Things are not all as they seem, and the story scores very high on the guage of sadistic intent. The story makes you feel like you're sinking in quicksand.So, if you're a fan of erotic thrillers, this one is certainly worth a look. I'll bet you'll pay your own fare from now on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment","review":"Although I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Aniston's, I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-paced thriller about a married man who meets an attractive woman on a train and arranges a hookup. His relationship with his wife is strained because their young daughter is seriously ill and the woman that he, Clive Owens, meets, Aniston, offers the promise of soothing his pain. Little does he know that the heartache and nightmares are about to begin!Jennifer Aniston plays a different type role, which is nice to see since she's usually typecast in that boppy, upbeat and giggly kind of way. She is serious, almost too much so, as a high-powered businesswoman.Owens, who I just saw in Children of Men, does a marvelous job and I loved the unpredictability of the story. Looks as though he's on his way to being the next Nicolas Cage.Sigridmac"},{"rating":"1","title":"Derailed? Nearly...","review":"In Derailed, the main character, played by Clive Owen, is a man under a great deal of stress. It's believable that he would meet someone like Jennifer Aniston and have an affair. What's more difficult to swallow is that he would go to such great length to cover his tracks instead of just coming clean with his wife.The acting here is probably the saving grace of the film. Owen and Aniston are great, and the rest of the cast is suitable, even if the nasty Frenchman is a little over the top.The script nearly wrecks the whole movie, trying to out-plot-twist itself too may times. In the end I was more confused than anything. Final grade: C-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Predictable and Silly","review":"my title says it all....I also, had this one figured out immediately and it killed all suspense, as it was so painfully obvious....I wrote this to answer the question one person asked about what happened to Jennifer? What happened to her is the same malady that has afflicted and ruined many a hollywood starlet in the last 10 years....ANOREXIA.......it does more than ruin your shape and body, it destroys your face.....go watch one of her older movies, as an example, look at her in \\"Picture Perfect\\" and then look at her arms, and body and sorrowful face now, as in this movie.....it is a crying shame....but she has plenty of company here....I could go on all night comprising a list of these people....."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Script Train is Derailed","review":"\\"Derailed\\" is just another movie with a half-interesting premise that's wasted by bad writing and marginal acting. The script is just terrible, with a couple of plot holes that are giant and dialogue that's at best an awkward series of cliches, and at worst sparse and unengaging. The characters don't develop, and Owen's stony performance isn't at all endearing.My new policy is that movies with rappers are not on my watch list. Rza and Xzibit both are simply rotten in the movie, even though they play parts with few lines. Anniston does not much better, showing off her legs but offering no hint of any ability as an actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable & regrettable.","review":"Why two actors on their way up would agree to this is a mystery.

Clive Owen does a good job and creates a believable character. Jennifer Anniston however, does not. She just can't pull it off and it is glaringly obvious throughout the entire film. Blame it on direction or inexperience with a role of this nature but bottom line is that it isn't working.I hadn't heard much about this film so I went into it with an open mind but it is necessary to point out that the plot line is blatantly OBVIOUS right from the start. Seriously, within about 15 minutes, you will have figured the whole thing out. Derailed is a good title for this one because the whole film gets derailed almost immediately. Worth the rental fee but not worth a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Clive Owen fans","review":"My star is for Clive Owen only - he is great as usual, although in a role that makes him look like a total wimp. The story has many holes in it as mentioned previously. Jennifer Anniston is horrible as Lucinda - totally miscast. There was no chemistry at all. How can any woman be so totally not hot around Clive Owen. And then agree to go to a seedy hotel with him. Only get this one if you're a Clive Owen fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thriller based in Chicago","review":"Someone somewhere in Hollywood is really trying their best to keep Jennifer Aniston's career alive. This thriller is based in Chicago and it is fun to watch Metra Union Station, downtown and I believe Evanston sites. But even fine actors like Clive Owens and Vincent Cassel cannot save this film with a predictable plot. Female audience - watch this with your husband/boyfriend, just as a way to gently remind them that at all times they are bait for the con - even on their way to work. Perhaps this movie can help them appreciate what they've got. Otherwise, this film is really just not worth mentioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"Consider it one of the worst movies I've tried to watch in years.

Not for kids, there's a rape scene, but...there are surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic thriller","review":"I thought this movie was great. The plot was fantastic and very unpredictable. Jennifer Aniston surely shed her \\"Racheal\\" persona for this one and did a fantastic job playing a \\"serious\\" character. Clive Owen did a fantastic job with his character and you could totally relate to all of his decisions through out the movie. You could really see him debate between what most would do, what he should do, and what he actually does. Xzibit and Rza's characters were well placed and they really fit into the movie. If you like Jennifer Aniston and are ready to see her in something unlike Friends or you are a Clive Owne fan this is a movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie...!","review":"Clive Owen is good.....very different from the rest and thats make this movie a 'must see'..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this from the GET GO.","review":"Clive Owens character really made me sick...he was so weak and stupid that I read this film from the get go...no wonder his marriage was in turmoil.How convenient that after he found out what was going on that he all of a sudden became the lone ranger who instantaniously became a one man hero.This piece of [...] made no sense and if you've seen as many movies as i have these poor excuses for TWISTS and TURNS are seem within the first 20 minutes of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"downright bad or okay film","review":"now first of all this isnt a kind of good acting and jennifer aniston looks unfit for the roll it sa sort of meg ryans role in the the cut made in 2005 and clive owens role is sassy"},{"rating":"1","title":"20 minutes done","review":"I got 20 minutes into the movie, up to the point where Anistons character gets raped, and turned it off. No where did I see a warning that there was a rape scene. Meaning on the box or in the beginning intro. A reviewer said that he didn't think the movie was that violent and compared it to the uncomparable Pulp Fiction. Ignorance. Showing a rape in a movie instead of implying it and letting the audience use their imagination is a sign of a \\"typical\\" Hollywood movie. Pushing the boundries of creativity was not apart of making this film. The actors were good in what they had to work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suspense and drama","review":"I love suspense dramas with good twists. I also enjoy Jennifer Anniston and Clive Owen. I have watched this movie several times since I bought it, and it still holds my interest. Good acting, good plot with a twist, good suspense and drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and not-very-thrilling \\"thriller\\"","review":"For the first 45 minutes this was one of the dullest \\"thrillers\\" I had ever seen. The rest of it was one of the more cliche-ridden ones you'll ever watch. Clive Owen is an advertising exec who's marriage is rocky and has a daughter with diabetes. One morning on the train he meets Jennifer Aniston and they strike up a conversation which leads to flirting which leads to an attempted affair. Something very bad happens at the hotel they go to and the rest of the movie is Clive Owen being blackmailed and trying to keep his secret from his wife and also protect Aniston.The twists in this movie aren't hard to see coming and will surprise no one. The ending is unbelievable and wraps things up too neatly. The movie has a good cast, and is a nice looking film but it takes too long for anything to happen and then when it does, it's predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"i go this movie, because it has some great actors in it. but this movie is terrible.do not make the same mistake that i did. do not get this movie.there is a reason why you can get it for so cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derailed was off the rails!","review":"I thought the movie was rather ordinary. I mean to watch Clive Owen go on the way he did in the movie by constantly giving in to the bad guys made it real frustrating to watch. I think the producers could have given him a bit more backbone earlier in the movie.When the re-runs are on TV, this will atleast fill 2 hours"},{"rating":"1","title":"casting against type, but typicall hitchcockian melodrama","review":"Owens and Aniston are cast against type in this overwrought overwritten tale about two adulterers being blackmailed by an attacker. One is not who she seems to be, which is obvious anyway.Dustin Hoffman playing The Graduate, written for a blonde CA boy, was such casting. But that was a brilliant film and a brilliant actor. Harrison Ford in What Lies Beneath, not so much.This is a derivative film and so so actors, so the casting is a detraction. This plot and production are notable for cinemax or showtime at 10pm on Thur nite, but not for these stars in their prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent job guys!!!","review":"Everything was just on time and in excellent condition!

It is also highly predictable, relies on sappy heart string ploys, and ends far to conveniently. Miserable to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"Jennifer Aniston is a terrible film actress. She may be okay for bit parts in half hour comedy television, but she cannot carry a major film. She has no persona. She's a one note, expressionless, actress.And Clive Owen is wasted in this lame script. You will watch the film to the end, just to see how it turns out, and then be disappointed.I, regrettably, bought this film based on the recommendations in Amazon. My advise to you: Don't even rent this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but so predictable","review":"Not sure what twist the others here are talking about, you would have to be blind not to see this one coming. Decent acting, Clive Owens and Jennifer Anniston, with a big shout out to the RZA. This was like an adult reading a childrens suspense book, you see it coming from a mile or two away. Decent thriller, but so painfully obvious. You see everything coming before the actors due, tough to watch it unfold just like you though it would. Not a buy, only rentable in my humble opinion. Definitely could have used some more direction and story build up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad film, sorry..","review":"I'm sorry but Jennifer Aniston can't act to save her life and what is worse is that she doesn't suit this role at all. This sloppy movie is predictable and doesn't have any surprises and or twists. It's not a clever movie nor will adults be intrigued. Even the directing is lacking. By now I am wondering when Hollywood will make a decent movie again. At this rate I suspect never. If I were you I would wait until this movie comes out on HBO. Why bother even paying for it on video. For that case why wait at all. Just forget about it. sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you think you have it figured out ;->","review":"This is quite a good movie. I love Jennifer Aniston, but let's face it, she's not the best actress. Having said that, she does very well in this movie. You probably know the storyline by now; she meets a guy on a train, they have an affair, someone is blackmailing them. It's not a total foreign concept for a plot. It's what happens after the blackmail starts that makes this interesting. I had a fair bit of it worked out already and so some didn't come as a surprise, but toward the last 10 minutes, there was another twist that you don't see coming. I love these type of psychological thrillers. I love how they mess with your head. This movie does and and does it well. You really should check it out. It's never going to be my favourite movie, but it's definately a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money and your time","review":"This movie was worse than a Lifetime television movie of the week- completely predictable from the start. A thriller should have some thrills and none could be found. Regarding the acting: Jennifer Aniston cannot act her way out of a paper bag. She has two facial expressions and both end up making her look constipated. Clive Owen, usually a favorite of mine, just couldn't find his way through this \\"thriller.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"TRAIN WRECK","review":"Derailed is a trainwreck of a movie. I mean a thriller? Please.. the whole plot was clear, the moment the \`bad guy' burst into the room. Jennifer Anniston failed to bring life to her character, only sparks of interest were shown in her character. Overall she was unable to act her way into the plot. Most of her lines were probably cut in the editing room. I think Ms. Anniston should stick to situation comedy, basically she is unable to act her way out of a paperbag. This was an unfortunate debut for Exhibit, most of his lines were probably cut as well. The main character Clive Owens was the only one trying in this movie, and try as hard as he could, it was still a trainwreck. I won't detail the plot, but overall this thriller did not thrill me, and it is not worth your money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"This is not a good movie--the surprise is not such a surprise. It should be easy to see coming when you aren't shown the backstories on major characters.Aniston is underused here.

The book for me had none of the splaterspunk that he is noteably known for and there was no real sex , depravatiy or shocking scenes - sorry but this is just one of those books that did not do it for me like his other stories. I will of course continue to buy his work, but if you are a Lee fan, stay away from this one - BORING !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I bought the kindle version and I'll admit that I'm only at 15% of the story but so far I am pretty bored with it.

I'm not sure if I'll even finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect a long learning curve","review":"I've used TOPO! for eight years and it's the best there is for mapping software. I own software for 10 of the western states and use the program almost daily. I use the program in my laptop and when hooked up to my GPS, I have what amounts to a super detailed car navigation system with a 17\\" screen. As new maps become available, you can download them free into your computer as needed and it's a very easy procedure. Also, free upgrades are available on-line and that's an easy procedure too.To make the state series most useable, you need to add Back Roads Explorer, which gives much more detailed up-to-date street and street name information.The only caveates with this program is that you need a relatively fast computer and lots of memory so you can copy the whole program to your hard drive so you don't have to constantly change cd's. Also, expect to take some time to fully get to know this program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless with Garmin eTrex Vista C","review":"I won't repeat the complaints by the other reviewers but I will agree with them. I have a new Garmin eTrex Vista C GPS, which is a good product. But, Garmin wants you to buy their poor quality MapSource software. Poor quality because of the scale. National Geographic TOPO software is somewhat clumsy to use, but it will produce a fine map and does a good job for large scale use, as in hiking, etc. The problem is that Nat. Geo. deliberately misleads in its cover blurb by implying that TOPO will work with \\"most popular handheld receivers.\\" It won't. So, if you want to produce a topographic map, with a route marked on it, and measure distances, develop elevation profiles, etc., then NatGeo TOPO is useful. If you want to upload waypoints from TOPO to your handheld GPS, be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Topo for Mac is horrible","review":"The PC version works ok but if you own a Mac, you are out of luck. Major glitches of very basic uses (such as unable to upload waypoints from a spreadsheet to your GPS!! Both upload and download buttons and pulldowns send you to a download only option). It is one of the few Mac apps that will lock down your computer and not respond to force quit.The interface is bizarre. Want to find a place? - go to \\"Edit\\".

They are all excellent products."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of date","review":"I bought this software for a trip to state-line res. It was not on the map, even though it was built in 1979. I end up having to buy a current map from wildlife resources. This purchase was a waste of time and money both. The interface was cluncky and difficult to use. Switching areas requires switching between 6 different disks. There limited symbols that can be placed on the map.

It is very slow to respond and if you were planning on imaging the disks to your hard drive for faster response, forget it. This software crashes ALOT and is overall unstable. The navigation is not like previous versions of Topo! either. Does the software work? Yes. Are the maps great? Yes. It is the interface that is poor on this one.

I was planning on staying on Cumberland Island and doing some hiking and that National Park isn't on the National Park cd set, so I bought the Georgia set. Well, Cumberland Island is on the set but it only shows some of the trails. Parts of the Map are crooked. Some of it doesn't line up with other parts.

There seems to be a smooth love song theme to this album, but done in a typically bizarre Furries manner. Opener 'Zoom!' is quite simply one of their best tracks ever, a mesmerising blend of a funk/soul groove with proggy experimentalism layered gloriously on top. In fact the whole album has a very Motown influence. There are poppy acoustic moments, crazy rock-out moments, mad techno moments, and so forth. 'Lazer Beam', the single, has a blissfully hyped up chorus, and while there's nothing on here as immediately poppy as, say, 'Juxtaposed With U', it's catchy stuff.

He can't even keep low-level information, something as simple as dates, correct. Three quarters of the book is merely quoting other people's work, i.e. reviews and interviews. As one O.B. member said in an online review that is easily found, \\"pure rubbish.\\" I think that says it all. It is no wonder why respectable publishers would print this; he had to print it himself through Xybris books (a pay-to-be-pulished outfit).

All technology (except biological research) breaks down - presumably there are no competent women engineers to run anything.

The first third is true to the form of A Sailor of Austria. An edifying slice of history told in a delightful fashion. Every page includes something fascinating about the Austro Hungarian empire as well as something laugh out loud funny. The other two thirds don't achieve the same level though.

A very adorable pattern, lights, music, toys and vibrating mechanism. However the quality is not the best. When I first received this item the toys on the toy bar were broken off. I had to send it back and wait for a new one. When the new one arrived, the vibrating mechanism stopped working after the first week and I ended up sending this one back. I went ahead and ordered a third one being this bouncer seat has everything that a lot of others don't. The third one I received has been ok although the vibration doesn't vibrate that much. The advertisement mentions two speed vibration and so does the box, however it only has 1 speed. The directions indicate the light bar requires AA batteries however it takes AAA batteries. Delta Corporation could have done a better job with the instructions and advertising. Very misleading!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bouncer for the price","review":"I really like the bouncer seat. My daughter is only 2 weeks old. It has a nice recline that allows her to sit in it without being propped up with a blanket. The other reviews talked about the music being loud, but I don't think it is at all. I really like the size of the toys and the two different positions you can put them in. I wish that there was a setting where you could just keep playing the music. You have to keep pushing the middle toy to get it to play. Overall, very nice for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great-very disappointing","review":"I purchased this bouncer early on because I loved the theme. I should have waited to throw out the box. I was just so excited to have it that I opened it as soon as I got home. (It was one of the first things I bought for my baby.) Now that my baby is here, I am very disappointed with this product. It doesn't support a baby's small head like I would like it to, so I don't like to put my child in it. Also the music is way to loud & annoying. I wish there was a way to adjust it. The toys are not very appealing to a baby.Update:Now that my baby is a little older I find that her head falls over some but I am able to stop that by placing a rolled up towel next to one side of her head. Seems to help a lot. I still think about getting a better one though.

While it was extremely easy to put together it was at the same time frustrating to use. It took a while for my child to learn how to make the lights come on. The vibrating feature made her cry, rather than soothe her, and it is not very sturdy: my infant flipped out of it onto the floor in my presense before I could prevent it.

I had also recieved another higher priced bouncy seat that reclined and had a canopy, it played music and ocean sounds and it seemed great but my daughter hated it. She was really intrigued with the toys and lights on this product. She loved the music and she quikly learned when she moved the toy's around the music would come on. This product is priced right for people on a tight budget. It is also a bit smaller than other modles which makes it easier to move from room to room. The only drawback I had was I wish it had a canopy and that it reclined.

Now I wish I'd gone with something else -- the bouncer is poorly manufactured and defective. When I first tried to use this brand new bouncer, I discovered that one of the legs was warped so that the bouncer won't sit flat on a surface, making it unsafe for my baby. One of the toys on the activity bar was broken, leaving a dangerously sharp edge that makes the activity bar unusable. And besides that, the picture on the seat is pretty hideous. Go for something more expensive -- this one is not only cheap, it's cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job","review":"I babysit and I needed a bouncy seat. This bouncer is cute but majorly loud; there is no volume control. I would not get this for my own child but I needed something to sit the baby in when I'm at my house.

MUCH BETTER OUT THERE!","review":"This was the first bouncer I bought. The lights move WAY too fast for my daughter. She ended up getting frustrated at them. The music is too loud in a semi-quiet environment. She could not activate the music herself because it was too hard for her to reach and knock the dangling toys. Plus, when she sat in it the seat was too straight up. She would flop all over like a fish. I HIGHLY reccomend the Kick & Play by Fisher Price. It's a bit more money, but HIGHLY worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"We received this bouncer as a gift and thought we'd give it a try. My son is 8 weeks old and is very bored sitting in it. The toys don't hang at the right height or angle and the music in only activated by a very hard push on the center toy. I'm not sure how the manufacturer expects an infant to get it started. Also, the music and lights only play for about 30 seconds for every time the toy is pushed. So this means that we have to have him sitting right beside us and keep activating the music and lights, not very practical. Also, son slumps down terribly in this bouncer. It has no support in it.The good points I will give it are that it's very easy to wash and lightweight to move around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newborn and toddler love it.","review":"In order to keep my toddler for venting her frustration at the new baby, I used this bouncer to its full advantage.

I'm ready to pull the batteries because it's driving me nuts but the babies are happy and that's all that counts, right?As for the quality, I am impressed. Newborn loves the vibration and it has survived the toddler's need to bounce like Baby does. Definitely would recommed to others! Well worth my money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Bouncer","review":"I love the pattern and my daughter enjoys being in the bouncer.

So, I took that off - and he LOVED sitting in the vibrating chair.... until the vibrator broke when he was 3 months old. We tried replacing the batteries - but the vibrator was shot!

In some of his movies he seems a little too stiff, however, in this series he is warm and believable. This is the story of a detective on the fast track who is losing his sight. Reading the synopsis you may think that \\"Second Sight\\" is referring to being able to see into the future/past; however that is not the case. He is losing his sight due to a viral infection that is uncurable. He is unable to hide this condition from his most able coworkers (they are detectives after all), and has to lean on a few of them which is something he hates to do.

Inchoate splendor? Resplendent performances? Be careful with your tools: they are precision instruments, not butcher's cutlery.\\"Silence like a cancer grows\\" is an excellent line.

I thought that it could not be improved upon, but then I heard their next three albums. It improved! The poetic folk-rock brilliance of \\"The Sound of Silence\\" is stunning, though it is not equaled by any other song on the CD. \\"Leaves that are Green\\" is a slightly irritating piece of poetry, \\"Blessed\\" is an overly religious screamathon, and \\"Kathy's Song\\"'s mediocre melody makes it forgettable. The album bounces back with the enjoyable \\"Somewhere They Can't Find Me,\\" and the doubly depressing two suicide songs, \\"Richard Corey\\" and \\"Peculiar Man\\" are really beautiful.

This DVD made me want to find a place to review it- I was nearly yelling at the computer screen for the first 20 minutes of the full workout, then I just skipped to the end to do ab work & cool down.I'm new to workout videos so maybe this is common, but she created and switched moves so fast that by the time I understood what she was doing she had already moved on. This did not make me feel as though 'everyone could do it,' it made me feel slow and out of shape (which I am not). It also made me feel as though I had never actually 'worked out' from ANY of the moves because of my confusion. I also did not have the 'props' I was expected to use, which seemed almost mandatory to the workout.All in all, I have found other (cheaper) videos which are amazing in comparison and do not frustrate me so completely. Check it out from your local library before spending the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cardio...with time & patience!","review":"I ordered this dvd wanting cardio...and I got it! Michelle gets your heart rate up right away and it stays up through the entire workout. She does move quickly between segments, but that's what makes it such a great workout--who wants to listen to an instructor drone on about the move--just do it!I've been exercising regularly for almost a year now (am in good shape) and I haven't made it through this entire workout straight through yet--it's definitely a challenge. The 30-minute condensed workout is great for those time-crunched days.PRO: Heart rate up throughout workout, works entire body (you will be sore the next day)CONS: Hard on knees (there is a modifier), moves are quick and hard to follow at times (that's where you need patience!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Only the introduction played without a problem. The first time I reviewed the exercise and it worked but then the next morning when I was ready to do the workout, it wouldn't play. It seemed to be stuck - I couldn't get it to do anything.

Most moves are only repeated 4 times, then she switches to a new move. You spend all your energy trying to figure out which move she is calling next, and it is very frustrating. For instance, she will call for lateral squats and only do two of them, then she will switch to reverse lunges and do two, then lateral steps times two, with different arms movements with each. This workout does not have any natural flow. I would not waste my money on it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great full-body workout!","review":"I recently purchased this video in the hope of getting a change from using a step, treadmill, and elliptical.

It was great on popcorn! My only gripe is that it would be nice if it came in a recloseable bag so I didn't need to make sure I had large enough zip-close bags for it to be transferred to (which just caused a lot of wasted plastic)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I agree that this is a great product for a less expensive cheese sauce for macaroni and cheese (haven't tried it on popcorn yet), but my only gripe is that it is a bit too salty for my taste and the taste I want my children to have. I'm just glad that it's available for a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland tasting","review":"I bought this because I would buy Kirkland (Costco's brand) instant mac 'n' cheese and almost always only use the cheese powder as a quick way to make mac n cheese with my favorite pasta. When it came in the mail (quick shipping), I noticed that it has no packaging date, sell by date, or expiration date. I found that a little odd and was iffy to use it but tried it out anyway. From reading other reviews that it tasted similar to them as using store brand powdered cheese, I made my recipe with the usual amount of pasta and put an equal amount of cheese powder as the box would have. It tasted bland to me and my boyfriend. We added more powder but still nothing much. Then some salt this time and it was a TAD bit better but not much. Given the vague packaging of this product and the bland taste of the powder, I'll stick with using individual boxes of mac n cheese powder."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not cheese powder!!!","review":"I bought this product with the idea I would get a cheddar cheese powder. It's not!! It's mostly whey powder with very little cheese in it. The cost of shipping is way to much and the stuff is crap. I think Amazon is in violation of the law. Nowhere do you find any ingredients of this food product. Except for the shot of the front of the bag that says it's Cheddar Powder. That's false advertising and against the laws put down by the FDA about food products. Keep looking there is better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's My Gripe...","review":"While this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese. The only benefit you get is that you get to pick what kind of pasta you use it for. When i got this I thought this would be great to have, now i can make wheat pasta with this mac and cheese. That was the only benefit....This powdered cheese is in my opinion too expensive and not natural or organic or anything of that nature. It is exactly the same cheese youd get in the Kraft box. It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ...Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner. No dyes no artificial colors or flavors. Its whole wheat pasta and white cheddar cheese. Its not half bad either for a wheat pasta but none of the artificial stuff like this cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster Shipping Charge!","review":"I bought this dried cheese last year but will have to go elsewhere for more - the shipping is 137% of the price of the product and that is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Known Better","review":"I was hoping to use this as a lightweight substitute for some of the cheddar cheese I carry on backpacking trips.

Unless I find someone to give it to, I'll end up throwing it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"No taste, and cooks poorly","review":"Reviews seem to be mixed, but I just had a bad time with this product. It's bland, and it clumps together if you try to make it into a sauce. Everything else I have to say has been said already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality I expected","review":"I chose this brand of cheese powder over Trio, which I'd used in the past and really liked, because this was less expensive. It came with no directions at all so I winged it remembering how I'd used the Trio sauce. This ended up thin and very salty. I had to eventually add thickener to get the consistency without making it horribly salty, but that made it more a \\"gravy\\" than a \\"sauce\\". I'll still use it up, but won't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheese Powder...","review":"I'm still figuring out how to use this product. It would have been helpful if there were some suggestions on how to use it other than just to sprinkle it on popcorn. I've tried several ways to make it into a cheese sauce with varing degrees of success. I bought it to use on the boat for its ease of storage and because it doesn't require refrigeration. In those areas it fills the bill. It tastes a bit like the powder they put in Kraft macaroni and cheese but isn't as salty or artificial tasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't as Sharp as I would like","review":"This wasn't the flavor I was looking for it is bordering on sweet... not the sharp tangy taste I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the perfect addition to my homemade \\"Chex Party Mix\\"","review":"It was easy, and tasted so much like freshly grated cheese.

The texture itself isn't bad, but it clumps slightly, so it's difficult to sprinkle onto food. I've tried it on buttered toast, popcorn and eggs. When it comes in contact with moisture, it forms small, hard, chewy clumps. I haven't tried it on pasta, but I have to assume it would do the same thing.

I recently joined Weight Watchers and needed something that would liven my popcorn up without adding a bunch of extra points. I saw the Barry Farm Powdered Cheddar Cheese on Amazon and after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. This cheese is awesome on popcorn! It's very flavorful but not overly salty and the best part is 1/4 cup is only 1 point! My only complaint is that the powder is very fine and tends to be difficult to sprinkle but that wouldn't stop me from buying this again. I would say it's a bit sweeter tasting than the Kraft powdered cheddar I used to buy locally but not overly so. I haven't used it for anything else yet but I plan on using it to replace the cheese packets I \\"borrowed\\" from my husband's mac & cheese boxes next time he asks for some. I don't think he'll notice a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, it's what you're looking for","review":"I too was looking for a way to buy 'Kraft Mac and Cheese' powder in bulk form. This is a 99.9% exact match as far as I'm concerned, definitely close enough to buy and use. I love it! I've been using up all the extra noodles in the house, instead of creating extra noodles by using cheese envelopes and not the macaroni. It's tons cheaper to buy this and then some bulk noodles.

The choir is quite good but the organ accompaniment is overpowering. The poorly balanced bass drones ruin the Requiem's last movement - one of the most serene musical moments of 20th century. I think the orchestral accompaniment is much nicer. As for the other pieces, I would say they are well done. Ubi Caritas is nice but I wish that more of the other vocal parts would come out more with the alto melody. The tenor harmony part is beautiful-if you can hear it.

Stop buying this product immediately.They disguise the ingredient by calling it BNPD, but it's real name is....2-Bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diolLook it up, you will see how toxic it is. Not to mention this product also used parabins for preservatives. I mean, is it not 2012?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like anything else","review":"I have used a couple types of lubrication with my toys and this is super. If you are not having such a good experience with that hot moment, then try this. It is very slippery and so far for me it does not get sticky. I recommend experimenting with the amount you use. For me a small amount lasts for some time. You be the judge. You'll enjoy those hot moments the first time you use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works","review":"Like the title says it works but its nothing special, has some unwanted ingredients as well. Gun oil H2O is better, KY ultragel was better, but it does work. Basing this off of it doesn't last that long and it's messier than other brands.(m/f couple)"},{"rating":"1","title":"tacky not silky","review":"was in the market for a new item in this area and thought i would try. other reviews were positive and took their words for endorsement. have not found product to be \\"silk like\\" at all. lube is on the tacky side. dries fast and requires reapplication much more frequently then the other products i have used. would not purchase again. also pump style bottle is great for home but makes traveling out of the question as to close bottle it is small feat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money","review":"I have tried a number of different lubricants over the years; all of them are overpriced and worthless except for one: Wet PlatinumWet Platinum Premium Lubricate , 8.9-Ounce Bottle.My partner and I decided to try the latest in \\"water-based\\" lubes and went with the most highly rated (including this one). They are horrible and essentially useless as they become sticky within minutes. The only explanation I can think of is that anyone giving them a high rating must not have tried silicone-based lubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is bad for you!","review":"This stuff worked great till I read about the stuff in it! methylparabens, propylene glycol, glycerin...duh! no wonder i always got yeast infections after sex. it was the lube, not the sex!try something like firefly orLiquid Goddessor I think even astroglide is making something natural (or at least free of the really crazy stuff) anyway, use google and find out why you dont want that stuff absorbed into your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't survive shipping","review":"liquid item didn't survive the shipping and arrived in a slippery mess. Liquid Silk is the best lube I've ever used, but when not packaged properly for shipping it's one heck of a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best darn lube out there!","review":"I have been using this lube non-stop since I first tried it! I work in an adult boutique and get free samples all the time but this is the ONLY lube I use. The feel and texture of it is so much more luxiourious than any other lubes. It never gets sticky or tacky like many others. I also love that it has no smell and if you happen to taste some, it doesn't ruin the mood with a nasty taste! The only downfall is that it does tend to dry out faster than most water based lubes but that is nothing in comparison to it's good qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware contains Parabens.","review":"The product sounds great from the descriptions and reviews, but after I ordered it I discovered that it contained Parabens. Parabens have been removed from many products because they are known estrogen mimics. I don't know about you, but I don't think that this is a healthy ingredient for a personal lubricant. Because of this, I've returned the product unopened. I think the company should strongly consider removing these compounds from its product, like many manufactures have. When this product is Paraben free, I'll reconsider it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lube ever","review":"My girlfriend and I tried a lot of lubes before we found this one. They all had their various problems, and many of them caused her physical pain. Liquid Silk was a lifesaver and we never even thought about using another one after this. Would give 6 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where did you find that b.awful photo?","review":"I really am Chrissie, Ronnie Hilton's widow. The songs, theirarrangements and delivery are extremely good and it's refreshing to see a wider selection of records. This CD was originally released in 1997 when Ronnie was still alive and I must say that the sight of the photo on the cover made him laugh out loud. \\"Red hair!! I've never had red hair - where have they dug that up from?\\" He was not impressed but I hope you will be impressed with Ronnie's songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"This came as the fitted post on my new Giant XTC2 bike. Within 6 months it was starting to slip. After another couple of months all the teeth were stripped off and it was slipping like a very slippy thing.Looking at the construction you can see that its poorly formed rounded teeth, single tightner bolt, and poor quality allow construction are significant design faults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful dust collector, but cumbersome bag change","review":"I originally thought the remote was a worthless frill, but now I think it is a great asset. It lets you stretch out the hose and remotely turn it on when needed at the planer or table saw. It has no problem keeping up with my 15\\" planer at full blast.Con: Changing the dust bag is a pain. I think that there could be an easier way to change this, which isn't a problem when its empty, but it is a pain when its full. Therefore, I recommend a cyclone type unit to catch your big chuncks and reduce bag changes. I made one out of a 50 gallon plastic garbage can, and the collector still has no problem pulling through the can and 20' of hose. I would buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extraordinary waste of the writer's effort.","review":"How or why should America's extreme right wingers need their language interpreted? Speaking as a Centre-right wing Brit I find the concept of such a book utterly bemusing.One might even wonder why anyone would want to write 820 pages on the decline of state militias between the War of Independence and the Civil War!If M. Pitcavage finds it amusing to dish out \\"Lone Star\\" reviews, then others can do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, But Not Alot of Change","review":"From what I've seen of the game, it looks great. Great graphics, gameplay, puzzles, everything you need for a platform game. Not to much has changed though. It plays alot like the first one. Of course its bigger and the graphics have improved incredebly.I loved the first one so in this case - ITS GOOD IT DIDNT CHANGE MUCH- becuse the first was so good. If you are like me and feel the same way then this game is for you. BUY THIS GAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this game!","review":"If you are looking for top adventure, then you are looking at the best game of all time! I love the game play, and would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Klonoa 2","review":"I purchased this game because it was highly recommended as one of the top ten games for playstation 2. I can't put the game down; very fun and addicting. If you like a game in the same style as Mario brothers etc. you will love this game. The levels are challenging and the graphics are amazing. I recently purchased the original Klonoa from playstation 1 because I like Klonoa 2 so much. You will be glad you purchased this gem and you will be looking forward to a part 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's So Cool!!!!!","review":"I loved it!! I didn't even play Klonoa: Door to Phantomiles yet even though it's the first one!! To me it's a little bit of a sad story because it turned out it was a dream, but it's really fun because you get to snowboard, surf, even use the board to surf on sand and a forgotten path!! I say it's the best game ever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out Crash!","review":"That's right. Klonoa 2 is much better than anything Crash Bandicoot can do! I know it looks cute but it's really a clever mix of puzzles and platform action all wraped up to make one fun game. From the first minute you start you quest you know its something special. I don't know about you but I thought the cel-shading was used very well and gave this game a very nice fell. If your looking for a fun platformer then look no more. Klonoa 2 should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game","review":"This game was one of the funest games I'v ever played. I thought the classic 2-D platform in a 3-D world was great. Though I hated the music and the story was boring, the actual game playing was fun. It was to easy, but there were some chalenges for the mind. Overal, it was a ok game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids, fun for adults, too!","review":"I bought this game primarily for my 7 year old twins, and it didn't disappoint. They (and I) played for hours and we were thoroughly entertained.The somewhat limited 2nd player option is still enough fun to make it easier when you're waiting out your turn to take over the main controller again.It's challenging, but not so hard that my kids get frustrated while playing. The worst thing a \\"kids\\" video game can do is send them away mad because they get stuck, lost, or confused. This game, however, always keeps their attention.I had never heard of this game before seeing it on Amazon, but I'm glad I took a chance on it...and so are my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game for younger kids","review":"You know how middle schoolers get to be annoying? Mostly because they start trying to act grown-up by swearing and saying perverted stuff? Well, those lamers wouldn't enjoy this game.Instead, give this to your innocent 12 year old who would never say anything derogatory. Their eyes will light up with stars once they play it - the game's characters are cute, the platforming is awesome fun, and the difficulty is ideal for younger kiddies.*** note that certain adults may have an unusual affinity for this game as well. when such a scenario arises, buy them a used copy immediately - you may otherwise find said adult stealing turns from your child in order to get some playtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaze No Klonoa 2 (Klonoa 2)","review":"Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil brings back the flying cat (yes, he's a cat. Namco confirmed it) from the PSX game, \\"Klonoa: Door to Phantomile\\". Personally, I was a HUGE fan of the original, so the second was a wonderful happening. The nonsense language from the first game has returned! It's good to hear a language that's not standard English or Japanese- it takes you away from reality, and since Klonoa travels through dreams, it's perfect. Klonoa has new garb, and a whole new adventure ahead of him, helping a priestess in training named Lolo, her companion Popka, and a world in turmoil. The feeling of the game is cute and bouncy, and the animation is lovely. I don't know what it is about this game, but I keep playing it over and over. RUPURUDU! (let's go!) ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for kids, but too easy....","review":"This game would be fine for kids age 5-12, but I was dissapointed by how easy the game is. Also, I don't understand why everyone is saying the graphics are wonderful. They seem pretty mediocre to me. They are very jagged and very simplistic. I've seen better graphics on some PS One games. Again, great for young kids, but not for anyone with gaming skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short,Too Easy,Not fun at all!","review":"Poeple are saying that this game is too easy and too short.But they also say it's fun!What type of game is easy and short yet fun?I don't quite understand.I would much rather have a game that made me want more.A game that takes more than just one day to play.I don't see how this simple childish game can appeal to anyone.Although I might be wrong,[not!]chow-dig!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID .","review":"If you want a game that is frustrating, annoying, tiring, childish and plain boring buy this game ! The only time i liked to play it is when I was on the verge of dying from being bored. There is a stage ( I think it's called mirror something ) is really confusing . But if you do want a pointless no plot story go for Klonoa , but if you want a story worth your time get one of these titles. Any Final Fantasy game , any Fatal Frame game. I hope this was helpful to you ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over","review":"I like all kinds of games: adventure, RTS, RPG, FPS, platformer, and a variety of cross-genre games. For example, I thoroughly enjoyed Rogue Squadron, Red Alert, Age of Empires, Zelda games, Metal Gear Solid and so on. However, one thing that I consistently like is the feeling of freedom in a game. Game developers have to think about the limits of the console and the goal of the game, but...I played about 4 hours of it and thought this game [...stunk]. Boring gameplay, virtually no feeling of freedom (2-D), and that irritating nonsensical language. I do have the odd feeling, though, that if you like anime, that you might like this game. I don't personally like anime, but the bosses and characters sure gave me the feeling that those types of folks might get a kick out of this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"At first I thought it would be boring. Boy was I wrong! This is one of the best games for PS2. It is a bit on the short side, but the grapics make up for that. It has a interesting story to it too. Once you start it, you'll want to finish it. If you like action and puzzles, you have to buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, quick trip through the world of dreams.","review":"Klonoa is an excellent game.The visuals are no polygon pusher, but the textures, colors, and character models give the game a disticnt happy go-lucky feel that no one can call 'bad'. The game's atmosphere is what truly sets me off on ranting about how much I love the game.The game isn't very challenging, but it remains to be endless fun. With several secret levels and many things to collect, the game doesn't get old. The control is the most simple control that has ever crossed a console, which is why it is so excellent. Any person from ages 6-50 will have a good time playing this game. It is slightly challenging of the mind, but it isn't challenging for the people that are somewhat lacking in platformer skills.There simply isn't anything bad about this game besides the fact that its 15 hours tops. But after unlocking everything and gettin the secrets in a new game, its about 25."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must be dreaming","review":"OK. ... whats my favortie game of all time? Klonoa Luntea's Veil!!!!! Now I played alot of games. Evrything from Poke'mon, to Crash ,to Zelda, EVEN SUPER SMASH BROS! But of all that, Klonoa stands out of the crowd. OK. It's alittle easy, (sometimes you run into a mind binder!)alittle short, and the CHARATERS SPEAK JAPANISE!!(if it gets annoying, copy out loud what they're saying in English). But the graphics are awesome with cel shading, gameplay is cool (espacally the hoverboard!!!) and I LOVE THE CHARATERS! Klonoa, Popka, Lolo, Leorina, Tat, just to name a few. Lot's of collectables, and the story is cool (this may sound weird, but I cried at the end!!). This game is just to good to pass up. I almost did, and I would of passed up one of the best games for PS2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not last","review":"I bought these (or similar Feit brand) at HD or Lowe's.

The most prominent tune, \\"The Shadow of Your Smile\\" was a jukebox hit from the Taylor and Burton film,\\" The Sandpiper\\". The balance of the theme songs that he recorded were unusual, not the standard fare, did anyone else record the title theme from ,\\"The Pawnbroker\\" or \\"The Oscar\\"? \\"The Trolley Song\\" from \\"Meet Me In St Louis\\" is here along with the wonderful Johnny Mandel song from The Americanization of Emily\\".

Its message mostly sees to be encouragement to stay in a marriage, keeping faith in God. It attempts to justify everything with the Bible, including scripture references in seemingly every other sentence (FAR more than the excerpt would lead you to believe). For those of us who do not believe that the Bible is the inerrant word of god and the sole source of authority, it's so off-putting that it makes it hard to get at the author's message."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic","review":"Ed Wheat completely overlooks the possibility that someone may be in an abusive situation. Reading this book in a marriage that contains any form of abuse, emotional, verbal, financial or physical could intensify the already painful patterns.

My wish is that the indicators of abuse were clearly stated so that if abuse were present the reader could turn to more effective methods of resolving their difficulties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This book is not worth purchasing! I am in the middle of a divorce and I purchased this book and \\"Divorce Remedy\\" by Michele Weiner Davis. Her book is much more readable and applicable today.

Wheat says if you refuse to \\"sign anything,\\" your spouse won't be able to divorce you. Not in the United States! He pretends to be all Bible-believing, but it is the sort of cultish belief that 20/20 did an expose on: \\"Independent Fundamental Baptists\\" and such. It is a short book, and has an extended passage from Hosea, one of the Bible's minor prophets, who was married to a prostitute. Do yourself a favor and watch Oprah, read the book of Hosea, whatever - can't be worse than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my marriage","review":"Several years ago when my husband said that he wanted a divorce, this book and another book by Wheat, \\"Love Life\\" fell into my hands.

I followed the advice in this book down to the last detail, and my husband and I are more happily married today than we ever were before. I went through times of discouragement, depression, and hopelessness. However, I read this book and gave my marriage to the Lord. Now I know that the Lord had to allow me to go through what was an enormously difficult time in my life, because it was the only thing that was going to change me.If you are discouraged and feel that there is no hope, even if your husband is having an affair, please DO NOT give up.

The CDC documented the rise in American obesity in direct response to the publication and propigation of the Food Pyramid. In 2005, the FDA recanted their obsolete unhealthy information (with diabetes-causing high glycemic index foods at the foundation of the old Food Pyramid).This book should be banned and replaced with modern healthy food information to stem the deadly tide of childhood obesity, diabetes and heart disease. This book is still being promoted by Lavar Burton on The Reading Rainbow on public television.

The songs on here can't be imitated by anyone because no one has it in them. Who could possibly create a song equal to \\"it's alright ma (im only bleeding)\\", a song where everyline could be quoted and still holds up today. I dont know though its tough to give a legendary album a review because you have to start using cliches like perfect and amazeing and wonderful to the point where it would start sounding like an acceptance speech. But its just a perfect gateway into dylan if youve never heard him before because these songs are accessible. If you hate it because of his voice then you should just give up on music completly because its an honest voice and a sneeringly delicate one at that.All roads Lead to Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"Excellent album!!!!!! Bob outdid himself on this one. The first half of the album offers Dylan's first electrical attempts, and he really pulls it off terrifically.

These are more classic Dylan, and you can listen to them over and over and over and always discover something new and interesting about them. This is a must album for any Dylan fan, and even if you don't like Dylan, get it, cause this is one of the most influential albums of all time. Seriously. Chances are, any band that played after this album was released was at least indirectly influenced by this album. Gems: There are so many!!

The first side of this album is full of well-written, funny at times, gritty rockers.

A great album that changed the face of popular music. The band playing with Dylan is a little unstable and unsure of itself at times, but does manage to capture the right mood of Zimmy's songs.

Without ever becoming overly sentimental, he vividly describes the straightforward determination and astonishing bravery of the family who took him in, and the network of friends who helped them.It does assume a certain amount of previous knowledge about the 1944-1945 campaigns in Holland, but if you watched Band of Brothers, you probably know enough to get by (and you'll have a different account of the rescue of the British forces after 'Market Garden' that program portrayed).Read it, and be reminded that WWII was something that happened to people who were just like us, but held themselves bravely in the face of real danger and fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ron Kaplan * Weber Iago Album","review":"Track List:I'm Just A Lucky So And So...(E.

I Can't Wait For The DVD!","review":"I recently discovered Gargoyles about two months ago, but since I fell head over heels with the show. It's absolutely the greatest! Unlike other cartoons, this show has that mystery and drama you see in adult movies and shows. I especially love the way how all the episodes are conected, and will revert back to episodes back in the first season. And of course I love the way you don't have single track-minded villians who want to just blow up the earth, we have complicated villans with purposes and reason for their actions, like Xanatos and Demona. We also have people who you don't know who's side they're on, like Macbeth and Puck and Coldstone.

The voices of the characters fade in and out, without good reason. (Like they will all be in the same place in a scene, its not like the sound is SUPPOSED to be \\"far away\\" sounding.. but it just cuts in and out)Also, the animation and the sound don't appear to be tied together.The animation lags the sound, and as you watch the episode it becomes more and more obvious.So far, overall, I have been quite disappointed. The sound issues make it really terrible to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best TV series by Disney","review":"Seriously. Gargoyles mixes the best of everything; right down to Shakespear and Arthurian legend. It brings to life characters such as MacBeth, Puck, Oberon, Titania, and takes you from modern-day Manhattan to medieval Europe, Avalon, and Ireland; even the possible future our heroes face. It provides excellent voice acting by well-known personalities such as Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, and John Rys Davies; and that's only a few. The animation is beautiful and flowing.

It works specifically because it does not insult the audience's intelligence. Kids will enjoy the Gargoyles' adventures, while older people will enjoy the deeper plot and near constant Shakesperean references.

Action packed, filled with drama, humor, and touching friendships, this is a must own DVD. I can't wait until it comes out. My only wish is that I watched this show the first time around, although I think as someone who is now 22, I can appreciate it a lot more.Oh and the theme song is great.

This incredible show is funny, romantic, sad, thought provoking, and action packed. It is all of these at once, and on a higher cognitive level, too.

This is one of Disney's most underrated feets of animation and storytelling to date. This wasn't a show for just kids. My parents would watch this with me when I was a kid, and now I share it with my 5 year old daughter. It's one of those very few and rare programs that the whole family can truely enjoy. And it deals with real world issues such as prejudice and gun safety. But in such a way that it isn't sugar coated, but it isn't anime-graphic either.

With a great cast for voices and one of the best opening credits songs ever, Gargoyles was probably the best alternative to superhero cartoons out there. The DVD's do a great job in recreating the feeling of when the show first came out and have very cool menus. There isn't too much bonus material, but compared to some other TV shows, it isn't bad. The only problem is, while watching the episodes, you remember how some of the characters seem to have NO motivation at all and just perform random acts of good or bad. Also, the storyline is subject to drastic changes (most of which they set up from about a mile and a half away) and I can't count how many times the phrase \\"but I thought...\\" was uttered. But with a good group of core characters and some nice \\"add on\\" villains, Gargoyles is a show definately worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"a show that has never aged in its plethora of wonderful messages","review":"As a middle schooler, I would run home from the bus and turn on the TV to watch Gargoyles religiously and repeatedly. Rewatching the series as an adult allows me to acknowledge the fact that this show is superior to any other cartoon show. The themes of family, friendship, tolerance, duty, honor, etc. are prevalent on this show and the stories are incredibly compelling. The lessons this show taught kids - too much TV is never a good thing, respect your elders, etc. are timeless.Even with Pixar's incredible animation, Gargoyles is able to compete with their hand drawn, 2-D illustrations - the drawings are just that good.This is an incredible show and a must-see for adults even more so than for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL I WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS WAS GARGOYLES!","review":"I got this complete first season of Gargoyles for Christmas...was the best gift I ever recieved.

The different colors are nice so you can easily tell everyone's throws apart. The size and weight are really nice for a family. They are not too light for adults, but they are light enough to be easy and safe for the younger ones to play along with. For the price this is a great set. It even comes in a nice nylon carrying bag that zips up and has handles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain terrible","review":"The first thing I did, after opening the brown cardboard box it was shipped in, was gently pick up the supplied red carrying bag by its handle.

This is the first item I will have ever returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice light weight set","review":"this is a great set for the not-so-serious bocce ballers.

It's inexpensive, ships quickly, and has 4 colors for 4 players at one time. The plastic is soft though, so don't hit anything with them as they scratch and get nicks easily. Also they are pretty small and light compared to official Bocce balls.

This is one of the only two cake domes I have found that are tall enough for a layer cake. This is the only one that is priced sensibly. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the lid is quite heavy. It is also shaped in such a way that the lid does not rest in a certain spot on the platter so you have to be careful not to touch the cake when replacing the dome.

Similar to David Korten's perspective expressed in \\"The Great Turning\\", but spiced up with droll, pointed humorous remarks, he challenges the reader to \\"escape\\" from a worldview designed to enslave the average person into compliance with a facade of freedom and democracy that ultimately serves only a tiny, elite \\"ruling class\\".He then walks the reader through his solution, empowered self-goverance beginning with direct relationships, with good descriptions of proven and effective dialogue and decison processes that build social capacity at the local grassroots level, which he refers to as \\"harmonization\\".Excellent resource information is provided for those interested in assuming personal responsibilty for creating community that truly is of the people, for the people, and by the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teri Jory: Poise Fitness Core Training","review":"I was not impressed with this DVD.

I thought this DVD would really push me to the next level, but it was very boring and not challenging at all. Also, the camera views made it impossible to see the position of the models feet during the ballet bar portion...who has a ballet bar anyway?

We received it last night, and it's a bit of a monstrosity. It's taller than I expected. I don't like that the bins are just balanced in place without really seeming to be held in place at all by the support bars, and it's harder to get toys in and out of it than it looks.

I figured it wasn't going to very large and I was right. This organizer is great for storing small to medium size toys, but in today day and age toys are getting bigger and bigger and this organizer won't hold to this task. The advantage to using this organizer is that you wont have the problem of having all your smaller toys stuck at the bottom of the been. I used two overflowing target large plastic storage bins for toy storage and I just couldn't find the smaller toys anymore. Out of the two large storage bins I got most of my smaller toys into this organizer. The larger toys stayed in one plastic bin that is no longer over flowing. I am happy with this product, but still need to improve. This product seems to be the best out there for toys.

The large bins are roughly 16x12 inches and 5-6 inches deep. The smaller bins are 8x12, same depth. When ordering online I tend to set the bar fairly low, expecting to be disappointed by some little thing or another- not so with this organizer! I put it together in 15 minutes with a lincoln penny!! (the penny worked far better than any of my screwdrivers, haha) It is sturdy, though once my daughter is old enough to pull herself up it WILL need to be anchored to the wall (but doesn't everything?)

She is loving it. I am loving it because its teaching her that her toys have their own place (all baby doll items go in one bin, all stacking cups in another, etc).

I had originally thought we'd be able to keep more toys in there, but this organizer really is for toys like cars, blocks, rings, beads and books. My daughter's dolls barely fit. She can fit one doll per bucket, so we decided to get a large toy box to use in conjunction with this.It wasn't that difficult to put together. My husband had it assembled in 10 minutes. We had a harder time deciding where to keep it. We found that it wasn't sturdy at all on carpeting and needed to be directly on the floor.The bins can either be placed in at an angle or directly flat. Neither position is perfect, but we found that the angled position best suited our 10 month old. We've also opted to leave the buckets off of the top rack for now, as our daughter pulls some of the buckets/toys onto her head when she's standing in front of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy Organizer, Well Worth The Money","review":"I'm very happy with this toy organizer.

This is a good concept but if you actually put any toys in the bins without expertly balancing them the bin just falls out.So not real useful if you are trying to make it easy for your children to get out and pick up toys.

This is Simon and Garfunkel's debut album. In the artwork Garfunkel tells Simon that they should get a job and they sure did, considering they brough over 500,000 people to their concert in 1981, over 15 years after this album was released. The only reason this album is a 4 in my opinion is it has very few popular songs on it as opposed to most other S&G albums. If you are a huge fan of the group, this album is a must, but if you just like their popular songs, go for the greatest hits cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Their Weakest Album","review":"Simon And Garfunkel were an unrivaled pair. Their divine vocal harmonies and brilliant songwriting have never been surpassed. This, their debut, is the only weak album they ever made.There are only three good songs on here: \\"You Can Tell The World\\" (I usually don't care for country music but this is an awesome song), \\"Sparrow\\" (the song that introduces their aforementioned divine vocal harmonies) and the original acoustic version of \\"The Sound Of Silence\\". The rest of the album is rather boring.Thankfully, though, all their other albums would prove to be sheer masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELLO DORKNESS","review":"This album is truly horrible. Even if you are a moderate S&G fan you will probably be surprised at how bad it is. It sounds like it was made in 1960 before the singer songwriter movement began. It is a folk album, nothing like anything many of you are expecting. If you have ANY of the greatest hits album and are considering buying some additional cd's LET ME DO YOU A FAVOR: Listen to some of these songs either at Amazon or at your local Borders. You will save yourself some money. I wish someone would have warned me. The positive reviews for this album are ridiculous and unwarranted. Buy the later albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even though this album does not demonstrate what. . .","review":". . .Simon and Garfunkel would become, to my mind, it still gets 4 stars because of the promise it showed -- promise which did come to fulfillment.Unlike later albums, on Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., Simon and Garfunkel covered quite a few songs written by other artists, including such stock folk favorites as \\"You Can Tell the World\\" (aka \\"Yes, He Did\\") and a rather good version of Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A Changing\\".However, Simon's music writing talent showed definite promise in the haunting \\"Bleeker Street\\" and showed profound musical genius in the all-acoustic version of \\"The Sounds of Silence\\". Credit must also be given for the touchingly beautiful \\"Benedictus\\" taken from the Latin Mass.This is still one of my favorite Simon and Garfunkel albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite Simon and Garfunkal Album","review":"It is true that this album does not achieve the novelty of their later albums, but it is perfectly coherent. The album can relax anyone despite its melancholy subjects. It is true perfection and has far more to it than 'Bridge Over Troubled water,' which is sentimental and lacks the complete truth 'Wednesday Morning,' does achieve.Grieg once said, 'What is so-called orignality, so called novelty? It isn't the most important thing. The most important thing is the truth of feeling.'It is important to realise this 'truth' is not only achieved as a composer but also as a performer and producer. Paul Simon achieves this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This album is what got me into Simon & Garfunkel/Paul Simon's music. All of the tracks are easy to listen to. \\"Bleecker Street\\" is the best composure I've ever heard. And to think of how young Paul was when he wrote it! The harmonies, the melody, and especially the lyrics are all genius. Paul Simon plays some great guitar on it too. \\"The Sounds Of Silence\\" is amazing. To me, you get the best version of this song on this album. If you love Simon & Garfunkel/Paul Simon, this album is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible album!","review":"This \\"newer\\" album contains old songs in their early development before they perfected their folk/rock style. Some of these songs were later recorded on other albums and are MUCH better. Others are not worth recording at all. Some of the lyrics and accompiament are different being much more folksy. If you want to hear this for curiosity sake, then go ahead and buy it. As for me, I prefer to hear the songs as they were later perfected and recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goood!","review":"Not my favorite album of theirs but still awesome!!

The last 5 entries on disc 2 are moving and one would have hoped that much more of that tone would have found its way into the concert itself. The length of the applause excerpts could have been narrowed considerably without affecting appreciation of the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Keith Jarrett's Best Work","review":"The recent edition of the \\"Carnegie Hall Concert\\" is a disappointment. Jarrett engages in self-indulgent riffs, with apparently no intention of creating anything melodic. There are a few cuts that have a \\"tune,\\" but, in the main, those (like me) who favor the Jarrett of \\"Shenandoah\\" should save their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't reach all the Hype","review":"Not nearly as good as the Koln Concert. I really like only one of the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Koln Standard","review":"In this past Sunday's NY Times, Keith Jarrett said that he felt his creative energy during this concert was at the level he had not experienced since the classic Koln Concert. Having been disappointed by Radiance, his previous solo work, I was reserving judgement and now, Mr. Jarrett's comparison can be validated.Carnegie Hall, in some ways, surpasses the Koln Concert in that the more evolved Jarrett has not only returned to tonality but is able to incorporate both technical and harmonic improvisation at a level that maybe no one else is capable of. The second disc in the set rolls out gospel, blues, straight-ahead jazz and ballads that will take you back to Koln without the retro/nostalgic elements. This is one of the two best recordings Keith Jarrett has ever made and there's no need to go into a detailed account of the music. I do have to agree with the previous reviewer about the applause-too, too much when you're not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maturity and skill, but still the same incredible player","review":"It is clear that Keith Jarrett has just gotten better, and better all these years. This concert is a little different than earlier concerts in some ways -- more refined, a little tighter, and the first part is brilliantly complex. But then as things go on, you start hearing the fantastic parts when he is just completely absorbed and becomes part of the music he plays -- the guy anyone who loves his music came to hear. I love it all and just can't get enough -- I think I have listened to the album 20 times now and am still finding these connections and threads that run through various pieces.I am still getting used to this different Keith Jarrett. I think I like it as well as my favorites (Koln, Paris), but it is a bit different.I don't know if this is useful information, just a feeling that if you like his previous work, you really need to hear this concert. If you don't know his previous stuff, get that first, love it, then get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always different","review":"Its really hard to know what to expect from Kieth. I prefer his jazz improvs. This concert has more disonnant playing than I prefer. The long applause should have been faded out as I find it a distraction. This concert does have its moments though. There aren't enough of them I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance - Applause overkill","review":"This is yet another great solo piano concert by Keith Jarrett. His playing is unique and he has is own voice on piano. A style filled with passion and grace. I've listened to enough Keith Jarrett the vocal noises he makes do not at all get in the way of the listening experience. What does get in the way of my personal enjoyment on this particular album is the applause on some of these tracks. There's one primary reason for this not getting 5 stars-There are a few tracks that have more than a minute of applause after the last note. It sounds enthusiastic, but I get it...it was a good performance, and if I was there I would have applauded strongly and for a few minutes. On CD though, I prefer to hear the music not the applause. Okay rant over - I hope that Keith continues to do these concerts and I hope that he collaborates with more artists (when is the last time that he's played with a horn player?--a European Quartet reunion would be great!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I really liked this disc although I find the recording seems to have some issues (at least on my copy), like a pop/crack at around the 5:36 mark on the 5th track, this obviously shouldn't be there, I tried multiple copies and found the same flaw on all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We have enjoyed the Koln concert recording for years, and found this one quite disappointing.

Much of the music on this disc is nothing less than a sonic rip off of what Boulez and Berio were doing in the 60s, but without any of the highly developed and extremely sophisticated structural and developmental elements that make that music great. He doesn't even understand what he's quite lamely attempting to emulate. It's ersatz and quite embarrassing really, especially for someone of Jarrett's supposed musical sophistication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion and Scholarship","review":"The Ground Beneath the Cross opens up for the reader of English a world of lived faith in the theological writings of the murdered Jesuit Ignacio Ellacuria.

The wealth of information regarding these aspects of the Soviet war economy make it worthwhile for anybody interested in wartime economics, despite the heavy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, enjoyable read.","review":"I picked this book up expecting something a bit more fluffy and light. I'm so glad I was wrong. It is not a 'happy' novel, and doesn't try to portrey it's characters as perfect, (which they are very definitely not).The author's vision of a post-apocolyptic America is fascinating, mixing science fiction and fantasy without being awkward. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next two books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but....","review":"This book had a wonderfull plot line, and unique ideas, however, there wasfar to much....love making (shall we say) scenes, and it greatly took away from the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an unlikeable heroine!","review":"Eve was manipulative, self-centered, spoiled, immature, and had absolutely no compassion for any other human being. And those were her GOOD qualities! She crawled all over every man she met and then wondered why Ethan had such a low opinion of her. Gee, can't imagine! In all fairness though, as much I liked Ethan, he had to be kind of out there to want this woman!It's a good thing I didn't read this book right after I'd eaten or I doubt the food would have stayed down!I can however highly recommend \\"The Sheik's Chosen Wife\\" and \\"The Arabian Love Child\\". They were the reason I got this book and they were both very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate and Witty","review":"This is a fabulous story that you will not want to put down until you finish. Ethan Hayes has his own story (previous character from \\"The Sheik's Chosen Wife #2254 ) meets the beautiful, spoiled, confident Eve Herakleides. He has his hands full when he has to pretend to be her fianc��e after being caught together in bed by her old fashioned grandfather. There is lots of flirtation from Eve, and Ethan tries very hard not to succumb to Eve's charm, but in the end gives in. Lots of witty and passionate dialogue from the characters and also the reader will get a sense of each person's thoughts. I like the way the writer brings in the other characters from the other books by having Eve jealous of the woman everyone thinks Ethan is in love with, yet at the same time shows her confidence by trying to win Ethan using her charms. I don't think you even need to read \\"The Sheik's Chosen Wife\\" to appreciate this wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't understand all the negative comments....","review":"I almost didn't buy this book because of all the negative comments I read. I'm glad now I ignored those. I like this book. It isn't one of MS. Reid's best books but it is still a good read. The hero and heroine are the main focus with very little outside interference. Eve is a big flirt and spoiled as many beautiful young women are at her age, but Ethan being so much older handled it very well. I didn't think Ethan was abusive as some of the Hs in Ms. Reids books and I liked that. All love stories have misunderstandings and disagreements, but I think it is okay to let the H/h show love and kindness to the H/h. The only thing I didn't like was the \\"would be rapist\\" got away with his crime against Eve. Don't let the negative comments stop you from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done sequel to The Sheikh's Chosen Bride","review":"This is Ethan's happily ever after--touching, romantic, and very sweet. His heroine, Eve, is young and vulnerable, and Ethan is truly a hero in helping her through her near date rape. It was great that the plot is actually running simultaneously with Leona and Hassan's as it adds a new dimension to their story as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"temptress?...or hussy?","review":"The title conforms to the story. Eve was definately a spoiled rotten temptress rich girl, who used seduction and other tempting wiles to get what she wanted. The only thing i favored about this book was Ethan. Poor guy, I felt such sympathy for him. How could a man as smart and charming as he, fall for a winy, sophmoric, hussy like Eve. If you ask me, Ethan should have stuck a pacifier in her mouth each time she decided to put on one of her famous (not to mention WINY) tantrums. My ears were practically SCREAMING.I hope there are better books by Michelle Reid that can molifiy the ache in my ears, because this one was awfully LOUD (and disappointing).Do yourselves a favor people: do not read this book. If you do however, get ready for some MAJOR ear bleeding.Ps. the 2stars are for Ethan."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT a brat!","review":"Read ONLY if you like your female characters immature and unchanged. Usually in stories involving a spoiled heiress, I can find at least something redeeming in that character. Eve was completely unlikeable. Even after what should have been a life altering event, she remained the same obnoxious child from beginning to end. Other than a sexual attraction, nothing explains what Ethan saw in her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant in its badness.","review":"This is one of those books which I read merely because it promises to be so bad, it ultimately winds up achieving humor. It did not fail -- though it failed to achieve it as thoroughly as I'd hoped. The purple prose were more lavender than purple; romance-lite, is the term I'm thinking of. The clumsily engineered scenes she contrived, while frenetic, didn't have that hackneyed spice that I usually find so endearing. Why, she only introduced one -- one! -- complication throughout the entire story! (I do not count Eve, as she isn't complex enough to complicate things.)I got it for free, so I can't demand my money back on the virtues of the argument \\"It was drivel, but not so devoid of all signs of intelligence as to make my insides cringe with hilarity.\\" Which I might, if I had paid for it.The best thing about it: typos were minimal."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of this product","review":"i just purchased a new 8x10 plush carpet for my family room.paid quite a bit for it i felt it would be wise to protect it.that was mistake i purchased scotch gaurd carpet protector sprayed on as directed after vacuuming well.three days later i went to vacuum rug and could not vacuum stuck to rug like there was glue on it.we called scotch gaurd and told them what happened.they said it was late in the day inform there chemist and have him call us.it's been more than a week and i haven't heard a word from them.stay away from this product if you would really like to protect your rug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work!!!","review":"I applied this stuff 3x on our rug and despite that my dog's pee stain didn't come out.

Well written, perfect composition and more infotmation then I could ever remember!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"After reading \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" I have become consumed with everything Japanese, geishas in particular. This book was the next to follow in my voracious appetite to learn everything geisha. What an experience Liz Dalby must have had when she gradually became a member in Pontocho's geisha community. I seriously doubt that there will be another American geisha in this lifetime. To read the difficulties becoming a geisha involves opened my eyes that nothing is all what it seems. Training to be a geisha isn't as easy as what most people probably thinks. Despite the lengthiness of the book, I could not put down the book. What makes this book special in comparison to other books on geishas is that the author isn't an outsider looking in. She drew upon her own experiences and that is why I love Liz Dalby's book more than the coffee table books on geishas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"I read this book after Arthur Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" got me intruiged in geisha. I wanted to know more about the world the fictional Sayuri lived in. \\"Geisha\\" does not have the drama and romance of \\"Memoirs\\" but it offers more than a cursory look at the life of a geisha. As Dalby gives a firsthand account of her experiences as Ichigiku, the American geisha, she also digs deep into the history of geisha in different parts of Japan, the intricacies of geisha customs and the joys and pains of being a geisha. While \\"Geisha\\" may not be everyone's cup of tea, the insights it gave me only made me want to know more about this fragile \\"flower and willow world\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled by the author's conceit","review":"The book's cover says that Liza Dalby is the only foreigner ever to have become an actual geisha', but she was never an actual geisha. Dalby didn't undergo the rigourous training necessary to become a fully qualified geisha, she wasn't ever a registered geisha, and claiming on the cover of the book that she was a geisha is blatant misrepresentation. It takes a lot more than a powdered face and following actual geisha about to become a geisha, and claiming otherwise is so unfair to the women who really do train hard and earn the name. In addition, Dalby is way too impressed with herself for the book to be enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's hyped to be","review":"Arthur Golden's 'Memoirs of a Geisha' was a wonderful and beautifully written story, which managed to get me quite interested in the subject. 'Geisha' seemed like the ideal book to read at the time and I tried hard to like it - the problem is it just wasn't very good. Everything is broken up into sections and written like a dull essay, with a few interesting pictures. Another big let-down was the fact that Liza Dalby wasn't really a full-fledged geisha. She just dressed in the fancy gear and put the make-up on and went to a load of parties. She didn't actually go through with the proper binding rituals to join her and her older sister Ichiume together. She only experienced a year of her life in this way and although she certainly knows a lot about a geisha's life, but 'Geisha' makes a very boring read. If you are going to read a book about this subject then do not miss out on 'Memoirs of a Geisha' - one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"I'm very happy with seller!

It is about an American journey, an American spiritual journey. Kent Nerburn shares his clear-eyed, middle-aged return to the left coast. This book is a bittersweet sojourn. It is as if the middle-aged Kent had to discover whether a small town in the northwoods of Minnesota had his heart or if his soul required the spirits of the west coast. His story takes you to exultant heights of the wonders of the human spirit and of creation that will make your spirit sing, yet gently grounds you in the sometimes grim realities of life in the United States.

Shame on however calls this thing a \\"remastering.\\" The previous release was so much clearer and much more listenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This remastered cd should be recalled!","review":"This is a great album...the reason for the 1-star rating is the quality of the newly remastered 2002 disc. It is actually hard to listen to...Barbra's voice in most cuts is scratchy and not clear. If you already own the previous remaster with the white sticker, it sounds so much better than this one. I have to wonder how Sony (or Barbra) would allow this to be on the shelves...there should be a replacement (or credit) recall on this ... what a rip off of a classic early Streisand album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, bad remastering","review":"This is not a review to dispute the merits of the music, which is some of Streisand's best, but the new remastering -- the third issue of this album on CD -- is radically dissapointing. The new mastering, while it pumps up the volume, sounds shrill and too bright, and even worse - the vocals have slight distortion giving them a \\"dirty\\" sound. Frankly, the previous remastering with the white sticker sounded much warmer and cleaner. The other newly remastered CDs sound pretty good, especially \\"The Broadway Album\\" which is a vast improvement on the original, but someone was really careless with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hawaiian Tragedy","review":"This is an excellent and well documented biography of Hawaii's last queen. Helena Allen tells the story of Liliuokalani and through her eyes we view the waning days of the Hawaiian monarchy and the oligarchy that would manipulate the media and congress to eventually affect the annexation of the kingdom to the US. Much of this story makes your blood boil. Yet beyond the political injustice, this is a story of a woman in conflict with her times, who manages to weather the storm with grace, dignity and aloha. It's a story that needs to be told and is a must-read for anyone interested in Hawaiian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Betrayal of Lilliuokalani","review":"Another viewpoint of the Queen, her reaction, the times, and the result of the annexation of Hawaii. Good reading.

When the author discusses a topic and asks the reader to \\"see figure 3.9\\", there is no \\"figure 3.9\\" It is extremely frustrating.I like the book, but don't buy it from this publisher or you will not receive the entire book as it was intended and you won't know what is being discussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is good, but the pictures are missing","review":"I contacted the publisher, I guess Avery took out the colour pictures.

If the publisher gets back to me or someone from www.bernardjensen.org with these pictures, I will return to this comment and make a note as such.

It gives a good breakdown of what Iridology is and includes the Iridology chart for both eyes along with photos of human irises for references. My only complaint: I wish there were more human iris photos in each section. But I'm only through the first few chapters, and I already know the basics of Iridology and how to read parts of the Iris for certain conditions. If your interested in Iridology this is a good starter book.Zac-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as hoped","review":"I am a collector of coleman lanterns. I have always used them when fishing and camping. I have 35 lanterns and camp stoves. Most of them are old,but work fine. My daughter bought this lantern at Amazon for me as a Christmas. It is the hardest lantern I have ever had to light. It smokes really bad for several minutes before the generator gets hot enough to vaporize the gas. Finally,after much smoking the mantle gets bright. I love Coleman products,but this one needs more fine tuning. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I will stick with the old one's. I got a really nice one at a yard sale today for $5.00. It works like they are supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Liquid Fuel Lantern","review":"The Northstar Liquid fuel lantern is a really great product, and it comes with its own funnel. I was skeptical about the wide rubber base, but it grips surfaces well and is heavy duty. I have used it over several nights with only one tank refill. It is built very rugged and will last for years I am sure. In my opinion, white gas is the way to go, it is much cheaper than propane and safer. The ignitor works great, and sure beats using matches. Also, there is a certain nostalgia associated with the tiny extra knowledge and care it takes to use a pump style liquid fuel lantern. I enjoy showing the kids and friends how it works and how to keep it going, kind of keeping the tradition alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Idea Programs","review":"Since my company has an idea program which I believe could be improved, I've read this book. It's short and to the point. It addresses the importance of small ideas for the improvement of the company and the engagement of its employees. It accompanies most of the points with real case stories which make the point even more compelling. Also very important is the chapter related to rewards and the counter-intuitive effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting ideas","review":"The authors show how important it is to gather ideas and encourage people to think creatively.

He told me I would be pleasently surprised with the nature of the songs both lyrically as well as musically. Frequently when I check out these CDs I find they don't live up to the billing. This one is good, very good! You can play it over and over again and not burn out on it. The way the songs are put together is a little different but very melodic. The musicians are top shelf players who seem to have a way of playing these intricate parts yet still clearing room for the other guy. The songs are fast and clean not like some of the slower plodding material which seems to be prevelant in some of todays prog music. I sense traces of YES, Steely Dan, Rush, Jeff Beck and Bowie in their writing style. I recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of the prog/fusion movement, this stuff rips."},{"rating":"1","title":"picture is not the same as model number","review":"I purchased these floor mats based on the picture Amazon has posted and received them today.

Now I have to contact Amazon and try to get this fixed. What a real dissapointment and a royal pain in the arse!

This CD is for people like me: completists. If you want to own everything by the man, get this one. But, if you're looking for a place to start, or round out, your Jerry Reed collection, this isn't the place. No surprise, after decades of singing and smoking, Reed's voice is pretty well depleted. Evidence of this is clear on the song \\"Brand New Me\\" -- a new original number which is quite good, but on which Reed has to trot out vocal assistance to finish. The other songs are lethargic shadows of the original. The recording is sloppy -- the first track starts with Reed talking in mid-sentence, and the applause track is clumsily added in a couple of places. If you want to discover what made Jerry Reed great -- and as a songwriter and guitarist he had few peers -- consider picking up one of the other fine CDs available here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sounding Live Performance","review":"This is an awesome CD !!!!

The title \\"Teach yourself linux\\" couldn't be more true, you need to teach yourself Linux because this book wont be much of a help. The authors don't go deep at all, just scratching the surface, not explaining much. Important things as the installation process, the structure of the system, and some bits here and there are written poorly and will almost definately leave a beginner helpless. As the authors say, this book is for a beginner but in my opinion it's a bit too confusing for a beginner.Don't buy this book if you want to get serious with Linux, there are far better books out there.The Red Hat CD + RPM-packages CD and a useful section about text-editing barely makes this book a two star."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T PUT DOWN THE BOOK","review":"This book is an excellent book, it was suggested on TechTV. it is true old but not outdated because the same Linux commands and the basics and advancced feathures in Linux have not changed.

It may be that this was a good choice when it came out, but it's not very valuable now. It includes Red Hat 6.1 (RH 8.0 is available now), which kept crashing when I tried to install it on my PC. A friend recommended that I try Mandrake. That installed with no problems. Using this book (which is a blow-by-blow Red Hat guide) with Mandrake is just awkward. (Once I got Mandrake up and running, I didn't have much incentive to download RH8.0 to see if this book works.) To be fair to the authors, it looks like they tried to write an interesting book. But as far as my goal - to move from linux virgin to linux newbie - this book didn't help me.If you already bought this book or find it in a garage sale for cheap, I'd recommend you download RH 8.0 and try that from the start.

Even more poor husband has asked that I stop making recipes from the book. The other down side is that a lot of the recipes require special trips to the grocery store, and requires planning ahead.

A child in a man's body, he just can't cope well with the real world.As he plods along on his trip to Cannes, you can just see the gags coming a mile away. In fact, if they hadn't happened, I would've been disappointed. Yet, his bad luck was at times excruciating as you just know he's going to do... don't want to spoil the gags.I enjoyed the first movie and this is no exception.

Even if you weren't a fan of the original movie \\"Mr. Bean's Holiday\\" is a complete 180 in terms of style. It's not by chance that this was given a similar title to \\"Mr. Hulot's Holiday\\" as this movie also relies more on sight gags and visual humor rather than dialogue. Thankfully, this fits in very well with the Mr. Bean character as he rarely talks. Those who enjoyed the Mr. Bean TV shows should like this movie as well since the style is very similar to the classic TV shows. But unlike \\"Bean,\\" this movie is not the same gags from the TV shows thrown into a movie script.Don't expect this movie to be a stereotypical comedy that spoon-feeds you the jokes. The style in this film is unlike anything else you'll see in American theaters today.

Once there, he encounters language and cultural barriers (the ones he is unable to work through are the most fun!), makes new friends, and enjoys an unforgettable adventure. The story is conveyed as much physical as verbally, and admittedly, some viewers will see some of Bean's antics to be a little bit silly. In addition, the plot unfolds slowly, so be aware of that, too. Otherwise, find your copy of this hilarious family comedy film today. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one","review":"I was disappointed, not very funny. I loved the movie BEAN, but this is nothing like that .Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The previews are deceptive and for those of you not familiar with Mr. Bean movies, he apparently does not really EVER talk in them. Mr. Bean's Holiday was silly at best, but soon into the movie I lost all interest whatsoever. For my introduction to Mr. Bean's world, it was a terrible first impression. For those of you who enjoy crude humor, or knee-slap comedy, don't bother watching this one. You'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down!","review":"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!

I found Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean somewhat entertaining on the BBC (aired for me on PBS) in the early 90's, and even found the first film \\"Bean\\" with a few chuckles, but the silent well's run dry here. In it, Bean wins a contest to go to the Cannes Film Festival, yet only wants to go for the beach (?). Of course he goes on his usual unapoligetic destructive path and loses his tickets, way, and you know how it usually goes from there. But as with other road-movies, this one just seemed to go nowhere. And what bet did Willem Dafoe lose to have to appear in this one? Man, talk about career slumming, even though his character's movie-within-a-movie bit was a tad interesting (yet not funny either).Another \\"watched off the TiVo\\" expierence.

This movie gets a one-star rating only because zero or negative stars is not possible. This movie's humor seems to center on Mr. Bean doing his thing, oblivious to other people and ignoring their reactions. At least his TV shows had him reacting with scared little expressions or actions after he'd pulled his blunders. He's unrepenetant and unreactive about his actions here and that makes the movie NOT FUNNY! It's like a joke with no punch line. Boring at best, and irritating most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Bean fans","review":"This is my favorite Bean movie of all time.

On the Christmas episode, the turkey weighing part was missing(one of the funniest parts). On the Do It Yourself episode, same thing! Missing part when older lady gets trapped by crazy recliner due to Mr. Beans intervention! So, I hung onto my old VHS copies, that are un-edited. I saw this newer version that includes both Bean movies and hoped they had listened to past complaints and re-did the editing on the t.v. episodes. OH NO!

When I came home I placed another set of mantles on and tried again, still nothing. The worst part is now I'm being told by Amazon that I cannot return this item. This information would have been nice to know prior to my purchase seeing that I now have a $80.00 paperweight. I'm very disappointed in this transaction.

For example the line during the sex scene on page 45, \\"he laid his hands on the hairs that furled into the ditch between her thighs.\\" Ditch? I think the author tried for too much.

These crutches are going into a closet and will not be returning. Comparing to the standard under the arm crutches these are bulky and heavy. Each crutch is specific for left hand or right hand which makes it a pain when you pick them up and need to figure out which one goes with which arm. After 5 months of use the springs on the bottom section are squeaking and make noise. They are getting loud. When your using crutches people already watch as you walk by, when you add the loudness of the crutches people hear your coming from a lot further away and larger radius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a leg up!","review":"These crutches work very well. They help alleviate some of the shock regular crutches have. They also help to propel you a little bit, but not make you off balance with the shock absorber/piston on the end.Two negatives... the hand pieces tend to loosen all the time. You have to make sure they are tight every time you use them. Additionally, one of the plastic mold pieces has cracked on mine after 2 weeks of use...will call Millennial tomorrow to see if they will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the Millenial Crutch","review":"I recently broke my ankle and brought this item.

Having struggled with crutches years ago, I was hoping someone had improved the design. They have! These are more secure and much easier to use than regular crutches. If you need to use crutches for any length of time, these are worth the extra money. The spring loaded bottoms give you a boost. The handles are much more comfortable. The folding design is great for travel. The hooked design at the top makes stashing them nearby when sitting much more convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEXT GENERATION WALKING AIDE","review":"This product is great for folks who are partially disabled due to weight bad knees ect. They allow you to walk long distances and feel like a hundred pounds have been removed and allows a normal walking stance. I have been walking longer distances and started to get aerobic type exercising due to these wonderful aides. The only negative is that you have to always check to see if the hand grips are tight. Lock-tight or a self tightening nut would solve this problem. Don't let that stop you. I have had doctors and nurses stop me and ask about this aide and where I got it and folks who could benefit from it.

It is another fine collection of songs, featuring \\"My Favorite Things,\\" \\"Sleigh Ride,\\" and a version of \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" bested only by its original singer, Bing Crosby.

Way over the top! The book has all the elements of a winner, but never delivers. He introduces us to several \\"Einstein\\" like characters that could be facsinating, however his character development is so bad, that you never get to know these brillant minds. Oh how I was left totally unsatisfied! Yes I did keep reading,but I found myself rapidly skimming the the pages to get to the end of this dreary gun control lecture. I was surprised that this has 4 stars. In terms of this being a science fiction work, forget it, it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the politicos or lawyers...not for the sci-fi fan","review":"I'm in agreement with some of the other readers...spends way too much time describing politics and not enough with the technology. In addition, in trying to describe the sociological effects of this \\"trigger\\" device (which is used to explode munitions containing nitrates) the author seems to overlook the fact that humans have been killing each other with edged weapons for thousands of years. This kind of lapse makes the story rather laughable as this component is not offered to display effects the trigger has on societies. In addition, it is offensive to see the gun lobby portrayed the way it is in this book. This book is clearly anti-gun and anti-American in the way it portrays our government and our established laws. Mr. Clarke, quit lending your name to works that don't deserve it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and retarded","review":"I've bought this book because of the Arthur Clarke's name on it. However judging from reading it, Mr. Clarke could have provided only the general plot. I will never believe that he could do such a horrible writing. The book is long and extremely slow-paced. The characters in it are badly retarded: all their actions are predictable 100 pages ahead yet they struggle hard during these 100 pages to come to obvious conclusions. The \\"science\\" in this book is completely phony. The book is so stupid and boring that I was not able to finish it. (By the way, do you know that the firearms with liquid (gasoline-like) propellant already exist and are considered the guns of the future ? This makes the described social effects of the main invention in this book, to put it mildly, unconvincing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Social Commentary Masquerading as Fiction","review":"I had an opportunity to read this book and was eager to do so. Arthur C. Clarke is one of my favorite Sci-Fi authors, and I have enjoyed many of his works. Sadly, I could not finish this book because in 75 pages it was clear this was a myopic, politically-correct and fantastical vision of the way the world \\"ought to be.\\" The \\"science\\" is theoretical junk, based on good wishes not scientific theory. The idea that peace would break out if all guns and explosives were rendered useless is the most hilarious, yet sad, idea that is repeatedly expressed by the authors. I look back on history and recall the millions who were slaughtered or enslaved by nations that possessed only the sword and the spear and laugh at the idea that removing weapons will change man's aggressive and dominating tendencies. Don't buy this book and contribute to ludicracy.

Especially so in the last pages. The reader is, however, often irritated by the sheer volume of unnecessary dialogue. The text could easily be reduced by one third without affecting the impact of the story. Indeed, this book would surely be better remembered if that were so. Four stars, nevertheless, for the idea...."},{"rating":"1","title":"a 10-page essay straining to fill a 500-page novel","review":"Whether or not you find the premise intriguing, this book is an unmitigated disaster when judged as an actual story. There are no antagonists worth mentioning, no real conflict, no satisfying explanations of the speculative technology, and NO PLOT. By the time I had reached the 300th page I was thinking, \\"ok, I get it already. Do I really need to read to the end? No.\\" (I did anyway in the hopes of some surprise or twist at the end, of which there of course was none, or none worth mentioning at least.)

The result is a wish list of things that might issue from technology. We have my namesake, Horton, making the serendipitous discovery of an effect that no one can explain, but which causes the destruction of nitrogen-based explosives. What does the world do then?Another reviewer points out the imbalanced viewpoints, pro-gun people being totally irrational in the book, anti-gunners being walking ages of reason. I agree with his criticism of this. One might do well to send Messers Clarke and Kube a copy of John Lott's excellent statistical study of the matter: More Guns, Less Crime.Or:I could just chalk it all up to the genre. After all, it's *supposed* to be fiction. I might as well see the idea that predatory people won't take advantage of a Trigger as another part of the same fiction.

It is easy to read and also is convincing as it, time and again, refers back to field research done by the author. To underline this, many observations of actual sales-calls are \\"quoted\\".If you are new to sales, you might find that the continuous assumption that \\"you have been, of course, for a long time been familiar with the following concepts...\\" gets a bit irritating after a while. A side-effect is, that the author quite often feels the need to defend himself against established sales-culture. Also, the fact that the book brings useful news for those selling \\"large\\" items only does not exactly jump from the publisher's notes.However, if you are in large sales and wondering why the old-establised methods aren't working for you, then this book could be worth its weight in gold for you and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for All Sales People!","review":"This easy-to-understand book will increase your sales effectiveness, closing ratio, income and level of satisfaction in selling.

The scripted conversations are ridiculously simple and in the \\"what not to do\\" scenarios the sales rep making suggestions would have lost their jobs in 1988 when the book was originally written (I love the references to the \\"big eight\\", that's what re-releases are for) or can be found today on some used car lot in the California desert.This book reads like a consultant wrote it, a lot of words and wasted time determining what you already knew. If you're a sales manager looking for a book for your staff I would not recommend this one for anyone with more than a years experience if they made quota.

I must say, I'm very disappointed. I thought the operatic and choral stuff was cool but didn't know it would be on EVERY SONG of the CD and make up the lyrics entirely. The music is simple and just doesn't do it for me. The best song is the one that Hansi Kuersch sings on and that's because it's the ONLY song on the CD that isn't totally operatic with undecipherable lyrics. What a disappointment. I won't be buying any more music from Therion.

Apparently there was a short in the unit, it would just cut off. The only way to get it to come back on was to turn the temperature knob past the point where it previously was. For example, it was on Low and cut off. When I turned the knob to Medium, it cut back on. Then about 15 minutes later, it cut off again. Then I had to turn it up to High to get it to come back on, and about 15 minutes later it cut off again. Luckily it was still within the return period so I sent it back. Maybe I just got a lemon.

It is historical fiction that deals with Native Americans living in America's first real city, located in present-day Louisiana. It is the 11th book in the Gears' series about early Native Americans and reads similar to the others.I've read them all and have enjoyed them all. The Gears manage to create vivid characters time and time again that you grow quite attached to. They mix suspense and excellent story telling with history, since much of their setting is based on archaelogical evidence.This particular volume, while very enjoyable and hard to put down, did have a bit of a weaker ending than some other books in the series. It dragged a bit while Salamander pondered his big choice at the end. And his decision seemed a bit anti-climactic.But I still would recommend this book. Definitely to fans of the Gears other works. And also to fans of pre-contact Native American historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed !","review":"Remembering when the newspapers ran a story on Poverty Point, identifying it as a large and meaningful site, in 1955, I was excited to find something written about such a mysterious place. Something a layperson could understand and enjoy. This story, while touching, failed, in my opinion, to include so much of the true wonder of Poverty Point. The lapidarian skills, the questions about the use of the stones we now call plummets, were ignored, so, I was disappointed.

It sat nicely on one of the two burners.One thing I noticed, though. The temperature gauge seemed to register a bit lower than the actual temp. When I cooked the brownies the recipe called for 350 for 30 minutes. I cooked them for about 35 minutes with the gauge never going over 300 and they were fine.Also note that it isn't very huge; you can't put a whole cookie sheet or lasagna pan in it.

Most of their crimes were committed in the early hours of the morning under influence of alcohol. They seemed to possess a hatred of Catholics, especially Murphy, but killed Protestants as well in what became nothing more than blood lust after a few beers. The real problem is that none of the men in question could be described as psychopaths.I also believe that Dillon gives a good insight into the collusion that exists between Loyalist and Republican terrorists, which gives the impression that the politics of the terrorists are really a sham and that these people are gangsters, nothing more. Full marks to Dillon with this book, he certainly gains my respect as a historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indictment of the times","review":"A sad and disturbing book that gives an insight into the period of \\"civil conflict\\" misnamed \\"the Troubles\\".Murphy and his accomplices committed awful crimes against innocent Roman Catholics,quite stomach churning.I think this book has to be read with a view of the situation that was going on in Northern Ireland at the time.These Shankill Butchers felt that they were reacting to the murderous activities of the IRA who were shooting/bombing/maiming/torturing policemen,soldiers.As during this period the IRA and its allies the INLA were murdering people everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly funcional","review":"This corer works very well.

There's a brilliant comprehensible line here and there, but much of it almost seems like automatic writing with a little bit of word play added. The closest thing I can compare it to is Burroughs.

Despite witnessing the passions and fears of the book's characters including one of two protagonists, Celia (museum-robbing, sleuthing magazine publisher), the reader never gets to know why these people act as they do. Adele should perhaps remain a mystery, but the fascination behind Celia's relentless search should have been explored. On the other hand, Blanche (Adele's captor/slave/lover) is as fully fleshed as Celia should have been.Overall, I thought that for such sensual (often grotesquely so) material, the characters seem rather cold. It also seems to be missing a final chapter. Very unsatisfying (but was that the author's intent?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Come Together","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that although this book is supposed to be about passion, it did not inspire any passion and came off cold.

This album is almost an example of the kind of work Columbia probably originally intended for Streisand. Middle of the road songs with generic slightly jazzy arrangements, nothing histronic and nothing dramatic. The result is a very pleasing album but none of the tracks will really knock your socks off.

When I first listened to this album, visions of a urin stained mattress covered with dirty briefs and surrounded by whiskey bottles, Heroin needles and Hustler magazines entered my mind. Forget this traditional Metal trash and listen to At the gates' \\"Terminal spirit disease\\", Bathory's \\"Hammerheart\\", Immortal's \\"Pure holocaust\\" and Death's \\"Symbolic\\".UP DEE IUNZ DUUUUUUUUUUUDZ!

I got this album on cassette back in the days when I would sometimes buy an album just because it looked metal. I usually chose well which was not as hard in the early days of metal before the circus came to town in the mid-late 80s. I only really liked Take Control and Break The Chain but now years later I have come to realize what a great album this is. The production is electric allowing the guitar to crackle and the drums to pound! The re-issue that I have features 15 songs including a few b-sides. The cover of Born To Be Wild is so over the top with John and guest wailer Udo seeing who can outdo the other, it always makes me laugh. Of the 15 tracks I deem 10 to be i-pod worthy.

The sound quality of the band just isn't up to previous years, and the drums sound a bit tacky, but it's a pure high energy rock concert captured on CD. The band stuck to their older more well known songs but every one's a crowd pleaser, even if Bruce does shout his way through Back on the Road.

Recently we noticed that there was a critter, possibly a raccoon, trying to catch the fish at night. The water plants were turned over, the netting we put over the pond was torn and fell in the water. So we bought this trap and set up the bait at the far end of the cage. The baits were taken twice but the trap door did not close. So we tried again by tying an additional string to the bait and the hook of the trap door release, hoping that when the bait was taken, the trap door would close. This time the bait was taken and the trap door closed without trapping anything. We found that the bait was probably fished out from the top of the cage as the bait was tied to a string.

What I wasn't prepared for was the huge mess the raccoon created! Fecal matter everywhere...pee everywhere...and shredded cardboard everywhere(I hid the cage under a cardboard box not knowing the raccoon would be able to reach through the cage and shred it.

Imagine doing that to release a trapped raccoon (which is what I intended this trap for) - the animal would have bitten off one's fingers. I sent an email to Havahart describing the problem and asking for advice but they never responded. I then returned the item to Amazon's vendor. To be fair, I am not sure if all the Havahart 1089 traps have this problem.

Everything went fine with the build until I had to setup the connection between the plate spring and the trap door. The metal hook had to be bent to get into the loop on the trap door mechanism. The plate that springs the trap is not sensitive enough. I baited the trap with some chicken bones and noticed that something had gone into the cage. It pulled the bones outside of the cage without springing the trap.Bottom line: so far the trap has been ineffective and I would look elsewhere for a better trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Trapping Fail","review":"I liked this product for cat trapping. An infestation of cats emerged and the animal control failed to help and would rather deal with barking dog complaints from idiot neighbors than deal with nuisance cats, so I had to take this matter in my own hands.This cage helped at first and I was able to catch multiple feral cats but after that I was disappointed that the latch mechanism wouldn't latch anymore because the cheap metal became loose, therefore making this product useless.

I checked the trap in the morning and noticed that the \\"release door\\" was nearly pulled right off of the trap, and of course it was empty (must've been mommy).

In our case we were trying to trap a mother cat with kittens. If one or more of the kittens follows her into the trap and she trips it they could be injured (or worse!).

We tried a plate of tuna with a few kibbles of dry cat food on top. No success the first or second day (although we did trap a neighbor's outdoor cat by mistake). We kept adding fresh food and taking it in at night (as we weren't really interested in catching a raccoon) although dusk is apparently the best time to catch a cat.Today, when chatting with a neighbor, we heard a \\"snap\\" and guess who was in the trap?

Although the trap arrived with minimal assembly instructions, I was able to put it together without difficulty. We caught a good sized opossum on the very first night that we set the trap. It took quite a while to lure the feral cat into the trap (tuna juice did the trick), but we did finally succeed. All in all, I was very pleased with it.

The only way they can't get out is if I re-enforce the top and sides of the cages with big cement blocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cage not working properly","review":"The cage was a bit difficult to assemble but not too time consuming. However, after assembly we found the cage does not stay open for more than a few seconds. It keeps closing at the very slightest touch. It would not work for trapping an animal because the animal might have the door close down upon them before they were fully in the cage. We have contacted the seller and they told me to contact the manufacturer. I have tried to do so many times, but repeatedly get a \\"busy\\" signal with that phone number. The cage is still sitting here and I do not trust to use it on an animal. Something is wrong with this cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This is a piece of junk. The gauge of the wire is too small. A squirrel has no trouble bending the back of the trap enough to escape. A squirrel also has no problem bending the top of the cage upward sufficiently to release the latch on the trap door on the front so as to escape. A racoon has no difficulty doing either of these two feats as well as generally deforming the cage so as to open multple paths of exit.

I will try reading again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic, ineffective writing","review":"Having just started to read about Jungian psychology, and taken an interest in the concept of the shadow, I approached this book in anticipation after reading Robert A Johnson's 'Owning your shadow'.While Johnson's book was concise and to the point,and very enjoyable to read, this book has been a boring read after the first couple of chapters. The ideas presented are sometimes repetitive and at other times just do not gel. You feel that you've read a profusion of sentences with a sprinkling of punctuations in between but with very little new information or insight as you go from page to page. I don't think I've learnt much, in theory or in practice. Will go to Debbie Ford's \\"The Dark side of the Light Chasers\\" now and hopefully find a more satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 4 months","review":"This bracelet is made very cheap.

They are small hardback books with print so small they would only be good for notation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Down For Max","review":"Max - what does \\"realistic dialogue (corrected your spelling)\\" mean, in a documentary? Are you mixing your metaphors? ALL dialogue in a documentary is realistic, or it is not a documentary. Get your terms straight before you start slagging something. And HOW, pray tell, did the editing ruin the movie? There is no meat in your argument, let alone brain tissue! Try to make your thoughts cogent, and worth the time to read. Did you have a different kind of composer's music in mind, and who and what. Etc. ad nauseam.If you have not heard the album, and need a \\"similar\\" tag, my wife says Chris Michie's music is akin to a wilder form of Craig Chaquico, who I thought had been the guitar player for the opening sequence of film.The film was dedicated to Chris Michie, who died after making this wonderful music. If the filmmaker and the subject of the film are satisfied with Michie's product, pay more attention to that. Mark was too kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listening Music","review":"Great listening music especially if you have seen the movie. It makes you smile while listening and recalling the memory of the wild parrots in the movie. The music is gentle, easy listening. Chris Michie created wonderful pieces specifically for the film in additional to some of his other musical arrangements. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The drawbacks to this item outweigh the benefits.","review":"This product is nearly impossible to clean and sanitize. There is really no good way to clean it without it bending in weird ways and the bark breaks off.

It is a great complement to Harvest of Sorrow by putting the Famine in perspective with first had testimonies, the opinions of current historians and with recently discovered Soviet archival documents and photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting portrayal Soviet genocide of the Ukrainian nation.","review":"A riveting portrayal of the man-made genocidal famine in Soviet Ukraine, organized by Stalin and his henchmen, this book marks the epitome of the research and writings of noted historian Robert Conquest. It is a must for any student seriously interested in understanding why the Soviet Empire was so despised by many of the captive nations and why Ukrainians were amongst those who most desperately resisted the imposition of communist rule and the continued existence of the Soviet system. Most shocking is the actual story of this genocidal deed, but the obfuscation and propaganda of Soviet apologists in the West, at that time (1930s) and since, is almost equally appalling. That some of these communists who committed this crime against humanity (and many more war crimes subsequently) still remain unpunished, in our midst here in North America, Israel and western Europe, is nothing less than a sin against humankind and God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This book was just what I was looking for! All of the tips and hints throughout the book have made me a more conscious photographer. The art in the book shows what you should and shoud not do while posing clients.

However, I just can't. The photography in this book is bad (frequently bad light, bad subjects, horrible backgrounds) and the posing of the subjects is frequently laughable for what is supposed to be a 'good' pose. Plus, the organization of the book is terrible. For what is supposed to be an educational book, these shortcomings take it from sub-average to unacceptable. What a waste of money - I bought the book in a hurry in a camera shop. Never again. FLUUUUSH - that's the sound the toilet made with my $35USD.DO NOT buy this book.Amherst would be so much stronger a house if their titles were CONSISTENT - some books are good, but so much garbage. Can't trust 'em, may as well not pay for it. Find a good website or blog and learn it for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"posing techniques, Norman Phillips","review":"I like this book alot. I keep going back to it. It's about posing your subjects and not about using the camera to take the pictures or shooting in exotic locations. It gives lots of good series of examples with young people. That's where the money is at in Weddings. Lots of hands,feet, body, and head posing examples. It's good to see both examples and instructive explanations. Also has side by side examples of two subjects right/wrong. Also sitting, standing, groups, brides. I'd say it's a \\"technical\\" book that I appreciate. Too many Wedding books are just a lot of wedding photos without much \\"how to\\" and are useless. This one really helps! I made my assistant read it! 122 pages of good solid info if you take the time to study and assimilate it into your ingrained routine. It's as good as Jeff Smith's \\"Posing for Portrait Photography\\" book and that's a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disorganized!","review":"Sample pictures do not have a clear description of which poses are good or bad.

My printer is an Officejet Pro L7680 All in One.I may contact HP to see if they can determine if their recent software upgrade is the problem. For a while I thought it may have just stopped working from age (used since 2009) and that may still be the case. I do not know. The printer recognizes other commands using the bt450 but will not print.I am giving it 2 stars for now: not working. Until it stopped working I would give it 4 stars. It had good range.

I bought it through amazon but it was shipped from Tech Depot an affiliated company of Office Depot and they said since I opened it that I could not return it. How was I supposed to know it wouldn't work without opening, I won't shop from office depot or Tech depot again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Cut It","review":"I bought the product with the intention of printing from across my house. The room I'm printing from and the room with the printer aren't separated by any walls, so there shouldn't be a problem. Checked the manuals and it said there was a range of 30m. Took the measurement and found it to be only 50 feet, about half the distance that was advertised. I reconfigured their positions, and still nothing would work. The printer didn't have a problem as it's brand new and ideally should work, but nothing good has come. I resorted to the old fashion USB way. Another miss by HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adapter did not work with my printer!","review":"The Blutooth adapter did not work with my printer - an HP PSC 1510 All-in-One.

However, that particular adapter is no longer available, so HP told me I could use the bt450. NOT!! I purchased and returned 2 of them. My computer 'saw' my printer for about 20 seconds - that's it. After that it was no longer visible. I tried everything - including making a ton of changes to my system (as told to me by a couple of their techs), only to have had my entire system just freeze up. Thank goodness for system restore. HP is too proprietary with their products. They just don't like to \\"play nice\\" with other manufacturer's products. I won't purchase any more HP products.

I purchased two of these to connect my MacBook Pro to HP Officejet 7310 and too late read in my printer's manual that it can't be commected wirelessly. What a let down! Not what I'd expect from HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong USB Type!","review":"I bought this Bluetooth adapter to print from my laptop without cable. When I received the adapter I couldn't plug it to my printer because, as a lot of printers, it only had a type B USB port, when this adapter is a type A male requiring a type A female port on the printer. Maybe I should have known this, but the product info should also have told us about this possible occurence in its specification and warn us. So I cannot say whether it works or not, because I first need to purchase a gender adapter (A female to B male) which only costs 1$90, but because I didn't find it in shops I'll have to order trough the net and pay shipment for that. Just another silly waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent intro to NYC-on-foot to residents and visitors","review":"Awesome book for both residents and tourists alike.

Plot, characterization, background, and writing are all two-dimensional at best. Cullen's efforts to create depth to his characters and pathos to his story are remarkably clumsy and wholly ineffective.

But I was profoundly disappointed in the ending. Half way through, it became clear this was a romance novel dressed up as a mystery, complete with pretty explicit sex scenes that pulled me right out of the story. The proof was in the ending. The author breezes right past the resolution of the crime, and then glosses over an even more horrendous crime than the one which fueled the entire book. The villain(s) are just dumped into the ending and/or not identified at all, but sure enough, the romance is wrapped up with a neat little bow. I believe that when you spend more than two-thirds of a book building up to a big ending, you need to deliver. Too bad.

He simply cannot be believed or trusted.But hey, I'm sure Sean Hannity (another completely discredited partisan ideological right wing hate-monger) loved it. So there's your audience Zell.But as someone who has been betrayed by him and his so called senatorial representation, I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zell Miller Never Disappoints","review":"Zell Miller is to be applauded with standing ovations for this outstanding book. The liberal Dems have had their brief moment, venting and whining about Bible thumping Christian values. Guess what! I am not one of those but I do admire a man who stands and delivers as Zell Miller has done. He makes his words count and nothing Michael Moore or other limo-libs say can discount the truth of the matter. Zell Miller just reinforces a belief in our country's worth. We are a nation of very generous people who have given the Dems too much time to get their act together. All they have done is scare those of us who were unafiliated into the \\"enemy camp.\\" Those of us who cannot identify with John and Terroriza Kerry, Teddie-Boy Kennedy and Primal Scream Dean will have to find our own scene and Zell Miller will lead the way. Sorry but you Dems chased a lot of us away with your extremes. We are looking for heroes and Zell can fit the big shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conservative perceptions from a democrat.","review":"Zell Miller demonstrates outstanding courage to take a stand against the current liberal bias in his democrat party. Our nation needs more leaders like this Senator who comes from the school of hard-knocks in the mountains of northern Georgia instead of the pampered wealthy liberal lawyer types from the northeast and west coasts who insist on scuttling the very precepts upon which this nation was founded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deficit of Decency","review":"Mr. Miller writes a heart felt, very apt description of America today. It is a book everyone should read so they know what is right about good people, what is wrong about many \\"modern\\" trends.2 thumbs up !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deficit of Decency","review":"This book is a good review of the degradation that is happening in our society both politically and as a people. I found the facts given quite enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down Home","review":"Zell Miller's down home attitude regarding life and politics come through in this book. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Title","review":"The title of this book is very interesting to me! I'll explain. Besides the implication that democrats have no decency, \\"Deficit of Decency\\" could, mutatis mucockus, be considered to justify the national debt (deficit) as decent, i.e., Bush: \\"Deficits don't matter.\\" Going out on a limb, the def- prefix reminds me of the word \\"defecate,\\" which is what I wanted to do while flipping through this book. Then there's the hopelessly vague word, decency, which means different things to different people. To Miller, a balls-out kinda guy, it means something quite different than what, say, an Iraqi, or anyone who maintains contact with reality might think was decent.In other words, don't waste your time--just read the jacket cover and you'll be filled with enough righteous indignation to start your OWN war against humanity. Use the rest for fuel after the nuclear holocaust. The time you save can be spent doing research into Bush's war crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I thought this was poorly written and a complete bore.

I could write pretty, pseudo-intellectual comments, but why bother. The people who believe this crap can't read. They barely have the attention span to follow the bouncing, flashing lights on Fox. They want their own country, one slightly to the right of Iran, where gas is cheap, and people are cheaper. Where taxes don't exist, but their grab bag is always full. These anti-American traitors should be given what they want: a new US. They can have 'Bama, Texas, and all points between. Then, let's declare war on 'em and be done with them once and for all. Decency! This man knows no such thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Democrat in name only","review":"Forty years ago, Zell Miller said that Lyndon Johnson was \\"a Southerner who sold his birthright for a mess of dark pottage.\\" It's a vile, bigoted, evil statement. The unvarnished truth is that Miller was once a proud bigot toward blacks and, now that that is no longer acceptable, he is a proud bigot toward gays. I'm appalled that the Republican party would use as its keynoter someone who was once a proud segregationist. The objects of Zell Miller's hatred have shifted; but the spirit is the same. What was once the dark stain of the Democratic party is now being used by Republicans.Other comments made by Zig Zag Zell can be found at:http://www.americanprogressaction.org/site/pp.asp?c=klLWJcP7H&b;=180417Republicans, we are glad he is on your side, we disowned him years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deficient all right.","review":"This smarmy, chest-thumping collection of misinformation is precisely what one would expect from this consummate politician. His attempts in the book to cloak his ignoble motivation to betray his party and its principles fail miserably; it's clear that self-interest, not principle, was his motivation. I guess his fawning on Bush as our nation's savior from terror seems a little less credible than it used to. This political Judas Iscariot has a lot of nerve spouting about \\"Christian values\\" given his racist past and lack of integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-righteous hack","review":"Everytime i see books from old farts like Zell Miller talking about how they long for the good 'ol days of when decency prevailed in america i laugh. What decency is he referring to? What time is he talking about? Is he talking about the 50's? When black people were treated as second-class citizens? No? Well let's go back further then, is he talking about the 1800's when the south owned slaves? Was it decent back then 'Ol Zell? Give me a break! All these self-righteous puritans need to get off their pedestals and come back to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE","review":"Zell Miller's over the top savaging of John Kerry at the GOP convention last year makes him a prime architect of the decency deficit that he has the gall to write about. Zell can now collect his royalties alongside such paragons of decency as Bill Bennett, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannerty who combined cant find a single thing wrong with the Bush administration. You cant fool everyone but you can fool enough to be a best selling author bemoaning the lack of a quality you don't have yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love you K Manno","review":"I have nothing to add here save a hear ye! hear ye! to the review below by K Manno.

Zell Miller is the classic example of a man left behind by history, and the irony of his being helped along that path by Sean Hannity is priceless (or even the penny this book can be bought for used on this site). Still I admit I wished they had left Zell's original title \\"My Struggle\\" intact and also the translation from the German isn't as sharp as one would like but still this book is a vivid snapshot of when conservatism embraced the worst of the old south and offically became the party of bitter old white men and uh Sarah Palin. Congrats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Unique","review":"Such an impossible story is made possible in this truly unique story of Shant's journey home. Each chapter draws you closer to the end, but also to a new beginning. Shant has done an excellent job making the reader feel as if they are along side him on his journey, and his attention to detail is outstanding. I highly recommend getting a hold of this book, (just make sure you start reading it with some time on your hands, once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Heart","review":"This story was truly a different side to what most people see and hear.

It holds a great list of books.Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War\\" is in there, but I especially like Tao Tai Kung (or \\"The secret teachings of the Tai Kung\\") The most entertaining thing about this work is that it is a beautiful example of a different world view. It was an excellent introduction to an entire philosophy.(look for surprising parallels twixt this and Adam Smith's \\"...Wealth of Nations\\", with an eastern perspective.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide to warriors for 2,500 Years","review":"Ralph D. Sawyer's translations is a must have for anyone studying military thought and theory or martial arts. This translation brings to the Western reader the ideas set down by these wise men of the past. My friends who do read Chinese say this translations is one of the best English versions. Many business professionals like to say how \\"Business is war\\" and use these warriors' thought, but here the Saywers show that the ideas set down in these classics are for the warrior and especially for peace. A lost business deal pales in comparison to what a warrior faces when he/she looses in combat. These seven classics are a wonderful guide to one who wishes to live a martial and peaceful life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good short book, great appendix","review":"This is a great introductory book. Far from being overwhelming, it gives the technical reader a solid base on which to build. The best part about the book may just be the appendices, however. This is the only book where you can get a complete listing of the RMI and Personal Profiles, which is really useful to have around if you decide to go into the subject later on in more depth.A topic I found particularly useful and covered here better than other books is the chapter dealing with different Java Technology environments (ie: application servers, CRM, ERP, etc.). It seemed more real-world than some of the future applications and therefore more relative to what engineers may be working on today.While I wish the narrative by the author could have been a little more detailed in sections, I think the appendices alone make this book worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"This book is an excellent resource for those interested in diving into the field of Jini via J2ME. The book was well organized, the examples made sense, and it left me feeling like I had a solid foundation on which to build. If you're at all interested in Jini and small devices, this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good starting point","review":"I thought this was a really good introduction to Jini using J2ME, which is exactly what it claims to be. I needed a starting point and this book did the job pretty well. This is also the only place I could find the complete profiles. It's a convenient reference. While I agree the non-appendix part of this book could have been a bit more detailed, I still think it's a great kickoff point. I would recommend it for anyone interested in Jini using J2ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This Book is very disappointing.

For starters, out of its 340 pages, 233 are simply unannotated API (J2ME Profiles). The remaining 107 pages are a very shallow description of Jini and J2ME, hardly providing any practical advice about use of Jini on small devices.Book's examples assume knowledge of Jini and RMI and lack any explanation.

Ms. Piercy's writing is, as usual, beautifully crafted, almost lyrical. Her use of the cats in her life was, for me, a tantalizing hook. But unfortunately, no matter how much I wanted to care enough about her life to pick up the book after once putting it down, there was nothing in it, for me, to make that happen. I found the book to be nothing more than a not very interesting, self-indulgent trip down memory lane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining is not an attractive quality,","review":"even in a writer of Piercy's stature. By the time I was a quarter of the way through the book, I was bored. By the time I was finished, I was ready to write Piercy off . . . but then I re-read her poetry, and was hooked again. So what if I didn't enjoy the story of her life? She probably wouldn't enjoy mine, either. But seriously, this is one autobiography that I'd rather pass in favor of the fiction and poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing change from many autobiographies.","review":"Ms. Piercy shares with us her life - unsanitized, unpasteurized, in all its naked glory.

From her childhood in Detroit, through stints in Boston and California, then finally back to lovely Wellfleet, we see a brave, intelligent, strong woman struggling to live her life to the best of her ability. This book is an inspiration - I recommend it heartily to all women seeking to engage fully with life.Ms. Piercy addresses the cats who have populated her life as completely as she does any of the humans. Animal lovers will understand and appreciate the love she exudes in print for her four-legged family members.On the negative side, she sometimes jumps around from topic to topic, a bit disjointedly...but I pretended I was having a conversation over coffee with her, and the writing style fell into place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Left Cat","review":"Lyrically written, Marge Piercy dances us through her childhood, coming of age, and adulthood.

I loved this book. I read it on my long commute home, and now that I have finished it, I feel like I am missing a friend. When I can think about it without crying, I will write a letter to Marge Piercy and tell her how much I loved this book.An update: I did write to Ms Piercy, and much to my surprise, she wrote me back!

Woodiwiss descriptions of all these places are wonderful her ability to describe each scene with graphic detail pulls you in while all the unexpected turns kept me engaged. The love story may have been frustrating at times because Shanna would not allow herself to fall for Raurk and even I, during their time with the pirate's, felt he should just get her back to her father and give up on her, but he never does.

I thoroughly enjoy escaping into Shanna's world and watching her grow and change through all the trials she puts herself through. It makes me wish for a life that can be like this, beautiful and loving. Can you imagine loving someone so much that you are willing to be sold into slavery just to be near them?The ingenuity it takes to escape the pirates was wonderful. I don't even think it was too far fetched. Oh, and let's not forget some good, old-fashioned bodice ripping going on :-)This book is written so well, once your are captured into it you'll find yourself reading late into the night just to get to the next hurdle for this couple and see how they deal with it.I highly recommend this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Female Protagonist Ever","review":"Ruark was great. He was charming, smart, witty, and loyal. But love must really be blind because I do NOT understand how he could love Shanna so much and keep coming back for more. She's selfish, self-righteous, cruel, manipulative and just downright evil at times. I did not find their story romantic at all. I just read on to see how Ruark cleared his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Woodiwiss, HATE Shanna","review":"I adore Kathleen Woodiwiss, but I am here to finally confess my hatred for Shanna. I just can't stomach the super-spoiled, willful little witch who is the main character. That said - this is one of the finest authors of early so-called \\"bodice-ripper\\" romance. Don't judge the book on my account - especially if you like super-willfill heroines."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not understand the appeal of this book.","review":"I found the style of writing too flowery. To describe it as melodramatic is an understatement. Also, Shana was annoying. I must say, the only good part of this book for me was the hero. Now HE was something!I think I'll stick to Judith McNaught, Susan E. Phillips, Patricia Gaffney, and others.I recommend: ALMOST HEAVEN by McNaught and LADY BE GOOD by Phillips and TO HAVE AND TO HOLD by Gaffney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"underwritten","review":"This book was in very poor shape I am glad it was only a penny. But was not worth the complete cost. $5 pages falling out cover in poor shape. i will not purchase on this sellers descripiton of their sell items. Disatisfied"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun romance!","review":"This epic book was so much fun to dig into. Miss Woodiwiss does a great job with setting and character creation, that I wish I found in other romances. Frankly I don't, not even in the author's other books I have tried. I give this book 4 stars because it was a bit long in places, but otherwise it was a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry to say I too am named after this book.","review":"Although I enjoyed this lustful adventure when I was fifteen, the shallow romance does not spark my interest any longer. Maybe my problem is that I have never been a fan of romance novels, much preferring anything that more closly resembles life, or science fiction that has nothing to do with reality. I picked up this book again last month hoping to reminisce on why I liked it in my teenage years and understand a little more of why my mother liked it enough to name her first born after it, but I was at a loss. I found the first chapter positively ridiculous. I continued anyway hoping it would get better, but was not rewarded. There was enough fluff there to kill a person. By the thrid chapter I had to quit, and had my roomate rolling on the floor with laughter at the cliched language and preposterous events. I just hope my sexual encounters can't be described so cheesily. Ruark, I hate to break it to you, but you will never be this Shanna's hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty watch, good value","review":"It's a tad smaller then I thought but it is still worth the price!Would recommend for sure!

And once again I have found another great watch, from a great maker.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish production/great performance","review":"Turn off the TV and listen to this DVD. Image quality and composition are the worst I've ever seen on a professionally released concert. Given that bassist Rodby had full access to the band for setups and camera angles, his directorial choices seem all the more bizzare. Add to that lame video effects reminiscent of the dreaded \\"toaster\\" and you have quite a dissappointment on your hands. Stellar band peformances and audio quality make the visuals even more junior-varsity by comparison. To see beautifully shot jazz, check out the Dejohnette/Hancock/Holland/Metheny DVD as well as Keith Jarret Trio, Live at Open Theater East. Being a huge PMG fan (I've seen 4 of their live concerts over the years) I was really counting on this DVD to be a front-row seat. But given the choice between this disc and the balcony, I'll take the balcony."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Completists Only","review":"By all means buy the Imaginary Day music disc, but skip this turkey. I am a major PM(G) fan but this DVD bites. Editing looks to be done by a curious junior high kid, but was done by Steve Rodby, the normally talented beyond belief bassist/producer of PMG. Here's hoping if Pat does another DVD he will have it professionally shot and edited. Turn up the disc but turn off the picture. Boo. Hiss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Live Performance","review":"Imaginary Day album is very interesting (and good) simply because PMG uses lots of different sounds/instruments. It's just neat to see how they play these different instruments, etc. I recommend this DVD if you like the music album. It is always interesting to actually \\"see\\" them play.I put 4 stars because this performance is recorded outside on a concert in CA. Some of the camera shots aren't good but this is just a minor thing to me. The sound quality is still good + pictures are clear and that's enough to make me happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music - Awful Video","review":"Too bad the the images, film direction and photography were not on par with the music. The sound quality is outstanding, but the video is downright BAD! Many scenes were shot looking at the backs of the subject being shot. Other times I thought my TV was broke when there were many seconds of total black and no image. Worst of all was the amaturish usage of every concievable video gimmack in the book. It was hard to look at this music video for more than 15 minutes as the shots bounced around so often and never gave me a chance to settle in and enjoy the concert. Did I mention that the composition and camera angles were not well thought out either. If you are looking for a really good DVD get the WE LIVE HERE, LIVE IN JAPAN. I wish I could get my money back for this non professional attempt to record a concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 24 bit Feast for the Ears","review":"I own 8 DVD-Audio titles. Imaginary Day was made for DVD-Audio. The 5.1 mix is the best I've heard yet. I own the CD but when I got the DVD it was like I never heard this music before. Pure ear candy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy fan...","review":"When I ordered this DVD, I expected a show, much like the one provided on the 'We live here, live in Japan' DVD... NOT.All that is on this DVD is music with a picture accompanying each musical piece. I'm a Metheny fan, having all his albums on 33 1/3 plus CD, even got the PM Songbook. But had I known that this was nothing more than music and pictures, I would have never bought it. Of course, I had to take it out of its package to witness the desaster... so, no refund possible.By the CD. And beware of the DVD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pat Metheny Must-Have","review":"I had never viewed a live performance recorded on to DVD before and when I ordered this DVD I had no idea how fantastic it would actually be. I was looking forward to being able to see the performers since that always makes a huge difference in the depth of the music, but hearing it in 5.1 surround was incredible! I was so surprised at the difference it makes. It really lets you enjoy the music on a new level. If you're a fan of the album this is definitely a must-have item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a Pat Metheny video?","review":"I'll make it simple. This great music deserves a far better video production.Steve Rodby: please stay with what you know how to do best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry rotted","review":"The steering wheel cover shipped quickly. When I went to put it on my steering wheel, it all broke apart. It was dry rotted. Pretty disappointing, but they were quick to refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooooooooooorible singing, great songs","review":"Are you people kidding?? This cd is ONLY for the diehard Finn fan. The singers manage to grunt and sputter their way through Neil and Tim Finn classics so badly that I'm still suffering after having listened to it months ago. Do yourself a favor, and keep the 2nd cd with the songs sung by the Finns, and then take the first one and stomp on it, cut it up into little bits, burn it, bury it, and then pray that it is never heard in this universe again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"soulful reggae","review":"The Jamaican Wilson Pickett? Hmm, not a bad comparison. If anything, that tells you that Ken Boothe was not your typical reggae singer. Actually, it's perhaps unfair to pigeonhole him, or all his material, as reggae simply because he comes from Jamaica. Ken Boothe possessed a very soulful vocal style and could do covers of popular pop songs with an interesting island twist. This 2-CD set contains a lot of songs, thus it may be more music than most newcomers may want to digest at once. But it's nonetheless a very good, very listenable compilation of material from one of reggae music's more neglected song sylists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Low-cost padded mailers","review":"I've used a lot of the Jiffy yellow paper padded mailer envelopes, so I decided to try these plastic ones as a lower cost alternative. They are cheaper than the paper ones, and have much better rip and moisture resistance. But I think the paper ones look slightly better and have a tiny bit more padding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price good but very little protection","review":"This was my first bubble mailer - offered very little protection for the contents. Very flat bubbles, compared to bubble mailers at Staples store. Probably fine if contents cannot be crushed or damaged, such as a rigid box or VHS tape. I'll be trying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant close the Cover.","review":"You cant close the item, because gum is not great to close.I have lost 5 to 6 packages due to gum problem, some packages opened while delivery.Label also wont stick to cover, if you past the label, it will come out.You need to put the separate tape to close the cover, that is extra work.Regards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected.","review":"These work perfectly for DVDs, VHS, books, etc. They fit everything I expected them to and even some of the larger things I wasn't sure would fit. Recommended buy from valuemailers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"Product is of very poor quality. The mailers are very thin, and there is very little cushioning.I would not have bought these if I had seem them in person first, and I will not be buying them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small, too flat. More like #00","review":"Like a couple of other people have mentioned, these are too small to be called #0. We sell DVDs and have purchased tens of thousands of bubble mailers from various manufacturers. A DVD will barely fit in these. When we ship a DVD, we include literature with a rubber band around it. It's like torture getting these in there.And again like another reviewer said, the bubbles are very flat and there just isn't that much protection.The adhesive is another problem. It is not evenly distributed and there are often streaks or even blank areas which has required us to use tape to make sure they stay shut.To sum it up, they're pretty much useless. Better to spend a little more and get a quality mailer that is the correct size, cushioning and adhesive quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just be careful who you order from","review":"Some of the sellers, like Royal, offer a wider version of the #0 which is a perfect fit for DVDs, but some of the others have only the standard #0 which is useless for DVDs and a hassle for blu-rays. I learned this the hard way. For the other sellers, you need a #1 if you want to ship DVDs.Otherwise, they're light weight and offer ample protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the first time","review":"This isn't the first time I have purchased from 007 Design which is propackagingsupply they constantly change their retail name and logos on amazon like they send the fake produts6 months ago I bought this same product from them and rather than a 6x10 it was a 6x9 with a usable space of 6x8.5 the item should be way more in sizing and I can see the huge different from a 6x10 as I use them daily. I contacted 007 design they never responded had to go through a load of headache to get the items out and bought from them again because I didn't know they changed their retail name again!

Measurements are wrong!","review":"These bubble mailers are listed as #0, which is always a standard size of 6 X 10. When they arrived they were not the normal size #0 at all and they were much too small compared to all of the other size #0 mailers I have gotten from all other companies in the past. The true measurements of this seller's \\"size #0\\" is only 5.5 X 9 on the inside. If you need the full 6 X 10 space then these will not work as they are supposed to.

In my profession, I am constantly required to set anchors in concrete. My rotary hammer makes the job easier than it would be with a regular hammer drill. It drills holes much faster than my old hammer drill used to do. And with less noise and vibration.I bought mine here at Amazon. It came with SDS bits and a grinder. I highly recommend this tool to anyone who drills lots of holes in concrete."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best","review":"If you are now using a pistol grip hammer drill, or thinking of buying one, STOP NOW. Drilling in stone or concrete with this drill is like a hot knife through butter. Plus it's really light in weight. Way faster than any pistol grip drill I have used (including DeWalt, Makita and Bosch.) This is what you want for Tapcons and anchor bolts. Also great for chipping and chiseling - there are many styles of SDS chisels available, and the tool's light weight makes it easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rotary Hammer for the Price!","review":"It works like a champ! I don't plan on continous, heavy use but the rotary hammer works much better than I expected. I've drilled several 1/2\\" anchor holes into a concrete slab and so far it's worked flawlessly. The free side grinder (Amazon.com) was a nice bonus too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitbull","review":"If you are looking for a rotary hammer, this is the one to buy.

When it arrived, I wanted to keep it for myself. For some reason, when I was looking at it on-line, I thought it was going to be bulky. So I was surprised at how sleek it was when it arrived. Since I didn't drink out of the mug, I asked the person I gave it to for his thoughts: pros are it's very sturdy and holds holds heat well - cons are (and this is where I think he's wrong) it's over-designed - makes you feel like you're drinking coffee out of a piece of sculpture. Bottom line, this is a really interesting looking mug, the colors pop, and there's nothing wrong with drinking out of sculpture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for arthritic hands","review":"Graced with a large, wide handle, this mug is easy to pick up with stiff, arthritic fingers.

Otherwise, this is a fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time Favorite","review":"I turn to this book time and again and am always astounded at the paintings. In his watercolor work, Sargent was a \\"Painter's Painter\\" - an artist who worked with paint so playfully, with color so passionatly, with caligraphic brushwork so seemingly irreverent - that the final effect is breathtaking and as fresh as the moment it was painted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and informative","review":"I agree that some reproductions are rather small but it is a beautiful and interesting book that makes a great Xmas present. I enjoyed following Sargent through his far away destinations !! I personally think he is underrated when compared to Winslow Homer !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I was looking for a Sargent book exclusively dedicated to his watercolours. I think the Carl Little book is the best one. The book is very manageable (I prefer the paperback as I use it a lot around the house as well as for reference). The size makes it also very usable, rather than having the large, heavy, coffee table editions which I find difficult to hold. The content is spot on for me; I'm after the images with a little written background to Sargent's life; this is very well presented in Little's book. The quality of the spine lacks a bit, but then again, I make sure I get out as much juice out of this book as possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Home sweet home","review":"I purchased this bat house because I was about to evict a good number of bats from my attic. The fact that it was approved by the Organization for Bat Conservation was enough for me, and it's worked out well. I installed the bat house during the winter near where the bats were entering my attic. I then put up wire mesh to keep the bats out. When summer arrived, most of the bats moved into their new home. A few somehow found a way into the attic... oh well... it's much easier to clean up after a handful of bats rather than the 30 or so that used to live there.I've had this bat house for almost 3 years now, and it's held up well. The bats keep coming back so I guess they are happy with it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"We have bats!","review":"We are fond of bats, but not bats in our attic. We decided to relocate the bats and chose this one because it's design is approved by the OBC. Late at night, when we assumed the bats were out foraging, we put up the bat house and blocked the hole they used to enter the attic. Since we put the house near the blocked hole, we assumed they would simply move into the bat house by morning. Not until almost a year later did bats start showing up in the bat house. From what I've read, it can take as long as two years for bats to move in, so be patient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbra","review":"This is my childhood favorite holiday CD.

From the fun, whirling dervish opening of Jingle Bells to the grandiose closing of The Lord's Prayer every selection leads into the next sensibly making the album a cohesive whole and allowing it to become the classic it is by being consistently involving. While I love the whole record I've always been partial to the quieter selections, in particular \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" and the delicate simplicity with which they are presented.

First, I was disappointed in the flow rate. Second, the primer does not easily start up the filter.

This picture does not justify this car seat at all. The checked fabric looks like cotton to me and seems not hot for summer days, it is combination of brown/black color. The sides are black fabric and cushioned enough. I like most is the lock, it cannot easily unlock by a baby because it needs a little force to unlock it. I paid almost 30% lower than Amazon, got it from a wholesale store:) Overall, I'm satisfied with my buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"It is simply one of the best books on the market on Wing Chun style Kung Fu.You cannot go wrong purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning ving chun...","review":"I find this book insightful & also helpful.

This product, like many others on the market, is merely a laundry list of techniques/forms. If you know nothing at all, and I mean NOTHING, then it might do you some good, but probably more confusion. The photos are in black and white with dark gray background making them camouflaging into the background. If you are a beginner, it might be of no use. However, if you are a serious WC practitioner, then don't even waste your money. These volumes are huge, but they are mostly empty. I bought these books for reference, but it is not the standard I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Photos","review":"Being a student for 13 yrs, it was good to find a book that covered so many topics of wing chun and his approach to it all. While I may not agree with a lot the author had to write, too much outdated info, he stayed faithful to the minimal of the art...namely a good description of the forms. The photos and explanations may help someone who forgot how to do the forms. Otherwise not much else if you never practiced wing chun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldnt waste the money.","review":"When I received this book as a gift I had been a student of the art for a few years and even at that point the book was nothing great. Any martial artist knows that it is next to impossible to learn an art from reading a book, that being said Wing Chun has so much that can't be learned from watching someone else do it even in person. Save the money from the book and take lessons from a Sifu, you will learn much more.If you are a student of the art and you are looking for a book about the history of the art there are much better choices available. If you want a book about theory there are still better choices available.

For this model Saab, the factory crossover only sends bass to the doors. The Infinities handled most bass guitar ok but any kind of bass drum caused them to distort and pop. I removed them and re-installed the factory Pioneer speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with Infinity","review":"My OEM front speakers in my 2004 Colorado were blown (one anyway). I priced the OEM speakers at about $40 / set. For $10 more I was able to get these Infinitys. These seem to have a deeper base than the OEMs as well as improved treble. I have to say also that I can get more volume from these than I did the OEMs. Mounting was a bit difficult. Took about 1-1/2 hours to change them over. Down side was wiring. Would have been nice if they offered a wiring adapter kit to hook to the existing wiring. The speakers came with a mounting adapter kit that was cumbersome to install. I scrapped the whole kit and screwed them right to the opening in the door. I am pleased with the sound for the price. Enough so that I am thinking about replacing the rear seat speakers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for the price","review":"Plenty of mounting options. These sound crisp and clean. Good response on the mids. The his are clear. The innovative +3db button and directional tweeter are very useful for getting the right amount of hi where you want it. I don't get much bass from these (even considering they are 6.5\\"), but what bass response I do get is pretty tight. Others reviewers report decent bass, so it may be that I'm not pushing only 22 RMS each @ 4 ohms. Doesn't bother me though, as I've got a subwoofer for all my bass needs. I've already recommended them to a couple friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hefty and well finished....","review":"Not that it matters, but MIU France was founded in Hong Kong in 1978 and moved to mainland China 18 years later.

The description actually said MIU France. Since I never did find any of the spoons that were made in the U.S.A., (but for some really expensive pewter ones) I ordered these. When they arrived, I was unhappy to see that they were, in fact, Made in China. They did look sturdy, but we are trying to support, first, the U.S. manufacturing sector, second, another country's that is not covering the earth with slave-wage-made goods and destroying the environment.So, I returned the spoons and cups for that reason.Oh, and the stainless measuring cups (which did appear to be heavy-duty) that I'd ordered from the same company at the same time, were returned for the same reason.Bottom line: If you care about such things, MIU France is a misleading designation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The spoons and cups are well made and well marked a lot of the products out there are stamped with ink and will wear off with teh wear and tear of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great we bought a second set","review":"Strong, accurate, reliable, classy.

You will not regret buying them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice spoons","review":"These spoons have held up well. However, the ring started to get some rust spots (I do put these in the dishwasher), so I took it off.

You just have to remember to turn the unit off when you leave your car so the charge does not run down.Most people I have talked to on it report that it works reasonably well with only slight degredation in clarity.

This is the perfect addition for anyone that currently lives in a city that has passed a law where you can not be on the phone while driving.

If you own a Motorola Razr (I have the Razr v3m), the charger that charges the phone can be used as a wall unit for the T305. (It works!)

I could hear who I was talking to and they could here me. The device recognized the voice tags for my phone numbers about 90% of the time.Cons: After about a month of use, the device would no longer turn on, even after being charged overnight. It would not turn on even when attached to a power source, even though the blue indicator light was lit to show it was fully charged. This appeared to be a useful item for hands-free use without wearing an ear piece, but it is a poorly made product.Other Thoughts: About a week before the item died, I had a horrible time using it. Whenever it or the phone was turned on, the speaker would just keep beeping, and I could not stop it. After I deleted the bluetooth connection on my phone, and re-established it, it worked again for a day or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"This item is great and easy to use.

You can use the same USB power cord as for your phone (if its a MOTO RAZR model NOT the new V9). I take this for short trips in town.

Since California mandates hands-free phoning, I needed one (I don't care for the earpiece units), although I don't use it often. Well, it worked OK the first few times I used it, although the sound quality was minimal. Lately it has stopped functioning as it should -- when you push the \\"call\\" button, it shuts the unit off! Motorola has been of no help whatsoever. My recommendation: spend a little more and get a better unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for use in moving vehicle","review":"I was not really impressed with this product. It seemed too sensitive to background noise and voice quality was not that great. Also, when you are out of range of cell service the unit beeps continually which was very annoying driving down the road. This was intended to replace a hard wired hands free system in my vehicle but just didn't cut it. I suppose in a very quiet environment it would be acceptable. I was probably expecting too much for what it cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last very long","review":"I got one of these and it worked for a while. I, too, came to swear at that blinking blue light, it's really intolerable at night. But then I went on a trip and parked my car at the airport for a hot summer week, and the device never worked again. I'm now on the market for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"You asked for it","review":"Low price low quality. I placed this in my wifes car and everytime I call her she still has to use her phone even though you top the car and the unit suyncs wit hthe phone. ANother total waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I received the Motorola T305 after reading the positive reviews on it. I started using it and it seemed to work well and then people kept telling me they couldn't hear me. I adjusted the volume and that seemed to help and then they said it all sounded garbled. I even called my house to leave a message to hear what it sounded like. I connected my phone to my gps and that worked fine so I knew it was the bluetooth that wasn't working. I was very disappointed because I thought it would work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal sound quality","review":"The sound quality was awful. I used it for a few days and verified that signal strength on my phone was not the issue. The sound had a lot of static and \\"scratchiness\\" both on my end (hearing) and the folks I was talking to."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, little static","review":"this does what it say and is very good overall. i do get a bit of static sometimes. this is a great hands free device and makes talking in the car so much better that something in your ear that you eventually lose!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mjm1652","review":"I bought one of these for my son several months ago. I liked it so much I bought 4 more for the rest of my family. In the car, they are much better than the earpiece blue tooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"good size, fast pairing but low volume","review":"I bought this device 2 days ago and the first 2 hours it performed nicely. Cell phone to cell phone calls were fine, synchronization was excellent with my Motorola black razor and it even allowed me to use the voice names I had recorded in the cellphone to make calls with voice recognition, just by pressing the big blue button in the speaker phone.The problems began later, when suddenly the volume started getting very low in some calls. Since this device is for car use, the speaker should be bigger. This defeats the whole purpose of a \\"speaker phone\\" because yes, sometimes the audio is loud, but I've had phone calls with my wife from her office and I have to pick up the device and put it in my ear in order to listen.I will return my device tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR DRIVING!!!!!","review":"This product was useless when trying to use it as a hands free devise for driving. It transmits what comes through the speaker into the mic therefore giving the person your speaking to an echo. Works great for the user but will drive everyone you talk to crazy. Spoke with Motorola customer service and they could not remedy the problem. Returned the product for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly irritating","review":"OK functionality but unless you can drive with a blinking blue light in your face at night do not buy this product. Did anyone at Motorola try this in their own cars at night?"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than sticking something in your ear","review":"The speakerphone connects to my V3m seamlessly. The speakerphone has several volume settings, but in all honesty, it's really just two: really loud or not loud enough. The blue light that illuminates when it's on is pretty bright at night, but it was advantageous when I had to drive for three hours in the middle of the night in Alberta (Canada) and it seriously kept me awake.This is actually my second T305. My first one is now under the possession of whoever received my rental car at the airport in Philadelphia.Anyway, for what it costs, it does the job. It's also better than being trendy and sticking something in your ear. The only thing I'm going to stick in my ear is a q-tip, earbuds, or a wet willie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds good for the person using it, not for the person on the other end","review":"I got this for my wife for Christmas... I've been in the car with her when she's used it, and it sounds great if you're the one using it.... but then I've been on the other end as well... as the person she's talking TO while she's using it,.. and it's horrible. It picks up all kinds of ambient noise, which it seems to pick up better than the voice....definitely NOT impressive. I think I paid around forty bucks for it here on Amazon... which is about double what I should have paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Device","review":"I received the T305 on 11/26/09, charged it overnight, and it has been in use ever since. My callers say the transmission is clear and I have no trouble using the device. Volume buttons could be larger or raised more. I got a home phone with blue tooth and am using the T305 around the house rather than carry the phone. Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item Great Price","review":"Bought this item for my husband who is a true skeptic of these types of items. It works great and he is extremely happy with it. He feels very comfortable calling and receiving calls in the car now with this Motorola T305Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"I just received the T305 and the set-up and pairing went without a hitch. I was able to charge the T305 with my cell phone's wall charger (also a Motorola) so, while the product only comes with a car charger, this was not a problem. People I called said that they could hear me fine. The unit is small and fits well on the visor. It replaces a 3 year old Jabra unit that was continuously failing on me. For the price, you can't beat this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluetooth Hands Free Speaker","review":"First time bluetooth user. Used to wear a plug in my ear with a cord connected to my phone. This is much nicer. Bought it for hands free communication while driving. It is really nice. Set up was a breeze. It easily connected with my phone as per the instructions. The voice dial feature has become a favorite. Once connected it is clear both ways. Even those in the back seat can speak up and talk to Grandma. She can hear them clearly then say \\"Hi...\\" back to them. The finer points of operation take a little getting used to, but nothing the gadget oriented can't adapt to easily. It was a good choice for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Unit - Bad Feedback with Cingular 8125","review":"Pros: Form factor, ease of use, sound from speaker.Cons: Feedback to my listeners was horrid, my test callers all disconnected with the comment, 'fix your phone!!!!'.Resolution: Got a Blue Ant Supertooth Lite, fixed the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"good in the car, at home, even in the pocket","review":"this little bluetooth speakerphone is a good choice to amplify the conversation at home, even in the party, and carry it in the pocketthe plus is USB charging, that I can use any USB power supply to chargethe only minus is, I can't put it too close, or the sound is cut offother than that, I am mostly happy with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compatibility problems with my LG phone","review":"I received this device as a gift. It works OK & has reasonably good sound when it's on & communicating with my LG VX5400 phone, but making the connection is a problem. I find that every time I use it, I have to remove it from my phone's list of Bluetooth devices & go through the whole process of pairing it with the phone all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Product - a few annoying design flaws","review":"This product is reasonably priced and OK. A few design flaws really make it less than functional:First, the power button is impossible to find and use, you need to use your fingernail or a pen to push it in and can't find it when you are driving - which is needed because . . . if you lose signal, which happens very frequently where I live, the unit beeps every 2 seconds with a load and annoying beep and has to be turned off. You just wish the designers would actually try using these products and they might realize the deficiencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Really not a bad piece of equipment. Does the job adequately. You do have to disconnect when you leave the car, otherwise the signal is pretty strong and will ring in the car. So if you go in the house, you should disconnect it. Turning it on and off is not difficult. You do have to press and hold the button for a few seconds before it goes on or off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Fall Out of Your Ear","review":"I never met a headset that would work for me. After doing a lot of research (and looking at the Motorola website) I thought I'd give this gizmo a whirl. It is a dream! When I'm not driving around, it's charging up with the included car charger (but it will also work with my cell phone wall charger, too, so as I write this it is charging in the house.) When driving, I clip the receiver to the visor. When a call comes in, the slightest touch on the front button and, shazam, I am connected and taking the call. A week ago I was driving my twin toddler grandchildren home and their mother called; they were able to hear her on the phone and it delighted them. Earbuds don't do it for me; the several Bluetooth headsets I tried didn't do it, but this really does. I recommend it absolutely."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"This is the best bluetooth I have ever used inside my truck!!!Because its a speakerphone makes all the difference. I tried going to ATT to get a bluetooth, i even spent all the money getting the best they had, the Jawbone and then the Motorola H12 Pure. Both of them worked great, except for in my truck, which is really the only place I NEED bluetooth. I had to find something that worked in my truck, because in California it is now the law, so this worked out great.The only bad thing I can think of is IF there are other people in my truck, then they would be able to hear both sides of the conversation. Now that is never the case in my line of work, but it might be something to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves something to be desired","review":"I purchased 3 of these, one for each of my family's cars when the hands free law came into effect in California. Even with the volume and sensitivity turned all the way up on this thing, the person you are speaking with has a very difficult time hearing you. I believe this is due to all the background noise from the car that it also picks up. I got so fed up with this product the other day that I went out and bought an earpiece bluetooth instead. It also constantly needs to be charged.I would recomment that if you are to spend money on a bluetooth device, to instead by an earpiece bluetooth headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well with Palm Treo 680","review":"I do a lot of freeway driving and I've tried 2 of these speaker phones with myTreo and the noise cancellation feature is poor. It works fine below 45 mph but the faster I go the more my callers complain about the road noise. Also you have to turn off Bluetooth on the phone when you turn off the speaker phone. The phone thinks it's still connected to the speaker phone,it will show that it's not connected to any Bluetooth devise but keeps the phone mic and speaker on mute until Bluetooth is turned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Device","review":"I was looking forward to get my new gadget in order to start using it on my brand new Car, but what a surprise, the device says on the back \\" sample copy \\" and when I tried to charge it, the USB plug in the device is fake you can't plug a charger on it. I pushed the charger tip on it but never fitted and the USB end on the device went inside it. I was frustrated to have received such a fake device, was it too much for 25 dlls??? why the seller doesn't specify this is just a toy, don't try to use it?dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I was very excited to move from an earpiece to a speaker. After a couple of weeks, the voice activated calling stopped working (wasn't the phone because I tested with my old earpiece and it worked fine). After a couple of months it stopped working completely! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM","review":"This is the worst product I have ever used. The person on the other end of the line cannot hear you so don't bother yelling. The audio commands will not be recognized, so don't even try. If you want an annoying blue flashing light on your visor, get this item, all others stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"This review is simple; This hands free speaker works as advertised, paired instantly with my RAZR, and sound quality is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluetooth Hands Free","review":"It came with only a charger to fit into the car recepticle and it takes two hours to charge it. I expected to be able to charge it at home using an electrical outlet. Also, the instructions appear to be for users with Motorolla phones although the production description said it worked with all Bluetooth phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hands-free","review":"I just love this bluetooth. I like that I don't have to stick it in my ear. The light is fine during the day (unless you have sunglasses on). I forget to turn off frequently, but that's just the way I am with every bluetooth I've owned. So, you just need to get in the habit of remembering to turn it off when you get out of the car.The power button is not too small. It's right on the front and it presses in pretty easily with normal finger pressure. I've never had any problems with that. The blue light is a little annoying at night, but once you get used to it it's okay (I never forget to turn it off at night!).Hubbie says I don't talk loud enough when I use it, but he's the only person to say that. So, I just try to talk louder than my normal voice. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy sound","review":"This is an all right devise but if it is too far away you can't here the person very well. I'm sure there are better devices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant complaints about the bad sound","review":"Subject just about says it all. I constantly get ribbed by my friends whenever I use this device. Descriptives abound: \\"tin can\\",\\"shoe phone\\", \\"It sounds like you are in a barrel\\", \\"why don't you spend some money on a real bluetooth.\\"? Can't complain about he battery life, but I would never recommmend this thing unless you enjoy torturing whoever calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"extra fail-safe buttons","review":"I hold my purchase until Motorola makeat least 3 extra buttonsfor 3 designated phone numberson the next model,So people with not so goodvoice dialling-phones can use itas a fail-safe option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lousy","review":"I don't understand all the positive reviews for this product. Let me list its deficiencies:* The light is too bright at night and too dim during the day.* The power button is almost impossible to press.* It rattles when I drive.* I have to shout for it to understand my voice commands.* The other person can't hear me when I turn my head.I was wondering what I was missing with my old Plantronics headset. But the T305 makes the headset seem pretty darned good. I guess that's something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the $$","review":"For the cost and ease of use, well worth the price. Slight delay connecting when answering a call, but other than that the quality is pretty good. Much safer than holding the handset to your ear, and if you have voice dialing on your cellphone, making a call is hands-free as well. Battery life is excellent. Just bought one for my sister. My wife and I have had ours for over a year. We use them all the time and both still work fine.Update 11/13/10: Almost another year has gone by and these are still working perfectly. Battery life is still excellent. It automatically shuts off 30 minutes after it loses connection to your phone. You will only need to make sure to power down the device if you leave your phone in the car, or your car is parked close enough where it can stay connected.Update 04/02/12 - All 3 still working fine. Safe to say I got my money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great better than expected","review":"Bought this to use in my truck instead of having my plantronics ear piece stuck in my ear all the time. The on/off button is not that hard to press as stated by some reviews, in my opinion anyway, if you use the point of your finger not the flat fingerprint area part. The audio is great and people on the other end think I am talking on a landline. It sits on my visor about 18 inches from my head. The only time is gets a little hard to use is if you roll all your windows down and have windnoise in the truck which makes it hard to hear no matter what you are using. For the price, it cannot be beat. My phone is a Motorola Razor and uses the same AC charger, so I leave the 12v charger it comes with in the truck and sometimes charge it in the house with the Razor charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola T305 Bluetooth Hands-Free Speaker","review":"Works great!Battery life if very good also. I use in my work truck mostly and the people I talk to can hear me fine. This is a dump truck in summer and a snow plow in winter. It is a loud truck even with the windows up. They can hear the truck but they can hear and understand me fine. In car it is even better a nowhere near as loud inside(as the truck)seems to work better than my moto t700 headset. It is about the size of a genie garage door opener. If anything changes I will update but so far great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound Quality","review":"People on the other end of my calls say I sound like I'm speaking through a tube.

Of course it's not perfect, but what do you expect for the price. It's small and inconspicuous and contrary to what some people have written, the blue light does not bother me. If you are looking straight ahead while driving like you should be, the light is not intrusive.I would recommend this to anyone without Bluetooth. The only negative ( and the reason for 4 stars) , is that it must be charged in your car. It would be nice if there was an a/c adapter for house current. Otherwise, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands-Free Speaker","review":"Was very easy to pair with my phone. Very good reception usually. Every once in a while a little feedback. The voice dialing needs some help - easily confused and calls the wrong number. All in all a much better solution than holding the phone while driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a pretty expensive paper weight","review":"The audio is great and the voice dialing works. But people can bearly hear me, unless I take it off the visor and hold it close to my mouth. So in short, it's pretty useless unless somebody can tell me how to boost the microphone. I'll have to look at trying blue ant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good for a couple months","review":"I bought the Motorola T305 as a blue tooth for my wife's car.

I charged the item for two nights, then started to use it. For first few minutes, I can talk and hear, after about 5 minutes, I heard a big \\"alarm noise\\" and it continues (by this point, I can't hear and talk). So I closed the speaker and reused it after 2 days. It behavior the same, sometimes it works (the sound quality is very bad), sometimes it does not work (also it is dangours, I tried to hear the sound and it impact my driving). Also the power on/power off button is very small, you have to press the power button tightly and hold for a while, then you can turn on/turn off it, very inconvinence. I end with return the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for me, but not for the other party on the line....","review":"I purchased this speaker for my car because I have a slight hearing loss and my girlfriend had one that she used one day when I was present - the speaker was loud and clear.So I quickly ordered one -- well, guess what? It was true -- when I was using it the person I was speaking with came through loud and crystal clear. However, every single person I spoke to either complained of an echo, a rattling noise or \\"a sound like marbles rolling around.\\" I think it was picking up vibration from my visor because when I took it off and held in it the palm of my hand they said it was markedly improved.But then ... that kind of defeats the purpose of the speaker in the first place, now doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsatisfied","review":"This product has not worked for me as no one can hear me well at all. Everyone who I speak with on it, without exception, has said it I sound faint and garbled like I am under water. It is fully charged and clipped to my visor, I have even held the device in my hand. I drive a 96 Ford Ranger pickup for your reference as to how far the visor might be from me. I have since purchased a Jabra speaker and it works wonderfully, and I have not had one complaint. I don't recommend this unit at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It keeps turning off!","review":"The ease of use and sound quality deserve 4.5 - 5.0 stars, but neither of those issues matter when the speaker just turns itself off after about 2 minutes of talk time. At first I thought it needed to be charged, but that did not help. I have tried repositioning it and my phone, but those techniques were useless. It is really frustrating to get cut off mid sentence repeatedly AND I spend the first 30 seconds of each conversation explaining to the person on the other end that we will be cut off shortly. It really is too bad...I detest the earpieces and am going to have to switch over to one if I want to speak longer than a couple of minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much noise to have a decent conversation on the road..","review":"May be I got a bad piece. THe first piece I got stopped working (microphone went dead) so I called up Motorola, and sent it back for service. They serviced and sent one (don't know if it a new one or old one repaired). Now, there is just too much of a disturbance in sound quality and very low voice for people on the other end that I get really frustrated using this. I threw this away and went to a series of other headsets and finally went to a wired Shure ic2-m headphones that works out much better.This is not a good product; looks like if it works for you, you are just lucky..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a tunnel","review":"I've paired this with Motorola Krazr, Razr, Blackberry and Treo.

After 3 days of using this on her 2 hour round trip commute and getting constant complaints about the quality of the conversations she is back using a $29 earpiece device. We tried many different positions for the device in her car (new, quite Acura) with both of us being the talker and driver and the only even remotely acceptable voice quality was when we held it about 4-6 inches directly in front of our mouth.

My call on the phone would still be active, but I would be unable to hear anything on the speakerphone, nor could the person on the other end hear me. I would have to end the call and re-dial. And again be able to speak for only 5 minutes. I tried this with 2 different cell phones and had the same problem. So, I returned the product and asked for an exchange.

I tried to place this speaker on my car visor and use it while I was driving, but it defeated the whole purpose. I had to hold the speaker in my hand to talk into it. The person on the other end could not hear me unless I hold the speaker and talk right into it. Also the listener complained because they hear all kinds of background noise like I was in the train or something. Only good thing about this speaker is that I could hear the caller really well but that's about it.

They are totally unreliable and the sound is awful. Everyone told me I also sounded like I was under water so I decided to try this blue tooth and I have to say that I am very impressed with this one. People can actually hear and understand me. The sound is clear. Good battery life. It certainly makes me feel better being able to drive and talk at the same time handsfree.

I tossed it in my glove compartment after 2 days and haven't used it since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome purchase","review":"I am very pleased with my purchase of this device. I live in Michigan and new cell phone laws have been enacted. In fact, the city of Troy Michigan will give you a traffic ticket if you do not have 2 hands on the wheel while driving. The device works so well that a front seat passenger can have a conversation with whomever I am speaking with. This is really cool because me and my mom often talks to my siblings together while driving. I highly recommned this product. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because my battery life decreases faster when using it.

The product does work. I have it on my visior in the car. In my job I am constantly in and out of the car so the ear model blue tooth would get lost. The sound is reasonable, not great, but it works. The unit held its charge for a reasonable amount of time. It was easy to set up and use. I am not overly excited about the product and being a Motorola product I expected more, but bottom line it works, the price was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoy it","review":"I liked this so much I bought another one for my wife. I think it is clear and connects very easily to my iphone.I really was surprised with the battery life. I must not use it as much as others. Sometime you have to turn up the volume but that may be because of the wonderful ATT network."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moto T305 Speakerphone","review":"I paired this speakerphone with a late model Moto Razr. It works fine. Sound quality is good with enough volume that I keep it on less than its maximum setting. All callers have said I sound good with no intelligibility issues. This unit charges with the same mini USB plug that my Razr uses. In essence, I now have an extra car charger. The on/off button is a little tough to see because it's small, but once you know where it is, you can turn the unit on or off by feel. It audibly indicates when it turns on or off. I can see the blue indicator light in the day without problem. At night it is a bit too bright, but you get used to it. After a few days, I didn't notice it any more. If it bothers you, a small piece of black tape with a small hole punched in it would work to subdue the light. My wife liked it enough that she now has one too. Much superior to an earbud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Device","review":"The T305 works great. It syncs well, the speaker is clear, and folks on the other side don't complain about you being in a \\"tunnel\\". I bought this one for my wife and will probably buy one for myself now. If you don't like the earpiece bluetooth hanging in your ear this is the device for you. There are many that cost more, but why buy them when this works so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Perfect","review":"So easy to set up. I did it in 30 seconds with my Blackberry. GOOD NEWS: the Blackberry charger works with the T305 so if you have a BB you can charge it with that at the office during the day. The sound is great. The ONLY issue is the flashing blue light - what idiot came up with that? I used black tape to mostly cover the light. I don't understand the reviews of bad sound because mine sounds great. But for the flashing blue light, it would be a 5-star for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality for the price","review":"I got this for my daughter to use in her car.

I am extremely happy with the product based upon the price I paid!I can clearly hear to whomever I am speaking to, although I have been told that I sporadically cut out on the other end.The speaker is small & clips onto my visor without taking up alot of space.Overall good product for the money paid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unit","review":"I just received my unit from Amazon and it works great. The volume is very good and the sound quality on the other end is perfect even while driving at 45 mph, and my car has quite a bit of road noise from the touring suspension and Z rated tires. I use an iPhone with this unit so even when I am outside of the car and receive a call, my phone rings and I have the option to take the call on my phone. The blue light is a little distracting so I placed black tape over the light. To check if the unit is on during the day time I just press the call button and if it beeps the unit is still on. For the price it beats any over the ear unit. I just ordered another unit for my other car so don't have to move one between cars. As for a wall charger, it uses the same charger as my wife's Moto Raza V3 phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but volume control needs tweaking.","review":"I purchased this to enable me to chat hands free while in the car. Unfortunately, the volume isn't loud enough for me to hear the other person if I'm going over 50 mph. My car is a Honda Accord and isn't that so loud that this should be a problem.

I was optimistic about the T305. The pairing was easy with my blackberry curve, I understand how to turn it off when I leave my car so it won't answer when I don't want it too. The sound quality on my end is fine but I have endless complaints by the folks on the other end that it sounds like I'm in a trash can, they can't understand me, there is too much background noise. I have gone back to using the speakerphone on my phone which is not optimal either. I am going to try the Blackberry VM 605, the reviews seem to be quite favorable but then the ones for the 305 were also. I need to have good enough sound quality to respectably run my business. All of the choices are very confusing and I will be very glad if I can find something that works and sounds more professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough","review":"Nice product, simple to use.

Shirley's experience is almost unimagineable. Her father began molesting her at age three, and began having intercourse with her at age nine. He took nude photos of her to share with other pedophiles.But there's more. It seems that, in a twisted and perverse way, Shirley loved her father, and was her mother's rival for his affections.

The answer is \\"yes\\".","review":"As a long-time fan of both Alfie Bester and Roger Zelazny, I was delighted to find this posthumous collaboration. \\"Pschoshop\\" is, I think, true to both authors' bodies of work. After all, Bester's influence on Zelazny is evident in a a number of works, most notably \\"Eye of Cat\\" with its dazzling experimental typography so reminiscent of what Bester had done in \\"The Demolished Man\\" and \\"The Stars My Destination\\". What parts belong to which writer? I really would not care to guess. Their styles blend too well for that to be clear. \\"Psychoshop\\" is not the equal of the finest works of either Bester or Zelazny -- a level that few other writers can match -- but it is amusing and bright and energetic and engaging and makes a satisfactory last gift from these two wonderfully creative authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's an explenation...","review":"The book deserves ofcourse 5 stars ,but since each of the giants wrote better on his own - let there be four.It's almost blesphemy ,but I think the book would have come out better if Bester would be alive to finish it on his own. Not that the late Zelazny ruined it or something ,it's just that opposite to a few other reviewers ,I could tell when Bester stops and Zelazny takes over. It's not a bad change ,bad there's a change. of pace .of style. of plot direction.As it came out at last ,it's a wonderfully written ,humoristic (not really FUNNY but light-hearted) ,with that Bester quality of PKD chaos ,but not as gloomy ,and zelazny's action ,and a number of sub-plots converging at the last possible point. Overall one of the best half-light reads i've had.(half-light 'cause Bester's style is more heavy ,but not domminant).Very recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece of musical brilliance","review":"This is Simon & Garfunkel's second classic album (you can guess what's number one).

It's atrocious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their only album I can listen to in any mood...","review":"The cover alone would make one believe that this is merely a by-product of a by-gone era, but PSRT may be the boys' best album, before the overwrought sentimentality of their following releases (but remarkable on their own terms). This one opens with the hypnotic Scarburough Fair/Canticle, a song that was accused of being awash in pot smoke upon it's release. It's still the finest example of S & G's choirboy melodies, which worked best in this format. Elsewhere, when he's not trying to taunting Dylan, Simon first displays the burgeoning whimsy that was to come in songs like Cloudy and Feeling Groovy, 'For Emily' is probably their most aching song ever, and 'Silent Night/7:00 News' is a most effective experiment. This duo had too many good songs to quibble over best album, but this one is a real winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrically brilliant","review":"Lyrical MagnificencePaul Simon is one of the greatest lyricists of the last fifty years, in any musical genre. His words are sheer poetry and this art is exemplified on this magnificent album. Some people curiously dismiss Simon and Garfunkle as \\"passe\\" or \\"dated,\\" but they obviously haven't listened to this record.What's interesting is that the hit songs from this disc (Scarborough Fair, Feelin' Groovy and Homeward Bound) are not as good as some of the sleepers. Listen to the simple poetic beauty of \\"Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall\\" and \\"The Dangling Conversation.\\" Another incredibly catchy tune is \\"Cloudy,\\" which never got any airplay but which is classy as any song Simon ever wrote.Paul Simon is unmatched as a lyricist, nothing Dylan or Lennon and McCartney (not even \\"Eleanor Rigby\\") can compete with the poetic majesty of this man.

Fortunately, I did not pay full price because this is not really a book but better described as a 50 page pamphlet that should be distributed for free. The first 8 chapters are all 2-4 pages long and are not particularly informative.

So when I saw these, I knew they would work. When she got them, she loved them! They washed nice in the dishwasher, even though she told me to hand wash them (sorry mom). My sister also tried to steal them, since her plastic set had the numbers washed off.The best thing about this set is the 2/3 and 3/4 cups. That is what makes this set so valuable to our families. We are big bakers, and these two are crucial for us. Definately something I recommend for any serious kitchen baker."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kitchen tool that measures up!!","review":"This is a good quality set of measuring cups, good weight and feel, not flimsy at all. At first I thought the handles were a bit long-- until I had to scoop sugar out of a canister, or measure and pack brown sugar in a cup all in one move-- then the handle length made sense! I was unaccustomed to having 1/8 and 2/3 and 3/4 measures-- so I had to remember to use them-- rather than filling the 1/4 measure half full, or using the 1/3 measure twice, or using 1/4 three times to makes 3/4. I've washed them up by hand rather than in the dishwasher. Also, when the cups are all stacked up, the handles stick up a bit, which is only an issue if you have them in a shallow drawer. The solution is to use a small black binder clip to hold the handles all together. If you don't have a shallow drawer, or a tight space, this won't matter to you.

Someone almost ATE IT! Now we check for such an issue after each use.As a side note, we don't put this blade in the dish washer, we hand wash it.I guess $15/year is not bad maintain a $200 kitchen appliance that we use a lot.

Unfortunately, this is the case here.Not to say that this is a bad read. It isn't. Byrne is at the top of his game here, and it shows on every page. But modern comics have inevitably eclipsed this material (compare the Fantastic Four vs. Ego to the modernized version of The Authority vs. \\"God\\").

The metal is very strong and sturdy, and the handle supremely comfortable, and just the right length. Very easy to pick up soup- handle to cup angle is perfect.

None out of the end of the spout, but lots around the threads. After tightening it a bit more, I checked again. A bit less leakage, but still present. After applying monkey torque to the filler, it seemed to stop leaking, but it took lots more force to remove it. The strong spring to keep the filler shut is great except that it takes one hand to hold the lantern and one to pour. With a one gallon flimsy can it is difficult to safely do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and spills fuel all over","review":"Maybe it arrogance or just being lazy, I keep hopping that each time I use this thing it will live up to it reputation and not spill a drop. However, it never does. Leaks at every point that there is a crack, not a lot but a definite puddle of fuel. Then when you remove it (from the lantern or stove), splash more fuel comes out.

You really can't go wrong with any of his albums but his 1968 debut \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" is a masterpiece. It is one of my favorite albums of all time. Every song is great and there are no fillers. \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" is Cohen at his best lyrically, musically, and vocally. The album is overall mysterious, dark, brooding, delicate, beautiful and paints strange and amazing pictures in the mind. I have never read anything about how these songs related to Cohen's life but there is no need because Cohen makes it all so clear and you can see and feel it all happening while listening to the album. I could go on and on some more about how great this album is but I will simply say this is essential, no matter what you listen to, it's just great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gold standard then, a platinum standard now","review":"I listened to Leonard Cohen when I was in my teens and early twenties.

After sailing life's seas, I found them like a lot more wise and rich than I did earlier.

I do have the original Columbia issue and compared to this \\"remastered version\\" the original sounds like an audiophile cd. Not really but this is how bad this thing sounds. In looking at the credits it appears that the same person did the remastering on both. I am guessing that the import is nothing more than a digital dub from way back when.

South Korea's mountains provide a striking backdrop for the unexpected romance that unfolds.The story is told from the perspective of Jason Fitzgerald...an Army helicopter pilot stationed in 1978 Korea. I found that the male POV for the romance made the novel especially interesting to me, as did the personal growth that Jason experienced through his relationship.Jason and Young attempt to bring their cultures together and form a lasting relationship. Each day brings new challenges for the couple. The underlying theme of fate and sacrifice adds a satisfying depth to the novel. Told with intelligence and humor, Galen Kindley's novel will make the reader think about what it means to love. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEARTS OF THE MORNING CALM","review":"Hearts of the Morning Calm is one of the BEST books I have ever read. I lived in Korea from 1979 to 1981 and found Mr. Galen's description of Seoul, Yongsan and the surrounding area to be completely accurate. He was able to bring the characters to life. As I read the book, I felt that Young and Jason were examples of the difficulty the world has of understanding another culture. Young and Jason \\"got it\\" and enjoyed it.

The act of posting it listed me as the reviewer.This book is a must read. The depth of Mr. Kindley's style and descriptive intuition is classic; found only in those books written by the masters and treasured for reading over and over.Hearts Of The Morning Calm is a simple story of love between an American G.I. stationed in Korea, and a Korean girl. Both become caught up in circumstances of culture and familial and career responsibilities that appear to present insurmountable barriers to their emotional survival.In the hands of Galen Kindley, however, this simple story becomes much, much more. It will make you weep with joy, with sadness and with wonderment. It's a book that you will never regret having read; it will make you a better person for having experienced it.

Overall the book left me confused;Was it a cautionary tale of the pitfalls in Hollywood or a meditation on how Jews perceive themselves versus the idealized world of the WASP they're perpetuating in the media? Maybe both, or neither one. Ultimately the only thing I learned was that Hollywood is full of hateful, unhappy people."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like FUN, skip this one","review":"I decided that I had to SUFFER through the ENTIRE book before making an intelligent decision about the book itself. This book was DREADFUL and I embraced each moment as a ray of sunshine when I could put it down. Dori Carter uses too many CAPITALIZED words for my taste, in addition to words in italics that I just didn't understand. I thought this book was going to be fun, based on the title and the happy couple on the cover of the paperback edition. This is an EXAMPLE of a book that defines the clich��, you can't judge a book by its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK...","review":"While the biotechnology industry, industrial espionage and the human organ transplant field are perfect fodder for a thriller, I didn't feel this book lived up to it's possibilities.First off, the heroine gets hired as THE corporate lawyer by a huge biotech firm. She lies on her resume about her background and experience. And NO ONE bothers to check her background and references? Yeah right.If you can get past that, the book then becomes a pretty good(if somewhat by-the-formula)read.Until I got to the end and found the ending totally unsatisfying. Without giving it away, I still had alot of questions as to what happened to whom at the end. Ms. Christofferson did not tie up her lose ends. Hate that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"forth rate","review":"Jennifer Rockhill reason's didn't ring true to me.

Poor, boring writing and story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad","review":"I don't like using the word mediocre, but that is pretty much what the book is. An evil, powerful man is responsible for the death of the lead characters husband and child, and she sets out to frame him and get revenge. How she gets close to him is unrealistic, but this is fiction. There is also an ex-CIA agent working for a competitive company also attempting to get some info on the bad guy. They wind out working together to bring him down. But the plot falls short in action, and the demise of the bad guy is too abrupt and \\"distant\\", even though that was the actual point of all the predicaments the lead characters engaged in. The ending does stop short, leaving too much left undone, but don't write off this author yet. I think she has shown promise of better works to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable plot","review":"Yes, a plot that it's difficult to believe. While truth can be stranger than fiction, the many not-credible happenstances that this author would have us believe significantly detract from the book.On top of that, there's only one character who has more than one dimension to their personality. Everyone else, from the protagonist on down, is either all-good or all bad -- if you count the heroine's mixing in of revenge with justice as \\"good.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book that challanges widely held beliefs.","review":"Whittow makes the reader re-examine widely held beliefs on the structure and history of the Byzantine Empire.

As it is, the pads could serve simultaneously as tourniquets. And in spite the tight bands the pads tend to shift anyway. (I think this is because the pads are hard and non-conforming to the elbow).

The Don Juan paradigm, was formed by mostly non-native practitioners, receiving their training orally, in a way similar to the shamanic tradition, but with no connection. Don Juan is not shamanic or religious--he is mystical--having to do with knowing the way the physical universe is put together, and thereby gaining mastery over it, and finally able to leave it \\"shoes, hat, and all\\". Don Juan is not shamanic, mythic, or Native American, and states so many times.

Unlike this opportunistic piece of garbage that is destimed to fade into the twilight zone reserved for armchair critics. Fikes anthopology amounts to an observance of a group of people with pretence at impartiality. No way can any one understand the depths of a culture by studying it.

The Bob Dylan Biograph set is dull and dismal compared to the LP originals. No version of Dylan's great anthem 'Like A Rolling Stone' has sounded harder or crisper than the great version on the bootleg CD 'The Greatest Single Ever Made'.But now all is forgiven. 'Bob Dylan Live in 1966' is a spectacular improvement over every bootleg version that has gone before. I thought 'Guitars Kissing and the Contemporary Fix' brought us the best version possible of this great concert. But the Columbia engineers have brought a rawer, tougher sound to one of the rawest, toughest rock concerts ever put to disc.The only live rock concert disc that can compare to this is The Who's 'Live at Leeds'. Both are rock at its iconoclastic, anarchic best.

A note on Just Like a Woman:I'm not crazy about the Blonde on Blonde version, it's OK, but this version is heartfelt and captures the right mood for the lyrics and I love it.This historic concert is legendary and a must have for Dylan fans.

Spontaneous, exciting music by our greatest living American songwriter.

The CD is worth twice its price just to hear Dylan and most of what would later become The Band (minus Levon Helm)rip into \\"Like A Rollin' Stone\\", proving that that IS the greatest rock song ever written.

He has a way of letting the people know how to fight this battle. I am with the other person that said God has given him a gift. Thank you Frank for the life changing books you have written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing follow up to \\"Prophet\\"","review":"After having read the Darkness series (The premise of which Mr. Peretti attributes divine intervention) and Prophet, I found Oath left me a bit flat. A master storyteller, Mr. Pereti once again is able to draw his readers into the mind, spirit and emotions of his characters. The spiritual overtones seem to be a bit lacking in this work however. That, I believe, contributes to stunted character growth and an unsatisfying conclusion. Had Mr. Peretti strengthened the character's spiritual growth in an order of magnitude approaching Prophet, the book may have been more satisfying. Had he dropped the spiritual overtones, this may have been a nice monster story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner!","review":"Peretti did it again! Don't stop writing!

I like this book though accept the fact I think this book is way to long for the topic. There is talk about Cliff a guy that was killed while camping at the beginning the sheriff thinks it's a bear but there is talk that it something. At the beginning I thought that it was a bear but then I started to have mixed feelings about this thing that killed cliff I am beginning to think that it is something else. Also I think that the author should have explained a little more at the beginning bu then again I think he did a googd job because I want to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly one of the best books ever written","review":"Adventure.Intrigue.Horror.Action.Suspense.This book has it all.Frank Perretti has outdone himself again.I recommend this book to anyone who can read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Oath...hard to put down!","review":"I have to admit, I'm not much into Sci-Fi, which I think this book definately borders on - however, I believe deep thot and a lot of time went into this book.

The story centers around the main character investigating the killing of his brother by a bear, in a small rural town. The author builds some tension, but after reading it for fifty some odd pages, and nothing else happens, you lose interest, fast. I just couldn't get into it, but will try his other books(This Present Darkness, and Piercing the Darkness) hopefully they are better.Suggestion for Christians who like a book that moves; try Cain, by James Byron Huggins, same basic plot, but it moves a lot faster! Peretti should try reading this book to see how to write a Christian thriller.Another Good Christian (End Times) thriller is Blood Moon by Hal Lindsay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, this book is a total waste of time.","review":"Peretti should have spent his time working at a soup kitchen rather than writing this book. He attempts to coorilate the damage of sin in ones life to that of a powerful dragon. He fails. He gets too graphic in the \\"sin\\" a man and women commit with each other. He fails to make a clear conection between sin and the dragon. His other books are nothing like this one. If you liked This Present Darkness and Peircing the Darkness you should PASS on this one. On the other hand if all you like are satanic stories of the likes of Stephen King, you may enjoy this one.

I have never read any of Frank Peretti's books before, but after reading this one I want to go out and buy every book he's written! My review really doesn't do any justice to this book it was that great! I love the way he uses words anyone can understand, and the way he writes really grabs you, and makes you believe you are right there in the story along with the characters.

This book makes you take a double take on life and the part that sin plays in our life. I have read it a few times now and there is such a deeper meaning to it than some may think.

Frank Peretti is absolutely gifted with writing. The Gospel is presented in a minor fashion, but the book clearly emphasizes the penalty of sin. There is no escaping sin, and once it starts in your life it only grows and gets bigger and stronger, till it overwhelms you in the end, possibly destroying your life. That may sound like preaching to you, but this book clearly relays this message in a fashion that will even have a non-christian flipping the pages from beginning to end. It also tells you how to get out, but I don't want to spoil THE SUSPENSE, so read it yourself. If you you are the type of person that does not like to read in particular or thinks that christian science fiction is not going to be good... YOU REALLY NEED TO READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"I loved this new book by Frank Peretti. I would read by flashlight until 11:00 at night, and then sit in the dark, scared out of my mind. This book is thought provoking, but hard to believe that it was a \\"christian\\" book. If it would be made a movie, I'd hesitate to go see it. Although there were some gross parts of the book that the author of \\"Jurassic Park\\" would love, I think that all-in-all this was a great book, and I recommend it to any person over 16"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but would be better as a movie","review":"Peretti has written another gripping story, but it lacks the character depth that would make this an excellent novel. The writing is fast paced and works well as a good mystery/thriller, but the story would work better as a movie than a full novel. However, it is a great story and definitely worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"A potentially good story that is poorly written.","review":"This tale of good versus evil cloaked in the guise of a mysterious evil hidden deep in the secrets of an old mining town reads like a Hardy boys/Nancy Drew book. While the basis for the story is good and the story line fairly well developed, the simplistic conventions of writing, weak dialogue and sketchily drawn characters do little to entice the reader's inner eye. This would be a good read for a high school class in that the dissection of blatant symbolism, simple characters and story development would all be easily used to teach the basics of novel writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end drags on too long when the suspense is long gone.","review":"It took a long time for me to \\"get in the book\\" and I'm not sure that ever really happened. I kept waiting for a twist of some kind... which never came :(Peretti is an awesome author, but if you really want good christian reading, check out his \\"This present darkness/Piercing the darkness\\" novels instead.

This book is really great and you so read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising direction from Peretti","review":"Peretti has a knack about being unpredictable in this book. Just as you think you know what is happening, you learn that you don't really understand. It's a lot like life. The life in this book is not the life you want to live but escape. That's what makes it intriguing and an opportunity to examine yourself while enjoying a thrilling story.Ray Ruppert, Author of \\"The Sovereign Reigns, or Does He?\\" \\"The Sovereign's Last Battle\\" and \\"Revelation: A Layperson's Reflections\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"totally engrossing","review":"Again FRANK PERETTI has captivated the battle of GOOD VS EVIL in a story that engrosses the reader. The easy to folllow story is entertianing, yet deep, as you follow the characters battle within themselves . He makes you beleive in the impossible. it was another cant- put - down, do - not - miss story that makes the reader think about sin, and the battle within ourselves as we struggle between what we want and what is right.

From the first page, we are pulled into the dark and mysterious world of Hyde River. Peretti keeps the action boiling and adds to the story by making it an allegory, which, when revealed, hits readers hard with the power of its message. While some might compain about the \\"R-rated\\" violence, it makes the allegorical message all the more potent. The only two faults I could find with the book were that some scenes got a little too sensual, and the ending seemed, to me, a bit of a cop-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing!","review":"I'm not much of a reader, but this book was awesome! It was full of suspense and made me realize the awesomeness of God's grace--the only way for the good guy to live and survive his encounter with the dragon--sin--was to accept Jesus! It's so true and will make you realize the power of God and spiritual battles that go on every day in your life!

That's also why I continued to read it. This book starts as it continues, scary, thrilling, completely beyond belief, and very very good. This book isn't a God vs. evil thriller in the same way as \\"Desperation\\" or \\"The Stand\\" is, but as a horror story it does quite well. Don't miss out on it because of the Christian subtext."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one dull moment!","review":"I really enjoyed this book and loved how Peretti describes sin. His style of writing is unique and his imagination is wild. This book brings into view the power of sin and proves how little control we actually have over it. We have our original first choice whether or not to obey it, but once were hooked, only the power and blood of Jesus Christ can set us free. I would have liked to read about more of Jesus' redemptive power in slaying the dragon than Steve's. I think God should have played a bigger role in this story. Overall, a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Gripping Storyline about the power of evil and its antidote","review":"Hyde River is a mining town in the northwest United States, and it has been tormented by a terrifying secret that has been destroying people's lives for generations.

The lead character becomes a believer ... Stupid! I would not recommend this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"too simplistic for belief","review":"This novel needs about three revisions. The real story concerns the people who live in the town. Their interactions and relationships have created evil. Evil is not an outside force (the dragon); it is the selfishness of the individuals who want glory or power or money for themselves. Only Levi, whom many consider unbalanced, holds respect for humanity in his heart. If the author had bothered to make his characters more three dimensional and if had the talent to depict their personalities and actions upon each other, this might be a good book. As it stands, it is simplistic and unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris","review":"I LOVED This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness by Frank Peretti so I was so eager to read this book.

I did not know this when I read it. However this is a very boring book. I ceased caring what happened to any of the characters long before the 3 cassette. It is very contrived and lacking in originality. Some books have (perhaps unintentionally) clear conclusions from the start but you enjoy the ride to the end. This was not one of them.

His characters were colorful, powerful images that created lasting moments for the reader. In The Oath, he has turned his back completley on reality, forcing the reader to swallow the largest stretch of his imagination.Centered around a dragon that embodies sin and its powerful grasp on the modern man, one can only guess at what led Peretti down this path. Having lost the guidance of his brillant angels, this plot drags as slowly as the ooze from the chests of the dragon's victims. Please skip this book and read his other classics. Easily one of the worst I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast delivery & excellent condition","review":"this book came w/in 5 days of my ordering it & it was in pristine condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moves quickly!","review":"Mr Peretti takes a topic we all know something about and literally fleshes it out. His take on sin gives the reader a very visual picture of what we begin to look like when we choose to pick up and play with sin.

I did not submerge it in water. When I looked at it again, it had water drops between the glass liner and the exterior wall.!! Then some of these drops leaked out of the bottom. It has some kind of round plug in it that the brouchure says to occasionally tighten. But it wouldn't move. Certainly need to wash it occasionally even using fresh gound coffee which does not really get my carafes dirty.Love it but I can't have it leaking out of the bottom.

My eight year old niece slept on the cot; given her light weight, there was no problem there. The bed was difficult to set up; the bar that goes across the top was a challenge. I purchased the pump to inflate/deflate the mattress; however the mattress can't be deflated. I have tried everything I could think of to get the pump to deflate the mattress; I'm stumped and would appreciate any suggestions. I haven't used the bed since my family left; I had to stuff the half-inflated mattress into the closet (what a drag). I'm disappointed with both purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Beds","review":"Things I liked:Pretty lightweight, easy to move. Didn't take up too much space. Very comfortable night's sleep, at least that's what my nephews told me. Pretty sturdy, held my weight(about 220lbs) without a problem. I did not sleep on it, however. Packed and unpacked easily, and they fit nicely in a closet when not in use. Will probably take them on vacation, to use for kids when in smaller hotel rooms. (I bought two of them)Things I did not like:Little difficult to get the end rails on. I was afraid I might bend or break them when forcing them on, but got them on without bending or breaking. Still a little concerned that after repeated assembly/disassembly, I might not be so lucky. Black end caps on rails, that cover the sharp aluminum edges, fell out easily, and marred the walls. The black plastic left marks on the walls that I could not easily get off. Great for kids, but should be a little wider for a full-sized adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality & comfort","review":"I was surprised at the high quality of the airbed and frame. It seems like it will last quite a while, with proper care. The matress piece itself was quite comfortable as long as you don't overfill it. Leaving it a littleunderfilled helped level it out once you lay on it. The only issue I had was it was very cold with the cold air circulating underneath the frame - but thats an envoirnment issue, not a product issue!

Instead of trying to teach every aspect of assembly language, he starts from the ground up and explains everything in a conversational, easy-to-read style. It is such a great book because it gives you the conceptual background you need to learn assembly, which is what many books leave out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heh...","review":"This book wasn't worth the 5$ I paid for it. First off, I have to agree with the person who said he used alien anologies for hex and I think Binary. Also, I skipped the first half of the book because it was basically telling you how to turn on the computer. In the second half, I come across MANY things saying \\"This is too advanced for this book\\". Other things includ obvious typos, as in the NOT truth table... the operator XOR was used on both of the two lines. I'd have to agree COMPLETELY with the person that said buy an assembler and read the docs. MUCH more worth it. This book spends pages and pages on the simplest tasks imaginable. The only reason it got one star was because that's the lowest the scale went."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible.","review":"If you have never seen a computer before, are baffled by elementary arithmatic, and like to be led by the hand through obscenely simple exercises, this book is for you. Unfortunately, should you meet these criteria, you aren't intelligent enough to learn assembly language. This is just as well, because this book does not endeavor to TEACH assembly language. A bad technical writer tries to add humor to an extremely dry topic, and explains hexadecimal math with alien analogies. In his attempt to reach the dullest of readers, Mr. Duntemann loses those who have the ability to succeed at this skill. I also can't imagine how this book became so popular; he has glued his picture to the cover of every copy.
