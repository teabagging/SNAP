Today it is completely dead and broken. The batteries are fresh so that is not the issue. This is heading to the trash.The concept is great. However I would expect a $60 trash can to work longer. If you would be satatisifed replacing it after 2 years, by all means go for it. Great idea to not have to open the lid by hand and better than the manual cans that you step on.

I was torn between the round opening can and this one, I made the right choice. There are open/close buttons on the front you can push if you want the lid to stay open for a long period of time. The lid opening is wide so you can easily scrape a plate over it. Previously we had a 13 gallon plastic can, this one seems to hold a bit more!

How could one tie history, the mystical, religion, and everyday life into a well-delivered mystery? It took very little time to become so engrossed in the story that I simply lost track of time. At the turn of every page, I simply had to continue to a breaking point so that I could pick up the next day. The explosive drama, which continued to unfold right up to the very end, was as gripping as any that I have ever read. The breaking point never came. I read the entire book before I could part with it.

This work will challenge your moral and intellectual base and stretch your emotions to their limit.

Sound of the Zeekers. It's sick.I bet none of the kids nowadays who listens to Busta Rhymes now know his history or the history or hip hop!It's weird because a lot of people don't know about this group.

At least in the first two tracks the tight grooves that I fell in love with were there, but here, there was just the same boring four-on-the-floor drumbeat that I hear all too much. The next two songs were worse. Since when has Photek had lyrics?

PHOTEK LISTEN next time do what BIG BUD did on Late Night Blues. He did what he wanted on one disc and he did what he was expected on the other.

He opened up alot of other areas of music I never thought to explore. I understand his need for musical exploration in other areas as well, (not that if he did another drum n bass album I would mind) but this is a little too much. From experimental dark drum n bass to....house? For me anyway, house is to music now as disco was back in the 70's. A huge waste of time and only meant to get rich white people dancing around because it has a simple beat they can relate to. Photek used to be someone known for pushing music into a new direction, but this just seems to go nowhere, fast. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I like the album cover. Other than that, dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good bits, but...","review":"Wow! So very disappointing. I understand and respect an artist's right and need to explore new avenues of expression, and, as a Photek fan I realize that he couldn't go too much farther with the minimalist drum and bass he'd become known for. However, I think this record mostly falls flat. First of, the two old-school house tracks are terrible. Aren't there enough crappy house tracks out there? The rest of the tracks retain elements of Photek's dark and intricate sound, and in my opinion there is about a 50/50 sucess/failure rate. Nothing is as awful as the two house songs, but all in all, i think i'll stick with \\"Modus Operandi\\" and \\"Form and Function.\\" I'd try to listen to some of this before you run out and buy it, because it's a big step in a different direction, and if you're expecting \\"Modus Operandi\\", you're going to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singing Fun for the whole family!","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and surprisingly, it has been alot of fun for the adults in our family too.

I highly recommend the later ROMS that were introduced for it - which are songs that little kids would like more look for Kidz Bop Sing Along Favorites and Animal Favorites. My daugther really got into this toy more when we had these \\"kiddie\\" songs for her to listen to.

It comes with a magnetic wooden doll and magnetic clothing pieces to dress up the doll and interact with the book. Afterwards she told me that books weren't that boring.

I was only able to get 2 in, after shredding the skin on my fingers trying them all. I got a 3rd in there as near as I could and tried to open my Bulova up... what a joke. The thing is just so cheap.

I understand that it is adjustable, but you shouldn't have enough give or flex that its difficult to use. One one of my watches, it actually slipped off and marred the back of the case. It was an inexpensive watch, so I wasn't fuming, but I was still upset that it happened. Learned my lesson, though, and it wont be going near my expensive watches.Bottom line? There are two situations that you should buy this:1) You will only be working on cheap watches that you don't really care if they get scratched up, or2) You are independently wealthy and can afford to needlessly damage expensive watches.

Ben has a knack for not only being a whiz at Photoshop, but translating what he does in a manner that makes you better for it.I won't go into details, suffice to say that your getting a great deal considering what it costs for airfare, conference fees etc, to see in person - or via the screen what will enhance your way of dealing with, and understanding color.

Also, the roughness is essential; it adds a certain energy to the tracks. The thing that struck me most about this release is the fact that nothing the Maniacs have released since has resembled Hope Chest, but I feel that heighten's the experience, somehow. Another aspect of the album is that it's heavily anti-war or violence in general, utilizing a lot of grim imagery in the lyrics. My favorites on the CD are \\"The Latin One\\", \\"Katrina's Fair\\", \\"Death of Manolete\\", \\"Grey Victory\\", \\"Tension\\" and \\"Daktari\\" (the last three having been rerecorded for The Wishing Chair)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good addition to collection for diehard 10KM fans.","review":"Hope Chest (1990) is really a collection of songs originally released much earlier. Hope Chest combines the tracks from the 10,000 Maniacs' first two EP's, Human Conflict Number Five (1982) and Secrets of the I Ching (1983). These two EP's, no longer available, were released by the bands' imaginary record label \\"Christian Burial Music\\".The songs themselves are pretty good, with the best tracks probably being \\"Pit Viper\\" and \\"My Mother the War\\". \\"My Mother the War\\" became the group's first song to get some airplay. Some of the best songs later appeared on the band's first full length album, The Wishing Chair (1985).Although this is probably the weakest album yet released by 10,000 Maniacs, it does make a nice addition to a 10KM fan's record collection. Being able to hear Natalie Merchant in her earliest days as an artist is a treat, and John Lombardo's guitar playing and writing are keenly missed in some of 10KM's later releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your \\"typical\\" 10,000 maniacs: a documentary","review":"As someone who had his teen years in the eighties, I was gladly surprised to have heard this album which depicts the first recordings by the band at the beginning of that decade. There's a blend of styles that range from reggae to ska and new wave, that show where Natalie Merchant and company came from.

Though not at the level of Fanny's brother, they are certainly a lot better than Fanny's works, just as a sort of yardstick. The performances don't try to scare up any depths from the music, but are bracing and fast-moving, slightly like a score for some silent movie never made.

I can only imagine that this disk would be useful for practicing middle-eastern dancers in need of a drummer with a pause button. I would, however, recommend R.A.

Not totally accurate, but precise.The drawback comes when by mid-book, the reader has more or less lost track of what the book is all about. Besides, all goes well for these SEAL guys. I doubt real missions go as smoothly as the book's ones; This special ops unit is definitely good at planning, but THAT good makes it slightly too...\\"Hollywoodesque\\"!Pictures instead of drawings might have helped as well.Overall, a good reading for anyone having interest in this military, counterterrorism warfare business, and definitely a must-read for the Special Op Wannabee.Does not grant a second burst for everybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martell is a good writter","review":"Martell wrote this book astonishingly well.

Yet this method should be allowed only so much of a foothold on a commentary and should not dominate the landscape. Into this trap have Molina & Rohrbaugh fallen into.Moreover, there is virtually no Textual critical questions addressed at all. No interaction with opposing commentaries. Narrative and theology are barely given weight. And finally, the historio-religious method permeates Malina & Rohrbaugh's conclusions time and again.Malina & Rohrbaugh's all to frequent reconstructions are torturous and hard to follow. Somehow it seems that as the commentary progresses verse-by-verse M&R get farther and farther from John's intended meaning.A much better critical read of the fourth gospel remains Herman Ridderbos, or Rudolf Schnackenburg.R.E Aguirre <><"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid these","review":"We have had racks like these in our barn for 17 years.

They weren't cheap ones either, one was a Circle Y, the other a special hand made one. Saddles need a rack that will support the whole tree a V shape.

Plentiful exercises at various tempos and with a novel note pointer give the viewer lots to practice. This DVD would best be suited for anyone that was afraid to learn how to read rhythms (or afraid to admit so!) as well as Intermediate drummers looking to firm up their reading foundation. Teachers should find this DVD to be useful to study how an experienced teacher such as Pat explains reading topics, and could well use the video, or parts of it, with young students for reinforcement or as a change of methodology.

Up until this album, whenever I thought of soprano sax, Kenny G and his mind numbing music would come to mind, and I would cringe. But, this album opened up a whole new world of music to me .. now THIS is how a soprano sax should sound. It is beautiful. Sidney Bechet is (or was) a true genius, the way he made the horn almost operatic in sound, with the wonderful throbbing vibratos. No wonder he was sometimes billed as \\"The Talking Saxophone\\".

It does not confine its content to gender issues but expands to study all types of human relationships by categorizing personality types into the four card suits. Using this typology and subsequent scenarios, the reader is able to understand his/her personality, social interactions, and social reactions. Strong Suit studies the root of relationship obstacles, not only discussing why an occurance develops but also how to work through the obstacle. The book's manageable language allows the business and general public to readily understand and utilize its tactics. I highly recommend Finding Your Strong Suit to anyone who wishes a better comprehension of the human character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on personality typology","review":"No one has written on matters of personality typology better than James and Jung. However, one will not find a clearer presentation than the one found in the following book. The style in which we think, gain access to information, and those forces that motivate our emotions, intellect, and will are all influenced by our own personality typology.

I won't turn this into a rant about pop music, but you can't deny that this is a lively collection.There's some great songs, like the big-band uptempo jazzy J'ai Aurais Bien Voulu, the quaint and earnest J'ai Change (I have changed) and the bright La Cigarette. Some of them are absolutely full of energy and excitement.There's a couple of covers, one of them a Jack Johnson cover, which are good.There are some bad songs, like the repulsive Bitches on the Ground which sounds like a boy-band song, and there's a few more morose songs which sound a bit boring.This is a compilation, so you can just skip through the songs you don't like. The chances are, though, you'll single out 5 or so pearls and listen to them ad nauseum, cos they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Its Amazing to me that someone can review an older release and say it sounds dated, or has post-disco cliches, etc.Um, yah, it is over 20 years old. I love Chaka Khan too but I dont complain that Feel 4 U sounds dated.In Los Angeles, Angel was played constantly at kute.fm Which is why i bought the album. But what is really amazing about this album, in relationship to Ms. Baker's later material, is that to me, it sounds like she opened up vocally on it. Yes, there are some unusual-for-her faster tunes and thank goodness. Her voice is literally all over the charts, and not a bum note anywhere. I love her material, but there is certainly a \\"sameness\\" quality to her later releases, and this under-rated album added a variety of flavors.It was a great day for us music collectors who found this one on cd finally and i enjoy it still today, over 20 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Songstress","review":"I was in love with Anita Baker's voice after a quiet storm radio program in Philly played 'Angel'. I was overjoyed when this disc was finally released and out of 8 songs - I truly dislike only 2...'Squeeze Me' & 'Do You Believe Me' do absolutely nothing for me.Anita's voice shines on 'Angel', the stunning 'You're The Best Thing Yet', 'No More Tears', 'Will You Be Mine', 'Feel the Need' (where she stretches from the lower to upper register so effortlessly) and 'Sometimes'.If you love r&b; - excuse me, GOOD r&b; music, this is an excellent disc to add especially if you're building an Anita collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S NOT COMMERCIAL...","review":"This was her first solo cd and her best. The former singer of Chapter 8 showed her stuff and she has been great ever since. This cd is not commercial like the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eclectic debut","review":"Unlike her later work which focussed exclusively on jazz-influenced R&B ballads, The Songstress, Anita Baker's debut, is a more eclectic collection. There are even a couple of funk/soul dance numbers on the album (though some fans may be shocked to hear her sing, \\"Like the way you shake your thang\\"). Unsurprisingly, however, the album's best songs are ballads: \\"Angel,\\" and the midtempo, \\"You're the Best Thing Yet,\\" which brims with a wonderful sense of urgency and showcases Baker's stunning vocal range without ever resorting to Mariah Carey-like hysterics. The rest of the songs on the album aren't bad, but for the most part sound like work by a new artist who has not yet found consistent artistic direction. All in all, The Songstress was a promising debut, but not a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Dundas ProFlex Indoor Dryer Vent","review":"I have used this dryer vent for one month and it has performed exatly as advertised, I recomend it for any one needing an indoor vent system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just like it's suppose to","review":"The house we rent has a small washer/dryer and the vent runs up and out through the ceiling. The dryer motor isn't strong enough to push all the lint up and out so we ran the ProFlex down to the floor and now the dryer works much better.The only issue is that on a warm day, the heat from the dryer stays in the house and can make it even warmer inside. On the upside, on a cold day we don't have to run the heat so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but the hose is too short","review":"I bought this for my daughter, who moved into a townhouse with no outside vent for the dryer. My daughter's friend also surprised her with this vent kit. The one he purchased leaked.

That allowed the vent to be wall-mounted, so it doesn't get kicked over.My daughter has had no trouble with this vent system. It does a good job of trapping lint. She lives in an arid climate so the added humidity is actually a welcome feature.

I was worried about the space it would take. But it turns out to be quite small - about 5x6 inches. Construction seems OK it should hold up for quite a while. Opens and closes easily for cleaning.

After catching on fire, I decided to buy this indoor dryer vent kit. Yes, it's inexpensive, and technically does what it's supposed to do... It's flimsy, allows moisture to saturate the wall and floor, but worst of all it allows lint to accumulate all over the room. I put a mesh bag around it to try to stop the lint from flying out, but it still escapes. Messy, flimsy and heading for a moldy disaster soon.

As someone who prefers live vs. studio 99% of the time I was hoping for more from this album. I refuse to believe that these were the best versions of these songs and this album is pretty much plauged by bad choices.I never really bought into Morrisson's \\"poetry\\" nor all of his psychadelic mind freeing mantras. He blabs and blabs on many of the tracks rendering them pretty much unplayable. There are some fantastic instances of the rest of the band's brillaince shining through such as in Love Me Two Times and Break on Through. Unfortunately there are just two many instances of Morrisson going off on some tangent or screaming into the microphone.Bottom Line: If drunken rambling at nauseum is your thing then this is the record for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Absolutely Live\\" Plus","review":"Disc One contains what used to be the double live album \\"Absolutely Live\\", which is just about the most electrifying life performance you'll ever hear by anyone.

If you don't know The Doors, this is a great introduction. If you do know The Doors, you'll definitely want to get this for the virtuosity of Robbie Krieger on lead guitar and Ray Manzarek on everything. The drumming is powerful, unique, jazz-based, and allows everyone to do their thing without getting completely lost. Of course, you already know Mr. Morrison. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead cats, dead rats, Doors Live,","review":"Nice to have all the live releases combined on one cd release.

The back and forward buttons function the same way as windows explorer. The player is a bit heavy, but I knew it would be because it does have a 15 gb hard drive. The USB 2.0 interface is awesome, great transfer speed, and no errors. The software installation was a breeze and the batteries can be charged while it is on.

Full of characters you're ready to hate, you end up loving nearly every one. Extraordinarily beautiful language, the writing is the cream of the crop. Not much of a plot, to be sure, as it is filled mostly with conversation that asks all of life's profoundest questions.

My old ones were made in the USA. If they want to make them in China, let them stay there. The quality has definetly gone down hill..........a lot. These new ones will not last like the first ones I had, the liners and stitching are crap and the soles will be worn through in no time.

I like the slipper as it's comfortable and because it has a back works well for me, as I need to wear orthotics. I have had two pairs of these, and neither lasted a year. In both cases the sole has separated from the upper. For a slipper of this price, that is unacceptable.Subsequent to writing this, I bought a pair of Isotoner slippers that are the same style as the Acorns. I've had them nearly four months and find them equal to the Acorns at a lower price.

I feel like if I really wanted something old school, I would have bought a Donny Hathaway cd, or a Marvin Gaye cd, or something along those lines.

Best song is \\"Save Room.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of disappointed","review":"For the John Legend fans who bought the 1st album like I did, this one is nothing like it. I love his voice sooo much, but the song choices were a bit of a let down. There are maybe 3 songs that I listen to. I would advize people to preview the tracks and buy the oes you really like on I-Tunes or something like that, that way you won't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone Please Tell Me Where I've been?","review":"OK, So I have the tendency to pass judgement until heard. Like so MANY of us people tend to do. It took another person to make me see what a masterpiece this album was. In between another rendition from some very funny people I quite enjoyed this. In all honesty I had not picked up on John Legend simply from his single that I had heard previously\\"Ordinary People\\" The track did not move me and I simply left him at the status of another piano player with a neo/soul track. But \\" Again\\", maybe its because of the relevance to my life but this brother has amazing if not an astonishing ability to write. I now commend him and this album. I now must return to listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"joetoken","review":"This joint is absolute money. Yes it is true that this installment is a lot different from John's previous \\"Get Lifted\\" but that is alright. This album sounds like a mix of stevie wonder, otis redding, frank sinatra and burt bacharach all mashed into one. And yes it still has that r&b influence, its just not ubiquitous throughout. This man could make a hit record out of eep op ork ah ah. Definately worth the buy. So go buy it right now. NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Talented!","review":"Music to make love to, fall in love to, fall out of love to. John Legend is warm, healtfelt, engaging.

His second cd \\"Once again\\" is \\"Once is enough already\\"!. He sounds straned and annoying. The lyrics are not well written, more like very immature. He tries way to hard and you can hear it in his voice. These R&B acts are losing a lot of fans by making stupid music like this and expect us to \\"Like this crap\\". All they care about is getting paid. If you want to hear real R&B with raw lyrics listen to Amy winehouse or Corinne Bailey Rae. The difference between R&B Brits and american fake R&B, they sing with emotion, write meaningful lyrics and have great Vocals. American R&B is only in it for our cash and make awful music with no substance. As long as we keep buying music like this. They will continue to make trashy music like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I'm going to be completely honest...","review":"Some people love this album, and that's just fine. I just have to tell the truth here. I really did not like this album at all. It is annoying.I know that after a great, critically-acclaimed debut, John wanted to deliver another classic. And it shows. This album is so clean cut and perfect. His diction is so precise on here that it is annoying. To me... it sounds like he sat in the studio for a year tweaking this up until it sounded perfect... trying so desperately to make a great album.The songs are like Starbucks material. Very boring and laid-back. And again, his diction and vocals are just so absolutely perfect that it is unnatural and quite frankly unlistenable to me. But that's just my two cents.

He seemed to turn his back on the soulful,funky and edgy R & B that made Get Lifted great. This album seems like he's catering to the mass audience with predictable Barry Manilow like music. Too perfect production and boring at the same time. Ughh"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not feeling this","review":"I bought this album wanting to like it, because I truly enjoyed his first cd.

Once Again a Legendary Album","review":"May I be one of the first to say that for me this album is Waaay!!! Better than John's first album \\"Get Lifted\\". The latter left me wanting more in the way of the piano melodies and more vocally. \\"Once Again\\" delivers all easily superceeds those requirements.From the opening track \\"Save Room\\" to the last emotionally thoughtful track \\"Coming Home\\" this album coasts. I can listen to the entire album without stopping once(a true rarity in the music scene). My favorite Tracks in order... PDA(We Just dont care), Save Room, Another Again, Where did my baby go, Each Day Gets Better. It really dosen't matter, I'm feeling them all. Gotta see the concert when it comes through, John Stephens A.K.A. John Legend put it down with this record. Just put the CD in and press PLAY!!! and let it ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 1/2 Stars...Different From Get Lifted","review":"John Legend's second album Once Again is a pretty solid effort but it took me a few listens to get into the album versus Get Lifted where I jumped right into the album.

John Legend fans shouldn't be dissappointment so go support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Everyone But I Loved It","review":"True not everyone will like but I like the fact that he has taken risk with album.

His music is so thoughtprovoking, fun, sexy, cool and vibrating all at once. And his voice is incredibly haunting, soul, pop hip hop. He also changes his vocal style on tracks projecting a totally different sound. Anything less than 5 stars is an insult for this project.

The first was selling well in a streetcorner underground around New York City and Philadelphia. Eddie Gries and his partners decided to start producing their own acappella sessions. They began with the popular group, the Chessmen. The Holidays were a young group which auditioned right in the Times Square Record Shop. The Citadels were the first mixed group to record acappella, streetcorner style. The Youngtones were a young Latino group who almost made it big. This second record was rounded out with leased masters by the Delstars of \\"Zoop Bop\\" fame (remember them?) and the Five Jades. None of these songs had been released before Best of Acappella Vol 2. The CD is packaged with the same images which a adorned the original album jacket and includes the original album notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Version","review":"I have nothing against the guide itself.

The 2006 Guide is noticeably smaller than the 2004--with 2,000 FEWER entries! Like many film buffs, I use the Guide as a reference book. Film info and stats are more valuable to me than the reviews, i.e., who is that actress? when was is shot? is it available on DVD yet?, etc. I wonder what criteria were used in excising such a large chunk of film history.Now I'll have to hang on to the old dog-eared version for films cut from the 2006. Come on, Leonard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of the time, too little or too much","review":"To me this movie guide is maddening.Some of my favorite films of all time have been sorely underrated.

Whiles he raves about old fashioned stinkers such as Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Psycho, he is far less complimentary about classics such as Weekend at Bernie's, Gremlins 2 and Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach. I think Mr Maltin should learn to keep his so-called opinions to himself in future. Verdict: A very expensive doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to please movie critic","review":"I borrowed this book from the library; thought it would be interesting to compare it to Mick Martin and Marsha Porter's DVD and Video Guide. All I can say is, look up your favorite movies and see what Mr. Maltin has to say about them...he's one tough film critic. Some of his reviews even come off as nitpicky to me. I find the other book I mentioned is much more fair and the reviewers have similar opinions to mine. I do like the alphabetical film listing of both books and the paperback format, however. Glad I didn't actually buy this or receive it as a gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a big dictionary...","review":"Personally, I don't like this book. It reads like a big dictionary... lots of words but nothing tying things together. I found it difficult to find and follow a set of concrete steps to help get a PMO up and running. I understand it is \\"complete\\" but it does it at the expense of the \\"shotgun effect\\"--throwing a lot of stuff out but not really zeroing in on anything.I think this book would be great for someone who needed to pick and choose a few specific things and wanted a reference but as a day-to-day book to help with setting up a PMO and figuring out how to get a PMO effort off the ground in a way that ensures success, it misses the mark unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the worst guide to DLRP. The author clearly hasn't done his homework and judging by the misinformation concerning the newer attractions must not have visited the place at all in the past ten years. His descriptions of the Indiana Jones ride (ie that it runs forwards and then backwards through a loop) and the Canal Boats (he says there is a guide cast member on board each boat)are just plain wrong.

There's a couple of tunes on \\"Punk Goes Metal\\" that are a bit different and unique- \\"Love Song\\" by Ten Foot Pole is pretty cool and the Atari's version of \\"I Remember You\\" is fun. But most of the songs end up sounding just like the originals. The guitar and drum sound is definitely in that pop/punk vein but it doesn't do enough to set a song like \\"Looks That Kill\\" or \\"Little Fighter\\" apart from the original. And the only way you can tell the Ozzy covers apart are the American accents on the vocals. I can't really speak for the covers of Leather Pirate's \\"Why Rock\\" or St. Madness' \\"Sexual Abuse\\" since I've never heard of either of those two bands. But if you're not expecting much, it's a decent batch of '80s hard rock redone, but not all that exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal fans, avoid at all costs.","review":"If you're a fan of metal, particularly from the 80s, beware. This CD is full of butchered versions of some of your favorite songs, by emo and pop/punk bands. I wonder if this is supposed to be a tribute to metal, or an insult.\\"I Remember You\\", originally by Skid Row and covered here by the Ataris, is particularly bad. Once a sincere, emotional ballad with an awesome guitar solo, The Ataris managed to turn it into run-of-the-mill pop/punk garbage. I half expected the singer to scream \\"let's go!\\" at some point in the song. And speaking of the singer, he can't even handle the entire song, and is forced to sample Sebastian Bach's original lyrics later on.And as if that weren't bad enough, their are butchered versions of classic songs by Guns N' Roses, Judas Priest, Motley Crue, and ACDC."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is GREAT!","review":"Ok... I used to work for a very famous Metal record label (that this CD covers some of their artists) and I have to say, this album is really good.

(Like songs from Slayer, Pantera, Bloodbath, Dying Fetus, Bolt Thrower, Ministry or at least early Metallica) They choose phony, overproduced corporate garbage hair metal songs. I can see why so many punk rockers hate metal. They think metal is about some jackass in spandex with an annoyingly high voice who is so detatched from reality and lives in a mansion in Beverly Hills. Probably the only good part is that AFI doesn't sound like Guns N' Poseurs, or maybe that Divit doesn't sound like Judass Priest (which was really a cheap and corny imitation of Black Sabbath)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program but put your money to better use (part 3)","review":"Still another pair of episodes that will come nice and clean in set 1, buy only if your copy from that set needs a quick replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I purchased this toaster to replace my previous T-fal Avante that finally gave up after many years of service.

Nothing Is Sound hit you even harder with some fresh sounds and inspiring lyrics (mostly, some of the songs on there were a little dry). This album is a little too \\"hard rock\\" for my taste. In addition to that, the lyrics aren't as relevant as there were on the last two albums.

The lyrics are as deep as all other Switchfoot songs, the chord progressions are fresh and the beats are engaging. Dirty Second Hands and Circles are what I call successful experiments, with complex, non-conventional beats that keep you guessing. Standouts. I love the lyrical bass underlay in \\"Circles\\", and the end segment reminds me of Scarborough Fair. The album is a veritable smorgasboard of styles, with clapping as the added spice. I look forward to more harmonics among the band singers in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomeness","review":"I'm surprised that The Beautiful Letdown has a higher rating; Oh!

This has to be the first CD by Switchfoot that is great from start to finish! They were close to hitting a home run with \\"Nothing is Sound,\\" but they weren't quite there yet. \\"Oh! Gravity\\" is right on the money. Switchfoot adds to their edgier material from their previous release, giving their songs even more depth and maturity. At the same time, some songs, such as 4:12 and Secondhand Lovers, bring back fond memories of their first release, \\"Legend of Chin.\\" \\"Singability\\" is at an all-time high--songs like the title track, American Dream, and Head Over Heals have great choruses that you can't help but sing along with. As owner of all their previous work, I can honestly say that this is the best investment in Switchfoot material that I've made in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"My daughter and I are huge Switchfoot fans. We have all their CD's. We are enjoying this one as much as the others! Great music, meaningful lyrics and no bad stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sound","review":"'Oh! Gravity' is an enjoyable album that addresses some significant issues.This album showcases the band's considerable talents with a wide variety of genres. It is quite diverse and thus difficult to characterize with a label.The title song is perhaps the best one on the album although there are a couple of others that are very good. The overall sound of the album is more impressive than that of any one song.A weakness in this album is the lack of a solution. Although they criticize things such as materialism and focusing on chasing dollars, answers are absent. I think this is rather odd in light of the professed Christianity of the group. The obvious answers found in Jesus and his Word are either nowhere to be found or so obscure that one must have some special insight in order to pick up on them.In spite of that flaw (in my opinion), the band and this album are still better than much of what is being produced today."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome but not incredible","review":"Actually I give it 4.5. This CD is mostly amazing, but just one or two songs were really lousy. I DEFINITELY recommend buying it, and really wish that I could have given it five stars. Amateur Lovers and American Dream are the two that brought it down. But Awakening is fantastic, especially the bridge, FM&M is wonderful, Circles is a brilliant usage of 5/4 and slight polyrhythmy, which are unfortunately unusual in rock music.

I also love \\"Cindy of a Thousand Lives\\" because it's so different from any song out there. I was fortunate to see Bragg in concert here in Atlanta on this tour and Michael Stipe came out to sing with him. His CD's translate so well in a live venue.

Mann.... it was absolutely the worst book I have ever read on anything dealing with masculinity.The first major problem with the book was the fact that the author was full of himself. There are a couple of passages in the prologue that points this out. Secondly it was unprofessional, and heavily opinionated, and wrongly so. It was almost reading a radical feminist's perspective on male mysteries and sexuality. Which would be kind of like a guy talking about what giving birth is like.None of his opinions are scientifically backed up, nor does he refer to any sources to show its validity either. And I loved the fact that he talked about great sources of information, but didn't really idolize them, or incorporate them into the book. All in all, it is a bad book. Do not buy it. Save it and buy HB Harris' book Emasculation of the Unicorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"His Story\\" should be listed under feminist studies.","review":"Mann's linking of society's ills to the patriarchal world displays a gross ignorance of history and anthropology, two fields in which he claims expertise.

What i liked most about reading this book was, Trisha. It is so rare to read a mainstream black novel with a main character that is determined to stay a virgin until marriage. Trisha dated Jordan, off and on- the main character in this book. Everyone should give this book a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Shoes for Everyday Wear","review":"I was quite wary of buying shoes online, but was pleasantly surprised! This pair was excellent right out of the box. The shoe is very comfortable and was true to size. They breathe suitably - I can't recall my feet being at all uncomfortable in them. The soles are leather, and make a distinct \\"click\\" as you walk. (If that bothers you, you may want to pass on these.)I am very pleased by this purchase - especially since I got them on sale (70% off). If I were to pay full price, I would probably lean toward a pair of Echo (which I own) or better shoes but, on sale, I think these are an excellent value. I cannot speak to durability, but these shoes have already been through some very nasty weather without a hitch. I wear dress shoes every day and am happy to wear and recommend this comfortable shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"the war-up close and personal","review":"I was uncertain about this book when I bought it but after I finished it, I was glad I went ahead and got it. This is the first-hand account of Gen'l Liddell's experience during \\"the War ofNorthern Aggression\\" Liddell was killed in 1870, so this was written right after the war, before he had time to\\"filter\\" his feelings or bring his story \\"in line\\" with the general view. He speaks with an immediacy that is not often felt in other personal histories. I reccommend this book to Civil Wa buffs! It is like an unauthorized history of the War in the TransMississippi."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must buy this mouse","review":"If you are reviewing every wireless mouse there is out there, stop now. I already did it for you. My goal: I needed a good wireless mouse, a smooth runner, that could run even on my dog's tongue. My last mouse was a Microsoft, which was good enough, but let it fall and died. I have a wrist problem which has been caused by too much keyboarding at work, and I needed a comfortably shaped mouse which could run on almost any surface. It even cost me $25 at the famous auctions site. It is very solid, so buttons are well made. The side buttons work like heaven (I'm using them as page up/down). I cannot ask for a better mouse. You will be more than pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not Recommend Purchasing","review":"I have owned a few of the Logitech Laser mice including this one. They all suffer from giving false signals even if you are not touching the mouse. Its very typically to be on the web or a spreadsheet, and have your spreadsheet zoom (either in an out) to a completely unacceptable size. Try switching applications to get it to stop. Again various laser Logitech mice all have the same problem. A few thoughts if you can't resisting buying one to elimate the cord. Don't buy the mouse and keyboard combination, which can be very pricey, but buy them separately. When they stop working properly in a few months, you'll lose less money. Additionaly, don't go with the rechargeable mouse - go with the replaceable battery like this one. I have spent hours of cumulative time waiting for the mouse to recharge in order to have computer access again. Its very easy to be be in the habit of putting it on the recharger every evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Voices in the Muslim World","review":"&#65279;Living Islam Out Loud is an extraordinary collection of coming of age stories of American Muslim Women. The stories are intense, inspiring and powerful. This book provides an intimate and honest look how out-dated cultural and religious values have an enormous impact on the self image and life choices of young women. The women in this book illustrate the courage it takes to stand out on their own and find a personal relationship with God outside of the limitations of oppression and sexism. This book is an ideal representation of many American born Muslim Women and the obstacles we must overcome to find our place in Islam. Living Islam Out Loud is a remarkable vehicle for individual and international change in the Islamic world."},{"rating":"1","title":"It depends on what you want from this book","review":"I wanted to find out how Muslim women in the USA live their religion. For me, therefore, I didn't want to only hear from Muslim feminists rallying for their cause. I wanted to also hear from American Muslim women who were satisfied with the way they lived their religion here in the USA and what they liked about their religion and why Christianity didn't seem fitting for them. I didn't get that. And many of the chapters simply seemed like \\"rah, rah, let's change this and that!\\" It was like going to a political rally for one side. I didn't feel like I learned a heck of a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voices not ordinarily heard","review":"This book was definitely an eye opener on how Islam is practiced in America. I found it interesting how many of the authors drew points on the strong parallels between how Islam is practiced in other countries based on their respective cultural practices. This parallel is something that I think needs to be brought forth more often, especially with the youth of America who are struggling to find their identiity with their conservative Islamic beliefs in one hand and their \\"free-living\\" western culture in the other. There were some aspects of the book that I didn't agree with, but I say to each his/her own. At the end of the day, you do what is best for you. Only God is the true judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it!","review":"I understand the need for Muslimahs in America to tell their personal stories and I respect that. However, I was very distrubed by many of the stories I read. I am left wondering, if people want to change Islam to suit their personal perspectives and desires then what will be left of this way of life? I realize people have different applications of Islam but how can one justify sex outside of marriage, marrying a non-Muslim man, or being gay?? The Quran is CLEAR in its position on these matters. How can some of these authors expect people to see it any different? I totally support women praying in the same hall as men (separated), serving on the masjid boards, and taking a stand against sexist norms that have been interpreted as \\"Islam\\". But a woman trying to be an imam? Praying in mixed gender rows?

The Cat duet that closes the CD is very funny. Zez Confrey's Kitten on the Keys rings so true - if you know cats.Please don't let the \\"cute\\" idea behind this CD make you think the compositions or the performances are second rate. Nothing here is second rate. Noel Lester is a true artist and I admire his skill. The voices are full and rich. Even the short snippets of poetry work beautifully and I ordinarily don't like spoken word combined with my music.

I was wrong. This book does contain a good deal of information, but much of it is either common knowledge or readily available on the web (as mentioned in a previous review). The rest of it is a collection of stories from women who have pumped exclusively....I could get similar stories out of a magazine. I was hoping for some new, breakthrough information in this book, but it was not to be found. I would recommend this book to someone who has NEVER READ ANYTHING on expressing breastmilk.

Although it didn't meet the requirements of the material I needed, I was compelled by its charm to include it in the bibliography. It is the chronicle of a year in the development of a personal garden by the author, and illustrated with her woodcuts. The story is a personal and straightforward account of her daily efforts and thoughts, written in a way that endears you to her and to her garden. The woodcuts are very finely designed, and just as finely executed, and are worth the price of the book in themselves. A book worthy of reading or browsing, even if you are not a gardener, and just enjoy a bit of armchair travel to someone else's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Book for Pain in the Necks","review":"This handbook is intended for the clinician but is of great benefit to the layperson if they have a medical dictionary (or the net). Dr. Ronthal helped me as a patient prepare for an exam with a neck specialist. By learning what my doctor would be checking for and some terminology, I was able to ask less questions and understand the answers better. In 130 pages he shares 35 years of experience to aid doctors in diagnosis of common neck complaints, and it can be very helpful to the nonmedical adult as well. I would have given the book 5 stars but I am not a doctor and the graphics were way over my head. Like my exam, I will leave that to the pros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversimplistic book for practitioners","review":"This book is good for laypersons who are keen to learn about their injuries and about how to approach their clinicians but not so good for the practitioners.

So when I saw \\"Mammoth\\" on the shelf of my local library, I was excited to discover a Varley novel I haven't yet read.I'm three chapters into \\"Mammoth,\\" and I actually stopped to see if it had been written as YA fiction - not that I have anything against YA, but surely adult fiction by a respected author would have graceful exposition, characters with depth, and compelling dialogue. Instead, this reads like third-rate Heinlein (and even first-rate Heinlein is first-rate because of its plots, not because of the quality of its writing).I might have enjoyed this back in my SF-reading days, but my standards for good writing have changed since then, and this isn't it. Back to the library it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have made a great short story","review":"To be fair the only other thing I've read by the author was his short story Press Enter_ which I found in a Hugo Award compliation several years ago.Since I loved Press Enter_ I had high expectations for Mammoth. Mammoth just didn't deliver. I think if the author had cut out a lot of the fluff this could have made a great short story. There was just too much fluff left in to make a great novel. Also, I think that if you're going to write a novel about time travel that you should make *some* attempt to explain where the time machine came from. Maybe you can get away with it in a short story but I expect more from a novel.I did like the twist at the end though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Varley is 5 Stars; Mammoth is Not","review":"You can read the boilerplate to figure out the gist of the story, no sense in me wasting your time with a rehash.I am astounded and in awe of John Varley's imagination.John Varley is one of the best writers/SF writers I have ever read.John Varley is absolutely world class. I rank him with Howard Waldrop and Ted Sturgeon, among few others.\\"Mammoth\\" is flat and, although I loyally read through to the end, tedious. It ranks right down there with \\"Red Thunder.\\" A spark of imagination, coupled with cut-out characters and a \\"see it coming around the bend\\" twist at the end do not combine to enthrall.Do buy \\"The John Varley Reader.\\" Be amazed by brilliance. Pray that John Varley has only fallen asleep, and will someday awake, and return to writing the stories that have dazzled me for the last twenty-five years.And do buy everything else by John Varley save \\"Mammoth/Red Thunder.\\" Best money you ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mammoth Big-time Fun","review":"I was just thinking something like, 'Why can't they clone a mammoth from one of those frozen carcasses in Siberia?'--when along comes John Varley, who takes this plausible 'what if' and turns it into a wild tale filled with inscrutable time machines and paradoxes, an eccentric billionaire with a death ray, and a full-bore mammoth charge up La Brea Avenue. A fun and exciting read. The tale of 'Little Fuzzy of the Ice Age' is wound throughout the more improbable happenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Varley wimps out","review":"Mammoth is a quick and easy read, perhaps working as simple weekend entertainment. As a pulp sf/action novel, it has a lot in common with Michael Crichton novels. For many, that would suffice, but I found Mammoth to be disappointing. There is very little hard science here: the physics and philosophy of time travel are completely lacking, for example, supplanted by Rubik's cube hand-waving magic. Paleontology is discussed at a level that might be expected from a children's museum; part of the story (that part that contains most of the paleontological information) is, in fact, written literally at that level. But most disappointing is Varley taking consistently wimpy stances on the paradoxes of time travel, the corrupting influence of big business, science vs religion, and especially the rights (or not) of animals. Mammoth provided a very good framework for Varley to take a stand on these issues, but he takes the middle ground, placating in every instance."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Varley in a new direction","review":"Not your typical John Varley sci fi thriller, this story is nonetheless a great read. The premise, mammoths in the 21st century, and how this transpired will keep the reader interested right up until the somewhat surprising ending.A must for John Varley fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"Spoiler alert.This started out as a good, fun book. And I generally enjoyed it. But two big things bothered me about it. First, the chapters are numbered by time sequence. The book starts with Chapter 5, then continues in order until a time jump back to chapters 2-4. Then there is another skip to the current time (Chapter 16). It's around this part of the book that the reader realizes the book is going to end with Chapter 1. Not only that, but the who/what/when/where of Chapter 1 is obvious. Varley does throw in a twist at the end with one of those Ws. But the other 3 Ws are as predicted.The other problem with the book is that a big chunk of the middle is tedious and not as fun to read as the rest.Overall, a decent book. Some good things, some bad. But knowing the ending ahead of time is not enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Mammoth is absolutely riveting. Beginning with the opening page, I simply couldn't tear myself away from this amazing tale.The story is about a mammoth's corpse which is found sheltering the body of a man with a time machine. It's fascinating, absolutely fascinating, and continually challenges the mind. The protagonist is a super genius, which may account for the massive headache I now have (though that could also be from reading for 6-8 hours straight without wearing my contact). Without offering too many spoilers, I'll just say the book had a little bit of everything I love (drama, mystery, sci-fi, etc.), including a lot of surprises. The ending was completely satisfying, too. And I loved the little intersticials, particularly given how they turned out in the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"cant sleep? put this on.","review":"I just sold my copy on ebay, So i did actually own this hd dvd.

Occasional nature scenes are shown, but for the most part we see Muriel playing the guitar (there is no singing.) While this would probably be fine as background music while conversing with a friend in a bar or cafe, it is quite boring when your attention is focused on it. Picture quality is good, but then again there is not much to look at. Sound is good as well, but this will only be appreciated by those who like this style of music. This one is not even worht renting in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Eye Candy, Visually Disappointing","review":"I will preface that I do not claim to specifically be a Muriel Anderson fan, but I do like soothing guitar music, and was excited with the idea of having it combined with the visual beauty of nature. I am a huge fan of Discovery HD Sunrise Earth. This DVD fell completely flat of my expectations. (Which, no doubt, could be fixed by a more accurate description). This is an HD DVD of Muriel Anderson on stage performing, with the camera rarely showing anything other than her face or her hands, and almost subliminal flickers of nature scenes thrown in a such a scant and rare fashion that I cannot think why they even bothered other than to provide the misguided hook that caught me.

I am glad that Howard Jones keeps making music like Joe Jackson and others from the 1980s who are not only memorable for their music videos but their voices and sounds still reasonate in our time.

I mean, I've practiced for a while and decided to move my practice home - there is nothing Ashtanga in this DVD. Seriously Sun Salutations A & B don't make it the practice.

This is a waste of money - Ohm."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure who found this more boring, me or the instructor","review":"Beginners is definitely a misnomer here, unless it's just referring to an introduction to ashtanga. I am an intermediate yoga practitioner and I wouldn't wish this video on a yoga newbie. While you can turn on a pose explaination track, no modifications are shown on the main track. The instructor honestly seemed bored; her voice was about as excitement filled as Ben Stein's in Ferris Bueller. You know... \\"Bueller? Bueller?\\" The pacing of this is so slow I wanted to start counting sheep, but it manages to not feel relaxing at all. The sequencing seemed uninspired, and I grew quickly bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nails on a Chalkboard","review":"I found it impossible to get past the voice of this instructor, which is equivalent to nails on a chalkboard, and the fact that she just talks too much.

I was looking for a beginner tape - something easy. This is not it. It repeats each exercise endlessly and assumes that you can do all the poses without offering alternatives if you can't, for example, reach the floor with your hands while standing straight. Not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"I bought the first DVD in this series, Doane's Ashtanga Yoga: Introductory Poses. I thought it gave a great introduction to the Ashtanga system, taking you through suryanamaskar A and B and several standing poses. I bought the second DVD, Beginner's workout. It is the EXACT same practice. There is nothing new. Doane goes through the same standing poses as on the first DVD. I find that to be incredibly un-yogic of the people at Gaiam, just a way for them to get more money from unsuspecting customers who get no clue from the descriptions of the two DVDs that they are actually the same.Do not buy this. I plan to write to Gaiam as well to complain about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is \\"terrible\\" a strong enough word?","review":"This is the worst yoga video I have seen to date. Nicki Doane's voice is awful to have to listen to. Fifteen minutes into the workout, her voice just seemed to grate my nerves. Her voice also just seemed to have a tension behind it, which caused stress. The workout wasn't terrible in itself, so I suggest memorizing the sequences and doing them without the video.This supposedly is a beginner's video. But there is no information on using yoga props, and no warning about not trying to reach the full pose right away, so as not to injure yourself. There is the option of watching the video with extra pose hints, but they are not very helpful. I would have expected more on how to make sure that you are properly aligned, or doing it properly.I would strongly recommend a different video. I wish I would have rented it before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I have done Ashtanga many times at the yoga center - but it would be nice to save the $15 per session and be able to do it at home. Especially, since Ashatanga is the same every time.Well, this DVD didn't help me out much at all. It doesn't go through the whole routine. It doesn't follow the Ashtanga breathing. And her voice is annoying! I have turned the volume way down and it is still grating.The workout itself is actually not too bad. It is strenous in parts because she goes through A and B many times and very slowly. However, as an Ashtanga workout - it really fails miserably.For the workout it is - it could have been improved with a pose-only narration track.Save your money, there are better DVDs out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame..boring.. same old thing..waste of $$","review":"I wish I could say I liked this video..but its just the same old thing....her voice is annoying, the music puts me to sleep.

I will now have to waste a lot of time returning it to the manufacturer. I don't even want a new one back. I want my money back. I would never buy another one and I recommend that others avoid the product. Shame on T-Fals's quality control for letting faulty product off the assembly line. A 30 second test would have detected the issue - but they didn't test it and I own the problem and they have my money . . . . not a good trade.

Construction is good quality not tinny as many models are. This toaster is able to handle wide toast securely so it toasts evenly.

First, and most importantly, it did not toast BOTH sides of the bread. A slice of bread that is not square will not fit into the toaster. And last of all, a strange design problem keeps the bread from going completely down into the toaster. It has a wire cage that \\"grips\\" the bread and pulls it down. The gripping action doesn't allow the bread to fall completely into the toaster so only the bottow 2/3's of the bread toasted. Also, the unit is large and bulky, it takes up way too much space on the counter for just a 2 slice toaster. The only thing \\"deluxe\\" about it, was the price. Way too much money for such a lousy toaster. I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky, but attractive","review":"I searched a long time for a toaster that DIDN'T look retro. Good golly, I had those when I was a kid! I don't want one now! I wanted different, I wanted stainless steel, and I wanted cool-touch sides. This toaster is a bit larger than I would prefer, but large slices fit better than my old Oster toaster (which has found its new home in the hunting shack). I like the front load, and the easy-to-eject button in the center of the darkness dial if you're impatient. I haven't tried bagels in it yet, but seems like it would be a neat feature for those who eat bagels toasted. This toaster toasts way more quickly than my old one, and is consistent when making the second set of slices the same darkness. The price was decent and shipping was free. Can't beat that!

It's large, rather tall but you wouldn't need to cover up this one. The extra lift handles work well on short bread. The bad news is - I toasted several pieces of Italion short thick bread. One piece always did not toast on one side and was quite white. When I turned up the level from about 3 1/2, it wanted to burn the other side.Looking at the wires, I can see an uneven heat or glo from some. It just doesn't toast well. Looks like the electric wires are not heating the same on both sides. My 10 year old toaster elements were fine but it didn't have the lift handles and I was constantly trying to pick out the toast.

I frequently use that one as well as the lift-the-toast lever so it's easy to take the toast out. Biggest draw back is that the bread toasts a great deal more on the one side of the bread, as if it is always on a bagel setting. This would be very helpful if I only ate bagels, however, I usually toast bread and waffles in it. I've given up taking the toast out and flipping it over so that the other side gets browner. I just deal with one side being a lot less toasted.Also, once in awhile, our toast will fly out and onto the floor. When it starts doing this, I angle it away from the floor so it will land on the counter.I wanted to love this toaster, but I can't but I don't want to break down and buy another that may turn out bad too.

Apparently the thermostat and something else was wrong and not fixable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, uneven heating","review":"After six months, the heating elements would glow on one side and the other side only 20% would glow. This uneven heating caused bread to be toasted more or less on one side. Contacted the distributor through Amazon, but never received a response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good BIG Toaster","review":"Purchased last year and has been very reliable. It toasts bread and bagels quickly and easily. You have to be careful NOT to overdue the toasting until you get used to this model. However, as previously stated by reviewer 'It is enormous'. As far as I am concerned its only downfall is its size. If you have limited counter space keeping it out would be difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Great Toaster","review":"Like many others who have been looking for a toaster that actually toasts, I finally found one. Over the years I've bought toaster after toaster and wasn't pleased with most. This toaster so far seems to be a winner! All breads have been toasting evenly on both sides and no complaints from me. Fast heating elements, easy operation, and attractive in the kitchen, what else do you want? The T-Fal toaster complements the other steel front appliances in the kitchen. This is a large toaster, so make sure you have the counter space. Bottom line; it toasts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted longer than any of our past toasters!","review":"This has been by far the best toaster we've ever had - and we've been through many, from two slicers to toaster ovens. None of the past have ever toasted right.This toaster finally fits the bill. Evenly toasts both sides of the bread. Fits bagels and toasts them on the face side. It has done a great job and we've had it for over a year now. Admittedly it has gotten fiesty on a couple rare occasions and ejected the toast right out of the toaster - much to the dogs delight - but that has only been twice, probably light bread :) I would highly recommend this toaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cadillac of toasters","review":"If there is such a thing as a classy toaster, the T-Fal Avante is it. I grew up in a household where the toaster was always out on the counter, ready for use. After I got married, my wife insisted that our toaster only be in sight when it was being used, otherwise it was stored in the cabinet. On a trip to Montreal a few years later, we saw the T-Fal Avante and bought it. She liked the look of it so much that she agreed to let it sit out on the counter. That toaster lasted about 12 years, and when it would only toast on one side, we decided to get another one. This new model is even more elegant than our first one and toasts better too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted Toaster","review":"The T-fal TT7461002A Avante Deluxe 4-Slice Toaster, Black... Looks great- Makes great toast- Very fast- Very Stylish- Has awesome features- great size- Toast never gets stuck at all ( BECAUSE THE TOAST GOES FLYING OUT EVER TIME UNLESS YOU GET X LARGE BREAD THAT IS DENSE AND HEAVY REAL HEAVY. )I tried a bunch of breads many times, I even turned it around on the counter and put a basket in front to catch the bread that was falling on the floor. But I bought this for my 80 yr old mother, so it was not a good idea. So I returned it. They need to design it so the spring release is slower and not so much force. I say DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ONLY EAT BAGELS OR WHAT TO PLAY OK KIDS LETS CATCH THE TOAST GAME...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my toaster!","review":"This is a well made and well as aesthetically pleasing. Cooks the toast very evenly and fast. This is a great buy for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes!","review":"I bought this toaster after reading the good reviews. It seemed to be one of the most liked toasters. As luck has it, I ended up with one that toasted unevenly --- the toast was very dark on one side and barely toasted on the other. I returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll need some room for this one!","review":"As other reviewers have stated, this is a very large toaster, but it does toast wonderfully making it worth the space it takes up. It does a better job than any I've had so far. The crumb trays are easily removed for clean up, and it is well made. I am very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non toasting toaster","review":"We like both sides of our bread toasted and finding a toaster that does that is not an easy task. I read many reviews and finally settled on the T-Fal. When we took it out of the box I thought we were in trouble...it seemed to be cheaply made..no substance. However, we gave it a chance. We toasted a half of a loaf of bread and not once were both sides of the slice toasted. We tried different settings etc. So we put it back in the box and returned it. The good news..we hadn't thrown our old toaster away and, in addition, Amazon.com was very easy and efficient to deal with on the return. We have moved on to a Cuisinart that is working perfectly for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"good looking, somewhat amusing, but not a good buy","review":"I have to admit that the great styling was the top reason that I selected this toaster. It also has an excellent pop up feature, and the reviews were very good. We had a previous T fal that was very good when it worked, but lost function of one side after 2 years, so I should have been more selective. This toaster is totally uneven in it's browning, and changes so we can't adapt to it's quirky toasting. The most annoying trait is that it will send lighter toast pieces flying in the air, crash landing on our kitchen floor; this is so humorous that we just live with it, especially our kids who think it is a fun feature to go airborne; my son actually caught a piece mid-arc once. We will keep the toaster, but would not recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven Toasting","review":"Sadly, each side of the four slots toasts VERY unevenly. The reason for this is the heating elements haven't been threaded and spaced properly. It's a quality control issue I've come to expect from Chinese products. We'll probably just live with it since I don't expect it to last more than a year or two.The design however is fantastic, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of none. It takes up much space, yes, but it's a show stopper. I get more complements on this thing than my new Subzero. Also glad I followed another reviewer's advice and ordered black instead of white--agree completely.LESSON LEARNED: In the future, I will, no matter how painful, buy European. European manufacturing always leaves me amazed by its quality and indestructibility. This toaster is a beautiful piece of furniture. If only it had been assembled by a Swede."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, works awful","review":"I came to Amazon to actually replace this toaster. When I first got it, no problems. Toast was perfectly done, and the ability to have the toast come up from the toaster coils an additional few inches to make it easy to grab was a nice touch.After using it for 7 months - there are only two adults in the home, no kids, so we use it maybe 2-3 times a week - the cooking is now uneven. Half comes out toast, the other side just warm. I can see the coils on one side glow brigther than the other. Either side only toasts half the bread or you can burn half to get the other side toasted. And the lift function on one side does not work anymore.I remember going online to try and find something NOT made in China, which is where this sorry machine is made like so many. My advice is to steer clear of this toaster and buy something else. Now I need to go back to my research :-)Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted","review":"It was a very nice, stylish toaster while it lasted. Days after the one year warranty expired, the tiny piece of cheap plastic fell into the crumb tray and it was over. I now have a two slice toaster - the plastic catch broke and the side with the defrost and bagel selections will no longer stay down. It was used sparingly and not abused in any way so I'm leary of buying this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"toaster review","review":"I like this toaster ok- bought it to replace a previous model that just conked out. But this new model is a little to bulky and the dials are loose. I have a hard time setting the level of darkness- and the bottom burns while the top of the bread is normal. Seems to have uneven coils along the sides, or else the slant effect causes it. Sometimes the toasts flies out of the slots and onto the floor because of the slant. Kind of weird and probably will not buy another like it ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective!!!","review":"I like that the slots are angled; which works great under my counter. That's the only good thing about it. It didn't matter what setting it was on, it wouldn't toast right. One time I had it on 2 and it barely toasted, the next it burned the toast. Now the toast won't even stay down anymore. I refuse to stand there holding it down; so tothe trash it goes!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$.","review":"I received this toaster as a gift in April of 2007. It is stylish and easy to use, but if the setting is not just right, it will burn toast very easily. It worked ok until today (January 2009) when it just died. Only comes with a 1 year limited warranty, so no hope of getting it replaced. For costing almost $50 I expected it to last longer than under 2 years, even with daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Fal TT7461002 Avante Deluxe 4-Slice Toaster","review":"So far the toaster has functioned as is stated it would. I like the look of it. I'm happy with my purchase. Package came nicely packed and on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it looks nice ...","review":"... but I returned it. Every manufacturer of toasters specify how 'wide' the slots are for toasting bagels, muffins, etc. But, they rarely specify how 'long' the slots are. The first thing I tried was a slice of \\"Levy's Real Jewish Rye\\". It wouldn't fit lengthwise. Failing that basic test, I packed it up and sent it back without trying to toast anything. If I can't fit bread into it, it's simply not worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in USA","review":"The description of this toaster indicates that it is made in the USA.

My Gran's lasted decades. This one didn't. Now it wont stay down and thinks all bread you put in is already toasted. So getting a new one - needless to say it wont be a T-Fal."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty nice except for actually making toast !","review":"The design and construction of this toaster was very nice, as long as you don't actually use it to toast anything. Maybe ours was defective... like many previous reviewers, we found it would toast one corner of the bread very lightly while another corner was burned. The adjustment dials did not seem consistent.. one day #four worked well, another day it had to be turned down to #two. Summary: it looked great and felt well made, had some nice design touches... but didn't toast bread well at all. We returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not long lasting","review":"Perhaps I am expecting too much, as I have had this toaster for about 4 years. I have never been impressed with it's toasting. Only one side does the defrost/bagel option. I did however love what it looked like. The toasting has gotten worse over the years, as in uneven or one side of the toasting slots don't work at all. Now I'm down to one full slot and one half slot. Time for a new toaster, in which I will not be purchasing this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like burnt toast and uneven toasting.","review":"My first mistake was to buy this toaster, the second was to throw out the box and receipt. We had a white Cusinart for years and had no problem, but then we redid our kitchen and got SS appliances so we bought this toaster.It has never toasted anything even, one side will be perfect the other burnt no matter what setting it is on and if you slice your bread thin forget it charcoal city is what you get. It is good looking and has some nice features and is not too big for our kitchen but when it comes to making toast it is a looser.Others say it is great, maybe I just got one that sucks, going to donate it to a charity and get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Toaster Ive Ever Owned","review":"My T-Fal toaster is about 1 year old and unless they have greatly improved them, I suggest you find another brand. It toasted very uneven and usually shot the bread out of it onto the floor. Ita amazing how many times much cheaper small appliances work much better then the high dollar ones. I purchased a lightly used toaster at an auction for $5, looks to be from the 70's and it works perfectly. All four slices are equally toasted and havent chased any around the floor yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, poor quality","review":"I had a tfal toaster before that I liked (unfortunately it got dropped on a tile floor which did it in) so I bought this as a replacement.

This model was purchased in Sept 10 and it lasted until Feb 11 - WOW 6 whole months! Do we really live in such a disposable society? It worked great for 6 months and then one day completely stopped, just dropped dead out of nowhere. Tried taking it apart but no success. Once you get the housing off you can't go any further to see if a wire came undone or something else ridiculous. Very disappointed, feel like I have no options for return either. Is anything built well anymore? I really don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far, so good","review":"Attractive addition to the countertop. It looked big taking it out of the box, but I can't imaging getting a much smaller 4-slice toaster. So far it's doing a good job. The lift function is great for my english muffins, and I have not had anything ejected from the toaster. The only criticizm I have is that the button/dial for toast settings appears to be pretty cheap in comparison with the rest of the toaster, but only time will tell.We haven't had the toaster all that long yet, and it does give off a burning plastic smell initially (which the pamplet does warn), but just follow the instructions and run the toaster on empty the first few times to get rid of the smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toaster, nice appearance","review":"I bought this toaster looking for something that toasted fast and actually popped up the toast when it was supposed to! As for toasting fast, I guess I was expecting miracles because I thought it would toast faster than it does...but it's still better than what I had! And it's very good on the customization factor, being able to choose exactly how dark you want it and popping the toast up when it's supposed to. The \\"toast lift\\" feature is very nice too so you don't have to risk your fingers digging into the toaster to get your food. Overall, a very nice toaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Toaster","review":"We really like this toaster. We have a pantry off the kitchen where the small appliances reside and the design of this toaster works for us.

Also, gets alot of use as we have six kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I like it a lot! Everything you would want in a toaster. Great range of accurate heat settings. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toaster for those who enjoy eating toast off the floor.","review":"I bought this toaster because it had pretty solid reviews and I liked the look of it. I was all excited to make my breakfast toast and popped in a slice of white bread. When it was done, it was a little burned (even though I started it off on 3 as I loathe burnt toast)and, better yet, when the thing popped, it launched my toast right out onto the floor. I proceeded to try the right slot to similar effect. I ended up putting in one of the pieces of toast a 2nd time so that I could film it launching out onto the floor. In the end, I had floor toast and a frightened cat. I will be returning this toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this toaster!","review":"After 2 weeks, one side stopped toasting. It also emits a burning electrical smell. Even when it did work the toast was toasted but not warm. It also takes up a lot of counter space for 2 slices, and it's ugly on the counter with the open slots facing out. I wish I still had the box to send it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Style Poor Quality","review":"I was excited about getting this toaster. Although it is a bit large, the style is great and looks good on my counter but that is about the only positive thing I can say about this toaster. The toaster setting is not constant. If I set it at say \\"3\\" and toast some bread it may turn out perfectly one time and using the same bread the next time it will burn at the same setting. In addition one of the main features the toaster offers was the ability to push the \\"lift\\" lever and see what the toast looked like during the toasting process. The lever did not function at all straight out of the box. One thing seems consistent, toasters at or below the $40 purchase price appear largely to be junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Fast about this Toaster","review":"I bought this toaster because we wanted a 4 slice toaster and it was suppose to toast fast.Well, forget that! It takes longer than our old 2 slice toaster. Even if you only put 2slices in, it is still slow. There is also uneven toasting. It is however great for bagels.Even frozen bagels toast well. But you can only toast 1 bagel at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"China Quality","review":"I did not buy this through amazon rather Sam's club. 2 weeks later one side would stick and burn, 3 weeks later the auto stop button on same side stopped working.

Well, it looks nice, but it does not toast a whole slice of bread -- only about 2/3 gets toasted, plus when toasting smaller pieces of bread, they fly out of the toaster and land somewhere on the counter when they are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so fast...","review":"I like many are still looking for the perfect toaster. I don't find this toaster to be any faster than any other toaster I've owned. The heating is uneven because the heating wire touches the mounting surface in some places and not in others so some parts glow red and others do not. The slot size is about a quarter inch shorter than some other units so full size, store bought sandwich bread doesn't really fit all that well. After several months one of the toast raise levers flew off and landed in the heating mechanism and partially melted. I'd have to send back the whole toaster to get it repaired... customer service was tedious. The angled forward slots are really no advantage in fact you just end up looking at crumbs. I'd look elseware for a quality toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven heating - defective","review":"I received the toaster very swiftly. I am okay with the way it looks also. However, it would burn half and not toast the other half of a piece of bread even at the lower settings which makes it un-usable. The return policy was very short and I missed the deadline. So now i have to send it to the manufacturer. But at this point, i would like to just get a refund. I don't want the hassle of getting it repaired. I would like my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best toaster I've ever used","review":"I've had lots of toasters over the years. This one, quite simply, is the best I've ever used. Bagels, English muffins, bread, PopTarts, whatever. It does a beautiful job toasting, getting the hot items out of the toaster is easy and SAFE, and the angle at which the toast comes out of the machine is very convenient. A great machine at a great price. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good......but","review":"I recently purchased this toaster from Amazon. It has all the basc features I need and does not require any reprogramming after power failures. Instead, there are push buttons for reheat and bagel modes. It toasts quickly and evenly, so to speak. Although each side of the bread gets nicely toasted, one side is significantly darker than the other. For example, I get lightly toasted bread on one side, and the other is medium. That is not a problem for me and my wife, but could be for fussy cooks/eaters. The other thing I want to point out is that this toaster has a large footprint compared to a lot of the others on the market. If you have limited counter space, this could be a Problem. I wish it had a button so I could set it to activate only one slot when I am toasting one slice of bread. It would be an energy saver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built well, but does a poor job toasting","review":"This unit is big but well built. The controls are easy to use and a pushbutton pops up the toast at any time. It even has separate handles that raise the toast to view it. However when it comes to toasting it fails miserably.If you have it set to brown the bread in the center it burns it on top. Set it to brown on top and it will be white in the middle. We went through a whole loaf of bread trying to fine tune it but finally gave up.I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toast","review":"I started using this the day I received it.

I recommend to the manufacturer that this area be built up with extra and stronger plastic or simply make the entire product stronger. In time, with normal use they will break.

However, they have ignored a serious mechanical weakness in the headset construction. I have owned 2-3 of these devices and twice now one of the arms on the headset has broken. Last time I bought a new one because their warranty/replacement/repair service is as bad as it can be. If it breaks, don't bother. Just buy a new one. The disgusting part of all this is the fact that the mechanical weakness could be obviated with a simple tweak at the factory, which the Chinese engineers would be more than happy to accommodate. They need to have installed a stress relief at the point of juncture of the arm and the base. It would be that simple. They could even charge another $5 for a 5-cent fix. So, it will probably work well for you for a year or so, but be prepared to junk it and buy a replacement soon thereafter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"Nice unit helped a lot with my father watching TV on the top of sound level, but biggest problem is - it lasted less than 5 months.

Most TV earphone sets are too cumbersome. They mess up my mother's hair and cause her cheekbones to ache. We are going to try the Sennheiser IS410 system which has gotten better reviews and does not cost much more. If you watch TV a lot and want a wireless system that works do not buy this one.

Obviously, these folks make their money on replacement parts and shipping and handling fees.Look at the Sennheiser.

The answer was not to try to re-create \\"Surfer Rosa\\" or \\"Dolittle\\", but rather push their talents into another arena - arena rock, actually.And it fits. No, \\"Trompe Le Monde\\" is hardly as innovative as their first three breakthroughs, but it's nearly as fun. Rather than twisting their tunes, they burst them with a relentless sonic energy. It may be considered over-produced, but it's to their advantage most of the time. There is a lot going on in these seemingly simple rock tunes.Personal favorites: \\"Trompe le Monde\\", \\"Head On\\" (Jesus and the Mary Chain cover that's kind of better than the original due to Black's awesome voice), \\"Palace of the Brine\\", \\"Letter to Memphis\\", and \\"Motorway to Roswell\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album by my favorite band","review":"Everyone likes Come on Pilgrim or Doolittle the best but in my mind, Trompe le Monde is the greatest Pixies album EVER (which is saying a lot). I cherish every piece of music the Pixies ever made (and was absolutely thrilled to see them reunited on their new tour) but this album has a coherency the other albums lack. It may not be as gritty as the band's earlier work but it is technically superior and illustrates their musical maturation. Their version of Head On rocks (I used it in my wedding ceremony) and Subbacultcha is arguably the best song they ever made. Buy this album if you don't have it - it's a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"If not their greatest, certainly close to it","review":"Along with \\"Doolittle,\\" Trompe holds up as the best top to bottom Pixies album. Not one weak song and some of their greatest like \\"Letter to Memphis,\\" \\"Palace of the Brine\\" and \\"Motorway to Roswell.\\" So Kim Deal does not play a major role on the album, who cares? The Pixies always were Joey Santiago and Frank Black. An addictive album that will have you listening to it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jefrey, with one f Jeffry!!","review":"Yes!!! This is by far the Pixies at THEIR BEST. I can't describe how great this cd is, I just bought it yesterday and am listening to it right now!! Some say that this cd is hard to get into? Perhaps, but only if you expect another Surfer Rosa (which frankly, one is enough thank you) The incredible beauty of it, the complexity, and the emotion are mind blowing. Sure, their older cds had a lot of screaming, unfiltered emotion too, but this album seems a lot more mature to me. Some might knock it too because Kim Deal's voice is pretty much gone, but just listen close, and you'll find it still highlights the best of the songs. Which all of them are..well except maybe the Sad Punk (doesn't do much for me personally). My favourite songs are: Trompe le Monde, Alec Eiffel, Palace of the Brine (about sea monkeys! whoo), Letter to Memphis, Space (I believe in) and Motorway to Roswell. Go get off your seat and buy this now! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm the only one again?","review":"i love doolittle surfer rose and come on pilgrim bossanova is an good album but not as great as the two mentioned but this my friends is appalling god could they make much more un-inspired noise i kno that's the trait of the pixies but for gods sake just a few guitars being plucked badly and frank black screeching with his balls in his throat god...no thanks there is one song i like plant of sound great riff the only great songall the rest are noiseget the albums mentioned above then a frank black solo album before this good point"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pixies album","review":"This album was a huge dissappointment. I saw the Pixies in concert three times and the last tour was as dissapointing as this album. After the brilliant Bossanova a good follow-up was obviously beyond their reach.

I know I started late (1996). The first cd I purchased was \\"Doolittle\\" and I was completely blown away. The Pixies quickly became a favorite and I bought all of their releases.Trompe De Monde, is definitley one of the best releases. Catchy tunes and great riffs -- a must for any Pixies fan. If you want to listen to some of their BEST stuff! They even have a great cover of Jesus and Mary Chain's \\"Head On\\", and \\"Alec Eiffel\\" will have you singing in the shower! While \\"U-Mass\\" has a groove that will keep you rockin, catchy melody and lyrics. \\"Letter to Memphis\\" is another classic song, so many of these songs will get stuck in your head!And nothing beats Kim Deal's backing vocals on \\"Palace of the Brine\\" she sounds so good with Frank Black's singing.Just an amazing album for an amazing band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last milestone of an ingenouis band","review":"This is the last release of the Pixies. It is well worth having. Very sporatic and random and you don't know what will catch you next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad To See The Pixies Go....","review":"Trompe Le Monde is the Pixies' final effort. While it can't compare to Doolittle or Surfer Rosa, Trompe Le Monde is still excellent. It's more conventional than their other work, but it's got the loud, wierd sound the Pixies are known for. And compared to lots of other music out there, it's still very unconventional. I don't see why this album gets some criticism. It works; I don't know how, it just does. Even though Kim Deal doesn't lend her vocals too much, the album still feels like a Pixies album. \\"Alec Eiffel\\" will play in your head for days and don't be surprised if you start singing it over and over. \\"Planet Of Sound\\" and \\"Sad Punk\\" might be the hardest the Pixies' have ever gotten. \\"Letter To Memphis\\" and \\"Motorway To Roswell\\" are two other favorites of mine from this album while the cover of \\"Head On\\" is classic. Ignore the bickering and judge for yourself. In my opinion, Trompe Le Monde is a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aka 'A Fool and His Money'... not one of the best.","review":"A well-worn story about a marketing executive who starts a phoney religion only to discover that bilking people out of their money isn't worth the loss of his morals and his love.

Kane is a far better example of the \\"anti-hero\\" than Michael Moorcocks Elric that there really isn't any comparison. This particular book has 3 fantastic stories, and though I agree with the prior reviewers that the 2nd is probably the best, I also rate the 1st and 3rd among my all time favorite fantasy short stories.

I was sick of seeing my wife drag the hose across our hardwood floors and seeing damage on our moldings. The unit shipped was a dark forest green, nearly black which I was ok with because it won't show dirt anytime soon. I installed the unit in all of about 90 seconds since it just zips on or unzips off. I would not buy a unit that wasn't zippered since I would have to wrestle with the hose to get it all the way on or off.There were some loose threads that I snipped but overall the quality is fine for what this product is.

If you know how to do Sun Salutations you may want to choose a more advanced DVD. One other reviewer mentioned that she was annoyed by Nicki Doane's voice.

I don't know where Keith Sweat's head was at. It doesn't keep your attention on the second half. Keep it Comin' was okay, but the other songs Keith produced as well as Joe Public were lousy. He was smart to include There You Go from New Jack City, but the songs before and after it are so bland, It seemed like the formula that worked for Keith Sweat's first two albums didn't work here. I fell to sleep while hearing the album's second half--how can anyone create such dull songs on here? Sweat's trademark whining just does not blend with these songs. If he had wanted to, he would have given these songs to Usher instead of singing them himself--they'd be better under him(Usher).

Yes, there is an attempt at a message of 'teamwork', but it's pounded in with a sledgehammer against it's will as the characters constantly try to one-up and insult each other before deciding, nonsensically, \\"Oh yes, let's work together.\\"Like so much of the modern Hollywood children's fare, this movie is constantly choking on it's own wit as it makes fun (rudely) of the 'children's classic' genre even as it tries to become one.Suffice to say, if you're a 45-y-o adult child with a room full of Star Wars and Disney collectibles, you'll love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but...","review":"There was so much potential for this.

Awful.","review":"I was shocked to read the many wonderful reviews here. Being a fan of most things Disney, I picked this one up locally a few months ago. Me and my preteen daughter sat down to watch it, and gave up before ever finishing viewing it. The script is dull. The songs, while based on 'classic' melodies, are amateurish. (What happened to all the wonderful songs that graced the 1990's Disney films?) Even the characters voices bear no resemblence to the ones we are familiar with. (Yes, I'm aware that the actors doing the voices during the 30's through 50's have long since died. But surely a company with the funds Disney has could find voice talent that could do at least a passable facsimile.Disney should be ashamed of putting their name on this yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I wanted to like this, but it just doesn't hold up to the classic Disney shorts.

The plotline is about how Peg-leg Pete is trying to kidnap Princess Minnie and claim the throne for himself, with the help of the Beagle Boys. The Musketeers must come to the rescue!The most surprising things is the quality of the animation. While not on a par with 30's and 40's classics, it's still better than what Disney did in the 60's and 70's with a depth and perspective that really shines.The Extras are nice with the actual characters doing the commentary about their roles, and a good making of feature.

Their supposed take on the HUMAN Three Musketeers done in the late 80s, with the \\"Young Guns\\" cast, was such a corruption of the basic story it wasn't funny. Not only is THIS version not a version of the original story, but the characterization is all wrong. Fiery tempered Donald is cast as a coward, not Mickey, the mouse....the biggest scaredy cats in the animal kingdom....and BLACK PETE gets the Cardinal Richelieu role, And you'd think that Disney, one of the legendary meccas of animation, would produce something truly impressive based on the Dumas classic, but NOOOO.....Fool me once, Disney, shame on you, fool me twice....??

THere are multiple notes and markings throughout the book, and the paper is worn and in bad condition.It's as if it was left out on the back porch for about a year and then brought inside and mailed to me.Not good.

At All.","review":"In D.Baldacci's Camel Club books, he creates believable characters. He also creates believable scenes. In The Winner, neither is true. First, it seems that Part One was written as a short story or novelette. He could have ended there nicely. Unfortunately, he didn't, and the beginning of Part Two has the main character, LuAnn, making a decision that--given her independent spirit, not having a good childhood, and love of her little girl--never would have done. All of the characters are cardboard and unbelievable. The story line is contrived. Then there is the constant use of the words, \\"...eyes bored into...\\" And the worst phase--\\"...her breasts quivered.\\" Breasts quivering?! Come on, David, that's for the newbie writers!Yes, it's a page turner, and that's why I give it two stars. Something is always going on, and you'll read it to see if your guesses are right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"Most of the David Baldacci books that I have read have kept me very interested all the way too the end.

This book was great from start to finish. The characters were very believable, and the plot was pretty fun to read. I really liked the twist and turns towards the end of the book with adding in Riggs and the shady realtor towards the middle. I orginally thought the book was going to turn out one way, but wound up being surprised at how it ended. The action's also very well written. This book is great get away and enjoy yourself book.

With a predictable storyline and shallow unbelievable characters, The Winner would have you believe that someone could fix a national lottery only to have someone else claim the prize. The entire F.B.I. is unable to solve any aspect of the case but a newspaper reporter acting alone solves it 10 years after the fact in a month or two. The only reason ther is a book at all is because the main character (LuAnne)decides that even with 100 million dollars, she must return to the United States from overseas to live in the town where mother was born. While I understand you must suspend belief for this type of fiction, Baldacci asked too much of me this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci is a great author, but this one didnt sum up","review":"LuAnne Tyler is a trailor trash woman, who wins, wouldnt you guess it, 100 million dollars. Amazing isnt it? Not really.

The premise was good and the character of Jackson was fascinating (though absurd), but the storyline became so hackneyed and cliched that I almost quit reading the book.

All the characters are painted in flat, superhero (or villain) primary colors. The protagonist, LuAnn Tyler is a drop dead gorgeous woman who is physically stronger than any of the men in the novel, tougher than any of the men, and is as smart as any of the good guys there. The villain, Jackson is brilliant, immensely rich, all-powerful, all knowing, and is skilled in all the ways on how to kill a person. The other characters go down from there. The novel's plot line and the dilemma created from the plot are simplistic. Needless to say, I do not recommend buying/reading this book. The reading experience is akin to watching TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is on the Bestseller list?????","review":"I would have given this book great reviews if someone had told me it was written by an eighth-grade adolescent. I purchased this book before getting on an airplane and found myself so bored, I began reading the emergency card in the back of the seat to stay awake! The plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese. One man controlling billions of dollars, yet has enough time to work a job at the company that cleans the balls for the lottery machine, appear at different locations throughout the world on a moment's notice, and is able to control covert political operations in third world countries.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful web of financial deception!","review":"As a first time Baldacci reader, what struck me most about \\"The Winner\\" was the intricacy and detail of a grand financial scheme.

I can just see this as a blockbuster movie starring Bridget Fonda as LuAnn, the trailer-trash turned sophisticated, savvy globe-trotter who performs like Wonder Woman when cornered by the bad guys. Some of her dialogue feels more male than female, but the over-all effect of the story is truly engrossing. Cliches?, yes. But a fast, FUN read.

And you'll definitely enjoy this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Winner is a worthy successor to Absolute Power","review":"Absolute Power was an enjoyable quick read and much better than the movie. Total Control was a relative disappointment and I passed by Baldacci's \\"latest\\" for a few weeks as a result. That was my loss. The Winner is a most enjoyable quick read and, properly handled by \\"Hollywood\\", will gross more than Absolute Power. The antagonist is loosely but effectively borrowed from \\"The Usual Suspects\\". Kevin Spacey, call your agent. \\"Mr. Jackson\\" is every bit as able and evil as Kaiser Soze (sp?), but more believable. The protagonist is superwoman: so attractive, so troubled, so good, so intelligent, so athletic, so motherly, so decent, so... So what if she is absolutely unbelievable. The suspension of disbelief has always been required by all fiction media, don't deny Baldacci his LuAnn any more than you would deny Fleming his Bond or Clancy his Ryan. Bottom line: a very good, very quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable characters, well-paced, fascinating premise","review":"\\"The Winner,\\" was a well-paced and intricately developed book with sympathetic protagonists and credible antagonists. It compares favorably to some of the better fiction of J. Kellerman, and does not quite hit the pinnacle of Baldacci's earlier novel, Absolute Power, but far exceeds his last novel, Total Control. Some books take two weeks to read - The Winner is of the two-day variety; a page-turner. Personally, I enjoy plot twists late in the story, and Baldacci does not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Loser!!","review":"I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power. David, what happened???? The story is very fascinating but the characters were not. I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person. But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable. He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand. There were just too many up and downs for me. I am sure the next book will be back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and tedious but I read it anyway","review":"This was my first Balducci book. Had to read it so as not to disappoint my daughter who gave it to me for Christmas. As compared to Clancy, Forsyth, Follett, Grisham, Ludlum and others, well what can I say? If the \\"The Winner\\" is typical work from this author, then perhaps he should take more lessons from the established mystery writers. There was not one 'Jackson' character that I didn't pick up on immediately. Didn't anybody tell this guy that revolvers don't have safeties on them or that shotguns don't shoot bullets or that hiding a .44 magnum in a jacket pocket is about as realistic as hiding a gallon of milk in one? Predictable and tedious, but I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone actually ENJOY the voice of Frances Cassidy?","review":"This book (Baldacci's part) is fine - but OMG I cannot stand Frances Cassidy's narration style!!! She CAN vary her tonal quality, I've heard her do it. But for the most part she uses a PAINFULLY monotone voice. Arrrgh! It is SO hard to listen to - and for 14 cd's! I wish someone at Books On Tape would direct her differently. I really want to hear this book, but I feel like I outta be paid to put up with Cassidy.Recently I heard a story about audiobooks on NPR. They gave an example of a book you should not listen to while driving because the voice would lull you to sleep. I'm pretty sure the reader was Frances Cassidy.I'm sure she is a fine human being...yadda yadda. I just wish she would do her job differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the most part, very good :)","review":"i liked the story line a lot, the only thing i did not like was that the author -repeatedly- had to say what a perfect body the main character had. lol. i mean after the sixth time.. we got it! lol.. definitely a guy and definitely fantasizing when he wrote it i'm guessing.. perfectly toned, perfect everywhere else. good, now move on! :)other than that, i really liked the description of what the \\"bad guy\\" mechanisms were. too bad i can't use those kinds of disguises in real life. very interesting :)i'd still recommend the book :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"The Winner is my first David Baldacci book, and was I ever impressed! I normally read 2 to 3 books a week, and I must say this was one of the most riveting reads I've encountered in some time. The action is nonstop; there's absolutely no part of the book one could find boring. The plot is clever and unique, and the characterization is excellent. Add to this a very satisfying ending, and you have a true winner...maybe that's why the author chose The Winner as his book title! I'd enjoy hearing any recommendations from other readers who loved this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous!","review":"This book was one of the best suspense novels i've read in a LOOONG time. I personally want to pat the author on the back if i ever had the chance. THe character \\"Jackson\\" was so unbelievably cold and remarkably intelligent, you almost want to be him, despite the fact that he's the villain! Or at least I did. And a book about money...earning money, the way people do things or manipulate people to gain more money, etc. It was a flawless, edge-of your-seat novel to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting, if not overly believable","review":"heard the taped version and found it enjoyable . . . book certainly kept my attention, though i felt it \\"fell apart\\" a bit at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"While it is true that the characters in this book were not developed as well as they could have been, The Winner was still an excellent read that kept me up late at night to see what would happen next. The action was thrilling and the plot fun to ponder. I would certainly recommend this book to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, Terrrible execution","review":"I thought that this was a good concept, but the writing was sub-par, at best. The characters were one-dimensional and the dialogue was stilted. I wish this concept had been handled by a better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Winner Here","review":"I just finished reading my first David Baldacci novel, and I wasn't very impressed. The plot was very contrived, and the whole time I was reading the book I felt like I was two steps ahead of what was going on. Although Baldacci set up the story pretty well,after page 50 I felt like he lost his inspiration and mailed in the rest of the novel. I hope that his reputation as an excellent writer of thrillers wasn't based on the garbage I just finished reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine work by Baldacci","review":"An imaginative plot buoyed by great character development.

HOPE DAVID BALDACCI COMES OUT WITH A PART II TO THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adrienne's Review","review":"I wasn't thoroughly pleased with the audiobook, \\"The Winner\\". It didn't seem to grab my attention as much as David Baldacci's previous books. The main character, LuAnn Tyler, grabbed the reader's sympathy but the plot lacked suspenseful action and seemed at times, predictable. I gave it 2 stars because the story only faintly held my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAS DEFINITELY A WINNER!!","review":"The Winner started off a bit slowly, but picked up after the first couple of chapters. After chapter 2 it started to get more interesting and I couldn't put it down after that. To read this book you must have a great imagination and a good sense of humor. It made for excellent company."},{"rating":"2","title":"everybody has this wish","review":"Gets one thinking..........what would I do? Very cleaver plot. One where you shout at the book....Dont be so stupid.One point. Is it an unwritten law not to have dead heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth buying","review":"Baldacci gives us some wonderful characters, gets inside their heads and makes the most improbable scenarios sound believable. Even the bad guy had some redeeming features and left me kind of wishing he could have just got away with it and everyone would be happy. But no, somehow, someone got onto the scam and a new game was afoot. Thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The winner","review":"Very exciting well written book. Rather drawn out more than necessary. Suspense throughout. Keeps the reader on edge. Not transparent as some I've read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Predictable","review":"Book was Ok, but not up to Baldacci mystery standards as far as I'm concerned. Atill feel his book about the president (can't recall the name) has been his best. This one a bit far-fetched.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"Winner\\" from Baldacci","review":"While this one start a little sluggish, it picks up speed and never loses momentum. Lots of action and we'll-developed characters in this one. Easily one of Baldacci' s best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Winner","review":"The winner was a very enjoyable read that kept you turning the pages .

I was very surprised with all the excellent reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you reading til the end","review":"Kept me reading til the end. The protagonist in this book is easy to identify with, the man she falls for is also. Had to keep reading til the end, a sure fire page turner. Not at all an impossible scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Put Down? Try \\"hard to pick up\\".","review":"Boring! Boring! Boring! I wanted to give this zero stars, but the system wouldn't let me. David Baldacci's works since \\"Absolute Power\\" have followed the same pattern -- too much characterization thrown into the front half of the story, unbelievable characters who are too large for life, and a villian who is more silly than sinister. I kept envisioning LuAnn (the heroine) as a man high on steroids. I couldn't put down \\"Absolute Power\\"; I could only read two pages of this one at a time before I fell asleep. Big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"can I give a negative number?","review":"I was so completely bored by this novel. If it had been my book, I wouldn't have even finished it. However, a friend loaned it to me and I wanted to give it back by the next time I saw her. Cut maybe 200 pages and it might have held my interest. I cared nothing about the characters. I had just finished \\"Lucky You\\" by Carl Hiaasen whose main character had also won the Lottery. Oh, such a more interesting read. Baldacci needs to learn that more is not better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junior High prose style- middle schoolers will love it.","review":"I wasn't expecting P. D. James, but I was hoping for a good read. I had seen the author interviewed on television and he seemed to be reasonably literate. But this thing is juvenile beyond belief. I might have \\"bought\\" the preposterous story line (even the part about the young mother with super-human strength and the baby which required no care) had I not been so distracted by the prose style (or lack thereof) and the poor, (abysmal describes it better) grammar. I could hardly keep my mind on the plot thread. The prose is equivalent to that one might expect of a seventh grader. I thought this man had been to college and law school. This guy makes Grisham look like potential Nobel laureate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci never met a cliche he didn't use to death.","review":"Yawn. An interesting premise is beaten into a coma by an endless stream of cliched writing, \\"fight\\" scenes pulled straight from a sub-par episode of \\"Xena: Warrior Princess\\" and a super-villian who would make Keyser Soze look like a purse snatcher. Unbelievable, two-dimensional, predictable and boring. Plus, Baldacci's voluminous, sexist descriptions (there are dozens of them strewn throughout the book) of the main heroine's body would be offensive if they weren't so outrageously overblown (and I'm a guy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Winner, the Book in bad shape","review":"the book was yellow it was so old and one of the pages torn. If I had known the shape it was in, I would not have ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, you never know---","review":"Baldacci is a 10 on story ideas but a 5 on writing style. The Winner is certainly not a \\"great read\\" but it is good entertainment. I never have seen such a range of reviews as this book has received---from 1 to 10 ! I can appreciate the disappointment of those that gave the lowest marks. Their expectations were high and the reality of the text was a crushing blow to their hopes. But Baldacci is really no worse than most of the \\"blockbuster\\" writers of today. You know who they are. This kind of stuff is good for the beach, the long airplane ride, and the ultimate movie rendition. Now that we know, we can accept Baldacci for what he offers----memorable plots and plodding exposition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read a particularly bad review, \\"comic book characters\\", but choose not to believe it- a bad mistake! This does read like the script for a bad \\"action movie\\", I thought Sandra Bullock but maybe Demi Moore. My advice wait for the movie or at least paper back - compared with Mr. Baldacci's previous two books this is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing thriller.","review":"It's the kind of book that makes you wonder if reading really is better than watching television. The heroine is a super hero who you know right from the beginning cant lose. All that was missing was the heading \\"Soon to be a movie starring Demi Moore\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at the begining, but picks up eventually","review":"It was O.K. The first 200 pages were interesting but lacked the suspense of Baldacci's others. However, it did eventually pick up, and the last 250 pages were VERY good. Overall, it is worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Winner by David Baldacci","review":"Excellent book! A must read. One of Baldacci's best in my opinion and I've read many by him. Many plot twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldacci delivers","review":"This was my first Baldacci book and I'm sure I'll read more by this gifted writer. Lead character LuAnn Tyler, a trailer park mom who suddenly wins a \\"fixed\\" 100 million dollar lottery, was so real and human you had to cheer for her, even when she did something stupid, you hoped it would work out. She meets Charlie, and together they make the rest of the story suspenseful as they battle wits with the ruthless Jackson, the evil lottery bad-guy.The ending could have been better, but the total sum for this reader was a good read, and a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is the first Baldacci book I've read. Was recommended by a neighbour of mine. The book is about a destute mother of an 8 month old in Georgia, named Louann. She lives in a trailer with the alcoholic and drug addicted father of her child. She works full-time at a truck stop diner and has dreams of a better life for her and her child. Then one day, an elusive master of disguise named Jackson calls her and offers her a job. $100 a day for two weeks, just giving her opinon on events, fashion, etc,. When she turns up at a local mall to meet with Jackson, she receives an offer that she cannot resist; winning the national lottery. She accepts and finds that there is a catch; she must leave the country and never return.This book was very well done, especially for a novelist novice. There are a few gripes, however. The ten year gap. The weak character development on most characters. Otherwise, not very pretentious, very descriptive without dragging on--a well written thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Predictable\\" suspense thriller","review":"Aside from the the villian dressing up (and cross dressing), this was a tried and tested and tired story line - beautiful and feisty heroine, hunky hero with a shady past (that just happens conveniently to be in the FBI) and crafty crimminal who is too clever for his own good (much like the master crimminals in the James Bond series). The overall idea of rigging a lottery is a good one for a thriller but the story line and the relationships and histories of the characters were so contrived and convenient that it made for predictable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Cant get it yet","review":"I have the same problem with this mag subscripcion im not sure when i can get this purshase.Please let me know and help me to know when i an get it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meeting Jesus in the New Testament","review":"This is the second Doorway Series discussion book we have used at our church and participants have found it very helpful, offering them an open-ended guide to exploration and discussion of the various names we have for Jesus. This is not a straight Bible study in the sense of offering an intellectual approach, but rather a relational study allowing people to connect the Bible to their personal lives. Some people are not ready for this kind of study and have opted out after attending a session or looking through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This is a truely great romantic comedy. Heartfelt and funny. I highly recommend this movie for both men and women.

However, I had seen Bridesmaids (which was ok) and really liked the cast line-up. The movie turned out great! As a light-hearted comedy with deep moments of angst and revelations on relationships/family, FWK was both hilarious and touching.

It certainly puts into perspective what having children does to relationships. The acting was excellent and I would recommend this movie.

I loved the actors but expected it to be funnier. It was a different twist on growing up and having kids. It seemed more real.

The final scene wasn't exactly the storybook ending either which made this a special movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Awkward, depressing and not funny at all. Pretty much a horribly edited, poorly acted mess. I was really hoping for a redeeming ending and made myself finish it but I got nothing. Story was totally predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird movie - definitely a chick flick","review":"Made my poor husband watch it because I thought it was a normal, comedy type movie - and while it started as such and definitely had some funny scenes, it quickly became a major cheesy chick flick. Although, it was very realistic vs a fairy tale type story (although its still a happy-ish ending at the end).So yeah - if you have the time and are bored out of your mind, go ahead. If you have other stuff to do, skip right over this because you will want to slap yourself if you watch this instead of getting other stuff done. lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Just a bad movie.

Love is so much more than sex. But not in this movie. I wish we had not kept watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled.","review":"No matter how much they try to fool you, this is NOT an ensemble comedy. The film focuses entirely on the awful Jennifer Westfeildt, who can hardly even move her face at this point. Besides Adam Scott (who is great), the talents of Rudolph, Wiig, Hamm & co are all shoved into about ten minutes of screen time - IF THAT. The movie is not funny, overly long, and doesn't make much sense.Unlike what they want you to believe, this is nothing like Bridesmaids or Knocked Up. Or any other good movie for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than a 1 star","review":"This was a terrible and stupid movie. Don't waste your money on it.

However, i couldn't finish this one because it was painful and terrible in every way. Just a group of unpleasant people constantly screaming things that are meant to be a \\"shocking\\" kind of funny but it's just awkward and uncomfortable. A lot of times I enjoy some inappropriate humor and most comedies I enjoy are probably more rude and crude than others but this was just stupid and after about ten minutes became very predictable in what they were going to \\"joke\\" about next.As said before,I was really excited but I had to shut this one off."},{"rating":"2","title":"crude maybe?","review":"Funny but at times a little crude and it did not need to be.

I can't understand it. Perhapds a combination of bad script, bad directing, and probably bad producers too. This movie had a few chuckle moments, but mostly it was boring and a bit tiresome. Don't expect anything as nearly as funny as \\"Bridesmaids\\" in which 4 of the same actors starred and performed wonderfully. To top it off, this movie has such overt liberal left, anti-God, anti-religion overtones, it made the movie feel like a soapbox film instead of an enjoyable funny movie that it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty, insightful entry in the romantic comedy genre!","review":"This is such a charming film. Jennifer Westfeldt and Adam Scott are terrific and have great chemistry. I have loved Westfeldt since \\"Kissing Jessica Stein\\" and she hasn't let me down yet. All three of her films (the other being \\"Ira & Abby\\") have been very pleasant, witty and insightful entries in the romantic comedy genre. She has a real warmth about her. The supporting cast here is fun too but this is Westfeldt and Scott's movie all the way. One of my favorites so far this year. I cannot wait for her next film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"It appeared to have a pretty good storyline, but the acting was atrocious.

Also in my opinion, Jennifer Westfelt is not funny at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Boring With Kids","review":"This movie sucks. Surely, even people with kids have interesting conversations. The pace of the movie is to fall asleep to. The most exciting moment was when I hit the off button on my remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a comedy","review":"I would really love to know why a movie that is in fact a drama would advertise itself as a comedy? The moviegoer, in this case, me, settles in to expect to laugh, especially with the cast of Friends with Kids but instead waits......and waits......and waits for the funny. The funny never comes. So the viewer gets disappointed and ends up thinking it's going to end up on her \\"most hated movies\\" list when really if they would have advertised it as a drama she would have approached it as such and could have made her determination based on the movie being serious....but, nooooooooo, she just gets to watch a really unfunny comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"I thought this might be a fun movie about the changes people go through when they become parents. It was funny from time to time, and did show how parenting wears on people, but the part that sticks with me is what a bunch of self absorbed jerks the characters are. That and what must be one of _the_ stupidest romantic exchanges in cinematic history: \\"I'm gonna f___ the sh__ out of you\\"... \\"OK f___ the sh__ out of me\\". This is what you say to someone you just realized is your soul mate? This might be where I got too old and out of touch to understand popular culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, Really bad movie.","review":"This movie was terrible. It has a stupd plot. The language was terrible.

Cheesy dialogue. Trite.","review":"Wow. Appalling. Why did so many good actors sign up to do this movie? Couldn't watch more than 30 minutes. The dialogue was weak and predictable.

It had some funny spots but overall it was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I think about it, the less I like it.","review":"Had I written this review right after viewing the film, I probably would have given it three stars, but as the days have passed, I'm realizing how little I liked this movie. \\"Friends With Kids\\" has what seems to be a cast of comedy all-stars, but I was disappointed to find that the majority of those people are barely in the movie at all. Instead, it's basically the female lead/writer/director trying way too hard in every aspect, being a horrible actress, and Adam Scott being an unlikable jerk. In fact, nobody in this movie is likable. It became painfully obvious about halfway through that the only reason this film was made is because Jennifer Westfeldt is riding on the coattails of her partner, Jon Hamm, and was likely able to get this film made due to his success. I took nothing away from this film aside from wanting my 108 minutes back, which was quite disappointing because I really thought I'd enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megan Fox is the highlight. Yes, it's that bad.","review":"One of the worst movies I have seen. Not the worst, but one of the worst.It was neither funny nor dramatic. There was no chemistry between the characters (actors). It's bad when you decide to keep watching just to see when Megan Fox will show up. It's worse when she finally shows up and acts more natural than the main stars! The supporting cast was much better than the stars but their smaller parts still couldn't save this film.Save yourself the time and watch something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"I rate movies on the following scale:- I'd pay to watch it twice in the theater- I'd watch it again if it were on TV- I'd turn the channelThis movie was cute and had some good laughs.

The ending made me want to vomit all over myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This movie was a complete disappointment. I was ready to turn it off after the first 10 minutes, but having paid for it; I watched it and continued to hope it would get better.It didn't.The concept is cute, but that's about the only positive thing I would say about this film.I would not recommend it to any one, at all, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it, but...","review":"I was so disappointed with this movie. I love the cast, but this movie made me hate most of them. It was very much a stereotype of married people with kids. The couples that hate each other and only yell and nit pick. You could tell about half way through the movie you were supposed to be rooting for the two main characters, but the father character was such a d-bag that I could not root for him. Very disappointed with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Dimensional Characters, Dialogue is Not Believable","review":"The dialogue in this film between the two leads was annoying and not believable.

This movie could have been good if the language used would have been more real, ...unless the average person in New York really has such bad and degrading language, which I doubt.The way the characters speak sounds more appropriate for clubbing teenagers than real adults.I guess the female author tried to appeal to the male audience with this movie as well instead of creating \\"just a chick-flick\\", a try that went badly wrong in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong language","review":"Okay movie but slightly overdone, particularly the use of strong language.

Scott is entirely unbelievable as a womanizer.

Well, it reeks. Never mind that the \\"ensemble\\" is great - every moment that you spend in cerebral torture watching this movie reminds you that Jennifer Westfeldt is just trying to prove that she is good at something else other than regularly sleeping with Jon Hamm.

Sadly, it was not worth four dollars to stream."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this is Comedy?","review":"This is not a comedy. Do friends really talk so nasty?

I have two breatuful daughters and a lovely wife. We have had our beautiful daughters and many tough time that the movie failed to relate to on so many levels. The ending dailog was the worst. If I had been asked to write the lines I could have saved it but the lines were put to film. Is there something less than one star. The one was only for trying.

Not exaggerating - broke into a lot of really tiny pieces. I still don't know if I've found all of it. What a waste of money. Any normal flashlight would have been fine. This thing is a fad.

This light must be shaken a long time. If u want a sore shoulder, then u won't mind. Even when shaken it gives a small beam of light and fades quickly. We were trying to plug in a new DVD recorder and the light was so tiny we could not find the connections and it kept fading out. It also is magnetized so anything in the drawer clamps to it. We will keep it out and we all shake it when we pass it to be sure it will provide some light when we need it. This was advertized on TV so that should have sent up a red flag.

Unfortunately, only one of them worked for a week or so and then it won't work.

What I got was 6 minutes 45 seconds of light which consisted or 3 minutes of good light followed by the rest consisting of dim night light. I repeated this experiment 10 times, each time getting similar results. After that I shook for 2 minutes and lasted for about 8-9 minutes each time.

I have a great respect for Deepak Chopra and his wisdom, but whereas I can usually grasp the message of his work and learn from it, this book was beyond me. It was generally a disappointing experience, though I did enjoy remembering the places I have been to in the old city, and at times felt that I was actually walking through those streets again.

His message is tarnished when dispensed as pop-culture consumable. There are too many inconsistencies, gaps and assumptions to nurture anyone but a page-turning beachgoer -- not what we expect from Chopra.

Benefits: no wires, decent sound. Problems: adjacent channel interference, narrow freq. response, physical signal range.Best iPod sound in a car is obtained with a line input. Next best is a cassette apdater. But if those are not options, the iTrip is a well designed alternative and easy to use (if Macworld couldn't figure out how to change stations, maybe they need better tech writers - hint: turn up the volume).My iTrip works pretty well in the four cars I've tried it in. The biggest issue is channel interference in urban areas, but even that can often be tuned around. And it is great for parties at friends' houses. At the price, it is a decent compromise.-dan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good solution.","review":"I thought I'd give the iTrip a try, in lieu of installing a CD player in my 1990 BMW 525i.The unit is small, light and cute, and installs easily (a quick software install and then just pop it on top of your iPod). It worked okay with a radio here in the office, but even turning the unit slightly away from the radio would introduce static.So out to the car we go. The unit sits on the center console less than six inches away from the radio -- and the signal is okay until you start moving. Then with every turn, even though the unit doesn't move, there's static.The sound quality is poor, and the signal pickup is so narrow and weak that if you are in any kind of urban area where there are stations all along the dial, you're going to be SOL with this baby. Even though we have plenty of open air here, this was the case for me regardless of how low in the band I went, and how I fiddled with the sound level, position of the unit, etc.It's going back, unfortunately. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful if you live in an urban area!","review":"I picked up the iTrip today at the Apple Store in Walnut Creek, CA. I'm going to return it tomorrow. In theory, it's simple -- find an empty spot on the radio, and tune the iTrip to that frequency. What I never realized (before getting the iTrip) is that, at least in our area (SF Bay), there are _no_ sufficiently empty spots on the radio. The signal from my iTrip/iPod was constantly being interrupted. I'd find a good frequency, drive a few miles down the highway, go over a hill, and suddenly my signal would cut out.Perhaps if you live in a less urban environment the iTrip would work for you. I think if you could find an empty frequency with room on both sides it could work just fine. I used to have a cassette adaptor for an old CD player -- I'd recommend that type of technology over the iTrip."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing product","review":"I disagree completely with the previous review. The iTrip allows you to select any frequency, which gives you more flexibility than any other FM transmitter out there.The problem with competing radio stations isn't the iTrip, it's the FCC, which limits the power these items can have. Yes, it's more difficult to find an open frequency in large cities, but it works wonderfully outside the cities.Some of us don't have cassette players in our cars, so that's not an option, and besides, I'm not limited to just using the iTrip in my car, I can use it anywhere there's an FM radio.Another advantage of the iTrip is that it doesn't need an outside power source: no batteries to change, nothing extra to plug into your cigarette lighter - it draws a small amount of power directly from the iPod.All in all, I find this accessory indispensible - it's the perfect way to use my iPod without the headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make Sure You Have the Right Version of iTrip","review":"This is iTrip is for the older units.

It's a good idea but my iTrip only has a broadcast range of about two feet which is not acceptable to me. I noticed on the Griffin Technology website that range is not on the FAQ. Now I know why.I've tried the device on all the clear frequencies here is SoCal (there aren't many) with my truck (standing outside the cab in case the windshield was interfering) and with my house stereo which has an active antenna.

Unfortunately, the iTrip has proved less than reliable. It is terrible if you are driving long distances as every 75-100 miles you have to fiddle around with your radio and iPod in order to find a clear station. And, even if you do find a clear station, I have found you only have a 50/50 chance of the iTunes actually picking up the signal. It also seems to drain the battery of the iPod much quicker than usual. The sound quality is mediocre at best and often times tje sound becomes fuzzy unless your iPod is almost on top of the car antenna. I have broken down and bought a cassette adapter...it's just easier.

It's better if you're out in the country, but completely and utterly worthless anywhere near an urban (or suburban!) area. Even in the country you'll probably need to change frequencies frequently (ha ha). Additionally, you have to install the broadcast stations on your iPod and it works out so that when you're just trying to listen to your music with headphones these tracks for the stations come on and make a really loud high-pitched beeping sound (same problem just using iTunes on your computer). This could be solved by making a playlist with everything except the stations, but the whole thing is just not worth the trouble.

It seems to have short-term amnesia and keeps returning to 88.5 anytime I try changing it to another (clear) channel. Even just pausing a song is enough for it to revert to 88.5. Generally it will let me switch to another channel a couple of times, switch back to 88.5 each time, and then after that it won't even acknowledge attempts to switch it anymore.

Setup was difficult initially as it kept prompting me for the Windows XP disk (I don't have it, I have a company computer), so I got the drivers from the website and got it running. After playing around with it, I got it working on my home stereo. The sound was marginal at best. In my car, though, it was much worse. I tried many stations, and the signal was extremely weak on all stations. I have a transmitter for my XM radio, and the difference between the two is huge. The problem is not with my radio or with broadcast frequencies, it seems to me that the signal coming from the iTrip is just extremely weak and works best when the unit is literally \\"right on top\\" of the antenna (not possible in a car).

There is simply too much interference for quality sound, and I have run into antenna issues while using iTrip in both my cars.I must also caution would-be users to not turn the volume up too high on their radio while using iTrip because the device has a tendency to shut off sometimes for no apparent reason (most likely strong interference), allowing the previously suppressed radio static to suddenly come back on and startle you while you are driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"Someone earlier wrote;>Radio quality is only 92kbps<That is misleading. The new HD Radio signal is only 92kbs, but regular FM is analog, limited only by the multiplex stereo system in use that forces a high frequency cutoff at 15KHz. Technically, analog FM (without the required cutoff) would sound better than CDs, as it does not have the low bit rate of even CDs, and as a transmission system does not have problems with hiss as did old old tapes, or problems with scratches as did old LP records.Of course most FM stations now play CDs or MP3s, and they often compress their signals to make themselves sound louder. But technically, FM sound is about as good as it gets, transmission-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from these folks","review":"I purchased the iTrip but ordered the wrong one. I recognized that fact as soon as I opened the box and saw that it would not fit in the 3G model iPod I have.

I also had problems with the station tuning samples--my iPod would often crash playing them, and I eventually got to the point where I couldn't change the channel and couldn't figure out what channel it was playing to.

No, the quality is not as good as a CD and I have learned to live with some fuzziness at points. But this is better than paying/installing a new stereo.In terms of the problem of having the tuning frequencies playing on the playlist...it takes about 2 seconds to fix that problem by setting up a smart playlist to not include the iTrip stations.This receives a four star rating because it does do what it claims to do...the only reason that I won't give it a five is that the transmitter does not shut off even when I shut my iPod off. If I don't pay attention then the battery gets drained and this is a minor annoyance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The Itrip works very inconsitantly in my car.

Not only is the music second to none (they are the best, after all) the Crue have always put on a visual spectacle unmatched in all of rock and roll. With this video, you are taken on an audio and visual tour of the evolution of the most influencial band of the last 20 years, both musically and culturally. Hopefully, they will release another video compilation soon, so as we can see what they've been up to since 'Decade of Decadence' was released 8 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Hard Rock at its Finest!","review":"This record provides a nice cross section of the band's entire career. If you are more into the heavy, raw music of their earlier career, you may be better off buying Shout at the Devil (my personal favorite) or Too Fast for Love. For those who prefer the 80's hard rock/pop sound, stick with Girls, Girls, Girls or Dr. Feelgood. Stay away from Theatre of Pain; their weakest album.The newer songs don't add too much, although Primal Scream is a killer tune and Anarchy is a cool remake. Skip over \\"Angela\\"...it may be their worst song ever. \\"Angela, I'll be there for ya\\".

Also a few funny moments between songs, like the \\"Esther sign\\" and the apology for the screw up during \\"Nothing As It Seems.\\" The energy at this show was intense, and the crowd was one of the best of the many PJ shows I've been to (thanks to everyone there for a great night!).

Myth shouldn't be only about presenting fanciful stories and then unveiling the obvious metophors within, we need to go deeper and find out why was this particular story created in the first place? Eliot also falls into that other white male scholar trap of limiting his references to Asian and Classical mythology.

More on that in a moment.After filling one leaf bag by emptying the Toro cloth bag about 5 times, I filled a second by hand without the vacuum.

Suction tube CONSTANTLY plugs at the narrowest point mid-tube, so much so that you'll end up preferring to rake leaves up the old fashioned way. Conceptually, sucking up and mulching leaves is appealing notion. Practically, raking is more efficient and preferable, since the tube plugs, and messing with the bag is time consuming and cumbersome. Even if this thing didn't constantly plug up, I doubt I'd use it as a leaf vac. Just too much hassle. I threw out the tube and bag.

I'm disappointed. The vacuuming part is good, but the leaf blower is not so good. It doesn't seem to have enough power to blow the leaves away in a steady stream. Once the leaves fly about a foot, they lose their push and fall to the ground. This is when it's turned up full force. It's almost impossible to blow leaves out from under shrubbery. I find it's easier to use the vacuum and just suck them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job.","review":"Very lightweight and the price was great!

It was heavy and cumbersome but worked well until the engine died after about 10 years. I purchased another gas system that only lasted about 2 months before the engine died. I decided to look at the ratings for blower/vacs on Consumer Reports and settled on an electric system because it is lighter and less cumbersome. I am not disappointed at all because it has plenty of power to handle the work I need to do. I think I will have many years of success with this blower/vac. I accept the fact that I need to work around the electrical cord, but it appears to be a very reliable system and does a nice job of reducing the size of the leaves I vaccuum up. I would recommend it if working with a gas system has finally worn you out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good....","review":"Works very well...tons of power (I mean enough to blow heavy rocks all over the place).

It worked best with small, dry leaves (birch, hackberry). Larger leaves (maple, oak) clog easily,especially when wet. I'm average height and always fought back pain using this. I developed work arounds. Ergonomics of this thing not good for avg to short persons.I might consider replacing with the new 51609, if I knew the motor had been improved for longer life.

I would then be left with 20 to 30 large bags of leaves that would either be taken to the dump or slowly placed in the garbage bin throughout the next few months.All I can say is THANK YOU TORO for making such a light weight but powerful tool. I was able to clean my yard in a few hours. I was afraid of using a powerful tool but decided to try. One suggestion, make a more, \\"user friendly\\" way of draping the bag over your shoulder.

My old electric Toro model had served me well, but had lost considerable mulching and vacuuming power. The new model did a great job--the extra power and the metal blade (great idea!) made the job much easier. I have also been using it this fall as a leaf blower and vac. My only complaint, and it almost led me to take another star off of the rating (three instead of four) is that WHOEVER thought it was a good idea to put the zipper on the vacuum bag on the side rather than the bottom was an idiot. If you are dumping the mulched leaves into a paper leaf bag, as I do, it's nearly impossible to completely fill the bag without making a mess. My old Toro leaf vac had the zipper on the bottom, which made emptying the bag a breeze.

You can not make a good vacum by just turning a blower upside down, removing various parts that will get lost, and sticking a big cumbersom bag on it. If you really want a well designed blower/vac, try to find the Yardman model. It truely is a blower/vac that well designed and converts just by the flip of a lever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good all around blower.","review":"As a blower, this works great.

Very powerful in both blowing and sucking. It is so nice for cleaning out the garage (no sweeping), and flower beds. Converts easily from blowing to sucking. Only minor complaint I have is there should have been a clip for the cord on the body of the blower, comes unplugged easily, only a minor irritation. We just put the cord over the back of our neck, works fine. I like to help my hubby clean up the leaves now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro Ultra big improvement","review":"As a longtime user of Toro blower-vacs, I am very pleased with the new machine. The most important change is switching from a plastic to a metal impeller. It grinds up debris much more efficiently and, presumably, won't wear down from use the way the plastic impellers did. Also very useful is the variable speed control, especially when using the machine as a vacuum. You can set the suction so that it is not picking up materials that it shouldn't be or raise it higher to catch heavier materials. The only criticisms I have are that the system of switching from the blower to the vacuum function is awkward and difficult - you need a third hand to depress the unlocking mechanism - and having the electrical connection in the front of the machine when you're in the vacuum mode. It would be better to have it on a swivel or come out the side. Otherwise, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a leaf blower","review":"Blower strength is probably to much.

The variable speed allows you to \\"suck or blow\\" with appropriate power so you don't disturb the bedding material.With a small amount of training and experience you are able to adjust the sholder strap and catch bag to allow access around (and through) your beds and hedges.The mulcher really reduces the trips to the dumpster.(BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER FILL THE CATCH BAG.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blower/vac! Poor leaf bag!","review":"Power! That is what I needed for my tough fall cleanup. The blower is adjustable and strong and the vacuum is the best on the market for this price. If only they would put a stronger zipper on the bag. The zipper broke within the warranty which was a pain to get replaced. I would have been much happier if the zipper outlasted the machine. This is the second electric Toro blower/vac that I have purchased ( I upgraded to more power) and they both have had bad zippers. Another pain is the parts are not interchangeable from two almost identicle machines. Great blower/vac (five stars) Poor leaf bag (No stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blower for A really good price.","review":"With free shipping from Amazon and about 70 dollars, this is a really good blower with a lot of power. I think it is as powerful if not more than a gas blower. I haven't mulched with it yet. The one problem that I did experience though is extension cord kept coming unplugged as there is a weak connection. I don't know if there is a product on the market that is used to hold an extension cord to an appliance, but I used a nylon tie. If you can keep cord and appliance hooked together, it is great.

The vacuum, which I need to pick up leaves as we have desert rock landscape is terrible. After a small amount gets in the bag, unless you empty the bag, the suction is no longer adequate.

I stopped it for about an hour to allow it to cool off and tried it again the motor slowed down and quit. So I went to 2 of these units within three trips to my yard.

I have no desire to blow things around so I wont assess that. But for vacuuming, the suction isn't very impressive. Only small nearly dried out leaves get readily vacuumed in. Larger leaves or leaves still freshly green are too heavy to be sucked into the tube. So in the end, only about half to 2/3 of the leaves at any given time get sucked in. Unless you like the unfinished look of only half your leaves being picked up, the rest you will have to rake. What's the point of the machine if you still need to rake. I do enjoy its feature of chopping up the leaves into fine particles so it saves on bag disposal and for that I may use it upside down just to feed large amounts of leaves into it for waste processing. But otherwise, the motor seems too weak for massive suction. I realize the limitation on a 15amp circuit can only allow an electric motor so much power, but still this product seems way overrated to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent blower but vac bag very hard to remove.","review":"My model is #51598 \\"ultra 225(black), apparently the same as the one listed.

It did a good job for me when I cleaned my front yard with tons of leaves. It saved me hours of raking and bending over to pick up stuff. The only thing about this blower is that you may get very dusty when you use it as a vacuum to crush your leaves. If you're sensitive to dust and don't want to get dirty, you may not want to use the vacuum. The dust blows from the bag and goes all around. A mask and eye protector will help greatly.

I purchased this same blower a couple of years ago so it's \\"just\\" out of warranty. It was used less than a dozen times and well cared for. It still looks new. It stopped working for no apparent reason. To have it repaired would cost more than purchasing a new one. It needs to be replaced but now I'm trying to decide whether to purchase this same model or the Black & Decker which costs a little more. Consumer Reports gave the Toro the highest scores but I feel like a well-cared for, relatively new item should last for longer than 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for extended use","review":"I bought this blower/vac while living in a home that was on a 40x100 parcel. For that sized area, the vacuum worked well. I recently moved to a home that is on a 75x210 parcel. Unfortunately the previous homeowner did not do a fall cleanup so I had to. The blower performed well for the first 2 hours getting everything into piles. I then switched over to the vacuum and cleaning up the piles of leaves (total of 3 large piles). Halfway through the second pile (3 hours of use), I shut the vac off to empty the bag. When I tried to continue using the vac, it would not turn on. I think I burnt out the motor from exteneded use. It is my opinion that this unit is good for small yards that would not need extended use of this product. It's cheap enough, but buying a small gas version would have been a better choice for me. Hopefully my unit is still under warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro 51599 leaf blower","review":"This was a replacement for a gas powered blower. It is great not to worry about whether it will start or not.

I can't imagine a more powerful blower/vac. It even feels a bit lighter than the previous model."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent buy, product works as noted and is light weight","review":"I was wary of buying this, but glad I did, product is light weight, pretty simple to put together and worked like a charm. Powerful to do the job, even on some of the heavier wet leaf piles that built up from the wind tunnels and left to sit under the snow all winter.

I have owned similar tools, but I like this the best. It has plenty of power in both the blower and vac modes. Changing from vac to blower is quick and easy.The metal toothed fan mechanism allows vaccuumed leaves to be shredded and isn't bothered by the occasional sticks that get sucked up.If you are only picking up small quantities of leaves, the bag included with the product works fine, However, I definitely recommend the \\"hose and bonnet\\" accessory and the folding container if you are picking up large quantities of leaves. I initially purchased the hose and bonnet to install over a metal or plastic trash can. I didn't get a good seal, so I ended up getting the collapsible container.

That about sums it up.The blower works pretty well. I think I might like a bit more power, but it works plenty well for this price. I'm tall, so I have to hold it a bit low to get leaves moving well. The vacuum is OK. I feel a little silly using it in plain view of the neighbors. It gets clogged easily, so until you've developed a decent technique with it you'll be cleaning it out frequently (especially if leaves are damp). It's also a little awkward to keep the bag strapped over your shoulder while vacuuming, so I just let it hang to the side.The blower is defintiely worth the money, but if you have a big yard maybe get a dedicated yard vac for picking things up.

Very pleasntly surprised by the ease of use and effectiveness of this unit as a leaf vacuum. I bought it to replace 3 failed Sears gas powered leaf blower/vacuums, which were not at all reliable. All failed within 1st year of use, and were heavy and awkward to use. The ergonomics of the Toro unit, while not perfect, are MUCH better than the Sears gas units. The Toro is very powerful, and does the vacuum/shredding job very well. You do have to get used to the trailing power cord, but that is minor compared to refueling the gas units. The leaf bag seems to be better made, and is somewhat larger than the Sears. All and all, I am very happy with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transaction","review":"Bought for Mom to use in her backyard because the leaves were driving her crazy.

I attempted to use the vacuum almost exclusively on leaves and yard waste from mowing, and it regularly clogged up, requiring frequent stops to clear the tube.

Very dissappointed in Toro, and of course, the 90 day warranty has long since expired. UPDATE: November 2008. Since my original comments, I learned there is a two year warranty.

I mainly use it to vacuum/mulch the leaves, and it does a good job.

Thicker branches are minor annoyances, but a couple tap usually clear the pathway rightaway.We use the blower to gather the leaves and the vac to sucks them up. The trick is transferring the content from the vac bag to municipal leaves bag.

It works very well as a blower. The vacuum is a bit tricky to use and is time consuming, but the benefits for mulching and composting make it worth it, in my opinion. We can save more crushed leaves in a limited space than if the leaves were just raked and piled. And they break down quicker, making for a nice soil supplement. It helps to vacuum the leaves when they are dry and have been sitting on the ground a week or more. If they're wet, then it's important to move more slowly and pick up only a few at a time to avoid frequent jamming.

I was beginning to think it was just my imagination after using it for a while and having to go over and over leaves and clippings to get it to suck them up. But then I found my old blower in the shed and realized I was right. The old one (with the plastic impeller) works better and is lighter.

It just had a plastic impeller and a gum ball and lodged in there and burnt the motor up. I doubt it would do the same thing with this blower (because of the metal impeller), but I don't want to find out.I look forward to blowing my leaves with this blower."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice product","review":"bought to replace my old gas powered unit.much quieter, light weight and very powerfull.very happy with this unit.would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves it!","review":"I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift.

My son who used it did not find it difficult to connect the bag as other reviewers had. He was very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!!","review":"I purchased this Toro product to replace my existing (dead) gas blower. I was concerned that it would not be able to stand up to large leaf piles like the gas unit did, but I was happily surprised. The is an excellent product and I would definitely recommend it.The interchangeable parts to convert from blower to vac are easy to use. The metal impeller is also a plus. The unit is relatively quiet compared to my gas blower, but I would still recommend ear protection. I think I read a few reviews about the speed dial being a problem, however I haven't experienced any issues.This may not be recommended, but I've actually set the unit on the ground in vac mode and raked the leaves into the nozzle. You can tell when the bag is full and it's sometimes easier than carrying it around with a full load.I ordered this blower based on the reviews from fellow Amazon purchasers and a short review in Wired magazine. For the price, it's a great deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to change-over","review":"I bought this product based largely on user reviews, which were overwhelmingly positive. My experience doesn't match. I find the change-over from blower to vacuum a fingernail-busting struggle. Vacuum power is poor - it would be easier to get out the broom. Blower performance is only so-so. The unit is somewhat ergonomic when blowing but vacuuming is a hassle. It does pick up poultry feathers, but doesn't chop them - they pass right through. Not terribly noisy, and doesn't vibrate, but not the best purchase I've ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vac Dies After Only a Few Months","review":"Bought to use as vac only (have another blower). Worked pretty well (not great) for several months. Then it all came to a screeching halt (literally) when that seemingly powerful metal impeller was stopped forever by an acorn or a tiny pebble. After paying $75 for the thing it died quickly with just normal, residential use. Took it to have it repaired by the firm that services our other yard equipment, and were told that it would be cheaper to buy a new one. We are going to buy a Black & Decker vac, with the leaf collection tube, as our neighbors' B&D product has worked well for years. They are in the market for a new leaf bag for theirs. That's the kind of reliability we need."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked good for around twenty times used","review":"I bought this same style blower a couple years ago. Only used the blower, not the mulcher. Maybe used the blower 20 times. (I have a Weedeater blower that I also use) The toro worked great until the brushes, that still looked new, started arcing and the motor slowed down and then quit working. The comutator actually came apart. I liked the variable speed control and it had plenty of power but I certainly expected a longer life from the machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I have been using this Blower for a few weeks and I like it. It is very light and does a good job blowing leaves. If you need a light tool for blowing stuff, this blower will do a good job for you. Don't forget to get a cord with it. Carrying the cord and winding it up is the only thing I don't like . REC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn-out","review":"Used the blower a total of 3 times. Not as good at vacuuming as you might think. Rake and trashcan much easier. Burned out on its third use. Not once used on heavy, wet material. If you have a decent sized yard, cord is a drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Lasted One Minute","review":"I have a heavily wooded landscaped acre in the middle of town so I eat blowers. My Sears gas blowers last about 1-2 years and my previous electric blowers were just too low-powered to move the leaves for collection. When I saw the reviews for this blower I thought my problems were over. It only took two days to get here (a record for the internet) so I went outside and attached it to my new size 14 50 foot extension cord and let it rip. Wow!After about one minute the motor started slowing down so I unplugged it and waited for a moment before starting up at zero and going to a lower speed setting. Too late...the blower was history. As Gilda said \\"there's always something\\". We'll see if the replacement lasts any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died twice","review":"UPDATED DUE TO CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCEBought this in september 2010. It died a month later. Got a replacement in november from amazon, which just died today. It's less than two years old and amazon said toro won't honor the warranty because the original purchase was september 2010, even though the product i got in november 2010 is still less than 2 years old. (Rated 1 star after this)After calling toro, they said that they do actually honor the warranty for 2 years, even for replacements, after you receive the replacement. Thus, I was able to take it to a local service center, they diagnosed it and had toro replace it with a new one. It's nice to know that I will also have a two year warranty on THIS replacement, too. I love this blower when it works, but it's hard to recommend something that's doesn't last 2 years, especially when toro's had two chances to make me think the failure was an anomaly. (Upgraded to 2 stars after this)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice with one suggestion.....","review":"I've had this type of blower/vacuum in the past and, as always, it's a dirty and dusty job. The TORO 51599 is plenty powerful and makes very fine mulch out of leaves: I'd guess that it reduces 5 regular bags of leaves to one. I don't care for the power control as it has no \\"OFF\\" position. Its easy to bump it and turn it on while you're trying to attach the bag or the extension cord. I think it might cost them an extra dime to add a rotary switch with a positive \\"OFF\\" position, similar to a OFF/ON/Volume Control.I'm glad I read the reviews and paid for a slightly better version with the metal impeller over the plastic one. The impeller takes a beating in our dry, sandy, gravely terrain.All said there isn't a perfect way to deal with ginormous leaf falls. Any time you grind up dry leaves you're going to get lots of dust.....so wear a breathing device if you're sensitive. It's much more efficient than bagging full-sized leaves like the monsters from our Schwedler Maples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro Blower - powerful","review":"Best blower I ever had.

The first had the plastic impeller and didn't hold up well processing the small twigs that are pulled through when using it as a leaf vacuum. I replaced it with the variable speed with the metal impeller. It worked great for about half a season of cleaning up leaves from a quarter acre lot. it started to overheat and smelled of burning electrical parts. I turned it off and it never worked again... now it has a new home in the landfill... I now have a black and decker.. it's a piece of junk too.. I firmly believe that all of these things are built to fail, and the manufacturers make them as disposalable products that are supposed to be replaced yearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toro blows and sucks","review":"The Toro Ultra blows and sucks, both literally and figuratively.

Used it a dozen times, it worked great.... until it didn't. Now it won't turn on, even though the safety latch is in place, seems like a circuit issue but I don't know.

Coming up will be it's third year of use. It's done yeoman's service during that time and has taken a fair amount of normal abuse in the process. The only failure has been the plastic flange that supports the canvas collection bag, which is now duct taped to that part.Overall, very pleased with the high-power blower action, and have found the vacuum function handier than I might have imagined. Dragging a cord around is a pain, but this was a tradeoff I was well aware of in advance and it's not that big a deal when compared to the far noisier, smellier and less flexible gas-powered blowers.Really good buy. Well done, Toro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT BUY IF IN EU/AUS","review":"I live in Australia. I bought and imported this due to the high reviews as I really wanted a good electric blower/vac. Obviously this is a 110V appliance, and Australia uses 240V, but I thought I could just use a step-down transformer.However, this thing is 13A, which means it draws around 1500 watts of power. That is, you'll need a step-down transformer that is at least 1500 watts - which are very big, and very expensive.It's now sitting in the box in my garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as I Had Hoped","review":"This blower vacuum was not as I expected. The motor housing is pretty bulky and heavy compared to a lighter cordless blower (Black and Decker for example which I will likely buy eventually instead). Although I liked the dial feature to control the speed of the impellar with precision, I found the power of the blower too much for my needs in my average suburban backyard with leaves from three medium-large trees. The main reason I purchased this over a cordless blower was for the vacuum. I'm 5'7\\" and the vacuum attachment was a few inches too long so that I couldn't allow my shoulders to carry the bulk of the weight when using it. Moreover, it turned out that the time to blow and suck leaves from the patio was not much different from simply blowing and sweeping them up. Lastly, the fabric bag is cheaply made and seems prone to tearing, likely needing replacement or repair after a season of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blower & vac. A bit too big","review":"I knew this was a bit bigger than what I wanted but it turned out to be even bigger. I am six foot tall and even for me it hits the ground so gets tiring after some time and also difficult to store. Overall it looks like a well made product and works well.

I liked it enough to buy this one which for the cost is a great product. I would have given this product 5 stars except for this model doesn't have a clip to fasten in the extension cord so the extension cord may occasionally disconnect from the blower although making a knot where the two cords connect takes care of this pretty easy. This is a great product for the home. I wish it had a little more blowing power but you will probably need a gas blow to get much more powerful than this. Overall I am very happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro 51599 Leaf Blower","review":"I have only used it once for about an hour.

And this model had the best remarks of all similar tools, so I thought I'd be satisfied. But no. This thing is awkward to hold even with the shoulder strap. It's loud. It doesn't perform - at least the vac part, which was the purpose of my purchase. It wouldn't suck up even the smallest acorns, you know, those tiny little baby ones?! It was even slow to suck up leaves. A broom in my hand would go faster. When I returned it to Home Depot they took it back, but the man rolled his eyes when I said it didn't perform. Sorry guy. It didn't. Save your money, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I am very disappointed with this toro leaf blower/vacuum. I found the blower to be fine but the vacuum is disappointing. I was interested in composting my leaves and thought this vacuum would be just what I needed. It heats up and the motor stops working.

Also, I am short 5'3\\" and find the blower to be very long for my height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"The vac works great and with free shipping was actually cheaper than Home Depot by $10.00.

In the fall I will find out how it performs with leaves. I did try the vacuum to remove old leaves from a patio area; it worked but it's not very fast. I would not use it to vacuum/mulch lots of leaves in continuous operation that might be overheat the motor. With the 12 amp motor, I am using it with a 12 gauge, 15 amp 100 ft extension cord which does cause a lot of drag in pulling the cord. Much harder than with light duty 14 gauge cord that I used with my old blower. I also recommend using ear protection against hearing loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great, but still dusty","review":"This thing does work as well as expected... almost surprisingly so. It's light and easy to use. I have only used it as a vacuum, but it's held up over numerous heavy-duty uses (oak tree and oak tree \\"stuff\\" among other things). I like the variable speed. We have a paver patio and it doesn't suck up the sand between the pavers which I was worried about. It doesn't pick up the twigs or acorns, but that's probably okay - it will last longer that way. I was hoping to speed up the time compared to sweeping and reduce the amount of dust going up my nose... it's sort of faster, but it's still pretty darn dirty/dusty - at least with the oak and especially when the pollen is falling. But I can't expect to be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro 51599 Ultra 12 amp variable speed blower","review":"Great blower.

I'll admit I didn't have high hopes. WAS I PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! My only regret is waiting for years (and several hundred dollars) to purchase this gem.

But you can pay $30 to get a decent blower. As a vacuum/shredder, it fails. Literally. At the end of filling three tall paper lawn bags, it would not start again. Nothing. The Toro website says it has a 2 Year Warranty, but that you need to contact the \\"retailer\\". What? Not Toro? So, I came to Amazon and can find nothing here about warranty repair. I'm sad to see a manufacturer passing the buck to the retailer on warranty repair, when we all know that retailers typically shrug their shoulders when you bring a broken item in. They always say, \\"We just sell it. You have to take it to the manufacturer for repair\\". I'm curious to see how this runaround will work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This blower is excellent! It does a great job... I really haven't had any issues with it.

Both have told me they do not sell or repair Toro products. I can send it back but would have to pay return shipping charge.This blower is very powerful & it does mulching satisfactory, but like another reviewer stated it does vibrate enough to cause an \\"old man\\" to have arm & shoulder pain after use.I would not recommend this blower to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 year later and still going strong!","review":"I thought I would do a follow up review now that my husband has had this for a year.

I used it about 4 times over two years at my house. I turned it on for the first time this year, and after a minute or two, I heard the RPMs reducing, smelled something like burning plastic, and saw smoke coming out of the motor vents. The bag was empty, there was nothing in the tube, and the impeller turned freely and was undamaged. I called Toro and they said it was probably the extention cord's fault. It's out of warranty, and they don't sell a replacement motor. So at $70, that comes out to $17.50 per use. If you're going to throw it away and buy a new one every two years, you might as well get a cheaper one."},{"rating":"1","title":"First year it was GREAT...all DOWN HILL since then!","review":"I bought this blower/vac because I read so many positive reviews on it. The first year it did work great, although the bag is tiny and with it and the cord, it was all sort of heavy. I kept the impeler cleaned out and cleaned it all up before storing it for winter. When I pulled it out for the 2nd leaf season it was like the motor action had been cut in half, barely blows any air out now. No way could I use it for a vac anymore, it totally lost its sucking power. I am now using it as a back up blower only for the lightest of jobs, keeping the leaves clear on my deck. No way can it be used like its intended! I really think they should rename it \\"TORO WIMPY\\" I wont be buying another one by TORO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic","review":"It is just as described, Just make sure you get a power cord for it, and it was delivered in great shape, Just that being in the city I was not too keen on it being left on my front entrance, so that anyone could get at it, However thankfully I was home, I did my neighbors lawn and mine as well, Bag was a little heavy with the leaves but figure your picking up allot more than you would if you was bagging them yourself, No problems and would recommend it to anyone, Neighbor wanted to borrow it but not out of my sight, I will go and do it for him as he has a small lawn, It was everything it said it was, and amazon is the bomb let me tell you. I only gave it a 4 star rating as the fact it did not require a signature when dropped off no other reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective blower mulcher-catch bag needs improvement","review":"Blower has plenty of power, effective vacuum and mulcher especially with the durable metal impeller. The only thing that Toro needs to work on is the catch bag. After 3 uses the stitching on the bag where it attaches to its plastic adapter is already coming loose and a whole is developing. Simple enough to repair with the household sew kit and heavier duty matierials. I think is they dial that part in and improve the bag shoulder strap to be more effective in support, they will have a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I selected this electric Toro mainly to pick up oak leaves from a large oak in my back yard. Machine may be satisfactory as a blower for larger leaves but it is a failure in suctioning up oak leaves. Even at highest power you have to hold the suction nozzle against the ground and still it does not gather all the leaves. It just does not have decent suction power. I realized after using it five times now that it is actually easier and faster to simply rake leaves into piles. It is also far more efficient than repeatedly going back and forth over a tiny area with the nozzle of the vacuum.I realize many have given this item a good review but they could not have been dealing with oak leaves that cover Florida from Nov. till spring. Also the handle arrangement is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of power","review":"We love this for the leaf blowing but for the vacuum it just doesn't do the job. We live in Portland OR where we have lots of leaves that are very wet and this just gets clogged to make it practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blower","review":"Great power to this blower, easy to handle. You can adjust the power level easily with the turn of a dial. Only two downsides. First, the vaccum is powerful enough it will suck up bark chips as well as leaves, which then requires cleaning out around the impeller. Second, the strap to the leaf bag broke within about 15 minutes of use. Otherwise I love it, and I would buy it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaf Vac does the trick","review":"I love this vac.I have a large yard with a lot of leaves. It is fenced in so in order to get rid of the leaves I have to collect them and drag them out.Instead, I use the vac to mulch them. The bag holds the equivalent of 16 bags un-mulched. I pile them up in a corner of the yard and turn them over once a month. In the spring I have top soil.I had started with the Craftsman but it kept jamming. When the switch broke, I replaced the vac with the Toro. The serrated metal mulcher works much better. The vac is easy to use and the bag is easy to empty.You can work at your own pace since any time you want to stop, all you have to do is empty the bag.I never used the blower attachment so I cannot comment on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toro leaf blower","review":"Leaf blower is excellent. rated #1 by Consumer reports for handheld leaf blowers. Even better than gas models. I didn't pay for rush shipping and it still arrived in 2 days, even during the holiday season. It requires a 14 guage extension cord, if you want to use a cord with 100' length. I purchased one of those at Walmart for about $28.00. so you need to figure that as an additional cost. Most outdoor extension cords are just 16 guage. that will be sufficient if you only want to use a 50' extension. If you try using a 100' cord that is only 16 guage the motor is likely to burn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Honey, no blisters.... this thing ROCKS!!!!","review":"Toro Ultra 12 Amp Electric Blower/Vacuum #51599This is definitely a worthwhile purchase if you're looking to say goodbye to blisters and a sore back.

The one feature that wasn't a selling feature in my decision that after using the blower really makes this an all-around excellent buy is the dial to control the speed.

It is very easy to switch back and forth from blower to vac (and back). You really need the extra hose and collapse-able can to get the most of the vac part of this unit.

I had a lot of leaves and once I got too many blown into a pile it wasn't effective so I guess at that point next fall I should try the vacuum part to see if that does the trick. Or just don't let so many build up and do it two or three times.Pros: Cheap, pretty strong airflowCons: Make sure you get the right electric cord and understand it is going to be expensive. It was a pain when I watched the neighbor pull out his gas blower and go. Cord came undone several times and you have to learn to live with it.Over all I'm happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed with the performance","review":"I read nothing but good reviews before I decided to buy, and I wasn't disappointed.

Used it one year before the poorly designed safety switch for the vac attachment developed too much clearance and the unit would constantly cut out while trying to vacuum up leaves or whatever. I tried numerous jury-rig fixes to eliminate the problem without totally defeating the safety function. All to no avail.Bought a B&D; Leaf Hog while struggling with the Toro as my wife just wouldn't use the Toro because of the frustration of the power cut outs. The B&D; leaf hog went 5 years before burn-out. Last year we decided that the Toro was just taking up space in the shed as neither of us would use it anymore. So into the trash it went, though with only a year's worth of real use on it. What a waste of money. What a crappy safety switch design. We decided we'd never buy another Toro blower/vacuum based on our money wasting experience with this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toro 51599","review":"I bought this thinking it would pick up Acorns. We had a bumper crop this year. I was dissappointed. It would not even bring one 1/4 wy up the extension.Next I tried leaves, I was disappointed in this task as well. I would have thought at 230 MPH it could pick up leaves quicker then this. It would be faster to use a rake."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!! 1 use and it burned up!!","review":"I was very excited about getting a leaf vac that would do gumballs. I emptied the bag 2 times. on the third fill of the bag the motor died. Apparently it does not like gumballs. too late to return. I'll have to check the manufactors warranty. very dissapointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, good performing blower","review":"I purchased this blower for less than a replacement battery for my existing blower! After the first use, I'm very impressed by the power of the blower, but I am less impressed by the vacuum function. The blower can push around leaves, pine needles, branches and even rocks, but the vacuum was surprisingly weak. It's possible that the seal wasn't completely tight when I assembled things, but if you are specifically looking for a powerful vacuum you may need to look elsewhere.In my case it's not such a huge problem, because I frequently need to clean up things which are not 'vacuum friendly' anyway. So limitations aside this is still great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blower Out There","review":"I've owned the Toro Ultra since 2004 and it has performed flawlessly for me. I've used it both for clean up and leaf shredding and it's been great. It cuts the leaves down to a very nice mulching size, perfect for the yard. It's lightweight and easy to handle. It takes very little effort to convert from blower to vac and back again. My neighbors have seen me using it to pick up leaves and have asked me where I got it. I highly recommend it. Now after 5 years, it broke today. In pulling it apart I found that the 4 metal mounting brackets that hold the motor in place broke, causing the impeller to drop out and stop. No easy fix, so it looks like I'll be purchasing a new one, needless to say, I'll be getting the exact same one again. For $70 and 5 years of service, that's not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"works great for 2 years FRIED AGAIN","review":"I agree it is a great product for as long as it works. I have had 2 since 2005, the first toro blower/vac engine overheated and fried the AC cord after 2 years.

Must Read!!","review":"Hard to swallow at first, but I've done enough checking to know Rife lived, invented his microscope and that this story, while fantastic, may in all probability be TRUE!?!? Are most cancer's caused by a single microbe? Heck if I know, but it sure does make sense. Random genetic events might cause millions or billions of variations, yet most cancers are of similar form. A cancer microbe makes sense, as does the idea that electromagnetic radiation can kill microbes. With the Internet, if this is true, longevity for all is a reality. Poor social security."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Martyr.","review":"This book is a fascinating, yet tragic tale, of a man who not only invented a microscope that was ahead of it's time, but 'cures' for cancer and most other diseases, using a machine that used different frequencies. This man, Royal Rife, had to constantly battle with the corrupt Medical Cartel that is only concerned about the almighty dollar. It makes one sick to think about how much good his work could have been for world, except it was destroyed and is still being suppressed. I am glad that Barry Lynes wrote this book though, and hope that it will continue to spark peoples desires to carry on Rife's work.On the side, I would like to mention there is now more and more ongoing tests with RIFE type machines. And that quite advanced RIFE type machines can be bought nowadays. They are around $5000.00 US. Make sure they have a plasma tube and not just the pads if you want a genuine and more effective RIFE type machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Scam","review":"Another product to prey on the credulous. The people who promote this stuff should be locked for fraud, and their assets seized and given to a cancer research institution. It is incredibly easy to test the claims this device makes, yet all the believers don't require evidence, just hope. For hope, you can spend the $20 and get it as long as you don't seek evidence. Unlike the books claims, these techniques have been studied extensively by researchers and shown to not work. You will also find in the upper levels of this scam individuals convicted of fraud. On the lower levels, you'll find dead cancer patients and broke families. Find any academic search engine and look up \\"Rife Machine\\".

It does not exist. All other 'Rife' machines are rife-less. Pure quackery. Put your money, heart and hope elsewhere. If it worked, we would all know about it. It might cost more, but we would willingly pay for it. Do we really think that there is a hidden cure for cancer. Ridiculous. There are so many looking for it. We would, collectively find, expose, publicize and pay for it. No problem. This is a money-maker for some sadly misdirected people, who are happy to make a profit off of those who are in desperate need of help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh","review":"First off, I think the author forgot to mention that Rife is apparently God of universe in his book, or at least thats the way he is portrayed. Second, why should I have to plunk down 4000 bucks to prove this radio can heal me, maybe you should try showing a couple of people through some free trials.

The book cover states FIFTY YEARS OF SUPPRESSION but it was written in 1987 so now it is more like SEVENTY YEARS OF SUPPRESSION.

Oddball stuff? Absolutely. And why not? Good comedy should be sick. Season Seven has not disappointed, and \\"Sweet Dee Gets Audited\\" is hilarious, twisted and dark. However, this show works on more than one level, i.e. the writing is sly (digging on the Tea Party and Democracy's shortcomings). \\"Sweet Dee\\" seems to unfold perfectly from start to finish (No spoilers, I'll just say \\"urinal rocks\\"). Nice. Charlie (Kelly) Day has always been my favorite, but you've got an American Icon in the cast (DeVito), who gives a great performance (again) as Frank Reynolds - check out the heart-to-heart talk Dennis (Glen Howerton) and Frank have in the office - towards the end of the episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Hard to Watch","review":"This season started of strong, but seems to be running out of ideas, and humor.I may have laughed once or twice...and that was somewhat forced.I hope it gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 7 is great!","review":"Season 7 is great!

It's told in flashback form, about Frank and his brother in the 60's and 70's. There isn't really one funny moment except for clips of Frank indulging in a substance he helps his brother sell. This season has been good so far, but this episode can be flushed down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny flashback","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers - this episode wasn't funny. I usually enjoy this show, but this episode couldn't end soon enough. It feels like the writers ran out of other options and so they went with a flashback episode. Is this the beginning of the end? I hope not. I suspect that this episode isn't very funny because Danny Devito isn't that funny when he's on his own. I watch this show for the interactions between the other characters. I could take or leave him (& his character)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a decline in quality.","review":"I loved this show. Seasons 1 through 6 were wonderful.This episode was horrible. Beyond a doubt the worse I have seen.I usually bust out laughing when I watch IASIP, but I just had a couple tiny chuckles with this episode.The whole premise was absurd and poorly acted.

As a fan of the show, I really didn't like these two reunion episodes, & when I recommend the show to new viewers, I would advise against them watching this episode as an introduction to the show. I had hoped that this episode would salvage the last one (a to be continued), but sadly, IMHO, it did not. Every TV series occasionally has an episode or two that aren't up to par, & I'd suggest that this episode did not reflect what a great show it's been (& it hopefully will remain)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danny Devito has some funny one-liners","review":"Danny Devito's one-liners are the only funny thing about this episode. The rest of it is just disgusting. I needed a shower after watching what amounted to a string of grisly, and poorly thought out, sight gags. This show has been going downhill for a while but there are usually a few good episodes per season. I liked the actress playing the hooker but they didn't really give her any good lines. I know this show has always relied on a certain amount of crudeness, but when all you experience is one potty joke after another without wit or brilliant plotting in between, it just ends up falling on the floor. Glenn and Charlie and the rest of the gang could learn a thing or two from Larry David who uses just as much profanity and dark humour, but leaves you feeling that you've just witnessed brilliance and real comedic prowess. I'm a fan of the show overall so I guess I'll continue to buy these episodes as they come out, but I hope it gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 6 glorious seasons they phoned it in.","review":"I saw the faux family portrait they showed for this season and laughed my ass off. I was so looking forward to this but what a crushing disappointment! This show has been so original and funny for 6 seasons but it's just not anymore. The jokes are flat, they rely on being gross instead of funny (not that gross isn't funny, but that's all they've got this season). It's just plain dull.They should have stopped after 6 seasons and it would have been remembered for the uniquely funny show it was, instead of the uninspired, only-doing-it-for-a-paycheck show that it became."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a strong contender for the worst sunny episode","review":"Save yourself the 22 minutes and skip this episode.

The Jones character is a fedora-wearing, bull whip-slinging, adventurer who fights Nazis while traveling the world in search of ancient treasures. The Ark is the chest which held the Ten Commandments. The Nazis want it because legend has it that any army which possesses it will be invincible. Indy's droll instincts save the movie.

Her four albums to date have been progressively more sophisticated and beautifully produced. Matters of the Heart (the third) is my favourite. Possibly my favourite album of all time. A deep, sophisticated, introspective, subtly melodic, intricately textured, album, with typically socially conscious lyrics, sung with Tracy's characteristically longing, passionate phrasing. Like many of the classic albums that truly endure, it may take many listens before you really appreciate it, but each new playing will reveal more of the beauty of this brilliant album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Recording","review":"Enter Tracy's world of love, forgiveness and peace.

These lasted two weeks and went soaring down the thruway never to be seen again.

It seems that a few years ago only the expensive version of this lens was available from Nikon, so I alternatively bought other (far more expensive than this one) brands. They were clumsy to use and produced disappointing picture quality. This lens is great! Built well and pic quality is excellent! Very happy to have found it, even so long into owning the camera.

So, I refused the shipment and ended up getting only $30.00 back from my $75.00 purchase (including shiping, restocking fee). I couldn't be happier with the lens from the local camera store.

The physical disk showed scarring which matched the segment of the disk where track 3 would be, so I computer-copied the disk, hoping that the problem was surface quality and that my computer could read and copy the disk, which it did. Unfortunately, even the copy will not play track 3. The disk was brand-new and had not been handled (by me). I'm personally not too bothered, because it was track 1 that I really wanted (\\"Mysterium\\" -- the longest piece on the disk), which is magnificent, well performed, well recorded, and playable without flaw.

Onthis album he really shines with Take Me Down, and you can catch that live performanceon you_tube which prophetically was recorded 3 months before his death from an untimelyheart attack.This is a good place to start your John Campbell initiation, but the album \\"Howlin Mercy\\"is his finest hour.

I am using this for a toy, so I dont know how well it works with live animals. I would say that mice and dwarf hamsters and small snakes or lizards would fit nicely in here for a trip somewhere. it would work for insects otherwise. It seems pretty sturdy.

However, now that her marketing dollars got your attention, you have the opportunity to buy a better product. Linda is a fine singer, but if we compare her to others who spent their entire careers in this genre then she falls short. Her voice is monotonous...she only has one color and one technique (open with lots of vibrato) & her phrasing is quite poor (in Spanish). Do yourself a favor and buy Lola Beltran, Amalia Mendoza or Hermanas Padilla instead. Further, she cannot even claim to be the best Chicana in the genre...that honor would belong to Alicia Juarez the last wife of Jose Alfredo Jimenez."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to","review":"It lifts the handset.

All the actors and actresses fared very well. Other renditions of Macbeth such as the one by Roman Polanski, though entertaining, are no match for this rendition of one of Shakespeare's classic plays.

While easily fixed with some super glue, I started to consider what if I did move damage to it where I could not repair it.

However, the guy just screams like a child having a tantrum. Not very metal in my opinion. Hell, it's not even talented!All in all, I personally think metal bands today need to take a page from the 80's and 90's metal acts. People seem to like that type of music a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"hell no.","review":"just because it has pantera members in it doesn't mean it's good.remember, pantera's reinventing the steel had pantera's members in it, all of them, and that sucked and so does this.biatch.if you want good pantera, listen to far beyond driven and the great sounthern trendkill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking!","review":"I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with this release. I was hoping Vinnie Paul would come back with a vengeance after the terrible death of his brother in arms Dime. The fact that he was there for the shooting, must have been tough. I would imagine that something like that would be hard to recover from.Overall this cd just lacks good tunes and that's really all you can say about it. The mix is ok and the vocals are alright. But again, if the songs were really good, the entire experience probably would have been better.I'm glad Vinnie's back, but he can do better. Maybe he should call up James in Metallica and get Lars booted out. Can you imagine Vinnie in Metallica? maybe he could save that band and help bring it back to it's former glory!Overall I found this to be a pretty boring listen. I was hoping for so much more and this release unfortunately does not deliver the goods!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh i can take it or leave it","review":"it sounds like watered down mudvayne. just go buy albums by the bands this superground consists of. you'll get less disapointing results..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sucks....straight up","review":"If you think this album is any good at all, you are seriously trying too hard to like it. The first 3 songs are the only thing they have going for them and they get old fast. Not what was expected from them. You want to hear a good album, buy Doomsday Machine by Arch Enemy, they are at the top of the game right now and are only getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELLYEAH","review":"If I heard this CD without knowing who it was, I would say it sounds like a cross between Mudvayne and Pantera. I disagree with people who think its different from either band as both the Mudvayne and Pantera styles are obvious. I have yet to listen to nothing face so I won't make reference to their style.The CD is mostly fast paced with a couple slower songs. Even the slower songs are good but have a different mood than the rest of the CD. The band is appropriately named because the song HELLYEAH is by far one of the best songs made.Don't buy this CD if you're expecting Pantera or Mudvayne. Buy this CD if you can appreciate both styles blended perfectly into 11 songs (not counting in the mood)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of you need not to take this so seriously...","review":"because this is a pretty good album and I'm not one of those who tried REALLY HARD to like it. I came into this album with an open mind and I found it quite a fun, enjoyable album and that's the point I'm trying to make. This is a fun album. Most of you from what I've seen have criticized this effort for not having the best lyrics but you know what? It's not supposed to. It's supposed to be heavy as f*** metal that you can casually listen to but it's not supposed to be intelligent. Yes, I agree with many of you that about halfway through the album, some of the songs mix together. So, it does have its weak moments but overall it is an eclectic mix of songs by a group that truly doesn't sound like any other presently. Honestly, I wish this band went full-time because it's better than the other bands that comprise it.All in all, if you like fun, rocking heavy metal then pick this up and listen to it with an open, free mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"piec of trash","review":"this cd sucks. it is worth about 1 dollar. if you can download do it... dont waste your money on this garbage. if you want a real cd buy the new DARK TRANQUILLITY in about a week. this cd sounds like boring metal riffs that have been done before...."},{"rating":"1","title":"HERE'S WHAT THIS REVIEWER IS THINKING...HILARIOUS.","review":"The name of the band says it all.

The riffs are dull, the vocals bland, and the song writing is uninspired.I was never a fan of Mudvayne. Maybe this why. And Vinnie, what the hell were you thinking? You can't be serious. I guess rednecks need some headbanging anthems too.YUCK!!I need to listen to the new Machine Head album to wash this bad taste of stinky Southern wrangler nu-metal, or whatever it is, out of my mouth.Or, if you need something with a cowpoke in the title get Pantera's COWBOYS FROM HELL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellyeah","review":"I've read a lot of reviews on this band both on here and on other web sites. For the most part they all seem negative. These reviews were in part why I simply stayed clear from this band. Recently I had the chance to hear for myself. Here is what I think.It's a mix of Mudvayne and Pantera. More Mudvayne then Pantera, but still a nice mix. That being said if you like both bands I don't see any reason not to like this band. I really love Mudvayne's vocals and Vinnie Paul is one of my favorite drummers so needless to say I really enjoy this band.Lyrics are not anything special, however that doesn't concern me. I'm not interested in meaningful lyrics I just want something enjoyable to listen to.As far as the guitar work is concerned, it's no dimebag. Then again, is anything other then Pantera?To sum this up I will just say this. I really like this band.

A lot of the songs sound nothing like KMFDM, so they aren't really remixes or covers. They're different songs with KMFDM lyrics in them. This would be an album I would only recommend for someone who wants everything with the letters KMFDM on it.Plus side: \\"Disobedience\\" - Raymond Watts turns that song into a jazzy lounge song like \\"Angel\\" from Praise The Lard.Die Krupps' remix/cover of \\"Power\\" is cool.The cover of \\"A Drug Against War\\" by Razed In Black is pretty good.The horror, the horror: The disgusting remix of \\"Juke Joint Jezebel.\\" It's an atrocity!\\"Sex On A Flag\\" by Interfaith vs. Rick Sitter...I think you \\"blew your cover\\" if you can't even get the title right."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a tribute album, it rocks.","review":"Two of the tracks are done by fromer members of the band (being the first two tracks actually).

It's another bad tribute album from the the people who brought you such stinkers as \\"The Passion Of Covers: A Tribute To Bauhaus\\" and other worthless titles full of terrible bands (Rosetta Stone) doing terrible covers, and even some good bands (Sheep On Drugs, Julian Beeston) doing surprisingly terrible covers. Now why did I give such an insulting CD 2 whole stars? Well for one thing, Sheep On Drugs' \\"Money\\", while lacking all of what I was expecting them to give the song is pretty cool (if you don't think of the original while listening to it), and, the new remix of \\"Light\\" by Gunther Shultz (ex-KMFDM guitarist) is a treat that extends from the songs single, and \\"Disobedience\\" is more of a loungy remake of the original than a cover (Mr. Watts did sing the original as well). So if you like the bands on this CD, get it, but only if you know the originals very well. And if you don't but you are a completest (like me :( ) go for it.

The program is reccomended for 2-4. I was totally disappointed in this product. Before you begin to use the product, the child is given an assessment test, which was fairly good. However, it gave you the illusion that the program would be like that, when it is not. Your child is scored and based on the score, the questions are supposed to be geared toward the skills that the child does not know or needs improvement on. First of all the programs were difficult to understand for most adults (my husband and I are both college educated). Both my husband and myself sat down with my son and could not figure out the concept of the games. My son was easily bored with the product and seemed disinterested. He seemed to prefer some of his other computer software, (School Zone(preschool) and Disney for Toddlers. I would tell anyone to invest their money in another software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - Misleading subscription service required.","review":"Warning - A subscription service for $8/month is required for 70% of the game. Do not buy unless you want to pay more monthly or have a crying child who wonders why they cannot continue playing the game.See the message board on Jumstart's website for experiences from upset parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!! It's a RIP OFF!!","review":"We bought this for our 3 year son who is pretty advance for his age. After about a couple of hours of playing it he had already passed the first two stages and complained he couldn't do anymore. When I checked into it, I found out we had to pay a monthly membership online to play the rest of the games!!! What is the point of buying a game when we can't play the entire thing!! Do NOT buy this!! It is a rip off. We just paid $20 for a sample game!! You can bet we are going to get our money back. Anyone who has bought this should do the same. This was a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This product makes me so mad. My son and I completed the game within a few days. It shows other places that you can visit, HOWEVER, you can not play in those areas without going online and buying an extremely overpriced membership. I will never buy JumpStart products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have trouble using on Windows Vista/ bad customer service","review":"Easy to install at first but after a few minutes of playing the sound went out. I tried another day with disc 2 and after a few minutes the picture went out. I called tech. support and was emailed information about a patch which I had to install. After doing so I tried running the game and my computer went black and I couldn't do anything with it, after about 2 hours I got my computer up and running again. I called tech support and left a message and I also emailed them but no one got back to me. I am having a bad experinece with this game and the company so i would never recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for ages stated, boring as well","review":"This says it's for age 1 1/2 but it's way to advanced for a child so young. My son will be 2 in 3 months he has no interest in this game at all. He really loves to move the mouse by himself and I wanted a game we could do together with him playing it under my supervision. My son is interested in the games daddy plays like World of Warcraft which he laughs at all the time and enjoys the graphics of daddy jumping on his wolf, but he won't even look at the screen with this Jumpstart game playing.I expected it to be more visually stimulating for children so young but the graphics are horrid and boring.The learning is for older kids who are 3 or older.Not much content either for a $20 game, should be $10 at most.The game was rather girly with little ducks and butterflys everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monthly fees","review":"Beware - if your child wants to play all of the games available you have to pay a monthly fee for a membership. Buying this software only gives you access to a limited number of games. My daughter loves to play the ones available but I don't think its worth it to pay for the rest. You also have to have the disc in the drive to play and there are 5 discs. It is a pain to have to change discs whenever my daughter wants to change games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive and Cheesy","review":"Since when did the industry consider it appropriate to seize the user's computer on exit to run commercials for the product you've already purchased and REQUIRE an internet connection just to play what you've loaded to your local system? You cannot get more intrusive as an advertiser than that. In addition to such cheesy tactics, this game producer also provides a game for $20.00 that has a functionality comparable to a downloadable demo. The child can do precious little in this game, (without going online to pay MORE for what should have been bundled in the shrink-wrapped version) and what he can do seems to have had little user testing behind it. It is just a desperately poor implementation bordering on deceptive. Never again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a scam","review":"We bought it and found out its a scam... you can't do what it says. You only get letters A-G and have to go online to buy a membership to get the rest of the game. It isn't a one time fee, its a monthly membership. We called Jumpstart and complained, they were rude, nasty, and informed us that they will mail us a non-membership game version, but we have to pay the shipping. No where on the box does it tell you this... they are totally scamming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixes up circles & ovals!","review":"I have the version that states it works with windows Vista as well. I have not yet gotten to the part where you have to purchase the on-line subscription to go past level 2, but I keep reading about it! If that's not bad enough, both the Advanced Preschool & the Kindergarten mix up circles and ovals and teach that they are opposite of what they really are! I called customer service three times, talked to a customer service person once who said he had vague rememberance of having heard of this problem once or twice, but was unaware of any patch or downloadable fix for this error. He said he would research it and call me back. I have not heard back after over a month. I also called after that two other times & left messages after being on hold for a long time, but never got any calls back.

I wondered if he was ok because this is an Album of Digweed and Muir. When I listened to it at first I thought now I know why he just gave me the cd but then I started to like the first three tracks and the last one Heaven's Sent. Then every day before school I would listen to it but only those tracks. Now I like every track this is a very good cd it is just like there other works they just take time to like. The first three tracks get you moving then the others kind of but not as much, but have very good bass very deep. This is not a bad cd just takes time for some tracks but other tracks like the first three and the last one people should like at first. I would give it four stars because the tracks are not mixed in, but since it was given to me I will give it FIVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book provides excellent examples of what the news media is all about.

Go for the Sybex or Prima book, both of which are written by real experts with whom I'm personally acquainted. I'm quite sure the only good review was written by the books publisher, who more than likely hasn't played this game a day in his life.. it takes MONTHS to become an expert, you can't write 20 strategy guides a year and be an expert on all of the games.. so Mark Walker chooses to be an expert on none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game!","review":"This is an awesome game for anyone who likes constant action...You advance trough the middle ages while making the best military you can.

This technique would take the player back to the literal DARK Ages !I doubt if anyone who uses the tactics/strategies mentioned in this book could finish a regular multiplayer game under 4 hours.The tips/tricks mentioned in this book is nothing more than the Info sheet provided with the game and what a player couldn't find out for himself/herself in the 1st hour of the game.Sheer waste of money & time !I recommend Ensemble's book which costs the same and is good for even the average player.

I think that it's great that the author gave so much information on each civilization; that way you can become an expert in one area. His advise is great and it works, and he seems to know a lot about the game. I do, however, agree that he should have written more general tactics, but a lot of the general tactics he explains when writing about the civilizations. His walkthroughs for each campaign and scenario are fantastic and prescise, and if I were you I would buy this guide in an instant.(By the way, I was about in the middle of between expert and novice when I bought this book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I'm quite certain that \\"five star\\" review was written by the book's author.

This is a very serious, intellectual, psychological De Maupassant-type drama based purely on sharply understated dialogue and rising emotional tension, as two former lovers, both miserable with their lots in life, meet and try to bridge the gap that has grown between them. The scenes are almost claustrophobic, taking place in only 3-4 very closed-in locations. It is the evolving relationship between Rai and Devgan, and their brilliant acting (try to imagine Aishwarya made up to look like a slightly frumpy housewife) that makes this film so enjoyable. A truly different milieu for Rai, who demonstrates an acting ability that few might have imagined she had. Slow-moving, episodic, sad and completely riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"I know it go awards in India, but I can't figure out why.

Being an Aish film, I expected more. Love Ajay Devgan too, but hated the character he played in this film. Do yourself a favor and watch these two together in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanaam instead.

Anderson's writing is thoroughly readable, academically rigorous but free from the dry, heavy dialogue that plagues so many other scholarly works. My only criticism is her decision to exclude the Chinese immigrants' perspective on the development of their district, instead opting to focus only on how the Europeans perceived the Asian 'intruders'. Providing the opposing view would have given the work better balance and a greater level of depth. Nevertheless, an excellent book for those interested in Canadian history or ethnic/urban politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"the downing street years","review":"for the price i paid the book was kind of thick and heavy. there was an old smell and some browning on the edges but it's okey, it's what's inside that counts. it's kind of boring at first butthen again, you have to be a politician to understand everything she's saying and politician i am not. all in all, if i really want to learn what it takes to be a woman prime minister i have to read the whole thing. not everyone can be golda meir."},{"rating":"2","title":"question for those who read thatcher's books - not a review","review":"Hillary Clinton has mentioned that she went blond after reading Thatcher's autobiography.Why did Thatcher go blond?Thatcher's books don't list blond, bleach or hair in the index.I wish more books were in digital form.thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Margaret Thatcher is an incredible person and her tale of her time as prime minister is fascinating.

At times I felt there was some stereotyping of Maritimers but it did not take away from the story. The author's character development was realistic, as was her handling of sensitive subject matters.

For a person who does not have extra money to use and is not aiming for long term/ repeated use for 7.5% of the price of the Lange. We did double blind studies across individual professionals and found this caliper to be as accurate as the Lange. However it is not as durable and most likely would wear out. The spring would wear on either item and the Lange can be calibrated at a nominal fee. Yes the Lange is good tool for a clinic and is intended for professionals often found in clinics and labs, but most do not have budgets that will allow for $200 expense and the yearly calibration. For $16 dollars it's good enough for most users and will last because you are using it occasionally. For $16 dollars you can buy one every five years and still save."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The caliper is really good but I think the guide could be a little better.

But when a dietician that does this sort of thing all day long usesthem and it reads 7% you know it's off.My wife measures 13% bodyfat using the dieticians calipers.That's a 45% difference.

It was a big disappointment. Merton seems, for me, at is best when talking about social justice issues. Otherwise, his piety is too intense for me.This book is designed for someone who cannot afford the time or money to go away on retreat. It is meant to provide enough food for thought and meditation for use at home. It succeeds in doing that, though some days are more nourishing than others.One of the best insights, which we need to remind ourselves over and over again, is that we are called to be ourselves, not someone else. Also, the desire to please God does in fact please God and that \`All we need is to experience what we already possess'. \`Without some sort of solitude there is and can be no maturity' and we need \`to be converted over again each hour.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute title","review":"brian hagen ain't the funniest man in the world. i like nine inch nails. it's a household name."},{"rating":"2","title":"So that's where I was . . .","review":"I've nosed around the Baja for nearly 40 years.

Reading it gave me a new perspective on why people control and how wide the scope can be. I'm also shocked to realise that a person like myself who's struggling with control freaks also has some control issues.

It also provides suggestions on ways to improve those relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally someone who understands!","review":"My mother is the biggest control freak I have ever met. I never knew there were other people out there that were just like her. Granted, I have known other control freaks, but they paled in comparison to my mom, so they were tolerable.

I also question the morality of teaching religious superstition as a method for permanent behavioral change.

The rest of the selections on this album are also excellent, although \\"Ecstasy\\" has to be my favorite. The sound effects used are amazing, and the vocals are beautiful.This is an artist that needs to be heard to be believed. He apparently isn't too well-known outside of Europe but produces remarkable music. On this album, each track is connected to the next; it should be played straight through without stopping for optimal enjoyment (although each track is fairly good on its own too).If you like this, I highly recommend the single \\"Humanity\\". In fact, my only gripe about this disc is that \\"Humanity\\" is not on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A talented DJ has evolved","review":"When I first listened to this album, I thought the lyrics were written by a bunch of horny teenage girls!

I purchased based on price and the fact I exclusively used TDK brand audio tapes years ago. Yes, I had difficulty installing, but that was because I used Windows' install feature, which couldn't find the enclosed drivers, instead of following the directions and using the installation utility supplied by TDK. DOH! Also, when duplicating discs, I encountered the application hanging, but I discovered this was caused by serious circular source disc scratches. Once cd's were fixed to remove the scratches, no problems encountered with the use. In spite of this, I don't hesitate to recommend. Computer installed on was 5yo Win 98 system, and no compatibility problems encountered.For the person who complained about not meeting performance claims, perhaps he was limited by a older 1.1 USB port .....Also worth noting, a request for assistance on the TDK website was promptly responded to the same day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great external CD-R/W","review":"I love my external TDK USB 2.0 CD-R/W Drive 40x12x48x.

It does not prevent you from using it with a thicker book, but it is a bit annoying.I had to go pick it up myself in the US, since most vendors in Canada were trying to sale it for twice the price (Amazon was not shipping in Canada).

Also, unless your monitor is well above the desk, anything you put in this will block the screen, plus you need room front to back room between your keyboard and monitor. Buy this only if you have the space and need the holder for heavy items. For papers (e.g., contracts, homework) use a document holder that is longer top to bottom (or tape the pages one at a time to a top corner of your monitor)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This was a horribly boring video that did nothing to raise my heart rate.

Here is a man who was truly caught between two cultures. Raised Lakota, educated as a western physician and fated to be on the Rosebud Reservation during the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, his destiny was to leave a record of what the First Peoples truly believed, and why.His language swings from simple to more formal. It is obvious that he wants to influence the more well educated western culture of his time. Often, he is awkward. But, always, the soul and integrity of what he is saying shines through.This book is meant for all who have native blood in their veins and for those who need to understand those that do. It echos the humility that is at the core of all our beliefs. It explains the Integrity of Soul that we have been searching for these many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runon Paradise","review":"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. If I did not have to read this book for a course I am taking I would not have bought it. Sentences are obsqure, incomprehensible, internally contradictory, tend to be at least three lines or longer and may not contain verbs.I think there may be some useful information in the book but gleaning it requires multiple readings of sentences and leaps of faith.There is considerable irony here because of the book's title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing = poor book","review":"This book is a very difficult read, much like Carrasquillo's other books. It is not because the material is challenging or because Carrasquillo asks us to think at a high level. It is beause Carrsquillo's writing style is poor, and her ideas only halfway conceived. In this way, it continues in the tradition of her earlier works. (I have been unfortunate to read her books because I have worked closely with her.) Carrasquillo is simply unintelligible at times, complicating what are in essence simple obvious statements, unworthy of passing off as academic work. Definitely a book only for those who enjoy readin (or are forced to read) the flawed essays and poor writing ithat characterize Carrasquillo's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith based enviromentalism.","review":"This is a faith based environmentalism - that is you must believe in the 'idea' of the free market for it to work.

I would put the Memorex music CD-R in the CD recorder and that dreaded OPC Error message would pop up. It was very frustrating. Unfortunately, that is exactly what has happened with about half of the TDK music CD-R's. I might as well buy the Memorex music CD-R's since they are half the price ($9.99) at Office Depot; and they are of the same quality.

The memorex worked great, 100% usable. The TDK not so much. So far I am seeing about 90% failure rate. Either my CR recorder (Philips brand) can't recognize it, or if it does, it won't finalize it after recording. Would not recommend these to anyone. However, different recorders react differently.

Unfortunately brave and attempt is all it is. The theology falls down because Ateek's exegesis is at best simplistic. While Ateek criticises 'Jews' for their exegesis, he uses only First Testament examples and not particularly well at that. I would have liked to see Ateek use, for example, one of the birth narratives as his base Biblical study.Ateek confuses with his seemingly interchangaeable use of 'Zionist' and 'Jew'. The book lacks the rigour of Gutierrez Sobrino and Boek, and adds little to the litertaure of Liberation Theology.

In the background is a Dies Irae like motive. Alas it is too short, but it is a lovely thing nonetheless.In the final movement, the Andante Cantabile, I found the calm which follows the storm. The brass is again sweeping, and not as frenzied.

Until I read other reviews and realized that a lot of the others where not made right and they were destroying ipods. But this one is not exactly pretty in the picture but it comes black and looks great. It is not made of the material in the picture that resembles a dash mat but they are stretchable and very comfortable. Not to mention at the time this was the cheapest one on amazon. so if you want the best bang for your buck and still want the armband to keep your shuffle safe...get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod Shuffle Armband Carrier","review":"This carrier allows me to fasten the iPod Shuffle securely to my upper arm so I don't have to worry about losing it. It is comfortable to wearand very handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weightlifters beware.....","review":"I was pretty disappointed with the Tune Belt because of two main reasons. First, I had to take my Shuffle out of the protective rubber case that I usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the Tune Belt. That wasn't such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve. But then I went to wear it for a run, and the arm-band was too small for my arm! I have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training, but nothing outrageous. I would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users. This is unfortunately not the case. So if you have larger than average biceps (say 17\\" amd up), save your money...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish one thing was different","review":"I consider this a great buy for my old ipod shuffle. It works great for my work-outs or for working in the yard. The only thing I wish was different was the way to tighten it-I wish it had a velcro strap instead of a pull-through buckle. It would be a little easier to pull on and off my arm. Overall I'm still happy with the purchase and would still buy this product again if I could not find one with velcro."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the great ones -","review":"Sounds like hyperbole but Eshpai's symphony #5 should be included as one of the great symphonies of the 20th century. This is what is written by a Russian muicologist in the notes to this CD. More unheard music from the old Soviet union. This music depicts sounds of the \\"Great War\\"; listen for the famous German panzer march, which Frankel used in Battle of the Bulge, with a Russian flavor, whistles and all. Dive bombing airplanes, artillary etc. The music makes lots of wonderful noise - lots of pounding brass, drums, and strings, and I mean a lot - and it leaves an unforgettable impression. The finale is something else. This version leaves out some cacophony at the end of the symphony, which Svetlanov did not leave out in his LP version. The Svetlanov is an incredible performance and will make your hair stand on end, if you can find it - not on CD. This performance is OK (one star off) just to hear the music tho. The symphony number 4 pales in comparison to this masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit louder now","review":"I purchased the Clarity w1000 to overcome the noise from a room air conditioner. It usually worked adequately for this task. However, sometimes or perhaps often a little more volume would have been useful. On my phone line, increased volume quickly turns into quite a bit of noise and hiss. This is more annoying than straining to hear the caller. My Panasonic KX-TG 5421 cordless phone with voice enhancer turns out to work better than the w1000. I probably should have returned the w1000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I work from home and bought this phone based on reviews I had seen in the past saying it was great for making sure you can be heard and understood.

I can not find a head set that works with this phone as it has a 3.5mm jack instead of the more common 2.5mm jack.

It comfortably amplifies voices to a comfortable level for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. You can adjust the volume higher or lower depending on the voice volume of the person speaking at the other end of the telephone. People without hearing loss can also comfortably use this phone; they simply do not engage the volume boost feature.

Figured the Nady could handle that, didn't need anything high end... As soon as I plugged it in I noticed a very significant background hiss just from it being plugged into my mixer... This was just XLR out from Nady to XLR in mixer nothing turned up nothing plugged in. The background noise was being created from the power running through it no matter where it was plugged in or using a different cord.. Tried different XLR, different power, and even tried the 1/4 connection with the same results.. So I tried an older Behringer UBB1002 using 1/4 outs and noticed how much quieter it was right away..

I like this combo as its the big four I seem to always hear about for joint health in large quantities and without much other filler. It dissolves pretty well and tastes alright, but I still like to mix it. I mix it with the Amazing Grass drink mix which easily covers up the taste of this and provides lots of other health benefits.

You're either sending up the \\"inbred redneck\\" genre, or you're just adding to the endless list. Backwoods is the latter. The only shred of plot divergence here is that the group of psycho's are living on a former military reservation, and somehow think the land belongs to them.

Eventually one by one these people are killed by crazed in-breeders living in isolation in the wilderness, kinda similar to \\"Wrong Turn\\" and \\"Hills Have Eyes\\" but the people in this movie are a big cult.

The Kalinnikov Second Symphony dates to 1953 and the Glazunov to 1969. The ear adjusts to the sound in the Kalinnikov somewhat but the sound is remarkably antiquated.

Nu-metal has ruined numerous bands, and now Nothingface joins their ranks. The songs are repetitive, the lyrics horrible, and the riffs weak. In addition, the sampling that was characteristic of Nothingface has been removed, most likely an effort to make the cd more like every other nu-metal album. There is notable anger on the album, but the lack of brutal riffs and a double bass kick subtract from it. Overall, I was left wonderring what happened to creativity.

If your looking for pure heavy go with pacifier, meledoic go with an audio quide to everyday atrocity, melodic heavy go with violence.

They're a lot better than a lot of the more famous bands out today. I find them better than Korn, Limp Bizkit, Staind, and even Cradle of Filth. \\"Skeletons\\" is a masterpiece, I gotta tell you. I will say no more, except that if they come to your town to play a show live, go and see them, they are worth every penny in your pocket!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"faint praise and happy accidents","review":"This is the debut album of a rising band from Louisville, Kentucky who are lead by Billy Bartley. Without a doubt, this is great music! If you are looking to make a comparison with better known musicians, well let's see: Boby Dylan, Tom Petty, and a touch of Counting Crows. Their sound has the right combination of guitar rhythm, drum beat, rockabilly and pleasant mystery. All of their tracks sound fantastic!! I am particularly fond of \\"tongue tied\\", \\"contradiction intention\\", \\"grace\\", \\"we can go\\", and \\"i feel\\". Don't miss adding these rising stars to your cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"..just brilliant","review":"Next to nobody has heard of these guys but this cd is really awesome - I know some people who thought it was a new Tom Petty record or something and I guess I can hear that in there too. But it's really just a right combination of wailing melody, shimmering guitarplay and just beautiful music. It does take a few listens to really grab you but most music I really like ends up being that way anyway. What can I say? It's always a delight to find such unknown bands before they make it to the big league and usually lose some of the magic. I dunno if these guys make it there, but it'd be a shame if they didn't. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth Brooks from Tulsa to the Top","review":"This was not a video promoting Garth Brooks. Instead it seemed to have the soul purpose of promoting a book called The Road Out Of Sante Fe. (Which I have also read.) They constantly go back to the one who wrote the book and has it beside him, behind him and any where else he can place the book. It is not a look at Garth Brooks as a person in country music. It shows him very little throughout the movie. I am an avid buyer of anything having Garth Brooks in it on the market today. To me as a fan I wish I had spent my money on something else besides this movie. Oh yeah and by the way I wouldn't have read the book if it wasn't free for the reading at the library. As for the other videos you have listed for Garth, I would highly recommend them for the true Garth fans but please spend your money on them and not this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, works; strong butyl rubber smell, thin cable.","review":"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g., running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"They get the job done and they are really cheap","review":"These are good cables - got them a year ago and they still work well. Now, two things to note - I've been using them mostly indoors AND I take good care of my gear.

But he is at his best with old instruments and old tunes, or tunes that he writes that sound like old tunes. Sting Crazy is one of his strongest efforts, with Mike playing all of the instruments including amazing finger-style guitar, different resophonic guitars, bass, and even a little mandolin. He respectfully reworks old standards, and adds several of his own new songs that have a similar feel. His voice is smooth and strong, and you won't find a better or more tasteful guitarist."},{"rating":"2","title":"love love love my le creuset, BUT....","review":"I don't think anyone can doubt that Le Creuset makes extremely high quality products. However, the only item in this kit that comes with a lid is the french oven.

I'm not even sure I can buy a lid to fit it now. Seems like all of the french ovens or stock pots or soup pots come with lids, but in my quick browse through this area of the site, I don't see saucepans with lids! I didn't think it would bother me when I got the kit, but I haven't been able to retire the junky old saucepans, since they have lids and can be used easily for steaming vegetables or rice or other lid-necessary dishes!

I really don't like the lyrics in it at all, and I don't think the instrumentals are nearly as good as the other one's; it's like he just put lyrics in place of good instrumentals. Nothing too dynamic in this album either, the only song that stood out in it for me was \\"In Heaven\\", but that's mostly just because I remember the song they are covering from the movie Eraserhead. The rest of them all kind of sounded the same to me.I'm sure plenty of people will still like it, just make sure you preview it before you listen.

I ignored those reviews that said there was a quality control problem and got my second canister only to find that I too am having problems with it. It's not sucking the air out as well as the one I bought back in February and the motor makes a strange sound. It's a great canister when it works, but they have to fix whatever is wrong with their latest shipment. The one I bought back in Feb is still working great. The one I received last week however is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries Need Frequent Replacing","review":"When the bean vac functions it does a decent job removing air from the canister. The natural oils on the coffee beans are visible and don't dry out as quickly...so long as the vac actually functions.This bean vac has a serious design flaw: The batteries require replacing weekly or twice a week. Whether the vacuum is set to reseal every 48hrs or 12hrs, the batteries need constant replacing. I've switched to rechargeable batteries and its not worth the additional effort. This is a poorly designed product and I zealously discourage readers from purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Coffee Freshness","review":"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is exceptionally picky and likes the nicer things. He really loves this little machine.

However, this canister creates a vacuum that lasts for an hour or two and then is gone. There is a button that will allow it to automatically renew the vacuum every 12 hours. However, that leaves the coffee without a vacuum for the bulk of the day. I could have gotten a silver-colored canister with an air-tight lid for about $5 and saved a lot of money. This is not a worthwhile purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works with expensive lithium batteries?","review":"I just received this as a gift and right out of the box, the unit didn't work with brand new Duracell or Rayovac [regular] batteries.

I've already contacted the manufacturer. I think I got a dud. I'm willing to update my review upon receipt of a new unit.UPDATE 3/9/2012Received a response from Valerie over at the company and this was her response:\\"Most will work with regular batteries, (not rechargeable). Any electronic device will last longer with lithium batteries, and we do recommend that you use lithium.We suggest using LITHIUM ENERGIZER AA Batteries. It does make a difference.

No way I'm spending that much on expensive batteries a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product IF you do the following","review":"Nice to know the beans are staying fresh..nice to hear the air swhoosh out but who wants to replace the batteries every few days because they skimped on the seal which allows air to enter and requires to batteries to activate to recreate the vaccum. I thought the interior cannister might seal better if it were a bit taller so i put about 8 of those small felt furniture pads on the bottom of the cannister and it seems to have done the trick...no batteries dying for a week now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at doing its job.","review":"I chose to ignore the numerous warnings people had about this particular product losing its seal, spoiling coffee prematurely.Well, I should have listened because that's exactly what this thing does. Worked fine for about a month, and then all of sudden, every time I look at the thing, the popper would be up indicating that there was air inside, and no vacuum in place.I've tried cleaning the rims of debris, and even placing heavy objects on top of the sealer to help give it a firmer press. Nothing really works past a temporary period, so you can make the safe assumption that this thing doesn't work.There are some other reviews about the unit needing an update to a newer version. I noticed those reviews date back to 2008-2009. I ordered this very recently in 2012, so if this company hasn't addressed these issues by now. I doubt they ever will."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better alternatives.","review":"I have owned two of these for 7 months now. One of them stopped holding a seal after about a month. The second one just stopped holding a seal also. I have taken the rubber rings out and cleaned both thoroughly. They still won't hole a seal for long.

I have two Vacu Vins coffee saver sets and they work much better and will hold a very tight seal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to send it back","review":"Unfortunately, this item didn't do what it was supposed to. After the first time, the button that is supposed to go down to show that the air has been vacuumed out stopped working.

Thought that was the point of this was that I could put the grounds directly in the canister. They sent me a whole list of things to do for it to work correctly. Bottom line is I think this would work great for beans....not so much for grounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the coffee fresh","review":"This is the second container I've bought in over 10 years.

Invest the time to learn it using her book, and you can do more than pass the test - you can retain it and apply it.One tip for exam takers - you have 15 minutes to review a demo of how to take the test. It should only take you about 2 minutes. However, USE THIS TIME to write down what's in your head, your formulas, and to \\"relax\\" by getting your thoughts together.

The secularists who write and edit this kind of collection of essays just can't get beyond their own prejudices. Most essays are difficult to read because of poor writing and a failure to really look and analyze what K. is saying. Also, the selection of topics are arbitrary, and I am sure most of the writers wish K. had only written Either/Or and perhaps Stages on Life's way.

Chevelle is one of my top 5 bands of all time so I think I know this bands albums...I have to buy their CD's multiple times cause I play them so much!! This new album is not as good as the last 2 for sure, but it is definately worth buying. At first listen it sounds a little dissapointing but there are some good quality songs, then the more you hear it the more you like it. It's not as hard hitting as their previous work, more like they are trying to sell more albums with this one...(see Metallica's black album)...but again, worth buying and a quality ROCK ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"After the knock-down, drag-out, rippin, lesser-band-killing CDs \\"Wonder What's Next\\" and \\"This Type of Thinking\\" I expected, and hoped for, a lot more in \\"Vena Sera\\". Their newest just doesn't seem to have either the hooks or the punch of previous efforts, and almost feels glossed over in a way. Their sound is less raw (one of the things that makes this band great), sounds more produced, and just plain isn't interesting. Insane drums and massive, crunching guitars have been replaced with nigh hollywood-like pablem, more remniscient of Disney than Chevelle. Even the vocals just aren't up to par with previous efforts. All this said, there are some rocking songs to be found here and there. But on the whole I just can't give this album my entire recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Overheard at a meeting of the new Chevelle: \\"We've made some great records in the past. We have a distinct sound, and we have built a strong, loyal following. With the addition of a new bassist, we need to change direction. We need to make a record that sounds like everything else on 'rock' radio today. Sure we'll alienate a lot of our fans, but we should be tired of being unique. We just want to fit in.\\"In the words of GWB, \\"mission accomplished.\\" This isn't a good record. It truly sounds like the rest of the pap on radio today - from the vocals to the music. All of the previous Chevelle records still receive regular rotation in my cd player. This one will not. What the heck happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevelle/Tool??????","review":"How could anyone with just an inkling of music knowledge compare Chevelle to Tool? I'm a fan of both and challenge you to choose a CD from both bands, listen to them back to back, and then try to tell me they sound the same. If you have no change of heart I don't know what to tell ya, go pick up some Lenny Kravitz, next you'll be saying his \\"version\\" of American Woman compared to the original.Oh and by the way Vena Sera is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, boring","review":"This is basically catchy radio-rock that's not catchy. Nothing about this album will offend, and nothing will inspire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid #4","review":"while nothing ground breaking, this album is a serious effort and deserves props. The vocal performance of pete is getting more and more unique (minus a few toolesque moments, antisaint in general). I would have to say that if this album was released back in the early turn of the century, they would have sold alot of albums, more then wonder did. This is a solid performance with well thought out singles, but missing the journey that a ground breaking album has with each track. Well mixed, better musicianship and good tone make this album a head above the rest of there albums, while no point #1 this album deserves a spin in any collection for months and maybe even years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like Chevelle???","review":"I can't believe all the reviewers who state \\"this CD sounds like Chevelle\\"??? Why in the heck would you buy a Chevelle CD if you don't want it to sound like Chevelle? These peoples brain cells must have rotted away from endless hours of watching reality TV programming. I think this CD sounds killer, and I like it much, much better than their last release! I did buy it at BB, so I got the CD and 2 extra tracks for $9.99, minus the $5 reward zone coupon I had. Maybe the best $5 I ever spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Freaking Rocks!","review":"I have each of the last two albums that Chevelle released, and I have to say after listening to Vena Sera for the third time: it freaking rocks!It's heavier than either of their last two albums, more hard-hitting, and if you're into that type of thing, then this album is right up your alley.Of note in particular: Antisaint, Safer Waters, Well Enough Alone, I Get It, and my favorite, Brainiac.Excellent songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2007","review":"Their best album yet! This was my favorite album and I'm not a huge Chevelle fan. I liked previous songs but never enjoyed an album like this from Chevelle. Enjoyed it from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rock album!!!!","review":"This is, IMHO, Chevelle's best yet. Good old fashioned hard rock. \\"Antisaint\\", \\"Straight Jacket Fashion\\" & \\"Humanoid\\" are strong songs definately worth cranking up in the car or on your MP3 player.I've read some reviews that state that this album sounds the same as their others. I wouldn't say it's the same but, yes, it is similar. After all, it is the same 3 guys that started the band. I like it and wouldn't change anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevelle cruises some new terrain","review":"The Amazon.com reviewer, in what has become classic inside-baseball music reviewer style, puts down another band that first came to life on a \\"Christian\\" label [Steve Taylor's Squint Records], and because its vocalist reminds you of a vocalist in the \\"secular\\" market, \\"It's A Ripoff And It's Not That Good.\\" [See: Chevelle vs. Tool, formerly Creed vs. Pearl Jam and even dc Talk vs. U2.] In truth, this album is quite experimental in a number of places and doesn't appear to qualify as the same old Chevelle...except for those crunching guitars and throbbing bass sonics typifying the \\"solid\\" sound that, as the reviewer grudgingly admits, Chevelle seems to deliver on every CD. As usual with Chevelle, you'll probably hate half the tracks, love the other half, and as another reviewer noted, that kind of hit ratio is a lot better than most bands have been posting for decades. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty sweet sound.....a little different for Chevelle, but still good.","review":"This album is about a 7.5 out of 10 for me. I picked up this album after I read a review on another site, and I wasn't extremely happy with it, but I wasn't disappointed either. After reading the review, I thought it would be great on my first listen. It took me about 3 listens to really start liking the songs. It's definitely different than anything they've done, and I personally like the more upbeat style here. Tracks 1 and 10 are my favorites. Pretty sweet sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same old chevelle....","review":"If you liked their last effort (This Type of Thinking), you should definitely check out this cd. Typical Tool/Helmet type riffs with melodic choruses. \\"Safewaters\\" sounds like a single that belongs on a spiderman soundtrack. Theres more experimentation on this album than other Chevelle cds, more acoustic guitars and effects on some tracks. All in all, a pretty solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album, a must buy for Chevelle fans","review":"I don't get why all these people are complaining about the CD. I love this CD. It's as good or better than Wonder What's Next. I don't know where people get that this new album doesn't have the distinct Chevelle sound, because it sure does. Excellent lyrics, awesome guitar, bass, and drums as usual. The tracks Midnight to Midnight, Humanoid, Antisaint, and possibly my favorite Chevelle song, Straight Jacket Fashion (Heck I might as well throw in the rest of the album) are super great. If you like Chevelle any, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same Old (Amazing) Chevelle","review":"I've been a huge fan of Chevelle since WWN and currently own every one of there albums. It is my opinion that Vena Sera is their best album to date after WWN. If you are even a moderate Chevelle fan definately pick this album up. I promise you you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not sure...","review":"I'm not sure what album a lot of these folks are listening to and/or \\"reviewing.\\" Vena Sera is Chevelle at their best! Rest assured, the riffs on this one are brutal (Midnight to Midnight anyone?) and Pete's singing is better than ever. The best part? It's radio-friendly and instantly likeable. Even my wife, who's bored with most of the \\"rock\\" out there today, thought it sounded great and wanted to know who this was.I thought the Best Buy bonus tracks were very cool, but then again I'm a Chevelle fan and I guess a lot of these folks aren't.Vena Sera = another great album by Chevelle."},{"rating":"1","title":"wonder whats next? a new label!","review":"chevelles first two albums, point #1 and wonder whats next is alot like taproots first two albums gift and welcome, the band starts off good then decides they need a little extra money in their pockets, so they change to make money, not keep the fans listening. and i'm a listening and i'm dissapointed. point#1 is a great albumn, wonder whats next a step up, but they just squezzed all the juice dry on their last two albums. they have nothing left, or maybe their wondering whats really next for this trio."},{"rating":"1","title":"what cd?","review":"well i would review this product but i never recieved it because you guys sent it to the wrong address. or you just didnt send it. just like when you didnt send the two books i ordered. sorry but this will be the only review i am writing because i wont be purchasing from you guys again. ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many great moments!","review":"This is a great album! The recording is sensational. Easily the best mix they've ever had.The guitars are absolutely crushing. Very impressive layering.Most of the songs sound great. This is the first album of Chevelle's that I can listen to pretty much right through without getting bored.They're apparently touring down here in Australia soon and it will be great!Go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best to date","review":"In my opinion, this is Chevelle's best effort yet. For me , \\"I Get It\\" is the best track on the CD. I enjoy \\"Saturdays\\", \\"The Fad\\" and \\"Midnight to Midnight\\" as well. Great production without being overly glossy. There are a lot of Heavy rock bands out there and Chevelle is really coming into their own identity with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevelle Still Rocks","review":"I have to say that my favorite Chevelle CD is 'Wonder What's Next'. Especially the 'Evening with El Diablo' song, I LOVE that song. I agree with the others about the slower, acoustic type song missing at the end of Vena Sera. But I do like the songs 'Well Enough Alone', 'The Fad', the song before 'The Fad', can't remember the name. I was a little worried before buying this CD that I wasn't going to like it, but I listened to it 2 times and I'm really starting to love this CD. Sometimes with the CD's I love the most, it takes a few listens. I definitely recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Great album. \\"Brainiac\\" and \\"Saferwaters\\" are my favorite songs. It seems they tuned back up from A (or B... one of those) to D-tuning, so thats why it isn't so... \\"hard\\". I think it sounds fine, they sound great like they always do. \\"Point #1\\" was in d-tuning, and I like that album more than these last 3. By the way... They DO have 4 albums, NOT just three, for all those who are calling this their 3rd album.This is great album. And just because some of these songs were based on Unreleased songs, doesn't mean the \\"Unreleased songs\\" were the last album rejects. They were most likely not done or up to what Pete was looking for at the time. He probably finished them the way he wanted to (if they were finished before they probably would've replaced some of the past songs on the past albums).Songs like \\"Brainiac\\", \\"Saferwaters\\", and \\"The Fad\\" are the highlights of this album, IMO.4 Stars for this one! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great, unfortunately","review":"I've been a big Chevelle fan since Wonder What's Next, and even went back and listened to Point 1 as well. I really loved WWN and This Kind of Thinking, but especially the slower pieces that let the listener hear the passion in Pete's voice. Vena Sera doesn't have any pieces that you could consider slow, compared with Panic Prone and To Return, and that's what keeps me from giving it all five stars.The pieces are all very good and most of them sound distinct, but without the slower pieces in there to break it up a bit, unfortunately I don't believe that it matches to their former works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medio-core","review":"I have been a fan since their first album. I love the first album, wasn't a big fan of Wonder Whats Next and, again, loved This Type of Thinking...So, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I like every other Chevelle album that comes out. This one seems comletely uninspired. I can't wait until the next one. Based on history, it should be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!!!","review":"Deffinitely The Best Chevelle CD So Far!

Point #1: (pun intended) Chevelle's sophmore album \\"Wonder Whats Next\\" is so good that it will be really hard to ever top it. I thought they came close with \\"This Type Of Thinking...\\" but lets face it, WWN is in the top 10 albums of all time for me. #2: This had been said by someone else. Theres no softer, \\"toned down\\" song on here. I also really like the slower side of Chevelle. That being said, this album is still excellent. It is straight forward rock. Great CD to take to the gym with you. In my opinion not quite as good as WWN, but ranks up there with their 3rd album and definately worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album from a great band","review":"The title say it all folks. I've been waiting awhile for a new Chevelle album since I picked up This Type of Thinking.The album is like all of Chevelle's other albums that is great pounding riffs,great songwriting,and of course Petes voice.I myself wonder why these guys are not getting the credit they deserve cause in my mind they are ten times better then 30 Seconds to Mars,Breaking Benjamin,Staind,etc.Alright the only reason I didn't give them a 5 but a 4.5 was because This Type of Thinking is my favorite album I've ever bought in my mind.So thats my review hope you agree with me >_<"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevelle, Vena Sera, alternative rock, metal","review":"Chevelle music is again, strong, intense, moody,deep.

The book is set up alphabetically by subject and it includes many topics from fatness to jealousy. While you would probably need at least a cursory understanding of some plays to use the quotations properly, the author does a nice job of making comments and synopses when necessary. This book is very easy to use. I recommend it to anyone who is an avid reader of Shakespeare, or a student of English literature and would like to look up his wonderful musings (in characters and in his own sonnets) on everyday subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voices of the Faithful","review":"If you want to understand what God is doing in the world and in the lives of Christians you should read this devotional . It has some great stories and is written by Missionaries.

I love this what a great gift for CHRISTmas eternal Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Compilation","review":"This is not just another devotional. This is a superb collection of personal experience from christians serving as missionaries around the world.The structure is stories divided in 366 days (includes Feb 29th) and you are suppose to read one story per day during a full year. But the stories are so good and touching that you are always tempted to read much more than just one.One particular story that touched me deeply was the \\"We All Scream for Ice Cream!\\" This particular story describes how we should depend completely on God. If we trust in him, he will provide all our needs. Most of the time what we need comes as a direct answer to a prayer.This book was written by Beth Moore in 2010 and published by Thomas Nelson and they were kind enough to send me a copy for reviewing through their Thomas Nelson Book Review Bloggers Program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply enjoyed it.","review":"I tried using this as a devotional, but it was hard to put down after just reading for one day.

Though I myself am not familiar with many of her other works, \\"Voices of the Faithful\\" impressed me greatly.Moore compiles an array of stories written in short essays outlining missionaries throughout the world. Combining each story follows and illustrates a theme or lesson encapsulated in a scripture verse.Set up like a daily devotional, \\"Voices of the Faithful\\" reminds us that as Christians, we are part of a world-wide family of God. Each of us faces different challenges and joys, and hearing testimonies from our brothers and sisters around the world is both encouraging and helpful for refocusing our attention on Christ. This compilation, set up in an easy to read devotional form will bless and encourage you in your daily walk with Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"voices of the faithful","review":"I recently received a copy of \\"Voices of the faithful\\". This is a devotional book with devotions for every day of the year. The devotions are compiled by many different Christians all over the world. Each month has a specific theme, and all the stories relate to that theme. Each devotional starts with a scripture that pertains to the story. The person's name, who is telling the story, is at the bottom. As well as what part of the country they live in. At the end is a prayer that connects with the devotional. Overall being my first devotional book I thought it was really good. And I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Godsend","review":"If I did not know otherwise, I would have assumed that the book was brand new. As a college student at a very competitive secular school, it is very important to be constantly in the Word. With my heart for missions, this book was the perfect match. I feel rejuvenated every day and my heart for missions grows. Thank you for providing this book for me. It is a true Godsend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a great book. I would recommend it to everyone. It gives a good understanding of the lives of missionaries and how God is at work with each of them. I especially loved the stories of answered prayers such as when a missionary's van was stolen. The thief put all new tires on it (which the missionary needed but couldn't afford) and outfitted it in a fine manner. When the police found it and returned it to the missionary all upgraded, it brought a smile to my face, and I'm sure to his. There's a story for every day of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for backyard wars...Not a professional gun","review":"This is a gun for beginners/low intermediate shooters.

Dirr has composed a book of vast information. Sticking to the zones of North America, Dirr goes into scientific description of each species of plant, including form, foliage, bark, flower, culture, landscape use, size and hardiness to its indigenous zone. This collection is made more special as there is are good black and white photographs of each plant material. These photos are meant to only show the \\"typical\\" appearance, as all plants will vary with age and growth conditions. It is especially helpful that each plant and photograph is keyed numerically to the text for reference to the Scientific Name Index. This extensive book on woody plant materials is a must for any landscape enthusiast. The only thing lacking are color photographs, but it is still a complete piece of referential work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series Withering on the Vine","review":"I've been growing less and less enchanted with the series as it goes along. This continues its decline.Initially, the spectre haunting Rutledge held me fascinated.Was the Rutledge nuts or haunted? However, as the series continues we get no deeper into Rutledge resolving his psychological conflicts. (It would have been better, if he was just haunted.) I assume he's going to have to visit every county in Britain, Scotland, and Ireland (at one book each) before its resolved.Also, this book continues the author's recent perchant for making the least credible character to be the murderer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian Rutledge Series","review":"I have enjoyed this series. I recommend that readers new to Ian Rutledge (the detective) start with the early books if possible. It helps to understand the war trauma Rutledge suffered and resulting discussions Rutledge has with a deceased comrade from the horrific warfare in France in World War I. (I won't say more about these converesations because a new reader needs to read about these first hand from the books.) There was in this book, as in others featuring Rutledge,interesting twists and turns in the story and multiple story lines keeping you wondering what the connections are among the different cases Rutledge is investigating. There are descriptions of the impact of WW1 on England and the returning solidiers. Besides being a good mystery, I think the the Rutledge character offers insights into the PTSD veterans of earlier wars suffered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles Todd's books","review":"I really like the Ian Rutledge character and the way Charles Todd represents England during this time period.

First, I just ordered it yesterday morning and chose standard shipping - it was on my doorstep just after noon today! Secondly, it did not come with a bunch of needless packing, just the pan in the box with some cushioning, no excess for me to dispose of.

One aspect I enjoyed a whole lot was the abilities of Lobo's bike! :) Who knew....ah but let's not add any spoilers.Well written by and large, I only dinged a star for slight similarities to already established storylines (would have only dinged half if that were allowed).

(Simpsons did it!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak effort","review":"I looked at the book and because Lobo, the Martian Manhunter and Superman were in it I purchased the book assuming that it would be a good story with great fight scenes between the main characters. The book has very little action. It spends much of the time portraying Lobo as a Wolverine rip-off and the Manhunter as a Sap. The first half of the book has no action. Surprisingly (or not with such a week story) there is much inuendo and sexual content which was unexpected because these are characters that teenagers would be interested in. It was truly a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for flush cutting","review":"Although the description says: \\"Perfect for flush cutting dowels and plugs as well as trimming the bottom of door jambs for tile or hardwood floors\\", there are studs on the bottom that secure the handle. So you can't flush cut with it. The teeth are set in only one direction, as you expect from a flush-cut saw, but they're set up on one side, and down on the other!

There is no analysis of case law or statutes and the \\"legal\\" content mainly consists of suggestions to \\"see a lawyer\\" in certain situations. For example, if you have been discriminated against in air travel, the book suggest you should \\"see a lawyer.\\" If you have any experience in traveling, stay away from this book.

Each work, it would seem, is essential in the string quartet repetory. The performances of these works is very good, but probably not the best on the market although to have both of these works on one CD is certainly tempting for the amateur and collector both. Unfortuately the total timing on this CD is less than 50 minutes which is probably why this CD when I got it was marked down three times and which I bought for pennies on the dollar new and sealed. Other than the poor value for the money this CD is very good and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the combination of the great Shostakovich string quartet No.8 and Beethoven's Grosse Fuge, op.133."},{"rating":"1","title":"One short movie plus lots of archive footage","review":"The premise about American soldiers missing in action in the Vietnam war still being in Vietnam is an interesting one. But it's not well executed. Not until after watching the movie did I learn that the flashback scenes were archive footage from another movie, (Under Heavy Fire, aka. Going Back). That explains the difference in production values between those scenes and present-day sceness that were actually shot for this movie. The present-day storyline is very thin and seems to be nothing more than a means to connect the flashback scenes, in order to get two movies for the production cost of one and a half. The result is rather incoherent and also quite dull and unsatisfying. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting Read!!!","review":"Katangole's work is in the genre of books that present a landscape of recent developments in post-colonial and post-apartheid African theologies.

I felt that this book was a huge let down. Other reviewers have mentioned the \\"weak\\" mystery, the mystery was so weak, that there wasn't really one. What I've always enjoyed about these books are the daring and sometimes thoughtless escapades the Emerson's are always engaging in. Ramses is one of my all time favorite characters, but now seeing him so absorbed with family life, he's just boring. I hope if Peter's decides to write another Amelia book, it's not focused so much on domestic life. She should work on a new Vicky Bliss book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story--good story line","review":"I am currently listening to the audio CD of this book. This is the first exposure I have had to this author. The story is great but runs a little slow in areas. I find it fun to listen to. I am grateful to Elizabeth Peters for keeping it relatively clean as far as language goes. Her books are fun and refreshing and keep the reader/listener inerested enough to want to find out what happens next. Thank you Elizabeth for a GREAT read.I've listened to Elizabeth George mystery books. They could be good stories but there is so much profanity in the character dialogue that it ruins the story. I have had to return the books back to the library after the first chapter because it was so bad.

I can hardly wait to get to the next one on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continues","review":"Ms Peters continues to weave real historical events into her stories.

I await each edition of the saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of dialog about not much","review":"The novel Tomb of the Golden Bird by Elizabeth Peters is a long and slow. Frankly, after listening to the entire unabridged version, I am still trying to understand what the plot is all about. This book lacks a conflict or a purpose and resolves nothing at the end.Set in the early 1900's in Egypt during the discovery of the Tomb of King Tut (The Golden Bird), several British characters walk around and talk alot, but, not about much. The \\"sub-plot\\", the opening of the tomb and the vast collection of treasures contained inside was the most interesting parts of the book, but, again, they were a sub-plot.This is really too bad, it had a great setting with an interesting event to write about, but, just nothing to say. The characters were rather flat and un-interesting. No action, no adventure, no drama, my advise is no read it. This is one you can skip reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumped the shark","review":"I usually try to be thoughtful and reasoned when doing a review, but this book was just plain bad. This series jumped the shark several books ago, but I keep hoping Peters will realize this and turn the series over to a new generation of characters that *might* be able to breath some new life and new ideas into the plotlines.Alas, this is nothing but a \\"clips show\\" of old material (Sethos as rogue - we get it! David entangled in Egyptian independence - done! And, PLEASE, no more visions of Abdullah, family Xmas celebrations, councils of war, tea at Shepherd's or Kadija's green goop!) thrown together in hopes of suckering fans of the series into spending money. My advice: if you *have* to read this one, borrow it from the library. I know I won't be purchasing any more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear!","review":"This is the first Amelia Peabody mystery I have read and it will definitely be the last. What a bore! The character development seemed stifled, perhaps because of the very large number of them that filled space for no apparent reason. I found no suspense, no mystery, just a vague hope with each turning page that something might improve. Instead this is the first novel which I found myself constantly looking at my watch to see if I had endured enough. I suppose after 17 other stories, the rest of the series must be at least reasonable, but this one has convinced me not to attempt to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy Buggy ..... doesn't run in OS X needs classic mode","review":"This product does not run in OS X it only runs in classic mode yet on the order page it makes NO mention of this.

As a pocket-sized book it is much more affordable than most of the regular textbooks on the market, and I strongly recommend faculty teaching introductory courses to consider this fine and readable little book.

This microphone works great so far. I was not sure about it when I first saw it. However, the feature that bought me was that the cable converts from XLR (end that plugs into mic.) to a 1/4\\" end. This feature is great because you can plug the microphone into a small amplifier used for guitars and such. Also, you can plug into the \\"tape/cd\\" hole. This allows you to play something, i.e guitar, and use the micropone at the same time. I strongly suggest this microphone for aspiring singers. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality inexpensive microphone.","review":"Great sounding mic. Durable, built well. You do need to have some amplification to run it. Some sort of preamp.

The plastic material used for shipping would have been perfect, but certainly did nothing to protect this item from any bouncing or dropping etc. during shipping. Bottom line is that I had paid over $8.00 in shipping and handling to purchase it and another over $8.00 to return it. That was more than the cost of the item itself!

But something has gone seriously wrong with this CD -- there is the usual bronchial Russian audience, but I can overlook that. It is the sound itself, which is badly distorted, with digital clicks -- this leads me to believe that the problem arises from a very poor re-mastering. Richter also recorded Beethoven's 3rd Concerto for Deutche Gramophon with the Vienna SO conducted by Sanderling, in the 60's. Surely they will reissue this recording soon -- it is the one to wait for, unless a new re-mastering can salvage the Kondrashin one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book blending accounting, investing and finance !","review":"This book is also a bestseller in Japan.

Zip.If you use three times the recommended serving, you'll find it subtly makes your popcorn taste like cheddar, and I do mean subtle. You'll have to hunt for the flavor. Don't expect cheesy popcorn because you won't get it with this seasoning.It doesn't cling to the popcorn very well either, which further diminishes the flavor. You'll need to prep the popcorn by popping in oil or by pouring butter on after you air-pop the popcorn.Oh well. The search to make air-popped popcorn tasty goes on, because this product ain't it.That said, the flavor is pretty good, but as previously mentioned, I can't taste it unless I use way more than the recommended serving size, which then defeats the low-calorie benefit.

Like reviewer \\"Swimmer79\\" I think Linksys should have separated the antenna from the card and allowed users to put the antenna somewhere else via a cable. With the antenna mounted on the back of the card directly, you have to orient the PC with the back (the antenna)pointing to the router to get better signal which is not always possible. Under this conditions (brick walls) I would recommend to use a Wireless USB Adapter (WUSB11 or similar)or a Wireless Access Point (WAP11 or equivalent)which is separated from the PC, so you can place it in the best position to obtain a good link."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Cards Installed Effortlessly","review":"I installed these cards in a 200mhz IBM and a newer Compaq.

This let me use the Linksys utility to handle the setup and things were smooth from then on. Signal strength is excellent - much better than from the SMC PCI card I'd been using earlier.

The first song that hooked me was \\"Go Buck...\\". Still haven't figured that lyric out... :P Second song to hook me was \\"Call Him\\"...with the smooth, fast flowing and never a blocky-choppy transition of lyrics and great beats. So I got \\"Fallen\\" album.Flame and all the 'friends' in tow on the same production label are just what the young generation needs. Not one song is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLAME Does It Again","review":"Third time is a charm for FLAME on this album. Whether you are new to Christian rap or a regular listener, FLAME's message is clear and inspired. As the title suggests, the album attacks issues in our world from a Christian perspective.

Still, I finished the book this afternoon and I have to say it's one of the best books on Crawford that I've ever read.Never in a million years did I think a new insight into the complicated Crawford mind could emerge but the author pulls out all the stops here and lets us in on Crawford's wonderful world of letters. Over fifty years of correspondence...amazing!A real gem for the classic movie fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the REAL Joan","review":"If you weren't already a Joan Crawford fan you will become one after reading this book. This is probably the first book about Joan Crawford that doesn't focus on the scandals and instead shows you who the real woman was. The amazing thing is that the author got permission to write this book from Joan's very private children!!! Buy a few extra copies because this would make a great gift for any movie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Points of interest are...","review":"If you buy this book you'll be impressed with -The retail price. A great bargain!The many candid photos that have never been published before now.The selection of personal letters written by Joan Crawford spanning five decades.The foreword by her grandson which completely contradicts all previous reports about Crawford ruling with an iron fist.Many new insights are included throughout. A wonderfully entertaining read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Everything Joan said was gold! Loved it!!It was interesting how professional and business like joan was even with lovers and close friends.I especially loved how joan would let certain people have it while still giving off the impression of being sweet and professional.I loved how joan would restate each question or statement someone had made in their letters...and offer her own answer or rebutal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"A fabulous book!!!!!!!!!! I am thrilled someone finally wrote a positive book about Joan Crawford. This book was written with the approval of Joan's daughters and has a touching forward by her grandson. You get to see the real Joan - an ambitious actress, a caring friend, and someone who was devoted to her fans. Joan probably loved her fans more any other star and I'm sure all her fans will enjoy reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan Crawford: Her Life In Letters","review":"This book by film historian Michelle Vogel is a true delight! Not only does it contain Joan Crawford's letters dating from 1923 to 1977, but also includes many candid photographs, an excellent biography and bibliography, and helpful explanations relating to events and people mentioned in the letters. We are even treated to early poetry penned by a youthful Joan as well as some of her personal recipes. This book candidly reveals the actress with her insecurities, strengths, sense of humor and the affectionate gratitude she expressed to her friends and fans. This book is insightful and entertaining: a \\"must have\\" for anyone wishing a glimpse into the private, busy world of Joan Crawford!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Buyer BewareBefore you spend your money buying this book you should know that:1) It [appears that it] has not been proofread2) There are inaccurate facts sprinkled throughout the book that any fan of Joan Crawford will recognize immediately (what fan doesn't know the name of Joan's first picture?)3) A great many of the letters are available for free viewing at more than one fan website, and can be seen in their entirety, rather than transcribed portionsIf historical accuracy, original material, and literate writing are important to you, you will be disappointed.If, as a fan of Joan Crawford, owning copies of these freely available letters in book form overrides mis-typed words and facts that you know are wrong, then you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author should study English composition","review":"I gave this book one star for the following reasons. When I buy a book, I expect that its author will have had the respect for his or her readers to have put out an edited and proofread product. This book has far more than a few typos (not \\"typo's\\"). It is rife with incomplete sentences and inconsistent and/or incorrect punctuation. Language, grammar, words, sentence structure, spelling, etc., are a writer's tools of trade, so it's a puzzle why this book is such a mess. Even self-published books must meet some standards. Joan Crawford's letters prove that she used and respected the rules of literate writing and, if she was the perfectionist she was reputed to have been, I can only believe she would scorn this book. It baffles me how her ardent fans can condone it. Surely they should demand better for their beloved Joan Crawford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather a joke.","review":"A bunch of letters copied from online. Okay, but what do you do with them? Author Vogel doesn't do anything but slap them down on pages and create a lot of filler to go with them: a meatloaf recipe (!), a completely unrelated section on \\"celebrity stalkers.\\" And somehow she got Joan Crawford's grandson to write an introduction, which was only very mildly interesting.Vogel's original contribution to the book (that is, the part aside from Joan's letters) was an introduction that attempts to give some insight into Joan's career, life, etc. I've only read it once, but already counted 6 or 7 factual errors. And it's poorly written to boot.(...) It's poorly written, and the quality of the pages and photos is poor, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"I'm glad to see letters from Miss Crawford to show another side of her but alot of the letters are just chit-chat and don't say that much of interest. There's also a problem with the facts here. I know a little about Miss Crawford, well more than a little, and there's so much that's just not correct. (Some people allready mentioned specifics below so I won't repeat them.) The introduction from Joan's grandson was interesting to read. But overall you can tell that not alot of time and effort went into the book as far as the facts and writing. (I've also read most of these same letters on-line so I was kind of hoping for different letters from the ones I had allready seen.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Monsters Here","review":"I am so happy that Joan's side has been told since the black cloud of \\"Mommie Dearest\\". I think that Christina's story is based on anger and jealousy issues she had with Joan that were never resolved and therefore she presented Joan as a monster. This book is a must read for anyone and the presentation was a creative way of telling Joan's own story of what a loving, caring, hard working and giving person she was. Thank you MichelleLaura Canapa"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the photos alone","review":"If you only buy this book for one reason, buy it for the photographs. A lot of reviews have already covered different aspects of the entire work so I won't repeat those thoughts here.It's uncommon to find a photo of Joan Crawford that hasn't been seen somewhere. This book has many photos that look like they belong in a family album. The candid shots of Crawford with her fans are amazing! - The other photographs of her signing letters, photos, etc...carries the overall theme of the book's topic well. If you want a light casual read about Joan Crawford, buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"Love this cd. It's old so the lyrics are kind of dated but there are some great tunes on it. She's come a long way since then but this is definitely worth buying until her new stuff comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leeze","review":"Can I please give this ZERO stars? This may be the most disappointing piece of pop crappola that I have ever purchased. The lyrics are cheesy, the music lame and tired, and such a huge difference from what I was expecting.

Get this girl a songwriter, and stop trying to make her into a pop princess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Sound!!!

I personally hate them. They are lumpy and weigh alot. My husband likes the pillows for comfort and neck support, but within 1-2 months, the inside lining that holds all the loose crumbled foam, it rips easily and makes the foam lumpy and uneven and the pillow is very unsightly. Tempur-pedic should have found a way by now to improve the quality of the inner lining to prevent this. We paid $100 for each pillow and wehave exchanged the pillows twice.

I slept through the night like a corpse, hardly moving; calm, restful nights' sleeps. My girlfriend called it \\"the brick\\" because is was heavy and felt really stiff, but it did the job, forming around my head and neck snugly. BUT, after about 8 weeks it has lost its firmness and memory and is like a cheap foam pillow. Having paid $130 dollars for a pillow I expect a whole heck of a lot more than this, particularly from a respected brand such as Tempurpedic. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I would NOT RECOMMEND this pillow to anyone. I don't plan on spending this much on a pillow again."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"Firstly, the production quality is just a bit off on a few tracks but still good.

With the exception of the Miles Davis' classic \\"Nardis\\" all of the compositions are excellent Rachel Z originals. Mike Mainieri of Steps Ahead produced this her second album in 1993.Rachel divides the CD into acoustic and electric/contempory sections. The acoustic tracks feature David Sanchez (sax), Charnette Moffett (bass) and Al Foster (drums). On the electric tracks Rachel plays piano and keyboards. The other musicians include David Mann (sax), Lenny White (drums)and Victor Bailey (bass). Gumbi Ortiz plays percussion in both groups.Rachel is a superb pianist and the tunes are great, this is a very polished and enjoyable album. The CD booklet features numerous pictures of Ms. Z in glamorous poses and you have to conclude that men have it easier, nobody expects male jazz musicians to look sexy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transfer Is A Disaster! That's Why Only 1 Star!!","review":"Despite my 1 star rating, this is indeed a 5 Star performance, the best performance since Scherchen's early 50's Westminster Mono Lp Set. If this does not necessarily surpass the Scherchen in terms of performance, it is indeed the finest performance we have in Stereo. Unfortunately Russian Disc has totally botched the sound in their transfer. The 2 Lp set which was on Columbia/Melodiya some 20-25 years ago, had much much nicer sound. Fortunately, an alternative CD transfer exists on the Locked In The Vault Label ( Cat # 50 ), which is far superior to this Russian Disc disaster, and also a step or two above the old Columbia/Melodiya Lp set as well!!

I actually was really annoyed by that aspect of both books. The romance part, such as it was, was silly and embarrassing. It was not all bad though.

It's been a long time since I was that disgusted watching something, and that's a good thing. I'm a huge fan of horror films so I like to be grossed out and scared. While this film didn't scare me it almost made me look away. This would rank right up there with watching The Thing and An American Werewolf in London when I was a child and then again watching Cannibal Ferox (Make Them Die Slowly) when I was a teenager. So I give this film 4 stars for the plain fact that is lived up to it's potential and made me sick to my stomach. Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea vs the movie","review":"I thought this movie was worthless... I remember first seeing it about 15 years ago because of all the hype behind it. After searching and searching I found myself a copy and paid a ridiculous amount for it. The plot and the idea behind the movie is way better than the actual movie itself. I was excited to get it but truly disappointed to see it. Personal opinion... If you haven't seen it; save your money and let your imagination run wild with what it could have been... Otherwise you will be soarly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"The way this cable is set up the vga cable is set up as an extention cable, male one end female other so when hooking up from a computer to monitor you have to use a male back to back to make it work, unless your monitor or computer has an male plug connection.For the green and blue jacks there all males ends, when hook into the computer thats ok but for the mouse and key board you can forget it unless they have female ends on there plugs.or you get some form of back to back female coupler to make it work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Dragonlance ever!","review":"I thought they would bring out a book about our favorite wizard.

I found myself reading this everywhere I went wanting to know what was going to happen next. I will say that the only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because I was a little let down it didn't have more about Raistlin at school and the trials/tribulations he wen through. To me it seems like they could have expanded on that piece and not had so much of the book dedicated to Caramon, Kitiara, Sturm, Tanis, Tasslehoff, and Flint. Fully realize that these other characters are important in the story to come but felt that Soulforge should have been more focused on Raist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A resounding eh","review":"I am not quite sure why people are giving this 5 stars and a perfect rating. This is nowhere near classic literature, nor is is a wonderous example of english prose.All that aside, I simply found this book slow. If you are a huge Raistlin fan, then this might have something for you. Really all you do is follow his life day by day from childhood to adulthood. Really boring and drab with about 3 pages total of action.The second book in this set was much better, and I would pick up a third if it gets written. By itself, this book doesn't really stand for itself at all. I have liked many of Weis' books, but this one is down there at the bottom of the stack."},{"rating":"1","title":"character assassination","review":"While there were some interesting bits in this book and it was readable, for the most part it completely undermined the character of Raistlin, contradicts previous books, and is generally annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Dragonlance book ever","review":"Why did they make Raistlin look like a total pansy.

This is a very good example of a last ditch effort to save the Dragonlance novels which have been going down in ratings for a few years.

It tells about his ambitions at a young age. This book tells you alot about his family members and what kind of bond they had or didnt have.

But other than that, I thought it was great! A must-read for Dragonlance (and Raistlin) fans everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! A Must for all True Dragonlance and Raistlin Fans","review":"Margaret Weis is truly in her element here. Finally the true story of Raistlin told by the one person who knows him best. Raistlin has always been my favorite character in the Dragonlance world, and I eagerly awaited the coming of this book, once I knew of it. This book is excellent. I could not put it down, it did a wonderful job defining the \\"blows\\" that shaped the young mages soul, and provided valuable insight into why he did the things he did. This book is Raistlin's story, and his alone. If you want to know more about the other characters pasts, then look, elsewhere, because here is where you get to see them through Raistlin's eyes, and how he interprets them. I love this books and it is a very welcome addition to the Dragonlance world. Very Highly Recommended and a MUST Read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book. answered questions I always wanted to know.","review":"Excellent book.

If you are a fan of Raistlin this novel is a must. Very immersive and very well narrated, and it clearly shows that MW is one of the best if not the best author in this field. I want more Dragonlance novels from MW."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best DragonLance books !","review":"The SoulForge is a great book! A must for all DragonLance and Raistlin fans! Altough the end of the book, about Raistlin's test, is a little disappointing, it is still a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not entirely about one character","review":"While the book was well written and an excellent addition to the Dragonlance series, I think it should have been titled differently. The book may focus on Raistlin quite a bit, but it also provides a good deal of background into many of the original characters. Another 50 pages could have been added to make it fit nicely with the Chronicles. The section describing his experience with the Test was a bit disappointing, too. It was a good book, however. It's just the title that was a bit misleading. A must have for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book brings you closer to the characters in the Chron.","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it told you a lot about the characters of the Dragonlance Chronicles. I realize its value even better now that I'm reading its sequel (Dragons of Autumn Twilight). If you read this book then I would definitely recommend going on to the other books in the Dragonlance Chronicles. This would also be a good book to read for someone who's already read the Chronicles and wants to learn more about the characters' pasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelously well-done","review":"Unlike the cesspool of nonsense that Jean Rabe has brought us with her pathetic attempts at the Fifth Age Trilogy and her follow-ups on them, Margaret Weis has brought a stunning, in-depth look at young Raistlin Majere's life, detailing his schooling with the inept Master Theobald, his first love, the meeting of the companions, his parents, and the Seeker Gods. I found this to be an incredibly addictive story, and it even included a foreward by Tracy Hickman. The Dragonlance Team has done a superb job bringing up the heroes, and Weis has done a magnificient job in furthering it in \\"The Soulforge\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"I bought this book because it had such high reviews. Needless to say, I was disappointed. I think that M.W. has a good writing style, but the story lacks any pizazz. The characters are boing and predictable. Why did so many people like this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most captivating Dragonlance novel yet","review":"This was a truly great book that I had been wating for, for a while. It tells the story from Rastlin's mind for a bit of the story, which was a very good style used by Weis. It answers so many of the questions that have arisen about his past. Even though I knew how he was going to end up after his Test, I kept wishing that he would not travel the same path, for some reason. A couple of the spots in the story were difficult to read, because things didn't go Raistlin's way like you wanted them to, but that just made the story that much more captivating! I love reading about the magic in these stories, so maybe that's why I enjoyed it so thoroughly. Your excitement builds as you see him developing his skills, and sometimes feel like you're right there with him, thanks to the excellent writng of the author. So, pick up this book as soon as you can, if you havnn't already, for it is well worth the charge of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Example for Parents and Children","review":"This book has excellent illustrations while it clearly explains the virtues in a language everyone can understand. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like to explore virtues such as humility, rseponsibility, and justice.

I decided I would \\"force myself\\" to read through it and see what I came away with...well I am 3/4 of the way through and loving every page. Not preachy at all but rather like a really good friend who gives really good advice.

Maybe teaching would be my next career!. So I read through this mostly football book and found that the teacher makes only cameo appearances while Edmondson gives you lots of details about his height, weight and playing style.The teacher, who left the profession after only one year, is never well defined. He gives up trying to teach his students the classics of philosophy but has more luck with Kesey and Malcolm X. Oddly the pivotal momemt seems to be a snow-ball fight.If this book had been advertised as a high school memoir about inner growth and the importance of football, I would give it 4 stars. However, as it is I think the author and publisher are guilty of false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Students and Teachers","review":"Before reading this book, I assumed it was about an excellent teacher in whom the children connected with. After completing the book, I realized it told of the struggles of a high school senior and his reform with the help of his teacher, Mr. Lears. Told from the first point of view, Mark Edmundson shows how no child has to fail. I do not reccomend this book to college level students, though I do reccomend it to the younger audience. Teachers having difficulty in their own classes may find this book inspirational and helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teacher: The One Who Made The Difference","review":"For my English class I read \\"Teacher : The One Who Made the Difference\\" by Mark Edmundson. I felt that this book was kind of misleading. It was supposed to be about a teacher that made an effect on his student, Mark Edmundson. The author didn't talk much about Frank Lears, the teacher, and only really focused on Edmundson's high school experience. He played football and hung out with his buddies like any other student. Mark Edmundson should've given the book a different title because I read this book hoping to learn about how teachers can make a difference on their students. Lears let his students think for themselves and that's basically what the book points out in the end. If you want to read about football and about someones high school life, then maybe this book will interest you. If you're looking for a book that talks about a teacher and their students, then definitely don't pick this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"(...) book on NPR and that interview was excellent. (That's why I bought the book.) Edmundson focussed on what a difference Lears made in his life, and Lears spoke for a few moments, which was touching. The book's focus, however, is on football, sex, the Vietnam war and drinking for about 190 pages. Edmundson spends too much time setting the scene rather than showing the outcome of Lears' influence on his students' hearts and minds. Finally, if you endure, the last 70 pages are about how a teacher can change young lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author should stick to scholarship not memoirs","review":"A poorly written memoir of how, in the late 1960's, a nerdy philosophy teacher, Franklin Lears, changes the life of Mark Edmundson, a high school football tough with few future prospects. Even though Edmundson himself became a professor of English at U of Virginia and a prizewinning scholar as a result, this memoir veers frequently and wildly off the potentially interesting theme of the story into incoherent ramblings about high school life at the bottom of the intelligence chain. He even misses the opportunity of seeking out Lears as an adult to let him know the profound impact he had on at least one student during Lears' first and last year as a high school teacher. This book, which received a moderately positive review in Newsweek, turned out to be a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Life","review":"I think that this book was fairly interesting. It didn't have enough rivetting thoughts to keep the reader interested. Even though I was unhappy about the book, it's still a good read. I think that this book would be appropriate for a much younger audience, an age group of ten to sixteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scholarly for an inspirational tale","review":"I love memoirs about teaching and so was anxious to read another inspirational tale about a remarkable teacher. Unfortunately, by page 50, little had been said about Franklin Lears and a lot had been said about the school, the students, and particularly the author. This probably would have been fine had the book not been written in such a scholarly, pendantic fashion. The writing is dry, better suited to academic papers than an inspirational book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay's Wicked Awsome Review ! ! ! : )","review":"This book was an enjoyable story, but it had many points that did not hold my attention. I also could not find much interest in the book due to the fact that it was a tedious story. Many points got boring and I would have trouble concentrating. This is just an average book. I would only reccomend it to a middle-school reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Rambling, Poorly-Written Memoir","review":"I am a teacher and a writer, and I had so looked forward to this book. What a disappointment! This book is NOT really about the TEACHER who made the diffference to this writer (as I had expected). It is a coming-of-age story about this author. This story might mean something to anyone who experienced a similar coming of age (thug-turned-professor), but I'm afraid it meant very little to me. It was all I could do to FORCE myself to keep reading it, and by the end, I felt that I had completely wasted my time and my money. In my opinion, don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Academic dishonesty","review":"Edmundson's belligerence comes across in this book. He passes quick judgments on the academic establishment, traditional teachers, traditional parents, students that follow the rules, and traditions. What's lacking is a real feeling for the people, places, or times of the 1970s. He rarely connects with those around him, and when he does there's the uncomfortable feeling that he's making the subjects into something he desires them to be rather than what they are. It's a sad read for that reason. A few examples: he lashes out oddly at female students, who have rejected him for various reasons. I think that comes across clearly at several places in the book. He sexualizes people and places at weird times which is just a little offputting, especially because he's extraordinarily judgmental. He loves fighting apparently."},{"rating":"1","title":"High school nerd tale","review":"Reading this book, I started off thinking that the author had quite a high school career--amazing professors, amazing classmates, and, of course, the high school girls. I wondered about the last thing, however, when I began to notice that the girls never spoke and their interest in Edmundson was told via the author. The jacket cover suggests the author is Woody Allenish-type, so nothing there to claim attraction. His brilliance? Hard to tell. It appears to be at his own word. Then there's the author's mean streak: he attacks first and asks questions later. An author who manufactures the interest of adoring women? Definitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meffa","review":"I read the book expecting a nostalgic trip back to Medford High. What I got was total fiction as none of the characters resemble anyone that I remember. My sister was in all the honors courses that year, including history.

At first when I bought the book I thought that it would be interesting and enjoyable to read but it was not really interesting at all.There were so many ideas that were hard to follow, and it did not talk particulary about the teacher and how he changed his life.I would not recommned it to anyone, but if you like to read for pleasure and you have time you certainly can. There were some chapters that keep you interested but there were some that you just do not want to read. Overall it had a nice ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It!","review":"I doubt whether the last reviewer (code name dschepps3) has read Teacher. Although the book does take place at Medford High, anyone who reads Teacher will see that it doesn't matter whether every student experienced the school the way Edmundson did (though it's interesting to note that the writer Paul Theroux--dschepps3 points out that Theroux was a student there too--refers to Medford High in The Old Patagonian Express as a monkey house.) My own experience at a very different high school was nothing like Edmundson's either. The truths that come out of these beautifully told stories (stories about not only the transforming teacher Franklin Lears, but also about football, friends, family, war, the 1960's, race, and the woman's movement ) are moving and universal. They are good stories, whether or not you experienced the same things. Plus many of the stories are funny. I laughed out loud. Most important, the writer, who tells us he's a teacher himself now, is interesting and wise.

His recordings of Rachmaninoff's Second and Third Symphonies are wonderful. Here he demonstrates a splendidly mature feeling for Stravinsky. It is delightful to hear these works played by a Russian orchestra. They bring an extra dimension of color and savvy to these compositions. The Symphony may not be the most hard hitting version of this work available, but the second movement is splendidly lyrical and there is a fine sense of style throughout the piece. The Firebird Suite (This is the 1945 Suite, which contains more music than the more popular 1919 Suite.) is sensitive and pointed, and highly idiomatic. The sound engineering, from the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, is clear and well balanced, if not especially vivid.

Angelina Jolie is the movie, and, if you like Jolie, you will like this movie. She brings subtle depth to what could have been a very shallow character. Her martial arts is smooth and believable - the outcome, like all actions movies requires suspension of disbelief. It doesn't matter if it is Matt Damon or Angelina Jolie dropping opponents left and right, or, Chow Yun Fat flying through the air - the viewer always has to buy in. Why is it that men can accept Ulma Thurman and Michelle Yeon performing both gravity and strength defying stunts, but have so much difficulty accepting Jolie outside her role as Lara Croft.

Then she kills some guy as her duty to a Russian agent. She then watches her husband get killed by the Russians. Then she kills all the Russian agents. Because the Russians killed her husband she wants to kill them all. So the very gentle nuance is that she let go of 20 years+ of loyalty because her husband was killed.

This preposterously entertaining spy thriller moves at a fast clip with plenty of dynamic set-pieces and plot twists. Liev Schreiber effectively underplays his role as a pursuing CIA agent - an ideal counterpoint to Jolie's vigorous presence. Far superior to the recent Bond and Bourne entries, with a \\"Salt\\" sequel already in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Action Movie","review":"People will bash this movie for \\"trying to rip off the Bourne movies\\". In no way does it rip those movies off. Its a good old action movie with lots of...well action. Angelina Jolie can put most male actors in their place when it comes to being an action star. Sure, the story is a little weak in some areas, but most action movies are like that. It's a fun movie to watch; it's got non-stop action, a hot lead, and cool stunts. Just keep in mind, it's a movie, not everything she does is real.Also, great price. Lower then walmart.com and any other site and it shipped quickly using standard shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"The spy who irritated me","review":"Angelina Jolie plays a spy with a secret - go figure. The problem is, that she may actually be a sleeper agent from the Soviet Union with designs on bringing down the US of A. The whole 'is she or isn't she' theme wore thin really quick and about two thirds of the way through, I nearly gave up. But I figured I had invested that much time and I needed to see it through. I should have quit, because the end took me from indifferent to angered. There were a few decent action sequences, but there's no way I'd recommend this confused film to anybody.I'm not a hardcore Angelina Jolie fan, but have enjoyed most of the action films that she's headed up. Salt was certainly the exception to the rule. Do yourself a favor and just tape the next Bond marathon on BBC for your spy fix. Salt will just leave you wishing you could recapture those lost two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"She'll fight for freedom......","review":"This past Saturday I decided to take advantage of my local theaters air conditioning and perused the paper to see if there were any movies worth seeing. I chose the Angelina Jolie movie Salt. Simply put. I don't see what all the rave reviews for this movie were brought on by. Any fan of the old Mission:Impossible tv series with Peter Graves could see the twists and turns coming miles away but there is a much more annoying aspect to this movies toilet paper thin plot. The major scene that takes place several feet under the White House is a direct ripoff of the same sequence in the much better acted live action G.I. Joe movie that was out in theaters last year. So I strongly suggest you rent that movie instead and take this Jolie action adventure with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess.","review":"\\"Salt' is a mess. The plot is either incomprehensible or ludicrous and illogical. Theaction sequences are ridiculous , way over the top (What next I thought at one point, is she now going to fly ?)and way too long. Maybe a twelve year old would find it all exciting. I found it a monotonous bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"??","review":"I just finished watching Salt. I know I am behind the times. I just must comment. The commercials made the film look interesting and exciting. Sadly, I was disappointed! It reminded me of a mix of Taken and The Bourne Trilogy. I found it bland and generic. I am glad I watched the rented DVD and didn't pay the going rate at a movie theater. Hopefully someone in Hollywould (that's the way I want to spell it) can come up with a better action film starring a female lead. If there is a part 2, I hope it is way better than this!! :0("},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a Pass","review":"Take what you have seen in all 3 Bourne Movies, add in the same plot twists they used in \\"Get Smart\\" (only this isn't supposed to be a comedy) and the same set pieces you played in the latest Call of Duty Black Ops, and you have Salt. Its uninspired, poorly paced, at times frustratingly outrageous, and unsatisfying. Also its one of those films that intentionally leaves the end open to make it into a trilogy. At least the Bourne franchise had the decency to wrap up the story in the first one, leaving it as an ending that was actually an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the other versions?","review":"I purchased this \\"Deluxe Unrated Edition\\" with its promise of three versions of the film.

Rented it last night on Amazon Video-On-Demand and turned it off after about 40 minutes. This film, too me, is a complete rip-off of the Bourne series, only the Bourne series are some of the best action films ever made. Not going to ruin the plot here for people who will still rent or buy this, but the actual idea is pretty cool. And of course, Angelina looks amazing and kicks *** of course. It is just the execution of the plot and writing that is horrible. Directing isn't so hot either. Boring, linear and just a tad too unrealistic (even for this genre). If you must watch this film, at least rent it or Netflix it so you don't waste too much money. If you are the few people in the world who hasn't seen the Bourne series and you are looking for action, I'd rent them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"This is not worth seeing. Angelina Jolie is so overrated. She plays a tough anorexic spy - She could not have weighed more than 100 pounds and she is beating and killing russian spys and CIA agents.They could have done so much better in casting someone else for this part. The only thing that brought in the viewers is her name.When you are looking for an action star be a little more picky. Liem Nielsen would have fit this.They say that a person should not be judged on their looks. Well when you have a rough and tough action movie you do not put a 100 lb female in that spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu ray Disc Review of Salt (Deluxe Unrated Edition) (2010)","review":"This is a review for the Disc itself, not the movie. I hate when Movie Companies, in this case Sony, make you watch ads on things that you have paid for. I have an LG 530 blu ray player and no matter what I do, as when I insert the disc it goes through the 10+ movie previews, about 7 mins of wasting my time. I cannot get to the Salt movie menu until I have watch all the previews. My only option is to skip and wait each preview, you cannot press skip several times, you have to wait until the player has uploaded the next preview, which is really annoying. I have not checked any other blu ray or DVD version of this movie, so I do not know if they are all the same but this version sucks. I am definitively not keeping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salt","review":"This movie was returned because it would stop in the little.

This is a film in the Mission Impossible mold. The action sequences are well-shot and often thrilling, but Anglelina Jolie, as Evelyn Salt, is very much a comic-book hero. She jumps onto a moving truck, shoots her way out of impossible situations, falls out of a helicopter into freezing water, etc., always surviving with a few scratches (and looking gorgeous while she does it). And of course, she never has to eat or sleep. The Russians are stereotyped baddies trying to start WW III (how retro!). There's tons of collateral damage, and of course it doesn't matter if many minor characters are maimed and killed as Salt rampages. If you want a couple of hours of mindless action with lots of stuff blowing up, then Salt is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions your intelligence","review":"My GF wanted to watch this, so we got this by day 1 it came on DVD.

Entirely predictable. The movie is basically 2-3 overly long, boring chase scenes with some dialogue and shoot-em-ups stringing it together. I'm guessing there was maybe a 10 page script for this? I'm really surprised Angelina Jolie went for it. Truly a bad film. She's much better than this, as is Liev Schreiber. I don't think anything could have redeemed the script and overall story. It's simply a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Salt Please","review":"I love Angelina Jolie but this movie was terrible. The plot is confusing and generic. This was like the Angelina Jolie version of The Bourne Idenity or whatever those movies are with Matt Damon. They all bite the big one. Most of the movie is just Angelina Jolie being chased by evil FBI guys, and so on and so on. Alot of shooting and car crashes tailor made for brainded action movie fans who like to just zone out in front of a tv screen. I wish they would just stop making movies like this. Angelina Jolie should stick to intelligent dramas, she's better than this and all of the other Tomb Raider crap she got involved in. I could'nt even sit through the whole movie, didn't care what happened because you just don't care about the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Big disappointment.

As to \\"Salt,\\" here we have a contemporary, big budget, alleged thriller that is so absurd, it makes the \\"Giant Claw\\" look like a documentary.In \\"Salt,\\" we see the CIA take ineptness to new levels, unable to corral Ms. Jolie even when she is sealed in a room in a CIA office building, with a SWAT team outside the door. The clumsy chase scenes lack only Moe, Larry, and Curly. This movie does not even try.

I will never understand why because I do know that there are some movies that were released on the theaters but were never released on VHS or DVD.These films are fantasy and a real insult to men. Someday this may all have an effect or it may not. I do not care. When they start making movies with bad women being gun down by a hero and then they are release on DVD or Blu-ray then maybe things are changing back to reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respectable performance for the price","review":"This card is a great option for those that want to extend the life of their Win98(SE) or Win2K machines to use for casual gaming.

His vocals are bad and he talks about all the same tired things said in all rap albums these days. Except for the good rappers out there, like Cam'Rom, Pretty Ricky, Outkast, Nas, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Memphis Bleek, Tupac, and this underground rapper called Tech N9NE. Those are rappers with talent. Not this kid. He needs to shave his forehead first of all. Plus he needs to pick up a dictionary and READ IT.

With the exception of UGK, Outkast, Ludacris, and of course Scarface, dirty south rappers has no skill and their beats sound the same. Just like G funk hip hop of the 90's, Dirty South hip hop is gonna burn out when people get tired of their bad grammar. As for Webbie, he's gonna end up in the cut out bins in a few years if not sooner and his career will be over in a year.

Once the book got going it was pretty good, but i was expecting it to be like her other books. I enjoyed most of those more.

It was terribly boring. The synopsis is rather deceiving, you get the impression that it would talk more of her experience on the island, but that only takes a few pages and the rest of it is set in the States. It is very slow and the romance is rushed at the end.The ONLY reason I finished it was because I kept on thinking it would get better...not. I usually like her books.

Out of everything that I've ever read by her, this is by far my least favorite book. When I opened it up and read that she'd had the idea for this story for 10 years, I thought to myself, \\"This should be pretty good if she's been thinking about it for that long.\\" Unfortunately, that was not the case. The story was so chopped up, and it didn't flow well at all. There were breaks through the entire book. For example, at the beginning of a chapter, it would be a Sunday. By the time you turned the page, it'd be the end of that week. I think if she had developed the plot more, even making it a longer book (Pretense comes to mind), I think it would've been so much better.Unfortunately, it will probably be a very long time before I read another Lori Wick book because this one just did not impress me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best...","review":"I am a BIG fan of Lori Wick. I have read most of her books. I found this book hard to read. It took me a long time to get through it. I usually eat up her stuff. The book was just a bummer in my opinion.

But, it still is a great product. I've had it for almost 2 years now and I bought it really cheap at Oddlots, so I wasn't expecting the set to last very long. In my opinion the set is perfect for anyone who wants a wireless set but doesn't want to spend a fortune for one. It is good enough for the average user and by average I mean 4 or so hours a day.The keyboard works about 10 feet away and the mouse only worked about 6 feet away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a week","review":"This setup lasted a week, then the keyboard stopped working. I probably could have RMA'd it, but I didn't want to waste more money on shipping a bum product.

Horrible for gaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ends prematurely","review":"This book is a fresh take on Henry Stanley and well worth the read. However, the book ends right after his second exploration, quite literally. For a book that poured over Stanley's early years, many pages to his 7- and under years, the paragraph (literally) that sums up his knighthood, authoring of more books, marriage and subsequent adventures is pretty disconcerting. It is like the author died and someone else tacked on an ending and called it done."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-28","review":"I purchased this book for reference in the construction of a scale RC model of the T-28.

I like the huggie style because they are more secure. I bought these to wear in my first ear piercing, along with my CZ studs (that I wear in my upper, second ear piercing) for travel and vacation.

I got my first pair many years ago, in kind of a slate color, and when the headband actually snapped in half, Koss replaced them, no questions asked, with the current black color. They are pretty comfortable, even when worn for a long time, and the sound is good for a lightweight headphone. You won't get much isolation since they rest lightly on the ears and not around or in them, so they won't block out loud external noises, but I used mine all through college for private listening in my dorm room and around campus and they held up through that and beyond.

Sizewise I was very pleasantly surprised as it is a very nice size that sits well on the neck. The amount of detail does not show through on the picture. The detail around the center stone is actually a very delicate looping braid. It shows off the center stone beautifully. The metal work on the piece is very complex and the fact that time was spent on the piece is very evident. The stones are all matched nearly flawlessly in color. My only complaint and it is a very minor one is that the stones appear to be closer to the color of a deep amethyst then that of an iolite in nature. That in no way detracts from the beauty of the piece. Just know that its a very very rich purple should you choose to purchase this piece which I highly recommend.

Also, since I only used less than a third of the sheet I still have the biggest part left for an extra jig or two.My only gripe with this product is that - as another user complained- the sheet came quite scratched on one side.

(Perhaps to him, tolerance means anti-religion.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy thinking from someone who should know better","review":"Albert Ellis provides his argument that religion is itself a form of mental illness; due to the fact that it promotes ideas such as not putting yourself ahead of everyone else, letting others emotionally support you, and thinking that there is such a thing as Truth.Ellis absolutely rejects all absolute claims, tells people exactly how to avoid having people tell them what to do, and can't stand intolerant people. His intellectual arrogance is matched only by the internal weaknesses of his arguments. I am a psychologist who specializes in the study of religion, and the scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the idea that religion serves as a source of emotional strength and personal worth, not as a source of pathology or irrationality.Ellis, an otherwise admirable psychologist, is entrapped by his own prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"case against religion","review":"Case Against Religion: A Psychotherapists View and the Case Against ReligiosityThis is the most amateurish analysis I've ever seen.

Installation was straightforward. The drive worked right-away under Linux (using Xcdroast-098-alpha) by loading the ide-scsi module. Needs to be loaded via grub, or lilo. Under W2k the supplied Nero software works fine and producing audio and data CD-s at 24x worked flawlessly (no coasters so far after about 12 disks). On-the-fly copying from a Toshiba 32x DVD-rom drive works even at 24x, though the actual speed is lower, probably due to the fact that both drives are on the same IDE-bus (Nero warns about this). The drive makes a slight whistling noise from time to time, but is quieter than external scsi drives (Yamaha and QPS) I have tried before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Good drive for the price.Hardware installed on the first try.

But at the risk of getting myself blacklisted at First Look, I must express huge disappointment in END OF STORY.The reader doesn't have a chance to bond with the main character, Ivy, at all, before the flimsy case is made for her falling madly in \\"love\\" with Harrow. Her shortsightedness gives a bad impression of writers being unable to think rationally, only imaginatively. It was like watching one of those \\"B\\" horror movies, when the female bimbo decides to wander off into the woods by herself, and the entire audience is yelling, \\"Don't go in there!\\" simultaneously. END OF STORY is the literary equivalent of a \\"B\\" horror movie.The \\"ha, fooled you\\" ending might work for a short story, but I felt gypped after having invested the hours necessary to read an entire novel.

There is nothing authentic or believable about the protagonist. She is a writer--wow! Where did Abrahams get the idea for THAT? The main male character is literally someone the author dreamed up. He has the insubstantiality and mutability of someone out of a dream. People know something about prisons and might want to know a lot more but this book will not educate them. The one thing the author does know something about is bars. Had he spent less time drinking and hanging out, and done more living, this would have been a better book. The plot is implausible, to put it gently, with an ending you can see coming a mile off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stylistic masterpiece","review":"My husband and I have read many of Abrahams's thrillers and we agree that this is his best so far. Aside from one of the most appealing heroines in fiction, and an exciting (if, in its final moments, implausible) plot,Abrahams's ability to convince us that the heroine's love interest, a convict who is aspires to being a writer, really CAN write is simply breathtaking. His \\"convict\\" produces paragraphs that are little masterpieces of writing -- and done in an entirely different style and voice than Abrahams's himself. This \\"fiction within the fiction\\" is a tour de force. (Post script: I rated this novel FIVE STARS, but I see upon reading the \\"Preview\\" I see that Amazon has recorded only four. It deserves the highest rating -- all five stars!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dopey","review":"I am not normally a fan of \\"suspense\\" novels, but I was hungry for something to read, and this was mentioned in The New Yorker.

I had a number of bootlegs and saw them in concert. So, I know it. So, when I saw they had released a formal live dvd, I had to buy it (even having youtube to preview it). The band is great. Ed's voice is great. But, the performance is so overshadowed and distracted by Ed's self-congratulatory persona that it is mostly unwatchable. It's too bad, Lakini's Juice, Operation Spirit, Mirror Song... there are a lot of good songs on this dvd.

They have a wonderful gripping material on the bottom so that the stand does not slide or slip, not even a little.Finally, I wondered if it would be large enough for myLG W2353VP 23-Inch Widescreen 1080p LCD Monitor (Black). It holds it stable and is plenty big.Definitely worth it as it will significantly reduce neck strain by elevating my monitor so that I no longer have to bend forward to read text or work on other tasks.UPDATE (4/2011):I loved it so much that I bought one for our officeApple iMac MC508LL/A 21.5-Inch Desktop.

I like its simplicity, it is solid and it raises my laptop screen so that it is level with the other monitor I use with it. I suppose if you put something in the center of it that weighed 50 lbs or more it may sag a little, but I find it to be quite sturdy. I bought 3 more for my husband and for our home in mexico.

This book requires no studying; only quiet reflection into our deepest recesses, as we continue our respective searches for a true connection to something greater than ourselves.This is a \\"feel-good\\" book, one that promises hope for the future.

The compiler that comes on the CD is a tremendous aid and I installed in on a system running Windows 98 with no problems. Once you understand that COBOL programs need to be compiled, linked and then executed you should be off and running. Chapters one and two might need to be read with pen in hand but after you compile your first program you will see actual real world errors.

I find it flat and boring. This cd is not an honest attempt on the part of the writer to give homage to his influences (The Beatles) or to incorporate his influences (The Beatles) into his own voice. This is not the writer's own voice. This is John Lennon's voice; this is Paul McCartney's voice. It's unfortunate. The cd is boring because the songs are beyond derivative. You can listen to each song and hear the Beatle's song it came from. The writer is obviously technically talented and has a good ear for texture; however, he is hiding his expression behind this form. I would very much like to hear this band again in a few years to see if the writer has become more vulnerable and honest.

No subwoofer? Then stop throwing it around the house like a frisbee.I've had this unit for at least 3 years now, and I have not experienced a single loss in quality. I use it daily for DVD production, and I've given it a number of discs (from a well-produced Hollywood release to my crapped-out test productions to scratched Whitesnake CDs) all of which, it's read properly, and without failure.

There is no doubt in my mind that the negative reviews I have read here are mostly commenting on the fact that the style of music presented in these 2 disks simply isn't for them, instead of the comments on quality that they were phrased as.With the exception of track 2 and 3 on cd2, which don't really seem to fit, these cd's are absolutely gorgeous. Smooth, clean mixes, superb song selection and placement. The music presented here can best be described as a rennaisance (no pun intended) of the sound that made trance great in the ballearic era, before the onset of epic trance robbed it of intelligence and the excessively lengthy reactionary period of dark progressive hid melody lines away as if they were a dirty family secret.Gorgeous, intelligent trance is back, and Hernan is making a strong mark with this set that would make a fantastic addition to any trance lover's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'll say it: I did not like this album, even as a big hernan fan- it is BORING. But this is the strange part: alot of these other reviews compare the sound on this album with hernan's live sound and say they are similar. I strongly disagree. I saw hernan in January, 2004 at centro-fly in NYC and his set was WAY more energetic than this renaissance compilation. Objectively, I know renaissance puts out a good product, in fact sander kleinenberg's everybody is my favorite dance release. On this CD, however, as sad as I to admit it, it sounds like boring MU-ZAK. CD2 is obviously better, with some of the medium paced deeper progreesive tracks he spins live. But he was just a different guy live- a DJ on fire...energy, fast BPM, knowlegeable crowd that appreciated him- I don't get that same vibe on this mix, and it puzzles me that other reviewers compare the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best comp CD end of 03 beginning of 04","review":"This CD truly portrays the sound of the Renaissance serries to me.

I sold my 64 MB Olympus card when I got a new camera with video capabilities. This card has so much memory you really need nothing else. It can be used with cameras, camcorders, hand held PC's and some audio players. I don't care about how many minutes of video I can get (it's a lot), but I do care about the number of photos I can store. If you want to take HIGH quality photos, you'll get @ 110 photos; NORMAL quality photos, you can get @ 210; BASIC quality photos will give you @ 560 photos. This is with 6 million pixels (2832 X 2128). At this rate, even BASIC (4 X 6) photos will print well. This is a very competitive price for this card, but I would still shop around.It's also very important to check that this card is compatible with your camera and PC processor.

Our understanding of dog behavior has evolved a great deal since the 1970's, and fortunately, the methods now used by reputable trainers and behaviorists are much more humane (as well as more effective).

Clever and convenient design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"The plastic bin does NOT hold hanging letter-size files, but it will work for storing file folders. You can adjust the rails to hold hanging letter-size files, but contrary to the way it looks, you will only have about one foot of space. If they'd designed it to hold hanging files the long way, it would hold almost 18\\" of files. Also, the bin is pretty junky. Really not worth the high price. I recommend item #SAF5228BL by SAFCO instead. Much better quality, a lower price, and at least as much storage space for letter-size hanging files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fender Mini Master Tone Amp","review":"There is no product description giving an actual size.

I have visited some of the zoos featured and they have expansive, natural exhibits. It seems like the photographer focused on the few cramped or lonely looking exhibits the zoo has, and decided to feature that. Though, these exhibits pull emotional chords for us, looking at them doesn't often give the whole story of the animal's life. Zookeepers are very dedicated to them. I do wish all animals could have more natural, and expansive exhibits. I'm sure the zoo does too.I have to agree with the person that said many of these photos look like snapshots. I think that's intentional, but maybe I give the photographer too much credit.The power of photography, like any art, is conveying the artists ideas. This book is very good at that. However, one could even more easily make a book that made zoo animals look happy and healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Enough","review":"Pictures of animals in various zoos. The images are good enough, the best come across as well thought-out portraits of animals in captivity. The weaker images come across like tourist shots at a zoo. Perhaps this is laziness on the photographer's part or simply a weak eye for editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the science inclined shall appreciate this Master-piece","review":"The whole album starts like a science fiction episode of Svengoolie. This doctor obviously knows his medicine. He and co-surgeon, Sir Menilik aka Scaramanga aka Dr. Gerbik, rip things lovely. Dr. Octagon is defintely a (DJ Automator)masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky Fresh and Freaked Out: The Insane Word of Dr. Octagon","review":"Groovalicious and gynacological, Dr. Octagon is hip-hop's messiah for the third millenium, with his witty poop raps and an amazing free-style that gives him the freedom to rap about Chewbacca uncircumcised. The most groundbreaking debut ever for a man with multiple personalities, Dr. Octagon artfully illustrates his anti-ghetto raps on the masterful canvas provided by scratch wizard DJ Q-Bert and producer the Automator. A cross between Eazy-E and Fozzy the Bear, Dr. Octagon is one you do not want to miss END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes hip-hop to a whole 'nother level","review":"Dr. Octagon has a style all his own, pushing the limits of the rhythm while still always maintaining a tight flow. With all the lackluster MC's out there, rapping over mediocre beats & samples, this album gives hope for the future of hip-hop. Everything, from the heavy and innovative beats from the Automator, to the phat scratches that you'd expect from Q Bert, is so on point it's scary. The only complaint I have it Octagon's insistence on putting a lame and repetitive hook into every song; if he just stuck on flowing instead of trying to make the songs commercial, the album would be perfect. Other than that, this album is the new benchmark in pushing the limits of hip-hop, and has yet to be surpassed since its release."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got the book!","review":"I never got the book, i failed my 1st exam, i was suppost to get book in 3 weeks And its been more than 6weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As promised","review":"I received the book I ordered.

Not what I expected but good. It kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. I purchased it for my grandchildren and the older ones (8-11) got into it more than the the younger ones (6-7). I felt it was just to deep for them. I needed to watch it several times before I caught everything that was going on in it and understood somethings. So when you watch it make sure you are not distracted or make sure you can watch it again.Over all a good movie if you like Sci-Fi and fantasy which I do. It is family oriented which is great but my husband isn't into movies like this one, so he wouldn't even watch he fell asleep because he was board with it.

Most of the actors, however, were unlikable and detracted from the story. The adults, in particular, were helpless weenies, beyond even what would be expected in a children's movie.The hippy, love Gaia, hate the Patriot Act preaching was unnecessarily intrusive, as well. Can't Hollywood make a kid's movie without politics? Seven year olds can't vote, so leave them alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked great, but another company BLUNDER ruins the day.","review":"Are movie studios really this stupid? How do you release a movie in this day and age of accessability without at LEAST putting English closed captioning on the disc? I was so excited to pop this in the DVD player and was just settling in to watch it when to my shock, there is no option for english subtitles. I am nearly deaf and have been for almost my entire life so DVD has been a godsend for me because of my impairment. My television is an HDTV monitor that doesn't have a closed caption decoder built in, so I rely on the discs to have subtitles available from the set up menu, but alas New Line blundered another crappy \\"Infinifilm\\" release. Now I'm stuck with returning this movie and being frustrated that I can't share in it with my friends. Thanks again New Line for kicking impaired people in the teeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much wisdom, little heart","review":"I must say, I really enjoyed this movie. I have been looking a long time for a good movie that actually reveals deeper wisdom - and the writers of this movie definitely understood some deeper wisdom. Everything from psychokenesis to sacred geometries to telepathy to healing oneself struck far closer to my personal experiences than any other fictional movie I have seen.Nevertheless, as I began to think of comparisons to ET, that's when I began to see why I didn't absolutely love it.Perhaps society is just speeding up and we have to hit the major plot points as quick as possible to keep the audience from dozing off, but the heart in this film seemed to be forced quickly. When compared to Spielberg's old sci-fi flicks of the 80s - such as ET or Close Encounters - they built slow, took their time, and focused on the humanity. That's what made them great.Nevertheless, there's a lot of truth behind this little story about a bunny and that alone is worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaning inside","review":"Most folks will miss the hidden meaning of this movie, those that catch it will understand why its a keeper.

A- from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mimzy could have been better","review":"good movie start but disappointing quality storyline as it continued. Wish they made it a better. Good premise but failed in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not make much sense","review":"When a movie blows its own trumpet on its cover by saying \\"best movie since ET\\" etc etc, it usually means trouble. This is definately nowhere near as good as ET, infact no comparison to that landmark film. The movie does not make much sense, even for an adult. How did the future people send the packages back through time ? What was the purpose of the twinkling twirling stones and other gismos, other than to look good on the screen ? Very amateur stuff.

The trailers made it out to be far more interesting than it was (as usual). The story could have been brought up a notch or two. If you're looking for a movie to put the kids to sleep by, this is it!The cinematograhy was sharp and pleasantly set in the Pacific northwest, the scenes however would often shoot off to vague moments, with little or no guidance as to what we're suppossed to be looking at.Still, the movie might be good for smaller children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Mimzy","review":"The DVD does NOT work. I was so disappointed when I wanted to share it with some friends and they came over for the movie and it wouldn't run."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly action-packed movie!","review":"I tried to get my daughter and her friend to watch The Last Mimzy about ten times, but they thought it was just some kid's movie they wouldn't like, but I finally convinced them to watch it with me over the Thanksgiving holiday. They loved it! They were so surprised at how action-packed it turned out to be, that it had a smattering of metaphysical and futuristic plot lines, plus hard-core sciences, such as string theory, and that it was a just plain delightful movie. This is the second copy I've purchased, as I gave them one for Christmas - they had been planning to buy a copy of it, so it turned out to be a good gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing Science Fantasy","review":"We watched this movie on a hunch and found it to be a charming and captivating movie. While it starts off a little slowly it picks up speed and interest as the children discover what the object they found on the beach can do. Their process of discovery takes them in unexpected directions and creates an aura of mystery and suspense as to where all of their adventures will lead them and how it will all end.The acting by the children, played by Chris O'Niel as the brother, and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as the sister, is thoroughly engrossing and generates a sympathetic concern for their well-being as the question of the results of their decisions is revealed.This is a family movie, has a family friendly ending and is suitable for all ages; I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it had stayed truer to the short story.","review":"This movie is loosely based on the Science Fiction Hall of Fame short story \\"Mimzy were the Borogroves\\" in which the \\"scientist\\" in the future is really a bumbling fool who sets the story in motion by mistake and had nothing to do with an intentional attempt to recruit kids from the past (today) to save the future from humanity ruining the planet. However, the movie does capture the learning from futuristic toys stuff pretty well. Anyway, I recommend you read the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Last Mimzy' is delightful for any viewer","review":"Despite the fact that this movie only loosely follows the 1943 short story from which it is taken, this is a charming and well-produced movie that any one, children to adults will find entertaining. The DVD offers many options and the movie has a good story line, with some good acting and an unusual ending. I wonder why there was not more 'hype' about this science fiction movie when it came out in the theaters. Great gift for any youngster for birthday or holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and unsatisfying","review":"Just didn't quite hit on all cylinders.

We left entranced and filled with hope. With Global warming, pollution, war, and everything else looming over us, this movie was just what we needed to feel that there is hope. My son was happy because both the boy and the girl had important roles, they had to work together, their skills were different but vital for saving the world.

Why no golden retriever ? When sabotaging a great story, at least have the decency to sabotage it utterly.I hope that no more of Lewis padgett's short stories will be processed in this awful manner.Th great Clint Eastwood once said that from time to time, it is interesting to make movies for people older than 13 (or 15).

Was the bunny rabbit supposed to be ET? It also had smatterings of What Dreams May Come and What the Bleep Do We Know, but it fell flat. I love sci-fi and fantasy movies, and this one should've been up my alley. Instead, I enjoyed the full-length feature film on the backs of my eyelids through a nearly 2 hour slumberfest courtesy of said movie. The kids did a good job with the pitiful script they were given, as far as I could tell from only watching the first half hour and last five minutes. The special effects were superb. However, plot is what drives a movie, not special effects. I wish the writers had spent more time working the plot instead of glitzing up the special effects. If I could give it 0 stars, I would.

I am about 50lbs overweight and just started working out a couple of weeks ago. This workout had me sweating during the warm up! But I was not so exhausted and out of breath that I couldn't complete the entire Circuit (I only do 1 circuit per day & each circuit is about 40 mins long). I really like that she had someone doing the modified version (which is what I did). I also like that she has men and women with different shapes and sizes working out with her. The only issue I had is that she loses count sometimes but it's not a big deal to me. There are push-ups, squats, lunges and crunches (just to name a few) on this DVD which I usually hate but I didn't mind them with this routine and I like her energetic personality. At first I dreaded doing a 40 min workout but this workout was so fun that it made time fly by!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"The video came in perfect timing and is exactly what I need to get back in shape and ready to be out!! ;)"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],W={key:0},B={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-64a5113f"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/4.md","filePath":"library/4.md"}'),L={name:"library/4.md"},H=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,H as default};
