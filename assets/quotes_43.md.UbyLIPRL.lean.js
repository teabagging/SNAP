Definitely a dud, don't waste your time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fantastic listening material- very thought provoking\\"","review":"Listening to audio tapes while you are driving, walking, working, etc. is one of the most valuable uses of your idle time. listening to audio tapes which vitalize the spirit and energize the mind are priceless. If you haven't taken the time to listen to audio programs- you are missing out on a treasure trove of information. Debra Benton strikes me as a woman who gets things done. She offers only positive, business minded ideas. It may be true that there are more qualified writers/speakers on the subject (however, she is the narrator of her tapes, and does an outstanding job). No, of course all listeners will not become CEO's, but don't be misled by the title. There are lasting rewards in listening to these tapes! I have listened through them three times and will be listening many more times in the future. Find the gems in this material rather than the flaws, you will find this to be great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"O.k. but too simple!","review":"I did not learn anything new from this audiocassette. Kind of wasting my time a bit. Kept hoping that it will come to the essential part soon..... Too common sense. I finised the whole 2 cassettes and get nothing but my credit card bill.

Well...if you are not a CEO (yet) and still have time...go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a laugh!","review":"I bought this book with the good intention of improving my CEO skills. Mistake!Twenty pages into the book I began to suspect it was a send-up. By the time I got to the section on how to approach a chair, I was convulsed with mirth, and was absolutely certain it was an elaborate practical joke.This book has elaborate advise on some of the most idiotic things I have ever encountered in a business book. Such as ones attitude to the car park, and how to touch an employee when thanking them.If you want to have your colleagues in fits of laughter then I strongly recommend this book. If you need to read this type of material to become a better CEO, then I strongly recommend re-thinking your career."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it again","review":"Little information, even less original, presented too long.

As the president of my own company I find that her suggestions and necessary traits are simplistic yet often many of us don't use them enough to make impact with our colleagues and customers. Her examples are well studied and do make a difference when you apply them with thought and tenacity. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to improve in the world of business!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A continuation, but with vocals this time.","review":"This isn't truly a sequel to the first collection, but rather is a continuation adding, to the instrumentals, a few vocals to balance out the representation of music here. I personally could wish for more female vocals in addition to the \\"Bonus Track\\". I'm sure Hawaii has more than one notable lady singer.That's not enough to take away a star though. This again is a most rewarding collection. However, I always associated the ukulele with hawaiian music and there's only one cut, \\"Pu'u Anahula\\" which includes one. There is more traditional music here than with the first collection, including the familiar and beautiful \\"Aloha Oe\\", a classic love song written by Queen Lili'uokalani in 1877. Also notable and familiar is the \\"Radio Hula\\" as played by Led Kaapana.This record and its predecesser are great CDs to help create a romantic, tropical atmosphere.

They were like doors to me, ones that helped me understand not only who i was in a small part but what others are as well. A world of humans Threatend ,in their minds, by elves. Yet through all the hatred that the humans tossed at them for being different they still looked to peace and a place in the world. It walked me in shoes that were different than what we consider normal and/or average. It showed me that everyone looks for a place in the world and difference makes this world as fantastic as that of the two moons. They not only celebrated their differences, but they wore them proudly as thier names. I do recommend this book for both adult and child. If i would have discovered it earlier my pain would have been relived much sooner. lol its a great series that shows acceptance and the dangers of hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I like Forstchen's books, but this isn't up to his usual standard. The plot adheres a little too closely to the events of the Midway campaign in WWII. Sadly, the Confederation has forgotten all the lessons learned in that period, and needs to be re-taught the hard way.I'd give this book a miss, and head straight for Freedom Flight. Then, you can go on to Forstchen's excellent End Run, Fleet Action, and Heart of the Tiger."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kilrathi leap with claws extended at the confederation","review":"Contact has been made with the Kilrathi, tiger like creatures whom love to hunt and kill.

It looks great with a colorful collection of fruit and cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for our purposes","review":"I don't like cutting on it--too noisy and sounds like we're going to break the glass--but we use it to protect a small counter area next to the fridge. It's very useful for setting cold things right out of the fridge on. We have marble countertops and have to treat them with caution. Note that it is not perfectly transparent so you don't really see the beauty of your counter through it, but you do protect it. The board is inexpensive and durable if you treat it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT be fooled......MADE IN CHINA!!!!","review":"Despite the name of the company that makes it appear as though you're getting something crafted in the US, it's NOT.....MADE IN CHINA.....and nowhere does it state that in the description.

I will be using this as a surface, but no more cutting on it. Just too annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud!","review":"I can't believe no one has mentioned this. Using this board to chop without annoying everyone around is not possible as far as I can tell. I can hear my girlfriend using this board two walls away. If you're chopping it's loud, if you are slicing using a serrated knife it's even worse. What are people using these boards for that it hasn't been mentioned in a review?I bought two different sizes of these cutting boards and am at a loss as far as what to do.

ROHS magically infuse their music with unique style and sounds that puts them high above other bands of their peers. I'm a baby boomer and this is the first new young band I can totally relate to. With all these new bands coming out of the wood work these days, ROHS is one that stands out of the crowd and gives listeners in all age groups the music sound we grew to love and love to hear.

Not so with Mary Soon Lee's Winter Shadows -- each story draws you in and you read through the book from first page to last.If there's a unifying theme to the collection, it lies in the word transformation. Not just humans turned into animals, but people in general being transformed by their experiences. A lot of fantasy and science fiction is weak on characterization; but not the stories of Mary Soon Lee. In short, I can't recommend this book enough. I understand this is Ms. Lee's first book, though she has been appearing in the pages of magazines like Fantasy and Science Fiction, and Interzone, for some time now. If her later books are as good as this one, she will be a formidable presence in the spec-fic world indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, But Not Great","review":"This is the third book in Keri Arthur's Spook Squad series.

In this book, Sam and Gabriel have to deal with clones infiltrating the government, and Sam's mysterious past is finally revealed. The writing style was excellent as always with Arthur, but the plot seemed of slightly lower quality than her usual work. Still, I found it pleasant to read, and if you've read the first two in this series, you should certainly read this one as well. I hope Arthur has plans to continue writing in this universe.

I can't imagine what purpose the publisher had in mind (although someone somewhere might just want to read the book rather than play from it. On a positive note, the material contained in the book is well done, easy to read (if not easy to hold the book and play), and is the same quality that I found in the STANDARDS book noted above.

The story - of discovery of an old colony vessel from Earth in civil war and danger of destruction by twin black holes - is OK for a single episode, but to make an entire novel out of it is excessive. It is a book that strains to have add believable filler details and additional characters, making for a rather boring read. The whole time I was reading this, I thought: so what, someone is making this up. Nothing unexpected happens, nothing is added that is new, and then the resolution solves all problems miraculously and with complete grace.

And with amazon.com's rebate and 1-year (instead of 2-year) contract, it's a very good deal indeed.The only drawback is that the rebate takes about 4 months to receive (you have to wait two billing cycles, then amazon takes about 8 weeks on top of that to process it).

My father is 88 years old and cannot see very well. First the watch's clasp is very hard to use. My father is unable to either clasp it or remove it. Second, the watch's various buttons are extremely sensitive and the time/alarm set buttons are not recessed. In fact just brushing up against the watch and making accidental contact with a button will activate it. These results in the various functions of the watch being reset accidently.

Cobham and Bruce prove more than equal to the task of being Mose-ified, and Eric Gale helps Mose stretch out toward the end. Lou shines the way a guest should, pouring more passionate soul into one song than many do in an entire album. Mose had already redefined \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" with a dour, melancholy arrangement; Donaldson takes that pitch and socks it to the moon.Otherwise, you really couldn't ask for a better album of Mose's music up to that point. If you wondered what Mose was about (as I did), this is a great place to start: a handy intro to Mose & his music that will probably have you looking for more (at least, that's what it did for me)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wife in Apartment C","review":"My initial review was prompted by my indignation regarding the \\"smearing\\" of the colors in many of the scenes. I was wrong. My dvd player was the culprit. I totally agree with the first posted review of this film. Good looking, fit players, but the script left a great deal to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much chearleading and to little information","review":"After having read Norman Walker's series of books on raw foods and juices, I was looking for additional information. I was disappointed. While I share the author's enthusiasm for a raw food diet, I learned little from what he published. If this is your first book on raw food then your experience may be different. If you are looking for detailed scientific information and facts then you may want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book came highly recommended as a supplemental book for those interested in raw vegan diets. Because it was highly recommended by other vegan authors I though it was going to be a really great book but it was disappointing. A thin book with large type print, that gives basic exercise routines and a few recipes for high protein meals and drinks. The book is poorly written and not worth the price. Other vegan raw books in the same price range are packed full of useful information about meal preparation, food combinations and how to start your vegan diet. I was shocked at the price of this book compared to it's contents. It might be worth $5, but not the $20 I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve is Rawesome","review":"Hi!I think Steve's book provides us a powerful message and reminds us that we are all powerful if we are willing to make powerful choices.Raw food is incredible.

Give it a try.","review":"I bought this album after hearing the track \\"Sub-Lines\\" on Internet radio. If this sort of thing appeals to you, \\"Traces of Mercury\\" is an excellent example. It could be experienced as dark ambient music, as a relatively unintrusive example of something akin to the noise genre, as manipulated environmental / found sounds. I experience it as sound art, a form of music, and a profound, absorbing and beautiful example thereof. It would be perfectly feasible to sleep, think, work, or do almost anything with these sounds as pleasant accompaniment. My impression may change a little up or down as I listen to the album repeatedly, but I give it 4.5 stars after the first listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"noticeable difference for Jeep","review":"did research on it and ppl said that you wouldnt notice the gains, but i did once i installed it.

This book, rather than focusing on it's main subject, continually adresses issues of sexuality more than anything else. True, most of the characters are affected by eating disorders, however the story deals with their relationships instead. If you're looking for a modern (but rather decorated) teenage thrill story, than this is a good read, but don't expect nearly the amount of immense information found in the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as pictured","review":"The shirt that was delivered was not as it was pictured. The colors were completely different - the picture showed a faded red color with grey graphics on an SDSU long sleeve shirt and the shirt that arrived was red and yellow - like USC colors. I bought it for a school pride day at work, so I could not ask for an exchange in time. So now I'm stuck explaining why my SDSU shirt sports USC colors whenever I wear it. I will not be ordering from this store again."},{"rating":"2","title":"the very essence","review":"Shortly and directly, this DVD does exactly what one expects: touching on the very essence of Francoise Hardy's singing.To achieve this, the selection of her songs is small but excellent - spanning from 1964 to 2000. Of course it includes a fine clip of Francoise's most famous \\"Tous les garcons et les filles\\" (= French for \\"All the boys and the girls\\"). And also an unexpected but very impressive version of \\"Träume\\" (= German for \\"Dreams\\"), sung in perfect German.This excellent selection is completed by a seven minutes-interview with 19-year old Francoise Hardy. Dated 1963. Those who do not understand French may have a problem here, for this French DVD does not provide any subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is this thing called \\"enchanced\\"?","review":"I give five stars without hearing the disc because I know some of the cuts already and Francoise always gets my trust, despite her odder interests. The best of the 60s ye-ye girls has changed considerably since then, and her most recent original material on CD was jazzy, new-agey, and (but?) delightful and touching. But what does \\"enhanced\\" really mean? The French release included a 3rd DVD disc that had interviews and other visuals going back to the 60s. Is this enchanced with the same material, or only some of it, and how do you play it?

If you are looking for detail on how to actually make medicine using these plants, then this book will not be very useful. Besides a few Native American myths, this book is mostly bland. It definitely isn't a very entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sourcework","review":"It's great to have available old wisdom about plants and there's certainly some of that in this book, as well as adorable little snippets of myth.

Also one can learn which herbs best flavor possum and ground hog - there's excellent background material here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy for German Quality","review":"This is one heck of a deal from Amazon and Wiha. German products are top notch and at this price this set is a no-brainer. The grips fit my small/medium hands perfectly. The soft texture and ergonomic shape keep my hand from slipping.

The label disappeared for a while in the late 90s but has recently resurfaced and is putting out albums again.This is a good way to introduce yourself to the label and/or the artists featured here. You may, as I did, find yourself intrigued enough to dig deeper and start tracking down the larger body of works from these artists.Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allegory","review":"I have little doubt that by writing this book Saer meant the humanity as a whole. This is what we are - reduced to bare essentials - we are still cannibalizing each other and our own selves and then engage in our daily business as if nothing happened. This is us: chaos on the brink of order and order on the bring of chaos and turmoil.

All of these books are available on Amazon and give a much better, and more sound view of the world regarding Economics. Also there are lots of collections of columns from Walter Williams that are very easy reading and view life in this country through the eyes of economic principle. They are all much better than this book and use reason and logic to formulate their views. They also are all excellent in explaining their common sense views in terms that all can understand. You're money (and isn't that what economics is all about) is much better spent on these other authors than on this one and this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book give a basic understanding of economics.","review":"I'm a high school student and I had read this book.

Admittedly, I like the heavier fusion side of jazz/instrumental music. Lee had some impressive work in his earlier career, but by this point, he must have been living in an elevator. To me, this is the definitive album to show how good musicians sold out for some cash. The problem is, even if your tastes DO lean toward elevator snooze music, there are much better alternatives. If you want kitschy, cheesy schmaltz, you'd be better off mining the easy-listening fodder at your local thrift store's vinyl bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Nice big workbook for my seven year old cousin.

The content of the book was a good reflection on the curriculum for this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of international carving examples","review":"There are a few helpful drawings and remarks - as can be gleaned from most text on the subject but overall I was somewhat disappointed. Primarily the book is a showcase of small touristy type carvings from the author's travels - chili, alaska, etc.There is a wide variety of such material covered but it's presented in more of example format - rather than how to carve.It reminds of some old library book from the 60's. Interesting, informative, but not very current or helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIremagic Grills","review":"I bought a Firmagic Grill almost 14 years ago thinking this is such a great product.

I am stuck with a grill that I can not put a cover on it as thay do not make and do not stock the the metel clips that hold the cover down.

Now my grill will just get worse and worse due the manufacter not stocking parts long term."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's be realistic for a moment","review":"Wonderful recipes, easy to prepare, yes. But most households won't have all the needed ingredients. I'm not talking about needing to buy some scallops. Some of the herbs and seasonings aren't common to keep, and some of the ingredients can be difficult to find, even in my area where Russian, Indian, and Chinese markets are as common as your run-of-the-mill grocery store.

The tension shows even on radio waves and the station's rates soar!Things get tricky when drugs and murder cause a huge scandal at the station and the morning show, which is now called Red Wine for Breakfast, (and I refuse to tell why) is as shaky as the romance between the hosts.*** Perfect!

What I got was a crude, uninteresting collection of meaningless attempts at wit by someone who should stick with lawnmower repair or computer programming. It should be possible to do a clever rebuttal to preppyness, but this isn't it. It doesn.t even come close.The best part of this book, if you can call it a book, is its cover, which is done somewhat in the style of the Official Preppy Handbook. As such, it makes a colorful companion to the OPH on the bookshelf, but don't pay more than a quarter for this extremely boring, unclever attempt at wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"After reading a few favorable comments, I decided to purchase this item.

I can't think of a better pair of commentaries to use in a seminar on Heidegger. Whereas Dreyfus concentrates mostly on Division One of 'Being and Time', White aims to interpret all of Being and Time, and especially Division Two, in the light of Heidegger's later thought. This is exactly the sort of work many Heideggerians have been waiting for from Dreyfus or, as in White's case, one of his talented students. It is masterfully and beautifully written, and it accomplishes its extremely ambitious aims in less than 200 pages. There are references in the footnotes to unpublished chapters that are available online. As soon as Ashgate publishes this book in paperback it should become a standard resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bread!","review":"We were thrilled with the quality of this loaf of sliced bread.

In order to fully appreciate the Dust Brother's music, you MUST have seen Fight Club. Otherwise, it is simply a weird mixture of techno and percussion. This soundtrack does not really have the techno dance flave that you would expect; in fact, it's kind of relaxing. I would definitely recommend it for fans of the movie.

Clearly you are attempting to look to far into it, but are just making a fool of yourself! This soundtrack is so amazing that I don't blame them for releasing it. The Dust Brothers put it all together with a mix of ambience, techno, big beat, electronica, jazz, acid, rock, and even monastery hymns all slapped into one hour-long music trip that takes you to Paper Street and back. This is a definite buy for all of you well-rounded music lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Jack's utter dissapointment.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Fight Club. And I think the Dust Brothers are excellent music producers. I'll even go so far as to say that their music fit the movie extremely well. However, the soundtrack is meant to complement the movie... and ONLY to complement the movie. On it's own it is bland, lifeless, and unmusical in every sense of the word.

If you like dark, ambient techno and electronica (which I do) then you will simply love this album. However, this is definitely not an album to purchase if you're looking for something radio-friendly or if you haven't seen the movie. Fans of the movie will find it extremely enthralling.

I found most of their music a bizarre roller coaster of ups and out-of-place bass that my car stereo couldn't handle. So i must say this is a VAST improvement the Music on this album is very cohesive and puts you into a sort of trance no other music does.. it's filled with dark heavy bass lines and sharp eluding highs, It's definatly become one of my favorites, and i sure hope the dust bro's continue to make albums with simmilar stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Complaining","review":"This is a SCORE, it only includes the music by the Dust Brothers because they scored the movie.

The alter ego of our hero and his warped trip through corporate america. If you are like me and live in countless hotels each week, then you will understand the beat, the tempo and the pulse of this score. Though the middle weakens, the opening and ending are great! Perfect score for the film..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a person who likes dance soundtracks very much, and Ihave always bought CDs on the base of their reviews. The previous Matrix soundtrack is my Idea of an excelent sountrack, rich in music styles, non-monotonic and simply amazing; most important: one does not have to watch the film to enjoy the sountrack. This soundtrack is simply boring. Frankly, I have not watched the film yet, and I am not amused by the way the appearence of tracks are; it seems that it is created based on the film clips. In every track, there is always a pause between beats which in my opinion is good, but when the whole CD features the same style of music - it kills the richness one expects from a soundrack. Try listening to one track - it reflects the whole album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film music... but it doesn't stand up on its own","review":"Fight Club is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen. Yeah, I'm a fanboy. And what? And to make a great film flow, you need great music, right? Well, you need great music that fits the film, and the Dust Brother's score more than does the trick. The film is dark yet satirical, and it needed a score that would compliment that.However, the score simply doesn't stand up on its own. At times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere, but its only a part of a tense scene. And hence, it sounds rather empty by itself.No matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it (as I did), I wouldn't recommend it. Like so many other scores, it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damned Lie","review":"I am very frustrated. And even not by the fact, that this album IS NOT A REAL FILM SOUNDTRACK. The whole Internet does not contain any mention about list of real tracks used in film. You, Dust Brother's fans, of course, can have your own fun. (The Dust Brothers can have their money). But I know that there was a Tom Waits song \\"Goin Out West\\" in real tracks. There was a Pixies song \\"Where Is My Mind?\\". Where can I get a REAL soundtrack with this songs ? Where can I find at least a name of song, which sounds while clubbers try to fight passers-by ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really wanted that Pixies song...","review":"I liked the music, but like the other guy, I was wondering why that Pixies song wasn't on there!?

The music listening public has praised their name without even knowing it ever since Tone Loc sprung up on the scene.After reading Fight Club, and hearing of David Fincher's plan to make it into a movie, I was more than excited. Upon hearing that The Dust Brothers were scoring the film, I became ecstatic!Some of the material on this soundtrack is more spare than other Dust Brothers productions, but that can be expected of any film score. The rest is something no one would expect from a film score; a collage of sample heavy soundscapes with interesting changes worthy of the best DJ's attention, and the experimental junkie's praise. I'm sure that within the context of the film, it will be even more exquisite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I found this CD to be a big disappointment.

The Dust Brothers are great too, but without the images from the film, the compositions sound downright boring. The single track found at the end, \\"this is your life\\", is quality because it bears the doctrine of the antagonist. There should've been more voice-dubs added, because the film is rife with great quotes and quips. I was upset that both the Tom Waits track \\"Goin' Out West\\" from Lou's place and \\"Where is my Mind?\\" by the Pixies was excluded. They were what i would buy the album for, two of the greatest acts ever extablished."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is pretty good techno, but I expected to hear more on it.","review":"The entire soundtrack consists of techno beats and a few shortlived melodies. It is a nice album to have, if you are into the techno genre of music.However, I bought the album expecting to hear the song I heard playing through the later part of the trailer, and was very dissappointed that it was left out.

This book has information on every (or nearly every) public-use airport in the state. For every tower-controlled airport, there is a photo, a fold-out approach map, and a full-page airport diagram. For non-towered airports, there is a smaller photo and diagram. For every airport, there is information about nearby attractions, food, lodging, transportation, fuel and maintenance availability, etc.However, the best feature, by far, is the year of revision service included with the guide. (After that, I think it's $26/year.) The updates arrive in the mail 3x/year, so your guide is always up to date with frequencies and airspaces.This is the best guide I've seen for getting around California.

For a book to tout a one-stop-fits-all is beyond absurd. The only reason I gave this book a one is there are no zero's to chose.Do yourself a favor, steer clear. The authors espouse being objective in our thinking, to open our paradigm to new experiences, and then start the longest subjective diatribe I've ever had to endure.Maybe this works for the authors, but I categorizing every human being into tiny compartmental entities and then obviously leave out the tenets of all major psychological and ethical works since Aristotle, is unexcuseable.This was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I was on Safari at work looking for books to read and keep me busy. I came across this one, and read a few things here and there. Personally, I felt like the attitude in the book was somewhat prejudiced. It was like the authors put out their own opinions, and didn't care to know anyone elses. A lot of the things they said were true and quite enlightening, but others... not so much. I feel like the authors are somewhat closed-minded, and I find it kind of annoying. I feel like they were saying all religious people, and those who follow astrology are stupid (this pertains to the parts I have read so far). This isn't always the case. I am not religious, nor do I follow astrology... I just felt kind of taken aback with the attitude in the book.

The writing is quite poor, grammatically and logically in places. The opening 3 or 4 chapters seem like nothing more than an advertisement for a a new type of spirituality. I felt like I was being preached at to find a higher pwer more than I was being talked to about ways to improve critical thinking. Perhaps the term \\"critical thinking\\" is the issue. It means different things to different people. To me it means thinking in a more analytical, questioning fashion to help you reach more well thought out conclusions. This book does not provide that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fit for critical thinking","review":"Although the authors have plenty of authority in this field, the book comes across to me as marketing or propaganda. They have focused on what they view as the essence of critical thinking which they call \\"fairmindedness.\\" However, their intent seems less about teaching people how to apply logic to life's situations and more about an agenda of promoting liberal, Humanist philosophy. They eschew emotion as counterproductive to \\"fairmindedness,\\" yet the text is replete with emotionally charged words, symbols, and examples.

I've tried other drinks and this is the one that is the best. I once used their low glycemic index version which was even better but have not run across it in a long time. This one is great, though.I have also used Cytomax when I have to do hard work outside in the heat, it really helps my resistance to the high temperatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cytomax, the best for cycling and running!","review":"I have been using Cytomax for over 20 years for endurance cycling and racing.

The old Tangy Orange was smooth and satisfying with no aftertaste. The newer version leaves a sharp aftertaste in the back of the throat long after is is consumed. Not sure if the addition of Stevia is the cause. I just can't drink it like I used to and now choke it down like all the other nasty sports drinks that are so common. Also the addition of caffeine to Tangy Orange was a surprise. I don't like to consume added stimulants as they just don't work for me and lead to GI distress on the trail. Also what's up with all the foam after shaking it up in the water bottle? Cytomax has been so good to me over the years and I'm disappointed that this version has become more unpalatable. I used to give Cytomax 5 stars, now just 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"New formula - Yuk!","review":"Unbeknownst to me, the new formula was shipped to me. I used to love this stuff. It worked great and tasted palatable. I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it. That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin.

However, responsible h-f authors ground their stories in the period and the characters, rather than distorting both to make the story they want.Katherine of Aragon is one of the better documented women of her time, but the historical Katherine is unrecognizable in this book. (For a lovely portrait, try Mattingly's superb bio - no harlequin romance escapades there, but a beautifully told story.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give zero stars.","review":"If you ignore the fact that Philippa Gregory's writing style is dull and that she overuses italicized thought paragraphs to show what the main character is thinking, which is so very annoying... and this can all be overlooked if the tale is exciting... and this tale is not..... you're still left with half a story. The book ends before Henry even begins his infamous casanova-ist adventures. I can't say all of the references to Isabella of Spain were necessary. If I wanted to read about Isabella, I would have bought a book about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Inaccurate","review":"I wish people would stop referring to Gregory's novels as \\"Historical Fiction\\" and relegate her to where she belongs - \\"romance\\". Gregory pointedly ignores and distorts historical fact in order to write extraordinarily boring fiction \\"based\\" on real people.The true lives of the Tudors were scandalous, entertaining, and fascinating. It's amazing how Gregory can manipulate them in an attempt to make them more interesting only to make them completely tedious.The Constant Princess is a poorly written Harlequin romance novel populated by people bearing the same names as historical characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Disappointment When Compared to her Other Novels","review":"Let me preface by saying that I am a huge fan of Philippa Gregory's novels. When she writes, she has the amazing ability to put you there, in the center of her stories. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" inspired me to go on and read more about these fascinating times and fascinating people. However, this book, not only took me 40 some odd pages to actually take hold of, in the end I was left feeling completely drained and empty. No substance to Catalina, Katherine, and no substance to any of the characters. For further thought, I think we all understand that these are but works of fiction based on actual fact, but so were all of her other novels. I, too, think that she may be writing to quickly for her own good. Not a good read. Very disappointing, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed- Missing Pages!","review":"I ordered this book from amazon back in August and finally got around to reading it while I was on vacation. I was really enjoying the book, and then I found that the book jumped from page 344-377. It was missing over 30 pages! It had not been torn out, it must have been misprinted. Needless to say I am thoroughly disappointed that the book which looked to be in good shape missed the whole end of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This book was totally unblievable. The dialogue was a clumsy attrmpt to fill in the history of the period. Much of the book was repetitious, and it did not make sense to me. The last quarter of the story turnes from character study to tales of war. The book was a large disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"I am about 2/3 through with it, but it has held my interest from the beginning. Can't wait to read every night! In reading other Gregory books, I had a much different view of Catherine of Aragon. Of course this is fiction based on historical facts, but it is an interesting take on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged on and on!","review":"I have read several of Philippa's other books, and enjoyed them quite a lot. This one happens to be about my favorite Tudor Queen, so I was very excited to read it. It ended up being a big disappointment! I'm not about to talk about the parts of history that were inaccurate, I don't read Gregory's books for accuracy, they are fiction and I feel that gives her a little bit of room to rewrite history. However, there simply wasn't enough going on! We get it, she waited, years and years she waited, it felt like that's what were were waiting as readers! I'm still a Gregory fan, of course, but this is not her best work. I wish Gregory had focused less on the waiting in a little castle, and talked more about her as Queen, because she was so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably Shallow and Inaccurate","review":"What a bizarre book! I have read many fictional biographies of the Tudor era and this is one of the very worst. Not only are the characters very shallow and one-dimensional, the entire premise is historically inaccurate.Katharine of Aragon was a very pious, deeply devout Roman Catholic and to suggest that she embraced Moslem customs and beliefs is just too bizarre to believe. She was also deeply devoted to Henry VIII and to suggest otherwise goes against documented historical record.As if the sappy storyline (suitable for a romance novel)wasn't insult enough, Ms. Gregory's disregard for truth is the one constant thread in the whole entire novel.To cap it off, the disjointed narrative method adds its own cachet of awfullness. I personally don't need to read every few pages that Katharine believed herself born and designated by God to be Queen of England.Nora Lofts has written a far better book about her-the Kings Pleasure. Do yourself a favor and read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's historical fiction but....","review":"Yes, we know it's historical fiction but historical fiction is supposed to have some basis in actual historical fact besides just the names and a basic outline of the situation. This is true for this novel as well as her new one, The Other Boleyn Girl. In most historical fiction novels, even regular fiction novels, when the authors play fast and loose with some of the facts they tell you at the beginning or the end that they have modified facts for the stories sake and then tell you which ones. Then we can still enjoy the fiction but the facts are preserved. The problem when an author doesn't feel that they are bound by this professional coutesy is that readers who are not well versed in the history, read this book and think that what they are reading is true. HISTORICAL fiction does imply that a lot of what you are reading is fact and people cannot be blamed for assuming that some of what they are reading is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time. I couldn't force myself to get to the end. Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't. The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable. I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice fictionalized history","review":"Philippa Gregory does a wonderful job researching her history. The story about Katherine of Aragon is compelling and that Ms. Gregory has set the story around Katherine's youth and at her most powerful is a nice change from her just being Henry XIII's abandoned first wife.At the end of the book, the author answers some questions. This helps put in context her telling of Katherine's tale. The only thing I questioned was her assumption that Henry's self focus was based on an indulged youth as \\"second son\\" because he was not expected to ascend the throne. Henry's elder brother, Arthur, died when Henry was only 11 and he doesn't actually become king till seven years later. There was lots of king-in-training time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tell me a story...\\"","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Philippa Gregory did an excellent job writing this work of fiction.

However, I found myself...bored with the characters, the story. It was not engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, new look into Catherine of Aragon","review":"I thought this book was wonderful. I have been a fan of Philippa Gregory books for quite some time now and own all the books she has written. This particular book gave me a new perspective on Catherine of Aragon. It showed me more about Catherine besides what happened to her when Henry VII left her for Anne Boleyn. You get to know her as a child, a young woman, a great leader and wonderful queen. It is a great read for anyone interested in Tudor history.I make jewelry based on pieces worn on the tv show \\"The Tudors\\".

As others have said, Gregory often repeats certain points to death. Every other page, it seems, Catalina is reminding herself and everyone else that she is the Infanta of Spain/Princess of Wales/Queen to be/daughter of Isabella and that everything is God's will. I find myself skimming a lot of these passages because they're so repetetive and don't further the story at all. The author also has an annoying habit of using \\"D'you\\" in her dialog, which doesn't fit with the formal style of the rest of her writing, and using \\"especial\\" instead of special. She doesn't use any other \\"Spanish-isms\\", so her use of \\"especial\\" seems gratuitous.I bought \\"The Other Boelyn Girl\\" at the same time, and I hope that it's better than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Constant Princess - Another Philippa Gregory Hit","review":"I've been a big fan of Philippa Gregory's Tudor/Elizabethan era novels since I read The Other Boleyn Girl last year. Since then, I have read 4 more of her books in this genre, including The Constant Princess. I enjoyed the novel tremendously and came to admire the main character, Katharine of Aragon, based on Gregory's account of her upbringing and her life at the Tudor court.Before I had read this book, I had always thought of Henry VIII's first wife as the older, less attractive queen who was supplanted by the more glamourous Anne Boleyn in Henry's heart. This book gave me a much richer perspective of her time and her character. I also gained a new respect for her resolve and the strength of her character throughout her life, especially given the humiliations she had to endure first under Henry VII and then in Henry VIII's efforts to divorce her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual perspective on Katherine of Aragon","review":"I, perhaps like most, had very little knowledge of Katherine of Aragon, or Catalina, as Gregory refers to her, beyond her being Henry VIII's first wife. Yes, I knew she had married his older brother, and after his death, had been subject to humilation and ill treatment by her father-in-law, but little more. I found this work of Grergory's to really dig into her personality and the events as they may have unfolded. I enjoyed the style of the work very much, as it passed between third person and the musings of Catalina herself in the first person. I have read many of Gregory's other works, and enjoyed The Constant Princess just as much.I loved the ending!! Not quite where I expected the book to stop, but it made perfect sense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Constant Page Turner","review":"If you love English history especially the intriguing life and loves of Henry VIII, then this is the book for you. The Constant Princess is a rich novel written from Catherine of Aragon's point of view. Philippa Gregory transports you back in time to the challenging life of a noble woman. In this novel you experience all the difficult hardships Catherine faced in her adopted country as well as her husbands and parents wickedness. Filled with passion, love, betrayal, suspense, cruelty, lust, and lies, this tale of Henry's first wife will have you wanting more (which fortunately is available)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly dull.","review":"I've been reading about the Tudors for many many years but this is the first book I read about Katherine. I was always interested in her and felt pity for her because of the whole Boleyn affair. But I found it hard to stay interested in this book. Not that Katherine isn't a fascinating person, it's just that there is nothing that really leaps off the pages of this book. It almost felt like Gregory got bored with the book herself and decided instead of researching and writing more about Katherine's reign, to leap ahead about 20 years to the trial at Blackfriars just to get it done. But perhaps the biggest annoyance to me was the switch to Katherine's thoughts by using italics. Reading pages and pages of italicized text is not so easy on the eyes and I found myself skipping those parts a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work","review":"I loved The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen's Fool, but this novel is not up the standards Philippa Gregory set in those two books. It started out strong, but became repetitive and boring, with little for the title character to do but pace around various castles and prisons reciting internal monologs about why she \\"must be queen!\\" For readers who enjoy historical fiction written about this era, I strongly recommend Margaret George's Autobiography of Henry VIII or Mary Queen of Scotland and the Isles, both truly brilliant historical novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"I've been a big fan of Philippa Gregory and I'd looked forward to reading her new novel. But I have to say this is a total disappointment.1) Unsatisfactory ending: The story ended when it got interesting. (When Anne began to threaten her status.) Where's the beef? How can you talk about Katherine's life without her divorce or the painful process leading to the divorce?2) Weak and contradictory charactor development. Her description of Katherine's personality/charactor in this novel and that in Other Bolyne Girl do not really match. I didn't feel the Queen in \\"Constant...\\" and the Queen in \\"The Other...\\" are the same person. Katherine in \\"The Other\\" was totally in love with Henry but Katherine in \\"Constant\\" was a very calculative woman who married him b/c of his status.3) Lack of continuity: Except for Henry, Katherine and other minor charactors, no major charactors in \\"The Other...\\" appeared in \\"Constant.\\"I hope her next novel will be much better than this.

Gregory spins her usual magic at blending historical fact with romantic thrilling adventure, and making us love the protaganist, here Catalina/Katherine. Toward the end it tapered, and I feel the real meat is in the middle, at seeing her ascendance as princess -twice.

I really had high hopes for it. I've read \\"Earthly Joys\\" and \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", both of which I found enjoyable, despite the comma splice errors et. al. This story, however, was told with such cumbersome and repetitive diction that I put it down after the first 1/5 and gnashed my teeth in exasperation.Apart from the annoying stylistic faux pas, the character and plot development proved woefully improbable and wholly unsatisfactory. Catalina is very rarely amiable, and for the most part she comes across as arrogant, religiously fanatical, stubborn and somewhat asinine. Every time she mentions her mother I just want to slap her.I painfully finished the book after a 2-week hiatus, hoping that a fresh perspective might help, but unfortunately the story just grew more and more tiresome.

This is the worst she has ever written, and the last I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite but learned a lot","review":"I was expecting a lot more from this book. I found it actually kind of boring at times. I love Philippa Gregory but I wasn't impressed by this one. I think Katherine was a great and admirable woman and I hate how her life ended but nothing too much happened in this book. Here's a summary: Katherine came from a powerful kingdom whose parents were great warriors. She married King Henry VIII's brother out of love but he died and married King Henry VIII who was much younger than her and who did have a boy's puppy love for her. They reined side by side for the first few years of their marriage and Henry trusted and honored Katherine. Until he began to come into manhood and became paranoid and had a wondering eye. From there it tells how Henry falls out of love with Katherine and in love with Anne Boleyn and how he tries to denounce their marriage and cast her out which she eventually dies of emotional and physcial neglect. That sums it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Philippa Gregory please write the next book?","review":"I have read The Other Boleyn Girl, The Virgin's Lover and The Queen's Fool,and looked forward to spending part of my vacation with Katharine of Aragon in The Constant Princess. Big mistake. This book must have been written by someone other than Philippa Gregory: it is shallow, skims the surface, and is simplistic. The character of Katherine-- as well as each of the others--is not developed and is little more than a cartoon. The writing is awful and repetitive. All in all a bitter disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last 1/4th of this book is terrible","review":"I love this author. I pre ordered this book before it was published. I just finished it this morning. I thought it would never end. The last section of the book is dead boring!I am a student of Tudor History and this book covers the subject like a soap opera.The book ends without telling the reader how Catherine actually ended up before the courts. If you don't know the history you are lost.Very, very disappointing work by an otherwise excellent author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best.","review":"This book started off pretty well. The story is carried on alternating between third person narrative and first person voice-over by Katherine. Unfortunately, Phillipa Gregory only wrote half of a book. She seems to have completely lost interest in the story about 2/3 of the way through. She takes Katherine up to the point that she is pregnant with Mary, and has defeated the Scots, then skips over more than a decade, and ends the story. She spends a lot of time developing Katherine as a determined fighter, and then leaves out arguably, the most interesting fight Katherine ever had-that with Anne Boleyn. Maybe she should have written one novel about Katherine's younger years, and then a sequel. This princess/queen deserves better. Too bad. I have enjoyed other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Who knows what the real truth is about Catherine.

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a Half Stars Please","review":"While \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" was richly imagined in great detail, most of this book was repetitive and generalized.

I would like to see Katherine of Aragon's story written again with more emphasis on the political element rather than the wedding and bedding element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Phillippa Gregory!","review":"Really have enjoyed all of the 5 books that this lady has written.

I was bored....not near the caliber of OBG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history, fasinating storyline","review":"I'm a big fan of Gregory's writing and this is definatly my favorite book by her. The characters in this book are very real and the history is great, also unlike some of her other books i didn't feel that she left out too much of the history which made the book much more enjoyable for me to read. The love story in this book was wonderful and because the characters seemed so real to me i felt like the romance didn't feel as forced or irrelivent as in sometimes does in her other books. If I had to give a critizem i would say that the time where Catherine in basically forced to stay in England after Aurther dies draged on too long and was a little boring but other than that, i would say that this is an amazing book and i think that whether you like gregory's writing because of the history of the character's romance this story will fasanate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Constant Princess","review":"Disappointing. Not on a par with \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" by Gregory. I couldn't get past the historical innacuracies, such as portraying Henry VII as lusting after Katherine, and giving Katherine and Arthur a sexual relationship which is something most historians agree did not happen. For a much better historical fiction, read Jean Plaidy's \\"Katharine of Aragon\\". Or for historical accuracy, read Allison Weir's \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it for the pictures, not for the prose","review":"How fitting that Wallace writes of 100 years of the orphanage's history.

Every student of the Bible should own--and use--a set. Barclay adds life to Bible stories by explaining the customs of the first century. He helps our understanding of the text by explaining word selection: The various meanings, where else in the New Testament the word was used, etc. When new characters enter the Bible text, he describes them fully. He goes outside the Bible for historical material that helps with understanding. My only quibble is that Barclay absolutely, positively does not believe in miracles, while I do--and have stories to tell that can't be explained any other way. So, I disagree strongly with Barclay about miracles, but this information-packed series is still very much worth buying and reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"MINE\\"","review":"I think that Robert McCammon is a great writer.

I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is one of the best in this genre, and the characters are drawn superbly. It's a real page turner. I've always judged a thriller by its ability to surprise me at every next page, and this one wins hands down. If I can't guess what's going to happen next, I consider myself entertained. If you enjoy suspense thrillers, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent psychological suspense","review":"I have read enough horror and suspense novels over the years that I do not get shocked or scared easily. McCammon's character Mary Terror was a truly scary person. The opening scene she has in the book hooked me until the end. The rest of the book was a close look inside a very sick and screw up mind. The only complaint I would make is the protagonist did not come off as the most likable person. She wasn't bad, but you didn't exactly pull for her with everything you had. You keep reading to get farther inside Mary Terror's head and then you're sorry that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"This is my favorite book, I reread it every few years! exciting read I'd love to see this made into a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamentable","review":"McCammon has managed to make his protagonist, Laura Clayburne, even more detestable than his villain, Mary Terrell.

This was a damn good book, with lots of suspense and action. Not so much a horror story, but it does have some scary moments. Mary Terror is a violent, crazy character that can also be related to as someone who is left totally alone to cope with a world that has changed for everybody but herself. The only problem I could find with \\"Mine\\" was the ending, which seemed sort of abrupt. After everything else that happened throughout the story, I guess therewasn't much more for the two main characters to go through. A well-written book that I would recommend. 4 and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a B2B Implementation Management guide......","review":"This in my opinion is a primer in project management not an E-Business Implementation Management guide for business to business initiatives.The book promises to address the \\"burgeoning market for \\"buy-side\\" extranet/Internet procurement supply chain management / business-to-business, Web based transactions\\". There are for example 3 appearances of the word supplier in the entire book.A number of typographical errors exist.

SLICK was totally different - One of the few novels of which I read every word -(I even skimmed DaVinci Code.) Fast paced, intriguing characters, and no silly car chases or melodramatic seduction scenes. Really makes you think, and gives you lots of neat info for Jeopardy in the process.

Everyday, new evidence is presented that debunks the myth's told by the left about the war. Could it be that with the facts piling up for the republicans, that good, patriotic(read socialist) liberals have decided to use their clout in their chosen industries to launch expensive, and visually appealing propaganda to help turn the tides in an election year?

The message it delivers is so ineptly handled with unfunny humor and bald-faced hatred that it fails as propaganda. It is not funny, so it fails as satire. And because it tries so desperately to be satire and propaganda, it fails as horror.Clearly, the people involved in this sad project hate conservatives--which is fine. Many people do. But not many artists do to a degree that blinds their aesthetic judgments (Tim Robbins can churn out excellent parody, for example). The script seems like it was written by an angry co-ed.

I could never hear it make a note on my XP system. The manual says \\"Please note that when you press a key on the keyboard, you will not hear any sound. In order to play a sound, you will need to configure your music software. Please consult with your music software manual\\". Well, since I don't have 'music software' I'm out of luck. I just thought this product would have some computerized keyboard lessons - which it very well may, but you need to own and understand 'music software', which is an entirely external expense, with a huge learning curve of its own.

You can always watch them over and over and catch something you didn't notice the first time you watched it, and learn a new lesson each time. This movie is one of the best of the Madeas. You will laugh from beginning to end. This movie actually focuses on Madea a lot more than the other movies. You know, in the other Madea movies you may see about 20 minutes of Madea throughout the entire movie. In this movie, it is all about her. It focuses on her for once. I really enjoyed it. My niece and I saw it in theaters when it first came out. We could not wait for it to come out on DVD so we could download it from Amazon. That is exactly what we did and we have enjoyed many of laughs since we got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Pg13 is not the correct rating in my opinion.

The fact that one of the characters kept insinuating that African Americans men have longer \\"blanks\\" by how they use the bathroom and that they like bigger rear ends on women so they can slap them and position them was so offensive to me as a christian.

But I like to 'witness' things for myself. I generally would give his work 5 stars. This movie was good. However it seemed to move a little slower than the other Madea movies. Some of the jokes and puns were old and were used in previous TP movies. But I always love the messages that Tyler Perry's movies and plays display. I also love Madea.

I'm a big Tyler Perry fan, but his \\"Madea\\" movies are starting to get predictable and boderline boring. This movie really left me hanging, Madea taking in a white family under the witness protection program. In reality, a family would not be placed with a individual that has a criminal record. But, anyway for comedy sake I get it! But the storyline was written like a cheesy unrelateable sitcom. I lost interest half way through the movie and was tempted to just turn it off and watch something else. I'm glad I didn't pay $12 to see this at the movies ..

Come on, who in the world convinced him that Denise Richards could act? The out-takes at the end of the movie were funnier than the movie itself.

Would be a great gift for Christmas or gift anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the classic Madea","review":"In the earlier movies, such a Dairy of a Mad Black Woman, Madea Goes to Jail, or Family Reunion, Madea was a likeable character even if she could be very aggressive and in your face, because it was coming from the right place. It was easy to cheer her on when she was wreaking havoc, because she offered pearls of wisdom along the way.The plot for this movie was slapdash, and Madea was not very likeable in this, she just came across as more vindictive (in a needless way) and really annoying. All in all, if you like Madea, avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE Tyler Perry and Medea","review":"But Tyler could just as easily have phoned this in.

Well, I am going to go against this old adage, and say, that this is probably the worst Tyler Perry production so far. It was vapid, empty of substance, not funny or entertaining, and not the least bit compelling, or provocative... If you are a Madea/Tyler Perry collector, then I guess you can add it to your collection, but otherwise, you can afford to skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Make","review":"It seems Tyler Perry is just out to make money with his usual Madea films without putting much effort into it.

Great for family night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Hilarious!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I like the fact that Tyler was able to play more role at one time for longer scenes. For instance, Medea was able to talk to uncle and Tyler as the lawyer was interacting with both of them at the same time for longer scenes. So I really thought that was really interesting . Over all I really was pleased. Really Hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madea's Best Yet!!!","review":"This is quite possibly the best Madea movie to date. Madea has a lot more screentime, making the movie better and funnier. There's hardly any random subplot drama at all. It's a flat-out comedy starring Madea and Eugene Levy. The jokes are hilarious and keep coming. Levy plays George Needleman, a dorky businessman marked for death by a crime family after his company goes bankrupt and he is framed for money laundering. Brian Simmons takes the case and suggests the Needeleman family stay at Madea's house. (That's when all heck breaks loose as she tries to teach them love and respect) Will George and Madea be able to find the money and give it back to the charities? I highly recommend MADEA'S WITNESS PROTECTION!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another TP Movie","review":"I watched this movie hoping it would be different from ALL of the other Madea movies, but it was a typical TP movie...same plot, same story line, same tired lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"baaaaaad","review":"This movie has bad acting, bad setting, bad story, and a very bad plot.

Boring and a little bit pointless. I'd like to recommend the book, but I'm only about half-way through and find myself skipping entire pages - I mean, who really wants to read all those letters he wrote to home when he was at boarding school? It's a little like reading the shopping list of a famous person - no matter how interesting that person may have been, it's just not that interesting to read about the mundane details of his or her life.For a really great biography on another enigmatic scientist, try \\"Tesla - Man Out of Time\\" by Margaret Cheney. Now, that's the way to write a biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much detail for me","review":"I found the story of Alan Turing's life to be very interesting. His original work on dreaming up a \\"thinking machine\\" that would eventually become what we know as a computer and his work on breaking the German \\"enigma\\" code are worth knowing about. His tragic end is cause for us all to remember the importance of tolerance. However, I found this book to be too long and detailed for my tastes. I think the story could have been told in one half or one third the space. So I would recommend that anyone interested in the history of science read a biography of Turing, but a different one than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedium","review":"With so many good reviews (5 stars), somebody doesn't know what makes a good book.

Not to mention several incorrect math answers.Example would be on page 771 (Data and Probability) Exercise two-Part A-question 2- it Asks, \\"How many calories are in 2.5 cups of brown rice?\\". On the chart listed on the previous page, it has a list of foods whose nutrional value is listed by one cup. The brown rice has calories of 667 for one cup and carbohydrates as 140. The answer givin by this book is: \\"350\\" calories. Actually, 350, is the answer for 2 1/2 cups of Carbohydrates. I found wrong answers givin multitude of times in this book. I was willing to overlook one maybe two...but not consistant as it is.Very poor job on the publisher for allowing this.

Makes one wonder how effective the authors were in creating the rest of its content.In fact, the relevancy not found in the preview makes me think the authors are not too confident in their \\"epic.\\" Sadly, it might have some good content.

I would actually say that the test questions on the book were harder than the actual test.What is most important when reading the question in this book, and the test itself, especially in \\"controversial\\" areas such as social studies etc, is that you can ignore whatever \\"biases\\" you have (or perceive the book to have, even though this perception is likely to your own biases) by carefully reading the question and ONLY considering the aspects that the question raises. So take the practice exams on the CD-ROM, read and truly try to understand any questions you might have got wrong, because within the content of the question there should not be many answers assumed incorrectly by McGraw-Hill. I think I counted only couple of question from all of them that had the 'wrong' answer, to best of my knowledge. Still, I think it was a great study book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book has all that I need to be ready!","review":"I'm glad I have this book.

He further gave only one request of His disciples, prayer for evangelism (Matthew 9:38; Luke 10:2). This book will help you to see the burden of the Lord for the nations. Every nation and known people group is found in the pages of this book. I have found no other book on praying for the nations like this book. Johnstone (and Operation Mobilization) give the disciple enough information to help us to pray for the gospel to be spread in every nation (Matt. 28:19).You and I may never have the chance to visit Saudi Arabia, Japan, or the tip of Argentina with the gospel of Christ but we can pray for these nations and ask the Father to open their eyes to the truth of the gospel (1 Timothy 2:1-6). And this book will help us in that process."},{"rating":"2","title":"expanding your worldview","review":"Purchasing this book has already helped me alot with getting out of my bubble. there are so many things going on out in other countries concerning the state of the church that really need to be brought to the american christians attention. it makes me realize how petty some of our conversations really are amongst believers.in regards to informational content this book is very ehlpful, but i have noticed that concerning certain taboo issues in the american church it might be reflective of opinoin more than the actual state of things. homosexuality for example seemed to be viewed by the writers as having a more militant threat in american, which from my point of view the church has as much militant threat as the homosexual community, if mot more. thats just one issue that i noticed. etc, etc, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like World Domination","review":"This book sounds like something out of the Crusades where Christians want to overthrow all other religions.

Due to the sensational nature of these stories they were neglected. Jones was one of the few original critics in this area. His book covers different magazines, publishers, and authors. He also focuses on different conventions within the subgenre. One shortcoming of the book is that, at times, it seems to rely too much on quotes directly from the primary texts (pulps). On an entertainment level, Jones's exuberance easily translates through his writing. This book is hard to find, but worth it for fans and scholars of the \\"weird menace\\" tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A French Revolution!","review":"Very contrary to his previous albums, Dany Brillant outstands as he sings Dolce Vita. I personally recommend the first 4 tracks of the album, \\"Tant qu'il y aura des femmes\\" being my favorite.

I have heard this album from a very close friend of mine and I fell in love with it. I recommend it to everyone who are interested in french songs. This guy has the voice of an angel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond sales pitch","review":"This book doesn't have the depth of Ian Witten's \\"Data Mining\\", yet it is an excellent book on its own.

Unfortunately, the author misses this and other more subtle cultural changes that impact today's adolescents in a big way. I recommend Elkind's \\"All Grown Up and No Place to Go\\" for a more thorough critique of how society shapes and complicates the teenage years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too problem-focused","review":"This is just the latest of so many books that view normal adolescent development primarily from a problem perspective. Sure, there are challenges in adolescence for both teens and parents, and sometimes there are major problems to be addressed. But most adolescents, and parents, somehow manage the old and the new complexities of this period just fine. For a more positive approach, I recommend Laurence Steinberg's \\"You and Your Adolescent.\\" Another fascinating book by Steinberg focused on school-related issues is \\"Beyond the Classroom.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Reich","review":"The Last Reich is a novel with a twist on World War II. Germany wins the war but America reacts with fury and fire. Arthur Rhodes is at his best with his description of the four battles. He writes crisp and cunning plots, a complex thriller. He is not one to go into great detail, but moves the story along at footrace pace to the final battle. Older readers will recognize many of the famous names in the book, and why the Normandie Invasion failed with General Clark in command not General Eisenhower. Mr. Rhodes waves the flag a great deal and appeals to the young and young at heart. I especially was taken with the young Commander Iberson who wins the battle at the Golden Gate Bridge and the Rio Grande with his amazing feats, and courage. He is a man who can inspire Captains to carry ammunition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, very bad writing","review":"Alternate history has to stand on a believable premise and good writing and in my opinion this book has only one leg. I found the premise believable, a German victory in WWII through poor US leadership because of the early death of Roosevelt. The writing looked like a first draft, and a bad one. I find it hard to believe even the author proofread this book, much less the editor. Often, a new paragraph will start to describe a different character in a different country with no new chapter or section or even introduction. The characters are wooden with no depth. The conversations are not believable.I give it two stars because I found the plot interesting. However, the writing was inexcusably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea... my kingdom for an editor!","review":"This book is the classic example of how good ideas could be completely ruined. The author came up with a good premise... which included how the war could have been won, and how battles could have been fought on American soil... even how the internal conflicts within the Reich could have affected its control of the world.But that is it; there are no more good qualities to the novel. Sadly, the author cannot write. (...) His punctuation and grammar make it difficult to read; I only finished the novel because I was interested in how it would end... such a pity.It is obvious that Mr. Rhodes used a small printing company, and possibly his own money, to publish this novel; it is a pity that a major publisher did not pick it up, because this book would be a bestseller with the help of some major editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!?!?!","review":"Don't buy this book.

Much of the same content was found in all 3! The message I received is that unless my body is \\"enhanced\\" it is not fit to catch a boy. In a society where we are trying to teach girls to accept themselves as they are, this is outrageous. The stories do not have anything funny, I did not laugh even once. I felt violated when the young girls clothes were ripped off, and when they were seduced into getting drunk, appearing in swimsuit contest, and posing for dirty pictures. One girl is seduced into an 'aphrodisiac bath' with another girl! In all 3 books, girls are shown taking showers while being watched; there is no redeeming value to this type of content. Not only don't i recommend these books, i would steer clear of these pornographic excuses for comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying it.","review":"Alright, well, I saw this Manga in my library and I thought I'd borrow it, to read it and boarden my horizans of different genres because I'm a Shonen Ai and Yaoi Fan.This book was rated 13 TEEN and let me tell you, if you think this is a cute little kiddy story it's not!

The albums included here are Holiday (from 1974), Hearts (1975), Hideaway (1976), and Harbor (1977). All four albums include the orginal three members of the group and were produced by George Martin. Three of the four were big hits when they were released and were million sellers (the only one missing the mark slightly was Harbor which was a moderate hit).This package includes several big hit singles (Sister Golden Hair, Tin Man, Lonely People, Dasy Jane, and Today's the Day) and many album classics that received significant airplay in the 70's (Baby It's Up To You, Another Try, Old Virginia, Woman Tonight, Jet Boy Blue, Amber Cascades, and God of The Sun).

This book is full of constant digressions into totally irrelevant subjects and surveys of papers published since 1960s, which have nothing to do with the MPEG standard. If the authors understood the subject, it would be interesting to hear about the colorspaces, etc., but right now the book sounds like an overview of papers and books that the authors have read. Expect 4-5 references to papers per page in chapter 4. If I wanted to read all those papers I would subscribe to IEEE. And even the summaries don't make sense most of time. In the first 70 pages it didn't seem that there was a single original explanation, chart or formula.Overall: poor writing skills, lack of demonstrable knowledge, 90% of the book is made of summaries and quotes from other places.

This book goes to show writers that anyone can get a book published by paying a publishing house such as Authorhouse to print the book for you. Koch needed an editor bad. A reviewer of this book stated that Koch had spent time interviewing family members. Obviously he didn't read the many footnotes, which distracted from book, the author did not interview any family members. He used another researcher's interviews. This would have been a good book if the author had cut the book by about half and stuck to the actual events and crimes of the Kimes boys, which are fascinating and still deserve a book written about them since this one is almost unreadable. There was no sense in going on about Ray Terrell and members of the Barker Gang. The author admits he didn't think they were involved so why make them a large part of the book.

The songs range from mainstream jazz standards to Guérino's early musette waltz \\"Brise napolitaine,\\" Dorado Schmidt's \\"Swing Dorado,\\" and Moreno's tribute to his mentor, \\"Tchan-Tchou.\\" All in all, its is very mature album, with Moreno moving effortlessly between an undercurrent of the manouche sound blended into arrangements more typical of an American-style jazz combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I was so disappointed in this tea.

It's basically like drinking hot water. Even when I brew it for 5+ minutes and it's dark, it gains nothing.I was hoping to upgrade from the reasonably priced Irish import I've been enjoying (Barry's Tea) to something a little higher quality.

This video greatly disappointed me as it is nothing more than promotional drivel.

It reminds me of these terrible \\"the making of...\\" TV programs the have now to promote movies. It should be given free with subscriptions and not charged for.

I though when I got good enough I might have a chance, now after seeing a bit of what these people go through, I'm even less sure than I was. They go through a lot to get those shots and this is no where near the glamor life you might expect it to be. A real eye opener for sure.

I have had them for a while now and they are really holding up considering I have kids who are not so careful with furniture. I have gotten multiple compliments on this table. It is simple, elegant and modern. I put some nice table runners on them since I do not want them scratched up. Cleans up easily and the drawer is an added plus.

The table is made from plywood and the quality of the craftsmanship is extremely poor. The boxes were fine but the table had scratches and nicks. The face of the drawer came off during shipping, which isn’t a surprise because it feels like it’s made from Styrofoam and was fastened to the rest of the drawer with staples. The drawer itself is not even deep enough to hold our remote. The legs have pre-drilled holes for you to insert a screw which then locks into the holes on the bottom shelf. The major problem is whoever packed this, shipped two of the same set of legs. So I have two legs with screws that don’t line up with two of the wholes on the shelf and cannot completely assemble.

In our country these services are available in limited practices but not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or most insurance plans.

I work in a very busy kitchen and am trying to work my way up from Dishwasher. I bought these knives at the beginning of this year, It's may and they're rusted. They were the perfect weight and were very comfortable to use. They were ok with holding their edges. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for, as usual.","review":"The title says it best. Some of the specifics are that they do in fact rust in the dishwasher, and were quite dull out of the box. Not dull enough that they didn't cut, but dull enough that it made it difficult to cut and resulted in cut fingers.The dog enjoys the plastic utensils, though, hence the second star."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST deal ever!!","review":"I purchased this set few months ago, my biggest mistake. These knives are dully and rusty. I definitely not recommend this bargain to anyone at ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the knives they're supposed to be!","review":"These knives are advertised as stainless steel, but are nothing of the sort!

You wouldn't put fine crystal in the dishwasher... take the 30 seconds to wash your knife by hand.My problem with *these* knives is that they are dull out of the box, they are dull when you sharpen them with the sharpener, and they are dull when you pay to have them professionally sharpened. Dull dull dull. You really do get what you pay for, and possibly a severed finger to boot.Good knives cost good money. I'd rather I'd bought a single good one for the price of this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing what one _could_ get for $... (past tense)","review":"Please do not wash any knives in the dishwasher - they will eventually disintegrate. Also do not leave them soaking or sitting in water, i.e. same result. Just handwash and clean after use, what one should do anyway with every tool that has a handle attached to a blade. One other reason to never put knives in a dishwasher is that the banging + harsh detergents will result in damaged and dull blades faster than one believes.Review changed to a maximum of a 1-star rating, as my original rating does not apply any more! Not at all recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for the money","review":"This looks like it would be a cheep set, but everybody thinks that I paid over $100 for it. The knives are very sharp and think. They don't bend or lose their sharpness like you would expect from a set of this price.

I would highly recommend this to anybody on a budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh--unsharp!","review":"I bought this set and the triumph set, the triumph set is awesome, totally sharp and ergonomic.

I would not buy this product for anything more. The knives are decent. The measuring cups and teaspoons/tablespoons rust. (I have only had this product for about 1.5 weeks and some of the measuring cups I can not use anymore) The plastic tools that come with this set have short handles, affect the taste of your food, and are weak. I try to avoid using these unless I absolutely have to.

But my wife liked it. And I got the set for 20 bucks. Well its really very good for that amount. Its sure not worth $380. But for $20 its a great stuff.

I loved that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think they are great","review":"For $20, this set rocks! We paid over $20 at Walmart 3 years ago for a set that feels light and cheap. These knives have a weight to them, and they actually cut. It is nice that it comes with a sharpener...the only complaint is the butcher knife doesn't fit in the slot in the butcher block....but who cares, that's why we have drawers in our kitchen. The holes in the butcher block are cut entirely through the block....the cheap one we had wasn't like that and if you put the knife too hard back into the slot sawdust would be stuck to the blade.Overall, I am very happy for the $20 price. $300...no, but $20 heck yes!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these knives!

The wood block is made of two pieces glued together, and mine came crooked. The knife handles are not very ergonomic. The plastic accessories, the clincher on the deal for me, are fine but the handles are very short. All in all, while I'd like to return the set I don't feel justified in returning it for what I paid (heavy sigh). And I haven't even USED them yet! Let's hope they don't turn to rust in the dishwasher. We shall see..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginner set...maybe...eh...","review":"It looks impressive, a $ 380.00 set of cutlery for less than $ 40.00. So yes, I ordered a set - I already owned a few Henckels - I lived in Germany - they are way more resonable there. Henckels is a great company. But Sabatier has a pretty good reputation...or so I thought...Until they arrived - I agree with most of the other raters. Nice set, but nobody home...meaning, it's not the quality I expected. I hate that kind of shapener.. (old fashined butcher type) I never get it right. I already had a set of Henckel steak knives and didn't realize that's what the row across the front of the wood block was. Oh well, I should have read or looked more carefully - but you can never have too many steak knives. Bottom line - for the serious cook - this is NOT the set at any price - for beginners.. it's ..umm OK. I am just a sucker for a bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding for the price","review":"These knives are a great buy for the price. They are not the top of the line but are good quality as long as they are properly cared for. You can do just about anything with this set and it is rare to find a cleaver in a set unless you want to spend hundereds of dollars on an expensive set. I find them perfect and for an extremely cheap price you couldn't find a better deal. I liked them so much I purchased an additional set for my sister in-law and her husband for christmas. They are a great starter set and a good up grade from your standard low priced models. I would recommend this set to anyone willing to spend $60-100 on a good quality knife set and would like to save a little.

My roommates don't know how to handle knives (putting them in dishwashers, letting them sit in the sink, etc). So spending a lot of money wasn't an option.The balance is not bad, considering the price. They are not hard to handle, but they do \\"feel\\" cheap. They were not sharp, so I got the important ones sharpened right away (chef, slicer, utility, paring).My one big complaint is that they rust very quickly. The way we treat the knives I expected some rust but these are ridiculous. I end up giving them a CLR bath once a month to keep it under control. Just be aware of it.In short I recommend this to somebody who A) Has little money B) Needs nearly a full set of kitchen tools and C) Doesn't want to or know how to, correctly treat knives. If you fall into all three this is the set for you. Just don't pay more than $25 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected..","review":"I expected a detailed book with case studies and explinations of them.

And Lewis was talking about what most people today (ill-informed as they are) would consider old music (they'd be wrong). What would he think of the tripe people are singing in churches today? What would he think of the pseudo-eroticism of \\"Jesus, Draw me Close\\" and the insipid banality of its accompaniment? I assure you he would not be pleased with this \\"tribute.\\" Why not rather pay tribute to the man in a manner that would not nauseate him? What kind of tribute is this?

Ms. Baca has a pretty voice but it doesn't have a quality that I look for in a singer, a raw sound that can convey real feeling.The arrangements are trite, the tempos range from slow to slower, the back-up vocals are devoid of musical interest, the rhythms are simplistic, even the 6/8 tunes. A decent working salsa band has a much more sophisticated rhythmic sensibility that this group of musicians.There is an attempt to provide some modern arrangements to what I guess are traditional tunes but it only comes out sounding watered-down to my ears. The whole thing is so sugary that it was almost painful to listen to, I could barely sit through the whole CD one time. It's almost at the level of a music student's senior project.The only positive thing I can think of to say is that it might be a good CD to play for young children at nap-time. I wonder how much blame for this awful production lies in the hands of the producer-arranger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotizing","review":"I came across Susana Baca on a compilation cd, and immediately fell in love with her voice.

She's going to have to wear her gymnastic leotard underneath. It's also a bit difficult for her to get on by herself, and she's going to need to change into it for her school party.

OK Starter Set.","review":"For 19.99 this is an \\"OK\\" starter set of knives. The blades are all serrated so you don't have to worry about sharpening them. They are EXTREMELY sharp. The set looks amazing out of the box. HOWEVER, after washing the knives only one time, the black handles are fading badly. The once pure black handles are now a faded, and \\"used\\" looking black. The blades on 4 of the larger knives are rusting BADLY. They look horrendous after only one wash in the dishwasher. It's obvious that the grade of Stainless Steel they are using is extremely poor. It's a shame because at a glance these look like fantastic knives. Heavy duty, thick blades, full tang, beautiful block, etc... I would save my $20 and go elsewhere. Unless you want to take a shot at hand washing and hand drying them every time you use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Chop for the Buck","review":"At this low price, I wasn't expecting the best knives. They exceeded my expectations and are a great deal for what they are. No they don't stack up to the top-of-the-line, but they serve a different purpose and serve it very well. The block and the knives are attractive and look fine sitting out. I call them my \\"drone\\" knives because my high-end chef's knives are tucked away in a knife rack in a drawer. These cheap knives out in the open give my husband, mom, etc. a knife to grab when they want to open a letter, or punch a hole in a leather belt. (Geesh, the abuse my good knives were subjected to ...) My life is better. Others' lives are improved by not having to endure my wrath. And now I find myself reaching for these knives when I simply want to toss the dirty knife into the dishwasher and not have to handwash like I do with the good ones. They certainly serve their purpose and I'm very happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thai for Beginners","review":"If you are English speaking and want to learn Thai, this set of tapes seems to be more thorough than others available. However, you can not use the set of tapes without the book. There are some words and phrases that have the English meaning but much of it is in the Thai language without any translations into English. The instructions say to listen to a conversation between two Thai people, and you have no idea of what they are talking about. You are refered to the page number and section number in the paper book. Therefore, you can not use it without the book. It should not be sold by itself at all. I am ordering the book and assume the English meaning for these conversations are in the paper bound book. At that point, it should be an excellent course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent *textbook* - no misconceptions","review":"This is a book for the person who is serious about learning thai and willing to put in the time to do so. This is not a quick phrase-book; it is a systematic way to learn the letters, sounds, and vocabulary. This is a tool that should be used with a spoken audio program (I like rosetta stone myself).This appears to be the only textbook I have found (and I have searched through many), that actually gives you practice and quizzes for writing and making sure you remember what you've learned.Consider this a workbook with explanations designed to build vocabulary and help navigate the Thai writing system with the help of a well explained transliteration system."},{"rating":"1","title":"No tape or CD included","review":"I don't know why no one has bothered to mention this, but this book does not come with a tape or CD. You have to order the CD separately and it's not cheap, costs more than the book. I got the book and it's useless without the audio recording. I am going to order the recording, and hopefully will not be disappointed (again)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practically useless.","review":"Unless you have a genuine desire to become fluent in Thai this book is useless, especially without the CDs or an actual Thai teacher. If on the other hand you are just going to Thailand for vacation or perhaps to teach English, I highly recommend the Lonely Planet Thai phrasebook - it is much easier to use and has much more practical information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thai for Beginners not complete","review":"In the introduction of this book the writer states that the student must learn to properly pronounce the tones either by listening to the tapes or with the help of a good teacher.The book does not come with tapes.

This software will most likely not run on any modern system.Note: the one star review is for Amazon's ad and the publisher's lack of making sure this information is clearly stated, not for the quality of the product (which I cannot run)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tape Series","review":"Tapes are very helpful to use in conjunction with the book. One of the better tape series as it has a lot of vocabulary not just phrases, which helps a lot with pronunciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Thai language book out there","review":"I have tried several Thai language books and found this one to be the best. This book focuses on real Thai, not just touristy fluff like all the other books. If you are really serious about learning Thai, this book is a must have.Best of all, I have been able to continue my study of Thai with Ms. Becker's other books. Each book builds upon the last and also has an accompanying tape set (sold seperately).I have studied many languages and found that learning Thai or any other language will not come easy. You have to practice constantly. A little \\"in-country\\" practice helps a lot too. However, you also need a good companion book that can effectively guide your study. This is that book.Hope this helps anyone who may be considering this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic kanji--won't get you far","review":"This workbook only includes 70 kanji and uses very remedial sentences for examples. If you are an adult who is seriously trying to learn the kanji for adult activities like reading the newspaper, reading adult books, surviving in Japan or passing the jlpt, this workbook is not going to take you very far.For learning kanji, the absolute best resource I have found is Tadashii Kanji Kakitorikun. But you will need a nintendo console to play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"The quality of the shirt is very exciting; the stitches were well done, the fabric comfortable and soft. Unfortunately, though, after only a single wash (cold water) and hanging it to dry, it still shrunk up close to 2\\". After only wearing it twice, it is no longer comfortable, and I've donated all of those I bought for somebody who is shorter and wider that I am.I do not recommend the shirts at all, and am very sorry I spent the money to buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is flat out wrong","review":"Well constructed garment; however, the sizing is completely WRONG. I ordered 3x to use for laying with other clothes. It's about a size Large. Maybe smaller. Just because you put the label 3x on something doesn't make it that size. Products going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eidon Moisturizing Lotion Smells like burnt skin!","review":"I was excited to find a natural skin moisturizing lotion with MSM & Silica though I did not order this item through Amazon. It has the most repulsive burnt smell that I have ever encountered and there is no way to use this product without feeling ill, especially if you are smell sensitive. I additionally purchased the Eidon California Gold Sunblock.....same disgusting smell! They both have extracts of Hops which may be the offending smell culprit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle on Sensitive Skin","review":"I have been using Eidon's lotion for years. I bought it on the recommendation of our family's D.O., for soothing dry and sensitive skin. In my opinion, the scent is very light and non-offensive; important because I often have allergic reactions to scented products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cohen Entertainment","review":"The characterization of some oddball serial killers and terrific dialouge are the saving grace of this MOH episode.As is typical of Cohen, this is a bit tongue and cheek with some good kill scenes, some genuine suspense and hilarious characters. As seems to be the problem with many of the MOH tales, one hour was not quite enough to really flesh out the plot, which really was good given the time restraints.If you like other Larry Cohen films, you should enjoy this one as it really hits the spot from an entertainment perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise; wrong movie","review":"Pick Me Up offers a great premise: What if a motorist who kills hitchhikers picks up a hitchhiker who kills motorists? Imagine the taut, suspenseful, claustrophobic film that would develop as these two psychopaths try to kill one another. I would love to see that movie! But that's not this movie. Instead, Pick Me Up is a slighter, kind of hammy horror movie, which is expected since Larry Cohen (of Q fame) is the helmer. I think that the movie wastes time with the broken-down bus scenario. Characters are introduced that we don't need to know. I would have preferred that the two killers encounter each other right away. I do not mind the addition of a third character in jeopardy (we need someone to root for) but Fairuza Balk, a good actress, is mostly wasted. The guy playing the hitcher is forgettable, although Michael Moriarty is quirky and funny as the truck driver. The twist is amusing, although nowadays having a twist seems like a cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice really nice","review":"more than a gore movie, this episode of MOH is a combination of thrill, horror, suspense. very well done, one of my favourites of the 1rst season"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Horror Movie","review":"This movie was alittle better then expected but not by much. The movie definently had a good choice for a cast. Each star of the cast did a good job, but the plot could have been alittle better. The end was something I was not expecting. I did make me wonder what would happen next. Although it was alittle confusing. But it was an okay movie, definently one to rent to see if you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"RED-HOT","review":"This is on band I can never get enough of.

The outlet is made in a shaggy and cheap way with some narrow foam seals that first need to be compressed and then two parts of the housing slide over each other to get in place - the task that is really frustrating even on a bench (can't even imagine to accomplish this in the ceiling). Housings are made for the one size fits all concept. These fans might be electrically good but mechanically are a total junk. Cheap China-made stuff. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't DO IT! Your mind will shatter.","review":"Written poorly. This book is not for everyone. The author of the first chapter refers mercilessly to later chapters over and over again, defining introductory concepts using advanced terms. How many times the phrase \\"you need to remember this now, but we will not cover it until chapter 10, 11, 13\\" whatever occurs.My mind was shattered on the examples, which use inside computer-humor as examples (tags named foo, foobar, etc) of xml tags. How about using something the average reader can relate to, such as \\"textcolor\\" or perhaps \\"smallfont?\\" Oh no, all we get is random.tag, foobar, and other touchstones which are useless to a reader not part of the subculture.I really wish I had not purchased this book. I give it two stars because I think it will be later as a reference once I have actually learned XML. Until then, this book will remain in a box, and if I could, I would return it for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodge-podge!","review":"This book is a cut-n-paste from numerous other Sybex books.

Very annoying and a difficult way to learn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great clear textbook","review":"I believe this was the first textbook to introduce dynamic optimization to economists. It's simply and clearly written. Each chapter introduces a new development, goes into the theory behind it and gives examples, in just a few pages so you can go through it in bite-sized chunks. The style is unfussy but doesn't talk down to you. Two appendices explain important theorems in calculus and differential equations, briefly but in enough detail to be usable if you aren't familiar with those parts of the maths. This is an excellent textbook, although I can't compare it with the competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for powerful chewers","review":"My 10 month old lab destroyed this within an hour of me giving it to him.

Cards, wall art, special gifts etc. Vintage Valentines, some patriotic, roses, frames and more. I love Victorian and Edwardian themes and I know I will be using this over and over. Since I own many of the other books in this series I can see where I can interchange images and really have a lot more options. For me these books work, but for those with less vintage taste they may want to look elsewhere for clip art."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Destroyer Foe Smack-Down","review":"The best so far by the newest author..... Mr. Gordons is back. The Dutchman is almost back. Remo is officially Reigning Master. Elize Roote (#118's foe) is back - and it's the first face off of two of Sinanju's greatest adversaries - Roote vs Mr. Gordons . Jim has packed so much into this book it's almost dizzying. O.J gets whacked. Stephen King gets lampooned. Back in #18 when we first met Mr. Gordons , Chiun plays with a model airplane, then kills someone with it. In #125, its a model rocket ship. In #18, Remo tries to fry Mr. Gordons with a rocket engine. In #125 it's a Space Shuttle engine. Smith's apprentice (Mark Howard) is coming into his own, just as Chiun's apprentice (the white thing) has ascended to Reigning Master. Mr. Gordons survives once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Scientists","review":"While this book might be very interesting to people who enjoy \\"thinking about thinking,\\" it has very little value for people who are interested in logical reasoning and cold, hard facts. Read this book only if you are enthusiastic about poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than just math - yet not interesting","review":"I have read a few math books, prime obsession most recently, and this book wasn't technically very interesting, it also wasn't fun to read either. There are some good parts at the very beginning and end but middle is incoherently dry. Basically I believe that in some ways the way the author was trying to thought provoking and intelectual is where it lost it's was. Neither technical, historical, or fun enough you lost your audience"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I did not read the entire book, but I got a good idea of how it is laid out by reading sections of it. The book spends a lot of time discussing the quadratic equation. The derivation of the equation is in an Appendix at the back of the book. This, I decided, would be a good place to start. What I saw has to be the most non-intuitive possible proof. There is no motive, no explanation for why things are done the way they are. This is a shame because there is a simple intuitive derivation. I came up with the formula when I was 14 after learning how to factor second order equations. No, I am no genius, not by a long shot. Anybody who is sufficiently nerdy could do the same.After this initial disappointment I glanced at other sections of the book. I found nothing that would provide insight for the non-mathematician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted prose obscures the main ideas","review":"I read this book when I was 18, largely because of Barry Mazur's reputation as a mathematician. His attempts to compare complex numbers to poetry obscures the main algebraic and geometric ideas, and is certainly not the way a mathematician ever views complex numbers. After I studied algebra in university it made me realise how truly bad this book was. If you really want to read a book that answers \\"what is so special about i?\\", then pick something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adultery is Amazing","review":"Dog Fashion Disco have done it again. Yes they've put out a new disc that outshines their last effort. With their newest cd, Adultery, the band really shows their roots and then adds so much more to the mix. You have all type of generes thrown in throughout the cd. Everything from all out heavy sounding to melodic and creepy sounding. If you're looking for something different and just more refreshing than what's 'hip' in the current music scene then check out DFD. This cd will blow you away. I could go into detail and try to describe each song but until you actaully hear the music then can you fully appreciate the band and their music. It is definately worth every cent you pay for it and I promise you'll be listening to it non-stop. Give the album a chance and give the band a chance, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peak DFD","review":"This is DFD's best album, with Committed To A Bright Future coming in a close second. Heavy, Melodic, groovy, sexy, rockin jammy jammage. I mean, what review for this album could REALLY sum it up? Find out for yourself and pick up the most exciting and original album of 2006 and prolly the rest of the decade. This album is a kick in the teeth to all the carbon-copy manufactured radio bands and the whiny, boring emo scene. Best songs are Dead Virgins Don't Sing, 100 Suicides, Rose Covington, and The Hitchhiker. Its time for this band to get some limelight and have some money put BACK in their pockets for all their hard work and originality. Still a force to be reckoned with, Dog Fashion Disco are back with their most GRIM, eclectic album to date. Get all their records if you can b/c they all rule, but Adultery is the cream of the DFD crop. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adultery","review":"Awesome CD. You won't regret buying it. I listened to it for about 3 days straight when I got it. It's got a creepy, dark appeal, like most of DFD's previous music, but better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected a little bit less...","review":"I've been a fan of DFD for quite some time now, and I have to say that I was a little dissappointed in this album. It is just a little too polished and too \\"mainstream\\" for me. I usually have no problem with a band sidestepping their artistic side to go more mainstream if it works for them, but DFD was known for their funny/innovative yet brutal metal and intriguing time changes and signatures. Seemed to me on this album, they were just trying to record something to put it out. They left the artistic side out of this one a little bit. I still like it, but I expected less of an album. It's production quality is very high, but that takes away from a band like this if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"These are very well made shears - but they arrived dull, and were unable to cut hair.

Even the casual fan of anime and animation in general will enjoy Karas: The Prophecy. The action sequences are spectacular, expanding on the anime themes of transformation, beast/machine, and demons in truly epic fashion. Yes, the plot and variety of characters may leave your head spinning, but that only means you may need to watch it twice ... which you will want to do anyway.Don't let the affordability of the DVD put you off. Cheap doesn't always mean \\"cheap\\". In this case, in means affordable, quality entertainment that doesn't scimp on production values. My only complaint would be that the 2nd part is not due until sometime this fall. That is just too long to wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want best anime...GET THIS","review":"It is one of coolest anime I have ever seen.

First of all it is incredibly beautiful and the action is great. If you are a computer graphics fan you will love all the action scenes in this OVA. The characters are good, though in this DVD they haven't been explored in a lot of depth, it's mostly just premise. So far the primary plot is pretty cloudy, though this could be partially due to the fan subs. It seems like it has a lot of potential, but I'll have to wait for the other two DVD's to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good visuals, very confusing story","review":"I was really impressed by how the movie looked visually; but then I started to try and figure out what was going on in the story.......and was extremely confused. The reason I gave this anime 2 stars was because the story was so hard to follow I turned it off a little less then half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"No narrative","review":"This movie is an advertisement for Attention Deficit Disorder. There is no narrative thread to the movie. All of the characters know what they are up to and why, but there is never any explanation of what's going on. You're left to guess what is going on and how these characters relate to each other and the overall story. The fight sequences can be entirely too fast to follow. I understand that the animators were trying to make it an intense, fast combat, but staring into a strobe light would have the same effect as watching the battles.Well animated, and that's the only good point in this whole disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bar","review":"best nutrition bar candy bar replacement ive foundi had all the flavors they are all greati recomened try them all just get the best dealwhich now is amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like this product","review":"This is one of the best tasting protein bars I've had from this line.

The first time they were fresh, the \\"chocolate\\" coating was smooth and creamy. This last order appeared to be expired, old, with the outside coating powdery and dry. The expiration date was not outdated, so I'm not sure what the problem is. I opened three of the bars and they are all that way, not sure what to expect of the rest, or if I will order them again.

The chocolate isn't that smooth and the taste is a bit off. I still think the 2.5 net carbs & 190 cals for my work lunch are a payoff.

While they are edible, the chocolate coating on the outside had turned a very light brown and the consistency was changed. They taste OK, just not as good as they do when they are not exposed to extremely high levels of summer heat. I feel it was a bad decision to ship any perishable food items from Phoenix, AZ, in the summer time. I will not order these from Amazon again during the summer but will look for a place along the west coast or in the mountains where the bars will have a better chance to arrive tasting their best. These bars are normally really good bars, some of the best protein bars around, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bars!","review":"I can't understand why people don't like these bars. My sister and I have tried several flavors of these bars and the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is our favorite. Delicious!

These are wonderful-tasting bars, the chocolate coating is very good and if you find them too sweet, eat a half bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes better than I thought it would...","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at the \\"Thin Mint-like\\" taste to this low carb bar. The chocolate taste isn't as strong so it doesn't taste like a cakey, healthy protein bar. Be careful not to take too big of a bite, the peppermint may irritate your throat. Also, it was very good to find a low carb protein bar that only has 3.5 grams of fat. I haven't had any bathroom problems from CarbRite products like the reviewer before me. Although, I do agree that these bars aren't that filling compared to an actual meal. These are good for afternoon snacks, breakfast on-the-go or your protein fix after the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starpoint Restless CD","review":"Just as described.

Instead of just playing relaxing music (which I also like), this is what is called a \\"guided meditation\\" - where the author leads you on a meditative journey.Several times while listening to this CD I have reached that point where I am so relaxed that I actually feel like I am \\"falling into myself\\" (it's a hard feeling to describe, but it's absolutely wonderful!!!).Salle's voice is extremely peaceful and quite easy to listen to (It's amazing how important the sound of the author's voice is while attempting to meditate - I have several CD's that I just can't listen to because the author's voice actually grates on my nerves).I recommend this CD for anyone interested in meditation - it may become your favorite too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"learning miracles","review":"it's fine to find a book that explain some of the experiences yo've sensed before.

I strongly recommend this book to anyone after divorce and even before dating again just to get an idea of what you need to look at in yourself before you get involved with another person. If you don't want to end up with the same kind of marriage the second time around then look at the questions in this book, find out what you really HONESTLY want in a marriage and then look for that type of person. Only after you know what you want can you find what will make you happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say redundant?","review":"There a very few questions in this book they are just repeated over and over again.

While there are some good questions in it (that you could probably think of yourself), there are a lot of really offensive, irrelevant, and ridiculous questions. There are a couple of questions which are extremely racist. Some of the questions were so ridiculous that they made us laugh. Others were downright offensive.

It's okay.","review":"My 4-pound Bichon puppy went straight for the bacon bone, and quite frankly, she ate it so fast that I couldn't figure out where she'd \\"hidden\\" the bone. Turns out, she had literally devoured the WHOLE bone within a few minutes. I didn't particularly like that concept, mostly due to the potential choking hazard of a bone that crumbles that easily (she was 4 pounds at the time!).The rubbery bone did better than the bacon bone, but I ended up having to take the bone away because my pup would bite off shavings of the bone instead of eating it. This left quite a mess around my apartment, so that bone was pointless for us.The white bone has actually become her favorite bone over time. It doesn't make a mess, and now that she's a year old, she chews on it daily. So, if your pup doesn't like the white bone, hold on for a while and there's a chance that will change.I would not buy this set again, but I would be tempted to buy another of the white bones when this one runs out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me!","review":"My puppy loves these!!!

I think the story of Mr. Freemantle lovingly creating this gorgeous work of art for his wife is wonderfully sweet. I already have access to the Psalms through my Bible, but I have to say I enjoy the words even more when they are set in such a lovely format! The reason I am one star short of five is that I think the publisher could have squeezed out a bit more money for higher quality printing to really do this artwork justice. I was a bit disappointed by the small size of this book and the simplicity of the hardbound design. I have this book out in the family room and would love it even more in a more generous size with embossed leather cover and glossy pages that can open flat to really emphasize the delicate drawings of Mr. Freemantle.

BUT, I cant hardly even watch it without having it almost MUTE! If you dont mind heavy metal music then nevermind this comment, however, it was just waaaay to much for me. Yes, there is a lot of action...but the graphics on some of the taping of it hurt my eyes (i dont even know how to describe this part) it was electric colors flashing throughout the \\"way to close shots\\" of the monster truck action. But anyway, my biggest complaint is the CRAZY heavy metal instruments playing throughout most of the movie! I have enough noise going on in my household with 2 kids that I dont need crazy music screeching in my ears as well. I wish I wouldve spent the extra money on the other actual Monster Jam dvds :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!!","review":"I read the reviews and thought this would be a great video for my kids ages 3 and 5. Boy was I wrong. The background music drowns out the best part-the roar of the engine. You have to strain yourself to hear it. Also, everything is in fast foward or slow motion, which kind of takes the wow factor out of the action. It's more like a music video. My kids did not even pay any attention to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review for this DVD","review":"I don't want to be mean, but I'll be honest. This video is target for kids, but I think this DVD doesn't educate kids about monster trucks.

As one of the few good things to crawl out of the mid-80's pre-Alternative Rock quagmire, Gunshy rocked the f**k out! Between the schizophrenically menacing lyrics and vocals, the airtight rythmn section and the deranged, ear-splitting guitar work, these guys shoulda been monsters not footnotes. Personally, I thought the Hank Williams covered RULED, as did Twin Cadillac Valentine, Someone to Talk to, and come to think of it, most everything except Holiday Head & Talking Doll. I'm truly pissed my vinyl copy of this album bit the dust, especially with folks selling their CD's for over a hundred bucks.

They were smoking from the first song, and not a soul was sitting down for the entire show. Tighest drum and bass combo I have ever seen, and they really sounded like more than three guys.Top it all off with Bill Carter, of shaved head, who looked at any moment like he might smash his guitar or dive into the audience for kicks!But of course a live show has to be backed up with good songs.

I read it from beginning to ends waiting for them to show up. Instead, I endured through a rant, in a very un-Taoist manner, about how Mr. Hoff seems to think that the Human race is the apex of what the universe has been created for and now, we have ruined the happy ending.He needs to remember that whether we destroy ourselves and the world we live in is only a part of what will be a millennium of millennia where the cycle of life and death revolves indefinitely. Then, through all his badgering of poor Eeyore, he himself epitomized the Eeyore Principle by whining, taking an extreme position and judging others actions instead of accepting the world as it is, for what it is, regardless of how he feels it should be.So basically this book, through Mr. Hoff's words, is a lesson of what the meaning of Te is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Reader","review":"I don't mean to be an Eeyore here, and I certainly don't mean to be critical, but I had trouble figuring out exactly what this book has to do with Taoism. One of the central themes I've found in Taoist and Buddhist approaches to life is that criticizing and rejecting things is a sure-fire route to unhappiness. Many of the passages in this book seem to have more to do with Dennis Miller rants than with Taoism. I found myself becoming a little more tense, critical, and rejecting reading it, in stark contrast to the reactions I have when I meditate or read Taoist or Buddhist literature. Reaching Balance is not achieved by criticism, but by acceptance and gentle redirection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment after brilliance of first book","review":"I loved the Tao of Pooh when I was younger so was looking forward to reading this when I recently received it as a birthday present. However, it has little of the humour and presence of the first book and spends most of it's time being an 'Eeyore' and whinging about the world around it. If you want to feel depressed and/or pissed off about the state of the world this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book that melds Eastern wisdom with Western humour look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piglet on meds..","review":"I didn't find this book as lovable as Tao of Pooh. Piglet while seemingly an ideal model to learn the Te from there is alot more ranting and raving then the simple lessons from Pooh. Maybe Piglet needs a change in his prescriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be entitled \\"The Rantings of Hoff\\"","review":"I was first introduced to the Tao through Hoff's \\"The Tao of Pooh\\". It opened my eyes to a world that I did not know existed. My disappointment in \\"The Te of Piglet\\" was equally great. I expected a treatise that dealt with Te in the same manner Hoff dealt with Tao. Instead I found it to be not much more than a personal platform from which Hoff could vent his anger and frustrations. As a scientist, I found many of his remarks to be insulting. Scientists are not out to merely catalog and pigeon-hole the world into a set of neat facts, but to understand the universe as an integrated, harmonious system. Hoff's condemnation of everything he personally does not like is not very much in keeping with the Taoist philosophy of \\"accept everything, reject nothing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratches the surface of the tao","review":"not as good as poohentertaining at leastmore author than taoread pooh instead!which one of the \\"three vinegar tasters\\" is hoff?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is an amazing book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new way to view the world, that doesn't attempt to supplant previous belief systems. Through explanation of the different characters in the Hundred Acre Wood, the author makes it possible for individuals to learn not only about themselves, but perhaps those around them.I think the key issue that I will remember out of this book is that of Win Wei, or effortless action. The entire concept of completing BY remaining is a fascinating one.The author does go about bashing the Western World around the midpoint of the book, and that does get a bit tiring. However, don't fret, for it doesn't last for long.The introduction of the characters infrequently interrupting the author is a nice touch. It makes the book a joy to read, something you have to put down every so often just to reflect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane New Age Ranting","review":"While The Tao of Pooh is a cutesy book that cleverly interlaces one timeless classic with another to produce easily palatable extract of the Tao Te Ching, the Te Of Piglet is, how do I put this mildly, an inane load of new-age crock. By all means read the first one. Stay away from this one, unless you want your brain rotted in your skull. It's just 200 pages of repetitive griping about loving mother Earth (for the sake of loving mother Earth), interspersed with cranky whining about the horrors of nuclear power and microwaved food.Nothing to do with Taoism -- belongs in the \\"New Age\\" section. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"It is impossible to know what was happening in Hoff's life when he sat down to write this book. That is a personal issue for Hoff to work out by himself.What is possible to know is that this book has nothing to do with Taoist philosophy. Or Te. And this is the biggest problem. Many novices will come to the book believing, as Hoff has such a wonderful reputation from his Pooh book, that they are in the hands of a teacher of Taoist philosophy. This is not the case. Hoff spends all of his time venting his spleen, making assertions about those things that vex him.And right there - let's go no further - the book is failing as Hoff is showing he does not practice what he preaches. He is wanting only ideals. He cannot let things be as they are. He feels angry.He has forgotten the teachings of the Tao."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I loved the Tao of Pooh. I love Piglet. But I didn't love the Te of Piglet. This was a case of taking a great thing too far. My advice to Hoff is to write another, deeper, continuation book about the Taoist ways of Pooh bear and, as Milne did, leave the loveable cast of characters as just that, a cast of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sham.","review":"I read the Tao of Pooh and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was hoping I would find the same amount of enjoyment in the Te of Piglet if not more however I was destined for disappointment.This book speaks very little about Taoism and more about his own personal social and political beliefs. I was also offended by his complete disdain of the American Military. I consider myself a Taoist and I am also a Soldier in the U.S. Army.Everyone sees the Tao in differant ways and reading through it I see conflict a natural part of the Way. Dog fight dog, cat fights cat, apes murder one another. Conflict is just as natural as a tree growing in a forest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little Piglet, too much Hoff and puff","review":"This book doesn't compare with Hoff's earlier book, The Tao of Pooh. It's chock full of the author's dated personal political leanings and limited perspectives. Sure, there were a few nuggets to enjoy and tease the mind, but on the whole it was disappointing. I thoroughly enjoyed The Tao of Pooh, and just bought another copy as a gift, but I wouldn't recommend The Te of Piglet to any discerning reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Benjamin Hoff got way out of control on this one. In his sequel to The Tao of Pooh, he rants and raves and displays decidedly un-Taoist characteristics. He spends far more time arrogantly lecturing the ignorant, unwashed masses, than describing Taoism. Although he is clearly quite proud of his accomplishments in writing the Tao of Pooh, this followup is not worthy of the first book. For a better introduction into the principles of Taoism, read Eva Wong's translation of The Seven Taoist Masters."},{"rating":"2","title":"take the time to read this one too!","review":"Another great book by Benjamin Hoff and a perfect accompaniment to the Tao of Pooh, his first book of these 2. Like the other, I continually buy this book just to find myself gifting it away and then buying another copy for myself so that I can continue to re-read it. Always an inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read 365 Tao instead!","review":"This book was a major disapointment. Instead of building upon the foundation that was laid down in The Tao of Pooh, the author gets too emotional and rants and raves about the evils of the western world. However there still are many nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout the text. The poem included by Ko Hung is the most profound thought I have encountered in any text about Taoism thus far, and I am very gratefull the author included it here. However, the authors anger at the western lifestyle just gets in the way of his original message of contentment and happiness. Other authors such as Deng Ming-Dao, or Lao-Tsu himself are much better examples of pure Taoist thought. There is great wisdom in the author's book, it just takes too much time to sift through the anger to find it. Don't get me wrong The Tao of Pooh was groundbreaking but Piglets message of the virtue of the small in this book gets swallowed up by the authors anti-western attitudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"While some of the history regarding Confucianism and Taoism was moderately interesting the book quickly decended into the author's own political agendas. I'm only a third of the way into the book and I'm already considering selling it back to the nearest used bookstore. Such a disappointment. The Tao of Pooh was a much more interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"S***ty book after liking the Tao of Pooh","review":"I read and enjoyed the Tao of Pooh, but the Te of Piglet is overwrought nonsense. Between attacking public education and going off on a rant about feminists (WTF?), the author barely mentions anything relating to Taoism. I guess he used it all up in the first book. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, IT IS UTTER TRASH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piglet strikes back","review":"Hoff manages to unravel the core of the Tao and the Te using images we all know and love. He makes Taoism accessible and recognizable. These are well written, easily read and re-read. Using these images to illustrate a philosophy that can be very elusive is a master stroke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taoism Made Easy","review":"I recently became interested in learning about Taoism when I viewed the movie The Tao Steve, so I went to my high school libary and found a couple books on Tao Philosphy. All of the books seemed to be a bit outdated except The Te of Piglet. I liked this book because when reading about religon the information can become distorted and complicated and this book steers away from those downfalls. I also could relate better to Pooh,Piglet,Tigger, and the other characters better then i could relate to an ancient oriental rice farmer. This book tells how tao can help you in modern day life and in all aspects of that.I was a freshman in high school when i read this book and recommend it to people my age and above who are good at comprehending the material they read; SO go to the bookstore and and ask for the Te Of Piglet and a word of advise don't pronounce it teh because it's pronouced deh and I wouldn't want you looking stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about Ka-ching than Tao te Ching","review":"This book seems to have been written solely for the money the author knew it would make. It has none of the wit and charm of its predecessor. Mr. Hoff, who often annoyingly refers to himself in the first person plural (our tai chi instructor told us, etc.), begins with the notion that anything anti-western is taoist and constructs a long and tedious screed against modern American culture. He preaches the importance of seeing things as they are and then proves himself totally incapable of separating myth from reality. It would be funny if Mr Hoff were not so pompous. The difference between The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet is equivalent to the difference between a prom date and a prostitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good example of hypocrisy","review":"Definetly not as good as the first. I really couldn't get over the condecending tone towards the whole loveable cast of my childhood heros. The chapter criticising feminism outraged me highly...It showed the authors obvious lack of understanding of what feminism is, even at its core, much less the understanding that there are an unlimited number of \\"breeds\\" of feminism...The whole book is hypocritical...the author spends all his time complaining about how in the wrong people who complain all the time are...Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor sequel to Tao of Pooh","review":"\\"The Tao of Pooh\\" was a charming and insightful little book, and bears (pardon the pun) multiple readings. \\"The Te of Piglet,\\" unfortunately, is a huge disappointment by comparison. It doesn't stand well on its own and doesn't add much to the philosophy presented in the first book. \\"Tao of Pooh\\" was overall positive and gently humorous. \\"Te of Piglet\\" is negative, preachy and mocking. It seems to be mostly a collection of rants about how messed up Western life is, compared to the (apparently) enlightened Chinese. Unless you're heavily into Taoism, don't spend your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Te of Piglet","review":"Speedy delivery great condition. This text I recommend for spiritual practitioners as base reading and for children.Great perspective and life practices can be taken from this text and its brother text The tao of pooh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing after Tao","review":"I wanted to like the Te of Piglet, but part of the way into it I realized that, taken to it's logical conclusion, the author laments that humanity has created tools to allow for more than just survival. There were few of the direct applications of Daoist writing into his treatise and almost nothing about Piglet, except that he was small, brave, and escaped from Owl's house after it blew over.By the time the author got to his rant on Conservatives, which we have all heard countless times, it was clear that I should have stopped with Pooh. This book was a vehicle to put forward a political conviction disguised as another opportunity to have Daoism explained through these wonderful creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gift","review":"This book was bought as a gift,having only scanned the contents to prevent any visible usage of book,but I enjoy the subject and recommend it to almost anybody.Also the book arrived in short time and in relatively good shape for a used paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly poor control","review":"This may be the best out there for Motorcycle racing, but it really is very poor.

The stories are bland and inoffensive, the perfect example of the stereotype of a cozy mystery, with thinly drawn characters and mysteries that are not very mysterious. Some pleasure in spending time in various vacation locations (Grand Canyon, Montreal, the Caribbean), but better mysteries can be found that accomplish that with far more style. Biggest mystery: how this series managed to reach seven books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible","review":"I read this book with great anticipation because I love crosswords and mysteries. What a horrible disappointment. The characters are poorly developed, the dialogue is not realistic at all and the worst part -- which ironically is the most important part of a mystery -- the slick, and a reader would hope, clever, unraveling of the solution is far from either.Every one of the short stories sputters along and then the \\"solution\\" is thrown at the reader like a bag of soggy oatmeal.

I have other translations on my iPad but wanted one with study notes. Study notes are not on the same page with the text and so you have to go back and forth which can not be done seamlessly.

I was reading my Bible but interpreting the scriptures to the best of ability, which most of the time was wrong. This book was suggested by a wonderful Pastor. I read it everyday because I have yet to feel lost or like I cannot apply it to my life. Before each book, the author gives a brief historical description, the theme of the book, important scriptures, an explanation of most of the scriptures and the message that is being conveyed. No matter what you may be going through in life, this study bible teaches you how God wants you to respond to those challenges and that NO matter what you are facing, God will never leave you nor forsake you.

The biggest problem at first was the unresponsiveness. We would often press a button on the remote more than once because we did not think it had registered. Even the buttons on the player were unresponsive.Another minor issue was that we did not like the fact that only the chapter is displayed when the disc is player. We would much rather have the elapsed time shown.At this price, point I also expected the player to have an optical TOSlink audio out connection.The worst problem with this player, though, is that about 2 weeks after purchasing, the player started malfunctioning. When the stop button was pressed, the video would stop, but the disc would continue to spin. If you then ejected the disc, it would spin in the tray. We returned the player and purchased the Sony DVP-NS77H/B which is performing nicely so far.I would avoid this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by Toshiba","review":"We wanted a new upconvert DVD player primarily to view our very large library of VCD's SVCD's and DVD's that we have burned of photos from our travels. This player said that it would play all of those formats. (It is becoming hard to find players that still support some of our older collection) This player performed very well with our older VCD's. However with a brand new just burned DVD,we kept getting a bad disc message. After repeating the burn several times,we hooked up our old and dying player,and it worked great.The phone call to Toshiba tech support was most disappoin ting. They informed me that,regardless of what their specs on this player said, it would not play + DVD's. Their only solution was to use only -DVD's.

Little did I know when I bought the CD that it would be such a diverse, hooky and start-to-finish enjoyable CD--\\"Christian Rock\\" or otherwise. ATS shows great adaptability and musicianship by playing everything from Dave Matthews-style acoustic rock (Face To Face, The River) to horn-driven funk a la Al Jarreau/Stevie Wonder (No Condemnation, Magic Show) to top-40-tinged power rock (On and On, Camouflage Soul).

The book is fairly short, but it details the early interactions of these cultures and religions. I was surprised with the early Islamic quest of knowledge which ultimately led to translations and increased knowledge for the whole world. Even the early Christian societies came to depend on the efforts Islamic societies placed on knowledge. Then as Christian societies developed, Islamic societies turned inward and more dogmatic. At the end of the Reformation, Christian Europe was ascendant, and Islamic society was mired in a downward spiral.This is a good book for some basic knowledge on how the two religions relate to one another.

With another reviewer, I found the writing style, with its unorthodox punctuation, make the story almost incomprehensible at times. The author has a strange habit of closing and opening quote marks within in a sentence when what were needed were parentheses.The needlessly gruesome, manipulative and unsatisfying ending contribute to making this book one of my least favorites of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for improvement","review":"After great expectation, I found the book disappointing. Much of it was in the book's preparation. It is poorly illustrated, often making it difficult to understand what is being depicted. It has dozens of typos and grammatical errors. I also found many of the entries uneven in terms of coverage and depth, and in some cases, such as with alternative sexuality, naive. At times the book attempts to be dryly factual and at other times it editorializes. Some of the book has been \\"translated\\" into American English and some of it hasn't, sometimes mixing spelling of words on the same page -- very confusing, particularly with medical terms!

I have almost all the Parsifal CDs and DVDS and this probably is my favorite, except for the Kundry who sings beautifully, but is not a great actress nor seductive. Waltraud Meier is the echt Kundry in every respect. Hans Sotin has a great voice but is not a great vocal actor. Falk Struckman as Amfortas made me bawl at Bayreuth and almost did it again. Poul Elmung as Parsifal is excellent. The sound and picture were much better than I expected for an older DVD. A must for Parsiful lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulsar PXH225","review":"This is a great watch and of very good quality but appears to have been out and returned before. It is also the second Pulsar that I have ordered in the last 30 days and both had that been out before look and both arrived dead/non-working. I sent the first(a PXD795X) back as soon as I opened the carton. Thinking this was a fluke or one time error on Amazon's part I immediately ordered the PXH225, which as I already mentioned arrived non-working.I really liked the looks of this watch so took it to a local watch jewelry repair shop and had a new battery installed at a cost to me of $12.95 and they did it while I waited. This was the cheapest I found and most wanted $15 and up and had to keep the watch several days, as they had to send them out.Like I said, it's a great watch but got expensive for me as Amazon has refused to refund my shipping cost of $13.49 on the first watch and it cost me $12.95 to replace the battery in this one.

You never fall in love with main characters, there just there. You can tell the ending right from the beginning . The story actually leaves you speechless and not worth any comment.

This movie was not family appropriate. My husband and I were embarrassed watching this with our children. It is not rated so we felt safe to watch it without previewing it first. The story line was just plain silly with no sound message involved. It was actually more on the immoral side. Very immodestly dressed women are seen.

As the English King John must contend with the French King Phillip, A King In Spite Of Himself carries its readers through the relentless pursuits of Marshal and his aide Roger de Clare as their story involves them in a plot that could end in civil war, the captivity of Arthur, the nephew of John, and a quagmire of courtly intrigue with its lethal twists and turns.

There are no instructions in the Casio documentation for removing links from the band. There are instructions for removing links on the web, but its a klutzy, kludgy task. The tool used to remove round-pin links does not work with Casio links.The digital display on this watch is small but the digits display on a light-gray background that helps. The light for night-time use is a small, white-light LED mounted on opposite sides of its face, not the glowing-background type.If I could re-size the band myself, I'd keep this watch, given its low price.

A must read for any true romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Love Story","review":"Having been to one of the performances mentioned in the book, this story more than brang tears to my eyes.

A must read for anyone who believes in fairytales almost coming true."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL MOVING STORY","review":"I read this book lastyear in the Hardcover edition and I cried. It is such a moving, loving, tragic, and heartwarming story full of love that a young widow had for her husband and skating partner and the child Daria that they had together. It told of their skating years, marriage, how they met, and came to america along with the tragic death of her young husband Sergei. I couldn't put this book down. A great story that you will love. Well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching..........","review":"Wonderful! Marvelous! This book is touching and sweet. Ekaterina expresses her love for Sergei in a very passionate way. It really touched my heart. Nobody should pass up the chance to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"This book is one of the best i have read. Katia Gordeeva tells the story of her life with her husband Sergei, if you like skating, or just are in love with her story get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwrenching","review":"I was a fan of Ekaterina and Sergei and just had to read this book. It was better than the very best romance novel. You could just feel their love coming off the pages at you. I cried through the whole entire book. What really impressed me, though, was that you could just hear Ekaterina's voice as she wrote the story. I'd heard her speak in several interviews and her voice really came through. A lot of other similar books are too \\"canned\\" or you can tell that someone else is writing the story. Her writing style in this book was very natural. This is a must-read for anyone, skating or sports fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for anyone who enjoys a good true love story!","review":"The very first time I read this book I could not put it down.I found myself flipping page after page when I should have been sleeping, I was reading. Since I first read the book I have reread it countless times, each time not putting down until I finished. Ekaterina did a excellent job writing this book. She was faced with a tradgy and she has fought to overcome her fears of going on without \\"her Sergei\\" that it makes me want to live my life even better.This book has got to be one of the best I have read in a long time, because it is all true. Everything that is in that book, happened. That is the true meaning.

Actually, it's one of the most beautyful book I've ever read all of my life. It made me cry, reading the last chapters, more than watching a moovie. It's not only the story of the two pair skaters' life, but also the story of their great and unlucky love. The real main actor of this tragedy is not Sergey but his young wife Ekaterina who shows her courage to overcome her husband death and go on alone with her daugther Daria, forward a new life. I suggest this book to every fun not only of the two pair skaters but of ice figure skating in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching love story","review":"I read this book 4 times and reading it again.

I had the pleasure of meeting Ekaterina and Sergei at a fundraiser in Halifax in 1994. To watch them skate was magic, and to read their love story was to read about pure happiness. Ekaterina shares her life on these pages with the reader, and tells us of the Sergei she knew and loved. For him to pass on at such a young age, only makes the story more sad and hard to understand. Ekaterina has written a lovely tribute to her husband, and is a 5 star read for any figure skating fan, or person who wants the insight on a real life love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very touching story.","review":"My Sergei is a very touching, loving and true story about a pair of skaters wanting to achieve their dreams.

When you fill it you can't see whether or not you have passed the \\"MAX\\" line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"Worked fine for 6 months. From time to time the iron would shut off and not come back on. Totally frustrating because now the iron will come on only after about 20 times of plugging and unplugging. The light's on but it won't heat. BTW...the steam feature is great but you cannot turn it off at higher settings. You have to empty the water if you don't want steam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I was prepared to really like this iron. It is from Black & Decker which is usually pretty reliable.My iron is almost exactly 8 weeks. After shutting off from time to time without apparent reason as another reviewer has said, it died two days ago. Just before it died, the non-stick surface of the iron started melting and messed up a white shirt of mine. It just is not worth one dollar of the price.I am completely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst iron I have ever encountered","review":"The iron sprays hot water on the item being ironed, the user, the floor, and the ironing board. It does not balance well, easily tipping when sitting vertically, making it dangerous to use. When not in use for a few seconds in vertical position, and even while actively being used, the auto-shut-off light comes on (supposed to happen when iron is not in use for eight minutes in vertical position/30 seconds sole plate down) and iron turns itself off.Additional annoyances: you cannot tell when water well is full, the water well lid must be held open while filling -making this operation very difficult. The dial symbols are small and pale gray on white making them difficult to read. The iron makes loud clacking noises. All and all, the worst iron I have ever encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I received this iron as a gift & it is't worth what I paid for it. The auto shut off feature doesn't work properly. It shuts itself off constantly, even while in the middle of ironing. It does not turn back on when you lift it as it is supposed to do. The only way to turn it back on is to unplug it and plug it back in. It is almost impossible to see thru the blue water reservoir so you don't know you're running out of water until it's empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"I selected this iron because of the excellent reviews it had received at the time (about two years ago), but it looks like this iron has not stood the test of time. My first one lasted less than a year, and Black and Decker replaced it. I used the second one very little yet it still died in less than a year. I gave it two stars because it worked nicely during the time it worked. I'd nevertheless recommend crossing this model off your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked case less than 10 months old","review":"This iron is junk. Worked OK for about 2-4 months, then started not getting hot enough. Upon reading other peoples' reviews, perhaps it was turning off. Then the plastic cracked during warm up, when it made a loud noise, leaking water over everything. Sputtered water over everything. I should have taken the money and flushed it down the toilet, what a waste of $30. Why is everything that's made today so crappy? Didn't even last a year. My mother has an iron from the 60's that's still going. Black and Decker used to make some decent stuff, but it seems not any more. And of course it's not even worth fixing, it'll cost more in shipping back and forth than it's worth, might as well get another hunk of junk, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very wary","review":"I purchased the Black and Decker F1060 which is designed exactly like the F1000. It is a great iron with lots of nice features WHEN it is together. However, the top pops off the iron. There are clips holding it in to the clear plastic area that holds the water. I am not sure if it pops off just from the heat or if it is because when you turn the dial setting it can cause it to pop off if you turn it slightly past where you should stop. It is not hard to turn it too far. My husband has re glued it twice and maybe that has messed up the settings but I iron a lot of calico since I quilt and want the setting on the highest for cotton. So when turning all the way to the highest setting you can easily turn it too far and therefore it comes apart. Poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very satisified - I'd recommend against buying this item","review":"I purchased this iron because it was small and light weight but the quality is poor at best. In only one month the spray button broke and before the end of the second month, the steam stopped functioning. I replaced this iron again after only two months of use. I didn't buy another one of these. I'd strongly recommend considering another iron before purchasing this one.Very Unsatisified Customer"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not shut off","review":"I am not happy with this iron- it is supposed to have an automatic shut off and it does not shut off.

It leaks water ALL over everything, the ironing board and the clothes. The area to see the water level is basically opaque and its impossible to see.

No amount of adjustment will make work. I followed the instructions for first use to the letter. The \\"manual\\" included with the iron is of no help, probably because the manufacturer knows this product is defective.The only positive thing I can say is that because this iron didn't work the first time, I am able to return it.

I decided to stick with B & D, since our prior one lasted so long and because I used to associate this brand with quality. I chose this particular model because of the price and the light weight (our former one was quite heavy.) Right out of the box, the dial setting was almost impossible to turn. But considering we only use the highest setting anyway, I figured I'd just leave it set there - no worries. For about 4 months, it worked fine. Then it began to catch, tug & pull on clothes, creating even MORE wrinkles. If that weren't bad enough, it then began leaving dark residue on our clothes - apparently the \\"non-stick\\" finish of the plate was flaking off. What a mess.Do NOT buy this cheap piece of crap. And shame on Black & Decker - what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Iron","review":"Got this iron thinking that it would be a quality product. Won't make that mistake again! This iron did fine for about a month, just long enough that I could not return it to the local store. Then, it started dripping constantly. We followed all the directions regarding cleaning, adding water etc. NOTHING worked to keep this iron from dripping. Clothes always have water spots, then today, it just quit working, won't even turn on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad iron","review":"This iron has all the features you would need, but burns clothes.

He explains the duality, then invokes the other half the the prayer: poverty, death, and loss affecting all the millions in the defeated nation, as only Twain at his bitter best can describe it.This short story deserves a book to itself.

Written during the Spanish-American war, the sentiments Twain expresses are still relevent today. As a combat vet, I always struggle with those who invoke the name of religion, morality or righteousness with war. War is obscene - Twain's vivid poem illustrates what that is. The power of Twain's words are supported by the drawings of John Groth, which fit the tone and time of the story.As a previous reviewer has noted, the printing quality of the book leaves something to be desired; with that said, I strongly recommend this powerful piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"I purchased this book after skimming it over in a local store. I wish I had taken a closer look at it. I just came off a 2 week break from work and school. During my break I decided to work on a new model and following along with Mr. Steed's book. This turned out to be frustration hell. The methods in his book are fine if you are into wasting alot of time. Boolean and splines to make a simple character like the one in his book actually doubles your work. You wind up wasting more time cleaning up the errors from following his tutorial. Why he didn't demonstrate the way MOST people in the industry model, which is box modeling, is beyond me. He basicly tries to reinvent the wheel. I found much better tutorials for FREE on the web. Save yourself from learning bad modeling techniques. I happen to also know that Paul Steed DOES NOT model the way presented in the book. This should raise a red flag or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I'm sorry but this book is written with 3ds max 3 in mind (editable mesh). If you want to model a character today I cannot insist more not to buy this book. I strongly suggest investing your hard-earned dollars on 3ds max 6 animation by barret fox because his way to model a character is much better and in a ~350pages book he even show how to create a scenario, how to rig + animate your characters and the after-production retouches with combustion 3. sorry for my english!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally, a book on character modeling that I can respect and aspire to learn from. Mr. Steed's knowledge of anatomy, his facility with the program and his artistic talent have come together to produce a book that is a pleasure to read with or without a computer. He has clarified so many questions through the copious use of illustrations concerning low poly as well as high poly character modeling that I have had the past years, that I have been able to use some of these principles in non-character modeling. A must have for any serious 3D animator. Anxiously looking forward to his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great, but not the worst either","review":"I got this book 2 years ago when it was hyped as being top notch for learning 3D modeling. On the postive side it is easy to understand and gives you a good idea of the entire process of making a character rather than just jumping around and trying to explain a hundred different unrelated things like other 3D modeling books. The bad part is that the modeling technics are a bit dated and backwards. A person who posted a previous review mentioned that he uses wierd modeling techniques like booleans and splines instead of regular box modeling, and that is the truth. He also wastes A LOT of time turning edges. If you model in quads (4 sided polys) to begin with, and then teselate (triangulate) then its all done for you automatically. And as mentioned previously not much time was spent on the concepts of uv unwrapping and creating the image map."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOOK FOR ALL 3D ARTISTS!","review":"This book is what I've been waiting for ever since I started doing 3d work as a game artist four years ago. This book is good for people of all levels as it's well done and makes learning one of the many ways for modeling fun. My one complaint is it doesn't cover using surface tools for modeling. Surface tools is the widely preferred method of modeling organic shapes but instead covers modeling with primitives. Because of this I don't think it's worth five stars and instead would give it 4.5 stars.

When I have thought considered for about 2 days at home, I decided No.Here comes the comments, I don't really like the hair, I always wish to buy a book that is very comprehensive about hair modelling and perfect body modelling. In contrast, the body part which is being modelled of that character is great and quite appealing.Bad news is, in this book, the polygonal hair is way too bad and unappealing for a game character. Unlike Kate Walker from Syberia, she has a very beautiful perspective because of the realism of her hair(very detailed) and the textures that suit her body structure. Not to say that the textures of the girl in this book is bad, but it looks like a tattoo clumped to her naked torso and legs. Looks so unreal !And the other things is that, the functions were mostly based on 3DsMax 3, and the functions are slightly different from 3DsMax 4.

The only problem with the book is the turning edges portion; the dotted lines for the turned edges are almost impossible to see. After a few minutes of experimenting I was able to figure it out.

I knew this instinctively, that only by experiencing this journey could I offer authentic guidance to others on similar journeys, however, Virk's work helped me bring this into consciousness and not only accept, but to be inspired by it.

One of the most valuable parts of this book is the documentation of life with an alcoholic and the toll it takes on the individual family members. This book , especially the middle chapters, could become a tool in the recovery process. Her straightforward, unpretentious, guileless style legitimizes the credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty sweet but crappy light","review":"The watch was great value and pretty stylish.

Remember thos eold watches your Dad used to have with the litlle ligh on the side that never illuminted anything. This is the same thing. Contrary to what some others have said the light is not bright enough to even light the analogue face let alone the digital.Why anyone would go back to this old technology after the brilliant invention of electroluminesence is crazy, but it's a mistake Casio made with a few of their latest range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek, comfortable, and highly adjustable.","review":"This watch is very sleek with the black/gold/silver color scheme, the rubber strap is stronger than the cheap watches you find, and the strap has more size adjusting holes than most but the excess strap is well handled and not flapping in the way.

I was intrigued by the premise and all the possibilities it might offer, but the author focuses on a minute idea and pounds the reader over the head with the same themes so that it ultimately feels as if he never explores the real meat of the idea. At times, you literally feel as if you're reading the same scenes you had 50 pages before.Even when things get moving near the end, our characters are mere passive observers who fail to take an active role in the action with one exception. However, this moment is glossed over so quickly, that it might as well never have happened.If you don't mind passive characters, predictable plot points, deus ex machina, and bridge, this novel may hold your interest for the duration. If not, you could probably skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turtledove's worst?","review":"I've long complained that Harry T's best work was in singleton volumes (e.g., Guns of the South or Ruled Britannia) but he was instead writing unending series. This book is the counterargument which completely disproves that idea.\\"Presence\\" is a complete story in one fat book, no sequel needed to finish the story. It is also as boring as all get out.If you're interested in reading long prose descriptions about the game of bridge (the bridge column in the newspaper is much more interesting), or in reading clumsy dialog of an even clumsier seduction, or just dealing with Turtledove's unending pedantic voice, this is for you. Otherwise, move on, and move on quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Mix","review":"I had been getting a little tired of Turtledove's work recently, phrases repeated, similar plots, but I think he has returned to his better early works.I loved the story of a Jewish family hiding and the many concessions they had to make to their own faith to survive.And I also loved the way the author retold the Gorbachev/Yeltsin years.

Having undertaken to expand a poignant short story into a novel, Turtledove ran short of filling. So, as in \\"The Great War\\" he has U.S. Socialists copying HTL German Socialists, here he puts Gorbachev and Yeltsin into brown shirts instead of biznes suits. Dr. Snappdove, you should be ashamed of yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTRAORDINARILY BORING BOOK , NOTHING HAPPENS","review":"BASICALLY, THIS BOOK IS 400 PAGES OF PEOPLE SITTING AROUND HAVING CONVERSATIONS.

Can't he come up with a more original name?Or the action at the end is taken straight from August 19, 1991 in Russia where Gorbachev is overthrown and Yeltsin climbs upon a tank and asks the crowd to defy the coup.Or the hit musical put on by two producers who want to close their theatre and so put on a horrible musical. It is a success and there now many companies putting on the play.It has all the originality of a poor high school level English class assignment.Glad I borrowed it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best efforts","review":"I was very excited to hear that Harry Turtledove was going to tackle the idea of a victorious Third Reich. I have read a number of his other books and have usually enjoyed them. Unfortunately, that was not the case here. This novel tediously plods on to an unsatisfactory conclusion. The author continually subjects the reader to countless hand by hand descriptions of bridge games between two couples that are boring and unnecessary. Perhaps this would appeal to a bridge enthusiast, which I am not. It seemed like filler to me. Or perhaps Harry is newly devoted to the game and couldn't contain his enthusiasm. One of the most galling incogruities in the book is using a Jewish computer hacker to spead the rumor that an SS man is Jewish in order to help quell a Putsch. All in all, a very unsatisfactory effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down...","review":"Mr. Turtledove's novels tend to be hit or miss with me, and this one was a definite hit.The story was believable and (I thought) a pretty decent projection of what might have happened if the Third Reich won WWII...and what might have happened to the Jews in their midst.The interplay of personalities certainly held my interest. I thought the main characters were well drawn and sympathetic. Some of the minor characters could have been more well-rounded but this did not detract from the plot.And yes.

I wouldn't recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this toy for my son for Christmas. When it arrived slightly more than a week before the holiday, I was completely disappointed. This sled was a flimsy piece of junk that comparable quality sleds sell for about $8-10 at the local stores . I was under the impression that it was more substantial based upon the description and the few favorable reviews that existed. I cannot comment upon the actual durability because I am returning it promptly. This is the first item of the many that I have bought through amazon that I am returning. This may be a trick, however, as the quoted return shipping charges were over $97 for this $40 sled. I'm not sure how that is possible. I was able to buy a replacement sled from another manufacturer and I am happier about the quality of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"echhh!","review":"Yes, you will be propelled through plot twists almost every chapter. But you don't really care, because you don't really care about the poorly drawn characters. Every one of the players is either lacklustre or repulsive. In fact, you almost wish the leading lady will die a horrible death early in the book - if you read the first few chapters, you will agree with me, but why suffer at all? The syrupy love interest doesn't help at all - in fact, it adds to your desire to see the guy or gal depart the scene so you don't have to read another sappy love line in this book. Nuff said.

Nothing in the book is either believable or engaging. The characters are facades with no clear motivation and the actions are simply beyond all belief.

Browne rails urgently against the complacency that had set in among most Americans since the Vietnam War, which led to a widening gap between the rich and the poor, as well as foreign camp counselors being overly harsh with American kids in their care. As someone who experienced that myself, I can truly appreciate what Browne is saying throughout this album.

It makes the reader think and gives facts so that the reader can make a decision.

It almost seems like these are his 'interpretations' rather than 'translations.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek and sophisticated","review":"A remarkably original book. The illustrations are well wrought, and the story contains some of the most evocative I've heard in a picture book. Describing Novio Boy's collar, the book says it was, \\"a leather one with real gems that sparkled at night when cars passed in the street\\". The cats themselves are a twinge odd. Drawn with cat bodies but human eyes, teeth, and moustaches, they are just disturbing enough to keep the pictures interesting. It's a colorful book as well, full of beautiful swirling scenes and bold shapes. The use of Spanish throughout the text is seamless as well, never striking the reader as out of place or jarring. This book would read well with other stories that incorporate more than one language in their text. Or, kids could read it with other picture books that take place in Hispanic communities. Or, it could be paired with other stories where hungry preying animals fail to get a meal. A beautiful book to read aloud to groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chato's friendly encounter","review":"Chato's Kitchen is a great culturally intriguing book with alot of character.

It is in English, but there are some Spanish words that are hard to read sometimes. I really liked the part when the cat was sneaking up behind the bird. The cat then heard the five mice walking, and he started swinging his tail to the rhythm of their walking. The cat goes up to the gate and ends up scaring the mice. That was only one of the funny scenes. The book has one more funny part at the end that I don't want to give away. Anybody who reads this book will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idealizing a Ghetto Cat","review":"I cannot stand Chato's Kitchen, but more specifically I cannot stand the portrayal of a Hispanic gangster cat. This is a character that is in no way lovable or intriguing but to me rather disgusting, stereotypical, and violating. I like books that mix Spanish and English and do like that element in this book as well as the fact it has a glossary, but the way in which this book does this along with the illustrations of the characters comes across as nothing but sleazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cross-stitch book ever","review":"I've been an embroiderer since I was 7. In all that time, it never occurred to me to even try counted cross-stitching. It just looked, for lack of a better phrase, like \\"baby stuff\\".Not this. Julie Jackson has cured me, I think. Her cross stitching kits and charts mix pretty boring, traditional stuff with some eye-scorching language. I love them. I don't think I'd put any of these up until my little one is older - she's 5 1/2 now - but I'd make 'em. Oh yes. I would.Ms. Jackson even gives charts for a few different alphabet styles, to allow you to make up your own in case these don't go quite far enough for you. If you're like me and haven't even bothered with counted cross-stitch, you owe it to yourself to at least give this book a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"Sorry, but I thought the reviews for this item over rated it. There were few if any of the suggested patterns that I would invest my time in creating. However, the technique descriptions are clear and concise so it was worth buying for them. Perhaps my sense of humour is not American enough, but at best the 'sayings' only merited a smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually earns no stars...","review":"I learned a lot from the convenient Amazon feature of allowing a peek into a book. I quickly realized that the reviewer who noted that any of the so-called-by-other-reviewers \\"edgy\\" and \\"hilarious\\" sentiments presented in this book can be put together with designs and aphabets offered in practically any other cross stitch book was correct. I'm saving my money for truly clever and helpful cross stitch books.

There are sentiments for every occasion: \\"This Place Sucks\\" for workplace adornment, \\"Whatever\\" when feeling particuarly apathetic, or the often appropriate \\"Go F*ck Yourself.\\"Each pattern is clearly laid out with a color key that matches the popular DMC brand floss. The book starts with simple, encouragine instructios. The back includes ideas on how to design your own patters as well as creative ways to finish them.Subversive Cross Stitch is perfect for the beginning stitcher looking for some manageable fun, patterns, as well as the more advanced stitcher who is fed up with traditional patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of stupid person spends their time on this?","review":"I can't believe anyone would waste their time or money on something so lame.

I think it's sad that people would focus hours of creative artistic effort to produce ugly sentiments. Before you buy this book, please ask yourself if what you choose to focus on, to create and display in your home, might have a subtle effect on your health, happiness, and life.There are loads of cross stitch books from which you can produce works of art that are inspiring and help to create an environment of peace, beauty and well-being. I hope you'll choose one, because there is enough hatefulness and sarcasm in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought out my inner artist","review":"It's amazing what a quick, little cross stitch book can do to bring out the inner artist. I loved Subversive Cross Stitch as it broke me out of that \\"oh, you can only do cute little samplers or cute little snowmen or cute little whatnots\\" in cross stitch. Now my mind is rolling with ideas with what I can do not only in cross stitch but with other crafts as well. I only wish there were more patterns in the book...I highly suggest this book if you've gotten yourself in a crafting funk; this will open the doors on the subversive side of yourself.

Tired of all the \\"fluffy bunny\\" cutsie cross stitch patterns...this is the one for you!! This one says it all! My favorite pattern would have to be \\"Happy F**king Holidays\\"! The author also encourages the stitcher to branch out...mix and match...make your own. This book is just a guide and gives permission to stitch what we've always wanted to say! The book is currently being passed around to all my stitching friends.

I swear.And if you like to swear - and cross stitch - you'll love this book. Even if you don't swear a lot, but are known for your sarcastic take on life, you'll love this book. Need a quick, pithy cross stitches for the more pointed aspects of work - no problem, do \\"This Place Sucks\\" with a cute lavendar floral border. Tired of a whiner? Stitch \\"Too Bad So Sad\\" or \\"Whatever\\". Need an expletive, but something less than rated R?

As a few others have said, the designs are far too simplistic, and are nothing I couldn't whip up on my own (and whip out in 15 minutes). I love the concept and the sayings (especially the foul-mouthed ones juxtaposed against the traditional, flowery motifs - ha!), but the designs are so simple I can get them by just looking at the photographs.

I mostly wanted this book for my library as it is certainly not your typical sampler. When I got the book I browsed through it and found the cross stitching ordinary. Of course the 'interest' is that the sayings are shocking on these sweet little designs. I wasn't so impressed. However, all 4 of my kids who were home for Christmas thought this book was HILARIOUS and my daughter needed to know -immediately- how to cross stitch!

This guy is a great wit, and possesses considerable intellect, which has to be some sort of a salute to his \\"home-schooling.\\" Mirth is incorporated here into all of his irreverent statements, and there is a little bit of Bode in all of us, at least in myself and my choice of friends! Since this book predicates the infamous \\"60 Minutes\\" profile, which wasn't bad; it was the ski-press' and industry reaction to it that has been so distasteful to me. Bode is going to be around as a character long after he has finished with his go-fast skiing. I look forward to knowing him somehow, and wish him the best as a centered human being who cannot fail to be totally himself. Ever! There is a great NH influence here, and he represents us well with our unique woodsy approach to reality. Godspeed, Bode. You are funny!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"flying downhill","review":"I defiantly recommend this book to young skiers and people that enjoy a good laugh. This book is filled with funny stories and basically the story of Bode Miller. This book was awesome I couldn't put it down. I connected with bode on some of the things that he wrote. I love skiing and I have the dream of being a professional skier when I grow up just like Bode Miller.

The video is very worthwhile to watch if you are a Christian, or want to know about what Christianity is. This is the classic story from Bible scripture. Jesus, 'after' his death on the cross, is found to be walking with two of his Disciples, who are quite upset and in a great quandry as to the meaning of Jesus' death, and what to do, now that they have lost their great leader. Tho the Disciples dont immediately recognize Jesus, it is He that walks with them on the road to Emmaus. Jesus allays their fears by explaining to them why the Messiah came, and why he died. I felt that the scenery and settings were very good, the acting was very clear and concise, and the words spoken were very helpful to me to understand why Jesus came to the earth, to create a loving relationship between Man and God, and between all Mankind to one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Scripture is Beautiful on the Screen","review":"I found this video fills the dialog and rich scripture from Luke's Gospel.The characters and setting are so real-to-life that they stay with me any time I re-read this telling of events later on Resurrection Day.The presentation of Jesus is warm, wise, and insightful.The video is \\"not too long and not too short\\" for my taste.I recommend this as an excellent gift for any Christian.John GremerIrvine, CA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Road to Emmaus -Transaction was Excellent - movie not so good","review":"Folk selling through Amazon are terrific. This movie was in content less than I was hoping for. I ordered it because it was suggested that others ording what I wanted also ordered this.

Follows the scripture (Luke 24:13-35) very well and very clearly presents the case that Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ; and that His death was necessary to reconcile sin-sick humanity back to our Creator.

Glad I just rented and did not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Depth of Islam and Sufism","review":"In this book you can find the real depth of Islam and Sufism and the organic connection between them. It's a kind of treasure chest, grounded in sound scholarship, in direct spiritual transmission from a lineage of Sufi shaykhs, and in decades of immersion in world religions, which the author considered to be different expressions of one reality. The book itself is more like a series of experiences than it is like reading *about* something. You may connect with some parts more than with others, which is fine; there are different gifts here for seekers of love and knowledge with different tastes and at different stages in their journeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I really appreciated the liner notes for this cd. These liner notes are actually a well-researched 29 page booklet that describes the zar ceremony and explains it's development, music and meaning in an easy-to-read way. The cd contains zar music (with translations included in the liner notes). This is a great cd for anyone curious about the zar or interested in women's rituals or trance dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERY TRACK IS A VOCAL","review":"I wish I had known that every track on this CD is a vocal and there are no purely instrumental selections. For that reason, this CD is useless to me. I am an American doing middle eastern dance and was hoping this would be something I could make use of with my dancing, as I like the 2/4 ayoub rhythm used for the zar. The vocals will sound harsh and dissonant to the Western ear because of the untrained voices and the singing style. The vocals overpower the instrumental background music. The tracks are undanceable and because of the ever-present vocals and their style, unpleasant for listening. This CD may be useful to somebody doing an academic study of the niche in Arab culture the enclosed info booklet describes. I give this one star because of the well-researched booklet. However, I must say, it's the first time I have ever paid $16 for a small information booklet, which is what this purchase was for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Clutches Of","review":"Hello!

It shows on this cd--every song is great and it clearly shows the other side of the Cars without Occask vocals- Cars fans-get this CD--you will not be disappointed0-plus Ellott Easton the Cars lead guitar player,. is on most of the cuts --sounds like the Cars in my opinion!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"filling in the blanks","review":"no there are no bonus tracks on the album. fortunately there are no dvd menus to navigate either. i own the lp/vinyl and it contains the same tracks and sounds very similar. bottom line is if your favorite cars track was \\"drive\\" then this is the album for you. the songs do stick in your head. frankly i'm glad they issued the cd, because i was tired of putting off cleaning the vinyl to listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unknown Gem","review":"Wow!

I'm sure that it will last a long time, and it doesn't rust which is nice because our previous mailbox had gotten very rusty and that is why it needed to be replaced. I do not have a problem with the door opening or closing, and for those that do, there is an adjustable clasp that can most likely solve that problem. The only reason that I gave four out of five stars was because it does not come with any hardware, we had to go to Home Depot to try to find exactly the right size hardware to attach the mailbox to the post.

The first thing I noticed about this product was that it was considerably larger with a larger container for water so she wouldn't have to change it as much but, as I watched her read the instructions and try to set it up, I realized that more water might not be the best thing. It was rather difficult for my 65 year old grandmother to set up. Then, to make matters worse, once she did get it installed properly, it didn't fit on her planter since it's curve is too large and there is no way to adjust it. All in all? She ended up just filling up her Aqua Globe and sticking it back in her plant. I didn't blame her either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Expected","review":"Easy to set up and works as expected. I like the eco-friendly design, requiring no artificial power source.

I'll give it a try,\\" this item works better in theory than in practice.You can't really rely on it to keep your plants alive. I think another review said you had to siphon the thing first. That kind of takes away the \\"automatic\\" idea. Maybe my expectations of the product were a little too high, and my review sounds a bit harsh, but when I see automatic, I want something truly automatic.Not only that, the system is a real eye-sore.Maybe plant sitting technology is still in its infancy and hopefully it will improve in the future.

I sure hope that if you buy this book you don't actually plan on fixing anything specific. The authors of this book raced through and tried to give as little detail about the repairs they were doing as possible.I will never own another Chilton's manual. I suggest you stick with the Haynes manuals. The detail is much greater, the pictures are MUCH better, and they actually tore down and rebuilt the vehicle in the Haynes manual.Please don't waste your money on this pitiful excuse for a repair manual!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generalities not Specifics","review":"The book takes a lot of space to describe what a relay is, but not where the relays are or what they do on this model car. The book has many sections similar to this, almost like a cut and paste exercise. Generic pictures of tire wear, spark plug condition - who cares? Reference is made to the low pressure switch on the air conditioning circuit - why not show you where it is. Wiring diagrams look like bad photocopies. Pictures of the engine compartment are reversed. Antifreeze colors have changed over the years! I would estimate that only 10 to 15% of the content has to do with the minivan model purportedly covered, the rest is auto \\"filler\\" - all in all, a pretty worthless book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unknown Philly's","review":"Maze was formed in Philadelphia at the height of the Philly-sound. They failed to achieve any degree of success until they moved to San Fransisco.

These Klipsch AW-400 speakers had by far the worst sound. In comparison to the other speakers we listened to, the sound was not clear and you could not hear sounds that were audible from the other outdoor speakers we tested. We kept the Boston speakers (which had the best sound) for use in our yard, and the Polk Audio Atrium 6 speakers for use on our balcony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller then what i thought","review":"This ended up a lot smaller then what i thought but my son knew who it was and was very happy, i wish it would have come with lighting mcqueen though.

It is very hard to open and close --which is annoying since you have to open the entire thing to put Lightning inside instead of just pushing him in and out of the back flap door--and it has too many useless thingies inside that break easily. When one of the car wash rollers broke off after two minutes of play, I told my son he didn't need that part. He said, \\"You're right mommy. I don't.\\" My son is not at all interested in having Lightning play video games or work out at the exercise station. Luckily, all he wants to do with it is roll it arund the floor singing \\"Life is a Highway.\\" I see it is selling for $50 and up.

It was hard to get apart for playing with the inside part. Lighning McQueen car is not included. Please read carefully, wish I had done that rather than look at the photo.I am sure this truck will be broken soon as it is not made with very durable materials, especially the tiny inside parts.I am very dissatisfied with what I got for the purchase price. However, my nephew who is 7 seemed to enjoy playing with it on Christmas morning. It probably won't last undamaged until the end of January tops.If you are considering this product please be aware that it is a very small truck, and made of cheap plastic the photo of the product is deceiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this unless you are an extremely patient person","review":"Trying to put his toy back together is not worth the 10 minutes of play time your child will get out of it. The pieces don't snap together well, and we've found it impossible to close the truck up so that it stays, not to mention trying to fit the pieces inside the truck as it is supposed to do. It provides hours of frustration rather than entertainment. That said, my 5 year old likes it, but since it's pretty small, he only plays with it for about 10 minutes at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for a day","review":"After one day of having this product, my three year old son informed me that it was 'boring'.

He plays with Mack and uses his cars with it everyday for what seems like an eternity at times! We hear him creatively describing loading up McQueen to head for the races as well as getting his friends on board. It's very cute and I would highly recommend. (There are small pieces, so if you have a younger 2, I would be cautious as the pieces do tend to come off, even though they do pop back in just as easily.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for 3 & 7 year olds....not that sturdy though","review":"My sons (3 & 7) both enjoy this toy. There are lots of little pieces that are pretty flimsy. One piece even broke off before we got it all the way out of the package on Christmas morning. Nothing a little super glue can't fix, but I still think this toy could have been built better.It is difficult (at best) to open up. There is no button to pop it open. You have to pull pretty hard to get the \\"Bachelor Pad\\" open. It is made of plastic, not metal. I would have preferred a more durable toy.Overall, my kids love it. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My son was thrilled to see that they made a toy version of the truck.

BUT overall it was worth the 14.88 at the local supercenter!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bought It","review":"Please note - the little play cars are not included. I bought it at one place thinking I could find the little cars someplace else. Don't buy this toy until the little cars that go with it are available. I have been to several stores and no one has them. You can't even order them on line! My son loves the truck, but it isn't as interesting with out the little car and the plastic parts of the truck don't look like they will take much before they break, so it could very well be broken before I ever find the cars that go with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone help me here!","review":"O.k. Can someone explain to me why a 4- to 8-year-old needs a toy called a Bachelor Pad that expresses the \\"racy\\" side of this movie character?

When are we parents going to open our eyes and pay attention to what the manufacturers are selling our children?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old LOVES Mack!","review":"I have a pretty huge CARS fan and he really loves this Mack truck. He plays with him a lot. The only thing is some of the smaller parts inside of Mack have fallen off or broke.

If you have a Disney Cars fan this will be a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the price","review":"I bookmarked this item to purchase in December. My son's birthday is a week after Christmas. I am DISMAYED to come back to this page and see that a simple little plastic (a little junky!?) toy has changed in price from under $15 to almost $100!!!. The Note that Amazon gave me was that this toy was no longer available from the original offering company. I wouldn't consider paying that much for a toy that won't last. Read the comments below and see for yourself if the toy will last. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many small parts","review":"My son loves the CARS movie and seems to be on a mission to aquire every toy made. He was very excited to see the Mack truck finally available to go with the cars. Unfortunately, the trailer, which is supposed to open, requires a knife to pry open. Once it is open it is filled with tons of very small, extremely breakable parts that fold in and out and actually prevent you from getting it closed again. Most of them didn't last the first day in our house. Once he'd broken all the little pieces and basically stripped the interior it was alright. But we still need a knife whenever he wants to re-open the trailer.I love the idea of a Mack truck to go with the toy cars. I just don't understand why they had to make it so ridiculously elaborate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son LOVES it, but Breaks easily","review":"We got this for my son when he turned 3. He had been wanting it for months. While he still plays with it every day (8 months after his birthday), it is missing some of the car wash pieces. They snap off and on easily, which is annoying for me. My son doesn't seem to notice or care. While I haven't done it yet, I think a bit of super glue would stop the car wash pieces from falling off. I would still buy it again because he absolutely adores it, but super glue some of the pieces before giving it to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a toy to be played with alone!!","review":"While this truck is certainly entertaining for my 4 year old, the trailer is impossible to open or close for him. He loves to play with it while it is open - but needs help opening and closing it. Unfortunately it also has LOTS of cheap little plastic parts that are constantly coming off the inside of the truck - often times while opening the truck!! (shower curtain, wash brushes, etc.) Luckily, my son is extremely gentle with his toys - and isn't too upset about things coming off----so long as I can get them back on. A little wheel has now popped off the inside of the truck and I think it's going to take glue to fix it - it actually looks like it was attached with glue. We've had the truck for 6 weeks, not sure how long it will last. This truck is cheaply made - and I wouldn't recommend it - personally, I'm glad someone else bought it for him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the fine print","review":"I am very disappointed, I ordered this toy on Black Friday for my son, for Christmas this year. It took over a week to get it in the mail. I was most disappointed by the item description. The picture shows a lighting McQueen car, comes with this toy, it does not!!It is also not as big as it looks in the picture. This toy is definitely not worth the 32.99 plus shipping that I payed. I was extremely disappointed with the toy overall, it was supposed to be the big toy my son was getting for Christmas. I would not buy if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of money, a lot of cheap plastic","review":"The product was very expensive compared to the amount of molded plastic it is made from. I'm guessing Mattel's profit on this product is about 70% of the purchase price. It should have been made of metal. I am wondering how long it will last under the hands of my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a hit at Christmas","review":"My son could do nothing but talk about his desire for this particular toy before Christmas and when he opened it.....he screamed and danced around. (He's 3) The truck has taken a lot of abuse, it goes everywhere, and still is in great shape. All of the parts are functional and it is easy to open and close. One of the padded brushes falls off on occasion but otherwise it was a great investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Favorite","review":"We got this for our 4 year old Cars fanatic for Christmas and it is still the favorite gift. He plays for hours with this toy. There are a couple parts that fall off when he shuts Mac together, but it is an easy fix. I actually think it is good that they made it that way, I would rather it be flexible and easily put back together than rigid and broken. Definitely a must for your Cars fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He plays with it so much I can't belive it's still in one piece","review":"and I mean that literally. It looks like junky plastic. It has tiny, break-offable parts (do not get this for a small child who swallows things). It is very hard to open and close. It can not open while Mac is driving, doesn't have massage pads and doesb't have a phone like in the movie. And my almost 3-year-old LOVES it! He plays with it every day. Now when he loves it this much and it hasn't actually broken even though I thoroughly expected it to the second I opened it I have to give it high marks. I do wish it was made to be more consistant with the inside of Mac in the movie. If your child is a stickler for detail don't get this. If not... it will fast become a favorite toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Mack Truck Bachelor Pad Playset","review":"My son has been so excited to receive this item. It is all he could talk about before Christmas. It has been in constant play since. The body of the truck seems to be durable as it is lugged around and dropped as my three year old plays. I wish the truck was not decorated with stickers as they are already wearing off. It opens to reveal fun activites for lightning mcqueen inside, but some of the pieces, like the car wash attatchment come loose and have to be reattatched over and over again. The Bachelor Pad can be difficult for little hands to open also. Over all it is a fun today that my son loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Title","review":"Not much to say about the toy.My son really enjoy's it.

His favorite toy and is played with everyday. good quality and big hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Toy","review":"This has to be one of my son's favorite toys. He is 3 years old and received it for Christmas. I agree with the other reviewers that small parts come off and can usually be snapped back on. So far the truck has been holding up well. There are lots of things to do inside and my son loves putting Doc and Lightning inside Mack. Because my son enjoys playing with this so much I gave it a high rating. He uses it every day and even takes it in his bed at night! I have seen this item listed as $[...] on some sites and would never pay this much. We bought it for $[...] before the Christmas rush, which is a very appropriate price given the size and features of the toy. If he takes this toy somewhere and there are kids around, they usually all go nuts playing with it, including the girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny truck with Big price tag","review":"For fear that my two boys, ages 4 & 8, would fight over this item on Christmas morning, I foolishly bought two. Fortunately, I bought one at Target and paid only the original price of $14.99 and then watched as the price for the truck skyrocketed as the holidays drew nearer. This truck is tiny and is waaaay overrated by the photos. There are many tiny little pieces that my children have already lost or broken. The truck is so cheaply made that it is a joke. Save your money or buy mine for a buck at my summer rummage sale. Very disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite!","review":"My son got it for Christmas and it is his favorite toy (along with bunch of die cast cars from the same movie) ever since. My son sleeps with it, eats with it and even takes it into the bath tab. It is pretty durable, I only wish that eyes on the truck would be painted not stickers, after couple of baths they started to peel off... does not seem to bother my son though. There are a lot of activities for pretend play inside the truck and when open it could be occupied with 3 cars, so McQueen can have friends over. Holds 2 cars when closed. Highly recommend for a Cars fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than expected, but daughter still loves it","review":"My 5 year old daughter was very excited to receive this for a Christmas present - it was the present she wanted most. She was a little dissapointed that it was so small, but she is very happy with it overall. It is difficult to open the hauler, most the time we have to open it for her. I'm hoping it will get easier to open as she plays with it more. We bought it on Amazon when it was $15 - no way would I pay much more for it. Overall, a good addition to the CARS toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mack Playset","review":"I bought this for my 5-year old son for Christmas. I opened the box and inspected the truck. I believe that the product is well made for the ages specified 4-8. This would not be an appropriate toy for younger children. I am sure that my son is going to LOVE this toy. My son will be getting almost all of the other cars as gifts, and I just know that we are going to spend Christmas break crawling on the floor acting out much of the movie. The current price is more than I am willing to pay, I got it for around $20. I guess that the sellers are just making the most of a limited product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute playset","review":"Saving this item as a Christmas gift.Smaller than I expected, but I think my 5 year old will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super After Shave Product for Sensitive Skin","review":"I have been using Gabel's Bay Rum for many years now; there is just nothing else like it.

I used to buy the Clubman version- which has a lot of alcohol in it and has a corresponding bite. The Gabels' lotion version does not bite and still has that wonderful crisp smell of bay rum.Like almost all bay rums, the fragrance is not strong for hours but fades to a subtle scent, which makes it great for today's workplace. If you want a longer, stronger smell choose a cologne rather then a lotion.For me, Gabels' lotion is great for day-to-day use...."},{"rating":"1","title":"80% Alcohol, 20% cloves, 100% waste","review":"You'd figure an average of 4 stars on reviews would mean a good product? Not really. Good Bay Rum has a hint of cloves. This stuff is what you get if you soak cloves in alcohol, add yellow color, strain, then bottle it. I am really disappointed. No point in returning as it is not sold thru Amazon. Don't waste your time on this unless you like clove alcohol aftershave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I absolutely love this product.

Certainly a fine value, even with the shipping charge--which was MORE than the cost of the product! I checked out the cost of buying 2, but the saving on shipping was not worth doing. Still, if the product is still available when I've gone through 16 oz. of bay rum, I'll almost certainly buy it again. One more note: when the package arrived it had a distinct bay rum aroma, but the bottle was sealed and as far as I can tell had not leaked."},{"rating":"1","title":"High priced Low quality","review":"This was no where close to the Bay Rum my husband is used to.

Be careful when you pour it into you hand because it comes out of the bottle real fast. I think they should slow that down with a smaller opening in the bottle.

The lotion in my bottle had almost no scent. The Gabel's ingredient label was as follows: SD Alcohol 40, Water, Sucrose Octacetate, Bay Oil, FD&C Yellow #5. The Bay Rum that I usually use had the following ingredients: Bay Oil, Ethyl Alcohol 50% by volume, fragrances, and Bitrex as a denaturant. Per the listed ingredients, Gabel's is mostly denatured alcohol, WATER, some type of sugar and then Bay Oil. The Bay Rum that I usually use is by Humco, Texarkana, TX 75501. I used to buy it at my local CVS Pharmacy, but they stopped carrying it. I will buy the Humco product on line directly online from them. The only draw back to the Humco product is the bottle it comes in. The bottle is the same brown plastic bottle that is used for rubbing alcohol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The scent reminds me of clove and nutmeg. It's pleasant but it lingers a lot longer than I would like. I think I noticed it a good 10 hours after I put it on. It does make my face feel great after a shave but I also think the bay oil is causing me to break out. I'll probably stop using it. I should also mention that it took 9 days to get a shipping confirmation which said it was already delivered. It was then delivered 4 days after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the bayrum scent of yesterdays barbershop","review":"I was GREATLY disappointed in this product.

The cast recording does a very good job with the Four Seasons songs, including Big Girl's Don't Cry, Sherry and My Eyes Adored You.I had forgotten how many songs by the Four Seasons I knew, and the Broadway show bought it all back.

It is a huge leap from this mess to the great performances of a great group.Obviously, most of us would be better off staying away from this one.

I have their albums, CD's and videos. My elementary music class loves singing their songs and I wanted to give copies of this CD to my students. They are to the '60s what ABBA is to the '70s. That said, I was disappointed with The Jersey Boys which I hoped would be equal to the Mamma Mia CD. My main complaint is two uses of the \\"F\\" word on The Jersey Boys. If you don't mind this on your CD I suppose you will like it, but I think others should be made aware of its inclusion. However, this sure ruined the CD as far as I'm concerned.

I've been playing it over and over again. Can't get enough of it. The cast is superb and the songs sound even better than the original. Great drummer too.

In the meantime, get the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff; I'd probably appreciate it better if I'd seen the show","review":"Thing about buying Broadway cast recordings - they usually have both music and dialogue, which you don't quite get the significance of unless you've seen the show. And since Broadway productions in Australia are few and far between...That said, however, the tracks on this album make for fun listening (and dancing too), and I enjoyed the cast's renditions of Four Seasons hits like Sherry, Walk Like A Man, Who Loves You, Big Girls Don't Cry, and many others, as well as John Lloyd Young's performances of Frankie Valli favourites You're Just Too Good to be True and My Eyes Adored You. It's impossible not to bop to the beats and sing along!Fans of the group might prefer the original albums, but this recording can help introduce the best of FV and TFS to today's generation, and will be great for fans of the Broadway show.Here's to the Jersey Boys touring down under..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jersey Boys...","review":"I originally bought this for my mother.

I've never seen an audience react to a showstopper like that before.The CD is fantastic. John Lloyd Young really captures Frankie Valli's sound. If you can't see the show, get this CD.

The author has spun a plausible scenario of the lives of the two brothers from their childhood to their deaths, to account for what might have taken them to that point of madness. The details of their their grandfather's abuse, their mother's descent into madness, their efforts to live a sane existence in spite of their experiences, and then the gradual acceptance of the futility of such a desire, is terribly sad and poignant. There is a point where the conclusion becomes inevitable and one wants to shout, as if to a movie screen, \\"No, not that way!\\", and with as much effect. It is such a fascinating and well thought out tale that the reader can be forgiven for forgetting that it is fiction.

Ricks obviously has good insight into today's military and the distinguising cultures of each service branch. He interleaves these observations throughout the book and that is the strength of this novel. For military buffs, this is a very easy and entertaining read. The big negative though is the thinness of the plot and the absurd decisions that the main characters make. An intelligent reader will have to suspend his logic when reading this book. As all of the protagonists are extremely intelligent they do some very dumb things. Also it becomes way too easy to determine what is going to happen - just like a poorly made movie. Ricks has the ability to write a really great novel, but this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing...very rare in the genre","review":"This is great writing. I am tired of reading shallow books by Clancy and is ilk, who are lost in technology and Reagan politics. So enter here for a good military story that does not follow the predictable route."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven plot and poorly-developed characters","review":"I'm not exactly sure what to say about this book. Several things come to mind:1) Without any spoilers, the ending was awful. It's as if the author thought, \\"it's time to end now.\\", scribbled some twaddle, and called his publisher.2) The characters were banal. There's the too-trusting, team-playing male and the quietly-suffering, outsider female. Wow, no way we could've seen that coming.3) The section on the court martial was poorly done and should've been deleted.Maybe the author'll get lucky and they'll cast Ben and JLo for the movie.As an irrelevant aside, I grin at the author's obvious worry that he perceives military officers as outside the mainstream (actually, it'd be more accurate to say they're outside his chardonnay-sipping, gallery-opening attending, Bryn Mawr and Wellesley-supporting mainstream). Since I'd bet dollars to donuts he'd prefer his kids were rabid PETA members than commissioned officers, all I can say is DUH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricks has broken the code","review":"Remarkable: a reporter who apparently has no military service but demonstrates an unusual understanding of the military and its many subcultures. From a purely literary standpoint it's journeyman stuff; only a few minor characters really flesh out to three dimensions, and the plot goes off the rails at the end. But the novel's main conceit (an e-mail revolution within the US Army officer corps) and its principal theme - where does duty lie? - are well-developed. Military officers should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster 5711 food steamer","review":"second one, we use at least once a week for several years.

I often cook carrots, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus all at same time stacked in a crisscross fashion. The only criticism i can think off is that the little plastic reservoir on front, used to show you water level, sometimes get dirty or moldy inside because it's impossible to get anything in there to scrub. But this could be my fault since I sometimes don't rinse it immediately after using. Either way I'm not that worried about it since the steam pretty much kills most everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"great kitchen addition!","review":"This is the first steamer I have owned and I am thrilled with it. It starts steaming very quickly after turning it on. I have steamed frozen veges straight from the freezer, crab legs, eggs, and rice. Everything turned out great. I use it at least once per week. It stores away nicely in my lazy suzan. I love that I can put all the pieces in the dishwasher top rack for quick cleanup. The only thing I wish was better is that you can't turn the timer back down if you set it too high....it would be nice if the timer was adjustable. However, I just unplug the unit and let the timer run out. I also wish the cord was a bit longer since you really need to make sure you don't set it under cabinets or anything else.

This one is on my counter and I use it almost every day.

It makes vegetables that are cooked through yet firm.I am finding I much prefer to reheat leftovers in it as well. They come out just as warm as a microwave but they are not dried out, overcooked, or flavorless rewarming food in the steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointing","review":"Oster 5711 Mechanical Food SteamerI have a small Black and Decker steamer works great. I saw the oster and liked the size and wanted an oblong, so got it. Tried it out and was very dissapointed in the time it took. I put a few slices of cabbage in bottom tier suppose to be 18 min. and some brocoli and cauliflower in top suppose to be 14 min. The cabbage was about half done in 35 min. so removed it and lowered the brocoli pot and it went another 10 min which totaled 45 min. and was about 3/4 done..so much for my opinion of double decker. If you put timer at high number you cannot turn it backwards to lessen the time. I wonder why they make this large size then tell you to put small amounts in it, seems like a waste to me. The steam output is about half of my Black and Decker. I am wondering if I purchased a steamer or a lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster 6.1 Qt.

I thought I would get the same satisfaction from this new one, but it has so far been very disappointing. The water never reaches boiling temperature, so that even after half an hour or more, the food being steamed is still lukewarm and I have to transfer the food to my microwave oven to have it properly reheated. This is a big contrast to the old steamer, which made food steaming hot after about 20 minutes. I am of the opinion that the unit shipped to me may be defective and wish to return it for a replacement, but unfortuantely I have discarded the original packing and the return slip because previous Amazon shipments had always been satisfactory.

I did so, and my eggs were still RAW. After about 35 minutes of total cooking, some eggs had perfect yolks but undercooked whites. Others had perfect whites but overcooked yolks.

Look in the \\"Acknowledgments\\" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published. Find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site (anywho.com, dogpile.com, etc.) and give them a call. If they are receptive to your idea, send them a formal proposal.I have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation.

Needless-to-say, we returned this item. As a side note, we went out to try to look at models before purchasing a new one and found a big chain store with a smaller Danby unit on the sales floor.

There is too much meaningless and very little sensuality...sometimes we forget that they aren't exactly the same thing; but this is a problem of many writers today. I see this book more as an intermission between the first and the last book than a volume with its own completion. All that is told in \\"Children of the vampire\\" had to be put in the first and in the third book, I believe. Luckily, the other two tomes are better.

His account is detailed, insightful and really does serve as a kind of political education for the reader. Stephanopoulos' book provides great insight into what is going on behind today's White House. I can imagine all the players and the spin taking place in \\"the Oval\\" for each new headline. Throughout the book, Stephanopoulos shows his respect for Clinton and the presidency yet struggles with his acceptance of Clinton's \\"zig-zag\\" ways of playing the political game and his manipulation of loyalists for political benefit. Stephanopoulos' portrayal of Dick Morris' White House antics should be given special note as both amazing yet frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunist Extraordinaire","review":"This book just proves that, when opportunity knocks in the age of selfishness, who can resist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Information","review":"I would have liked this book better if it had given more information on how to actually produce information-hiding packages in Oracle. The treatment of how to use Oracle PL/SQL to create stored procedures was also shallow and superficial.I feel that Oracle Unleashed was a much better book.

I found this book so intriguing I could reread it right now, and I just finished it a few minutes ago. Stephanopoulos has told his story honestly and admits his own fears and doubts without apology. Glad he got out of The White House before Monica."},{"rating":"2","title":"I perspective of Clinton from a friend, very insightful.","review":"I am a person seeking the truth, not a favorable impression of Clinton but a portrayal of him by someone besides a Republican critic. George shows what the game is like from the inside out. It reveals the nasty, the grand and the reason why it's all worth it. It shows that Clinton was a very principled man who had to push his agenda by staying in power, and that made him bend at times. But that is inevitable. It shows how the media gave this modern president no pardons and how they wanted to make a big story out of anything that turned up. It shows what it's like to be personally inspired by our president. It's a great book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Too Boring","review":"After all the hoopla, this book was really disappointing. The author's style is bland and flat and the only fact he managed to tell us that we didn't already know was that he had \\"sort of\\" dated Jennifer Grey. Wow. Who cares? I, for one, wish the publishers would have given us five or six good, but lesser-hyped books, rather than paying megabucks for what's already been printed in the newspapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Too Ego","review":"What simplistic tripe this book is. Stephanopolous injects far too much insecurity in this writing. He, on numerous occasions in the book, alludes to the fact that his being \\"Greek\\" has some kind of correlation with the other \\"oppressed\\" peoples of the world - absurd. Additionally, he seems to be the driving force behind ALL of the successes during his involvement in the Clinton Administration, relegating people like James Carville to a back seat (the opposite seems to be true if you read any of Carvilles works). His bias is clear and not at all masked, which supports the current \\" I am not a narrow-minded liberal even though I behave like one\\" mentality prevalent in today's network news media. Pass on this book and get one with true insight and analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real waste of time","review":"C'mon George, without Clinton you wouldn't exist.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One person's side of the story","review":"A better title for George Stephanopoulos' memoir \\"All Too Human\\" would have been \\"All Too Immature.\\"Passages in the book paint a self-portrait of an intelligent, but immature and starry-eyed young man who was in over his head.Maybe it was just that starry-eyed quality that won him the high post he occupied in the Clinton White House. But he reveals his lack of qualification for that high White House position IN HIS OWN WORDS, describing himself as an emotional wreck his last year there. Little did we all realize that he was borderline emotionally -- if not mentally -- ill.If Stephanopoulos had waited some decent period of time to write his memoirs -- say, five years -- historians would have been as well served. But clearly he wouldn't have garnered the big bucks he did by telling it now while the President is still in office"},{"rating":"2","title":"A piece of the puzzle","review":"With this book George Stephanopoulos provides yet another inside look into the Clinton administration. He is clearly a very intelligent person with a good grip on the power games in Washington.The book is filled with descriptions of situations and events from his time in the White House, but lacks real analysis of his and Clintons achievements or lack of same. One wonders if he might have been better off waiting a few more years to gain more perspective on his own performance. He was a very young Senior Advisor and perhaps some more time would have helped him understand how that influenced the decision making.Even with the lack of true analysis the book is an important piece of the puzzle if you want to understand the Clinton White House and George Stephanopoulos writes well and keeps the reader interested all the way through. Hopefully there will be a sequal at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I agree with DrDoug whole heartedly. He wants people to feel sorry for him. He still insists that anyone that didn't agree with their policies and methods were either stupid or part the the right wing conspiracy, and he still defended the poor foreign policies of this president. He said a few things that probably didn't go over very well with the Clinton's, but in general he still defended them and their policies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanopoulos is very smart, but wiser now.","review":"This is probably the best inside look at the Clinton White House since the \\"Agenda.\\" In addition to following the unique maturation process of a young and brilliant political strategist, George Stephanopoulos makes us feel the pressures of public service. In the end, cynicism and paranoia often tempered his unwavering devotion to the President and First Lady.The book tends to be a little too predictable at times. It is sequenced by high profile news stories that the Chief White House aide continuously tried to manipulate during his tenure. Ironically, he now uses the media to validate the same stories in his book.Does this book make George Stephanopoulos a traitor? Hardly. I thought it was a good read...if you have the stomach for cut throat politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light reading, Easy on the Analysis","review":"If you are interested in intellectual and political analysis concerning the Clinton preseidency, skip this book and read Dick Morris' Behind the Oval Office. Yes, Stephanopoulus is a smart guy with strong background in political theory and tactics. Nevertheless, his sense of strategy and the big picture are lacking.This is a light book and if you are looking for easy summer reading this may be just for you. There's lots of tidbits from behind the scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, I had trouble putting it down!","review":"I found this book quite insightful. Mr. Stephanopoulos takes us behind the spin of the white house to show us how decisions are truly made by some of the top advisors and even the president. He explores how he delt with being lied to about some of the more notable scandals. I found it interesting that he never lost faith in Bill Clinton, and how he also tried to remain true to his greek heritage. This is a wonderful read and at only 427 pages it is not to hard to finish off in a short period of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new here","review":"For all the flack Stephanopolous got for writing this book, I really expected some juicy insight (gossip?) as to what makes this White House tick. All I found was a little more detail on what was already apparent - the Clintons are self-centered opportunists and surround themselves with the same.Glad I got this book at the library, instead of paying for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This book is a great inside look at the White House, but it will bore you if you lack knowledge of history, government, or politics. I'd give the book five stars, but it was a tad verbose, so ya lost a star there George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its my party and I'll cry if I want to","review":"I bought this book for two primary reasons: 1) I have always been intrigued by G. Stephanopolous' public comments, and 2) I was very curious about the details regarding the inner workings of the Clinton Whitehouse. Mind you, although I wanted details, I wanted a fair and balanced account.If this describes your interests as well, then don't place this book at the top of your list. Some very interesting glimpses are offered into a presidency defined by poor leadership and a lust for higher poll numbers. What overshadows all of this, however, is Stephanopolous' self-serving approach to documenting history. Everything is filtered through his \\"they hurt my feelings and didn't appreciate me enough\\" perspective of the world. After a chapter or two of this, you can't help but doubt the honesty and objectivity of anything the author has written.My recommendation? Wait for the paperback edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"This book is a waste of time. I can't understand why people are interested in reading about the president saying s--- when he heard the OJ verdict or other such meaningless garbage. Who Cares? I care more about the effect of U.S. policies. Did Reagon and Bush lie about Iran Contra? Didn't those lies have more impact on people's lives than the lies about Clinton's affair? I don't get it. Georgey, get a backbone and stop your whining...it is not at all becoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing much really new","review":"Stephanopoulos reveals very little of importance. His main themes are that Clinton lies constantly, Hillary is deep into coverup of Whitewater and denial of the President's adolescent sexual persona and the total absence of integrity at the top is mirrored by staff and cabinet who value their positions above the truth. Donate the money you would spend on this to some good cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tale of Two Books","review":"It's hard to argue that George Stephanopolous is an extremely intelligent, well-spoken idealist, but he makes the mistake of attempting to write two books in one with \\"All Too Human.\\" He's a cheerleader throughout most of the book, but it's as if he was compelled to be critical sporadically to sell more books. The book doesn't flow. His portrayal of the political machinations in America today are fascinating, and disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of boring","review":"I wanted to like this book, but found it somewhat boring. About half way through I had to start \\"speed reading\\" by only reading the first and last sentences of each paragraph whilst skimming the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I don't think government is good, just necessary.\\"","review":"I agree with this quote from George. I dislike most politics but have been a Clinton supporter. This book is a great view of how it felt (would feel for anyone) intelligent but politically inexperienced to be thrown into that heady atmosphere. It wasn't an old guy spinning his view of(and his place in) history. It was a young guy showing what he learned along the way about the process. I think it was balanced for the most part and the critics of this book (like George Wills in the NYT) have some other ax to grind. As a former corporate VP I strongly identified with the dilemma of the \\"right thing\\" versus the \\"political thing\\" in making decisions. Politics are rampant in any hierarchical organization and this is a good primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest account","review":"If George would have interviewed a few down to earth people from Arkansas before he hired on with Bill and Hillary, then from what I read in his book, I do not believe he could not have worked for them or even been close to them for very long. He got his education the hard way. His account of his experiences seem to be honest without seeming to put a blade in anyone's back. After all, truth is truth, and should not be covered up."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME","review":"Who cares if he dated Jennifer Grey? All I kept hearing through the entire book was \\"pity me I'm so stressed\\" and \\"Clinton's my way too the top\\".

Stephanopoulos is nothing but an arrogant opportunist and this book offers no new insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"hail to the turncoat!","review":"for all of his professions about honesty lacking in Washington DC i find it rather ironic that George Stephanopolous spends much of this book ratting out anyone he ever came into contact with. Despite his feelings for the president he should have kept his mouth (and his laptop) shut because for right or wrong Clinton made him what he is today. His ego is larger than the entire Government and i could not stand his whinning about how he burning himself out. This book is a search for vindication against those whom he feels have wronged him and a private pity party for himself. i gave this book one star because, despite my feelings for him, the puncuation is at least correct and consistant throughout the book.

George tells nothing new of Clinton's administration. Nothing of value politically wise.Not much of his life except that his family was proud of him. It seems he was only obsessed with hatred for Dick Morris. I can't even say much about the book because there wasn't much of a book to review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. This really showed a more personal, human side of the White House. The part at the end about passing Medicare was terribly boring, but the rest was a+ quality.

This book is excellent for anyone interested in politics but needs it watered-down with a little bit of a personal touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff.","review":"To me this book is basically the story of a guy's tough times at work. It has lots of nice anecdotes. Very readable. Not especially idealogical, not too nasty either. It is easy to relate to George's high stress gig. There is a picture of him with a beard, which he grew to cover up anxiety related skin problems. That is the level of honesty we are dealing with here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good if somewhat flawed read","review":"The author has been credited with being too naive (or just sanctimonious) about his entree into the world of White House politics. Some of his background information is a bit too self-serving (e.g., many people from his high school have attended Columbia in recent decades), however, once he reaches the White House the story becomes riveting. Unfortunately, near the end, we get too much pettiness and not enough insight and the book just seems to \\"poop out\\". Still and all, many useful insights into the workings of the White House and the pressures it places on Presidential staff to be reasonably honest and public spirited."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a self-serving bunch of subtle lies and half truths.","review":"True to my perception of this little weasel as seen on TV, this book is a totally self-serving, ill-disguised pro-Clinton tome.

It was a waste of time and merely a weak attempt to defend the Clinton adminsitration. Stephanopoulos conveniently forgets any problems or dishonesty in the administration.

If you want to read the life of the saints, go to the religious section of Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to be learned","review":"Yet another how-I-lost-my-innocence book from someone who spent years spinning lies, only to be *shocked* to discover there was gambling in the club!Stephanoplous, who spent his career spinning lies and rumors for Clinton, expects us to believe that he suddenly discovered that something was rotten in Denmark. The truth seems to be more that he was being eased out of the center of power in the later Clinton years as the kids were fired and more professional career politicians were brought in to handle the damage control for a reckless president."},{"rating":"1","title":"All too Human","review":"In the beginning I was fascinated, and then the more I read the madder I got. The only thing larger than Geoge Stephanopolous' ego is is EGO. In the end I was glad that I took it out of the local library, thus depriving him of any royalties.At times I felt he was redeeming himself only always to have him be Clinton's apologist. Mr. Stephanopolous is a Socialist who will go to any length to get his views to the highest places."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information, too whiney","review":"I found this book to be a great disappointment. I expected some inside information, something new. I believe anyone with access to the NY Times could have written this book.

Having had a year of a real math book this year I am finally able to realize just how stupid the book was. It treats the student like he or she is about two years old, does not provide the information necessary for exam review, and is far too colloquial in general. In addition, it has no answers in the back, just \\"Hints\\" in the back of the book that either do nothing at all to help or solve the problem completely without explanation.

This is absurd and asinine, especially the concept of group based learning - where the smart student gets the answers and everyone else copies, and learns nothing.This book provides no reference, no way of teaching deductive logic, and the first chapters have no bearing on proper Euclidian geometry at all.

Hansen's album was the strongest of all the recordings. Most of his material is regards to life in the Mid-West, particularly Minnesota. Being 15 years old, not the material holds up, but most of his jokes about the people, weather, and food of the region are still pretty funny. It's not the most intellectual humor, but it's good folksy kind of material that Jeff Foxworthy fans would appreciate, albeit a bit dirtier.

Also some allusion to the controversy in archaeological circles about conservation of the sites vs tourism might be in order. Given this is an audio version of a Time/Life book that's probably too much to ask.

It is clear-headed and honest, with a quirky sense of humor. You feel as if the author is an old friend. He definitely is a rock and roll American with an Afgan soul. His experiences of living in Afganistan as a child and his later trip back to the Islamic world is both enlightening and completely engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book about an important topic","review":"I have read a large number of books on religions and about the Middle East. This is easily the best. Ansary writes compellingly about his personal history, his insights into Islam and militant Islam, and the politics of Islam. As I read this book, I was moved to laughter almost as often as to tears, and virtually every emotion in between. In particular, Ansary's insights into how Islamic terrorists became so important in recent years are well worth the cost of the book and the time spent reading it.Perhaps the best way to put it is that, no sooner had I finished the last page than I turned to the front and started reading it again. And I had to tear myself away, even though I read this book in just a few sittings! Very compelling reading - a wonderful story told with compassion, sensitivity, and insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"West of Kabul, East of New York: An Afghan American Story is a good read.","review":"A friend who is working in Kabul suggested that I read this book.

It's a quick read and worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Look a the Real Afghanistan","review":"Any book or film that provides me with new and compelling perspective on something that matters is well worth my time. This memoir by Tamim Ansary does that, and he's a talented writer to boot! The changes in Afghanistan in Ansary's lifetime are remarkable. Some of my favorite sections include his travel back to the Middle East and the people he meets along the way. His description of the way the events of 9-11 affected him and spurred him to action opened some new avenues of thought for me. I have selected this book as part of summer reading for my high school seniors this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Revealing Book About Two Cultures","review":"I've read other books about the Taliban and so forth, but if you want to get some idea of Afghan people and society in basic human terms--in terms that most Americans (like me) can really understand--then this is the book I'd recommend. Ansary's life has bridged the cultures, and he's able to talk about both America and Afghanistan with insight and compassion. One fascinating irony is that Ansary's younger brother went back to the Middle East where he advocates for the Muslim fundamentalist view. It's things like that which make this author different from a lot of others and able to write a book that goes beyond demonizing or defending ways of living to more fundamental truth. At the same time, I think that Ansary has worked harder than most of us to articulate what he sees and thinks. This is also, by the way, a beautifully written book, full of humor and often amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.

He questioned what he was doing, what Israel was doing, and what the future would bring.Johnathon unwittingly wrote this book - not knowing that his personal letters would become the basis for this book.I read this book over 5 years ago, and it is testament to the power Johnathon held that I can still recall these things from memory.Top notch.

Many consider this film to be truly frightening, and a classic of the horror genre, but I feel that true horror in a movie comes mostly in the suspense. Not in the horrific actions the monsters ARE engaging in, but the wondering of what exactly will those actions be, and when and where will they occur. A few slap dash moments of glowing eyes folllowed by a quick murder or two don't add up to horror for me.

He has the deep humanity and vision to rule all of us like the enlighten way he has ruled over MicroSoft. Long Live the King! This book is a true insight to what we should all wake up and act upon. Why do people fight William Gates? Is it because they envy his will power and excelent windows operating system? I think so, and he is to much of a gentel person to shove this fact in their face. With William Gates as the gentle king of our little world we could all be thrilled to be conected to the super information data highway.

Number one - he created the operating system that powers the microcomputer. Today, we all share either the desire or the reality that this computer should be in our homes. And they are. It is estimated that over one hundred million people in America today have personal computers in their home. Over ninety-five percent of them are operating Windows Operating Systems. Bill Gates owns a majority share of the company that innovated the creation of this infrastructure of not-only how-to where computers are going in the future, they also innovated the new Internet culture. It is my advice that you read this publication so you may have an understanding of how America's visionary thinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Gates - the inventor of the inter net!","review":"I learned a lot from this book. Mr. Gates, the inventor of the computer and the internet gives his thoughts about the future of business. In the future, toasters won't burn our toast unless we want them to. In the future, we won't have to think because Microsoft will do the thinking for us. Microsoft will download their new OS onto our computer and bill us instantly.

In the strip, the boss repeats phrases and sentences as if it were a foreign language, and becomes gradually more confident with verbose, quasi-technical jargon. This was the first thing I thought of while listening to this book.If you are looking to study management-speak as a foreign language, _Business @ The Speed of Thought_ is likely to be the next best thing to a Berlitz course. Otherwise, it's a completely unremarkable business book that has a bit of future prophecy.

I usually don't bother reveiwing a bad book, but I think you ought to know what you're getting into here.The setup at the beginning is remotely beneficial as internet scope/impact primer. It goes down hill from there. Bill's main point is that the internet and PC combination is powerful. While that is hardly a revelation, the book never goes anywhere from there. Over half of this book is overly simplistic examples of successful PC/Windows implementations. There is no practical 'take home' information here. Nothing to apply.This book suffers from several maladys: 1. There is nothing novel here. 2. The prose is really boring. 3. Half the book is pointless examples - (they all make the same point) 4.

You're not missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making it simple","review":"Discussing the digital flow of information in a company would sound to some like a horrible book to read. Not so, with this book. Gates finds simply analogies to explain why the flow of communication is so important and how managing electronic information can be made not only efficient, but simple. His enthusiasm comes through clearly as he reveals not only his twelve steps to manage digital information, but also the practical applications of flow management. I found this book easy to understand and very helpful at pointing out ways to better manage my own email and the ways I communicate information to committees and employees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to the obvious!!","review":"If you think you knew everything about the internet, Bill confirms it. A book about what has been, and the future that everybody already talks about.

He did it with windows, word, excel, explorer and now with this book. If you really like to know what the net possibilities are, buy \\"Customers.com\\" from Patricia B.

It is after all by a person considered a thought leader by many. Unfortunately it seems more like a book written to take advantage of Bill Gates' big draw name, with nothing new or insightful in it.I would be quite embarrassed to put my name on this book. It basically tries to put forward a fancy framework for corporate and global networks. In other words, the internet, something Microsoft famously completely missed the boat on and is still to this day trying to catch up on. Don't waste your time or your money, other than as a lesson in how corporates often completely miss the forest for the trees, especially when they own a very lucrative monopoly on a small piece of a much bigger picture.There's nothing new or insightful here.

Much of what is stated is co-opted from others, much is clever restatement, and much is an MS commercial. These are the good parts of the book. The rest of the content (a very small portion thereof) is filled with a scattering of implied 'nuggets' of Gates wisdom -which, by the way, are probably wrong. He created a great OS platform, but ultimately I think that gives him little insight into what the future of technology is; and the quicker he moves out of the OS software arena, the quicker MS is going to see its downfall.

For instance, the Japanese did not cave Detroit's head in because they had more computers and infrastructure, as Bill would have you believe. They had better business and engineering practices.

It is also a really good history of tarot that is well-documented. What he has done, essentially, is to collect similar mythological ideas under the the tarot cards to which they relate. The work not only demonstrates the similarities of most mythologies and religions but it tends to underscore Jung's assertion that the characters of these pantheons are really \\"archetypes\\" which we all share.

And I know that Pitchfork gave this album an 8.5 out of 10. And I know that they called this album a \\"grower\\". And I know that that implies that those of us who \\"don't get it\\" will be called shortsighted and unfeeling ignoramuses. But there's not much to this album. Nothing has the Rock and Roll energy on this record that is found on \\"Gimmie Fiction\\", \\"Kill the Moonlight\\", or \\"Series of Sneaks\\". But maybe that's what they were going for... Maybe their idea of becoming more experimental this year means lilting around on half hearted riffs and singing words that are entirely replacable over and over again. If that's the case, then yes, this album is experimental, but I hope that for their next release they get back their Rock and Roll sensibility and put out something Good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album and Store","review":"Killer album delivered DRM free from a worthy new competitor to iTunes.

So I've only listened to this a couple of times, but it's not hitting me--and I've heard the songs before because I've seen Spoon recently--and awesomely--in concert a couple of times. But this sounds like Spoon \\"lite\\" or a band trying to be Spoon but doesn't have the spark.

These 15 episodes were initially sold in two sets for $59.98 each, which means many people paid double the price for this set. The contents and bonus material will be the same, however this set will contain 4 single-sided discs instead of the double-sided discs that were released in the first sets. This is another sign that Universal is (finally!!) moving away from the problematic DVD-18s (double-sided, dual-layered) discs that consumers have been complaining about.

Throughout the experience of reading it, I couldn't help but feel absolutely enthralled by it. A year ago I spent 10 months living in Warsaw, Poland teaching English. I was able to travel to the beautiful city of Krakow on several occasions. John Beckman's accurate look at Krakow and Polish people is reason enough to buy the book. Even though the novel itself is fiction, Beckman is extremely accurate when describing Krakow. The unique thing about this book however, is Beckman's ability to create for the reader a city brewing with sexual intrigue and hidden dangers from a traditionally medieval city. Mr. Beckman chooses to stray away from the \\"traditional\\" sense of Krakow and instead opt for a more adventurous thriller. I reccomend this book to anyone interested in Eastern Europe and all the wonderful suprises it has to offer.

Whatever ones political outlook one cannot doubt the courage and conviction of Degrelle or the men he led. That he survived so much carnage and the vengence of his enemies at the end is remarkable. That he then went on to build a successful life for himself and his family in exile in Spain and produce such a memorable account of his experiences we should be thankful for. The book stays with the subject after a brief introduction about the author's background. The experiences of the Wallonians begins in 1942 and ends with Degrelle and two survivors in May 1945.

It is fascinating that she can have grasp of complexity and adaptive systems, but not be able to see that the U.S.S.R. failed precisely because it lacked the primary ingredient of complex adaptive systems, namely freedom to innovate.

With such an excellent film industry, India should have something like the Library of Congress restoration project as in the U.S. Pyaasa is moving, the music wonderful, the acting heart-wrenching, but this transfer is tragically inferior."},{"rating":"2","title":"positive and fast","review":"I had read most of this book from the library, but wanted to add it to my own library. It arrived in pristine condition and quickly. My mistake, I did not pay attention to the cover enough. I virtually never order paperback, but it was my mistake. I just will have to buy another one, hopefully in as fine a condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibbon did it better","review":"This book is warmed over Gibbon. The thesis of the book can be best summed up as nasty Christians and their squabbles led to the Dark Ages and the eclipse of reason for a thousand years. Gibbon had the same argument and delivered it with a style, alas, that Mr. Freeman does not approach. Of course the thesis is completely wrong. The ancient world was in an intellectual dead end long before Christianity came on the scene. It was the much maligned Middle Ages that produced the intellectual trends that led humanity, for better and worse, to surpass in many ways the intellectual accomplishments of the ancient world. This book represents history on a comic book level, and contains a fair amount of Christian bashing. Polemics make poor history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Response to Mr. Freeman","review":"Mr. Freeman's response posted here is no more than extended Renaissance and Enlightenment sophistry if not out and out bad will against Christianity and specifically the Catholic Church and Catholic Tradition. So this has all been argued before and in spite of the mischief caused over the centuries, it doesn't seem to ever deliver a knock out punch as is perhaps desired. Pope John Paul II's encyclical, Faith And Reason, alone, trumps Mr. Freeman's thesis. And, by the way, with the election of Benedict XVI (Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger), you will see even more examples of the marriage of faith and reason, faith and art, faith and education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real history","review":"While this book will not be for everyone it is still very well researched and written. For anyone who has a serious interest in the origins of the Bible and Christianity it is probably a must read. It covers the ground from the early Greeks through the Romans and beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchboard product","review":"As far as the professional response from the company goes, it would rate five stars. The product was very well packaged, and delivery was quite rapid. The cost was small enough that no one is going to get very bruised. However, I thought the product was really really poor. So bad, in fact, I placed 11 of the 12 sheets in the garbage, completely untouched. They are so thin that they are effectively unworkable as a \\"scratch\\" media. I ended up making my own scratchboard by applying two coats of dry wall mud over plywood, sanding the surface smooth, and painting black ink over the surface. This worked magnificantly... But it is alot of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scratch Art Boards","review":"These boards are fantastic. The ink is applied evenly and when the proper tools are used - the results are beautiful. These boards are great for older children and adults. I am thinking a professional might like these as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice TV show in VCD quality.","review":"I'm very happy if the Digi-Pack arrived today but the happiness was not long. I put in the first DVD and saw the catastrophe. The master of this show is good but the DVD-label made a very very poor encoding. Every scene with faster movements or explosions are blocking and pixeling like a bad VCD before 10 years. That's not the way to sell a very good action tv show.My own recordings from the german tv are better and has a Mbps of 5.000 or a little more in peaks. This original digi-pack has a Mbps of 3.500.Please ignore this bad quality digi-pack, so we can hope of a better release by a better label.The tv show self are a 5 stars action show in my opinion.In the future it will be better if more customers wrote about the dvd quality and not the quality of shows or films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to make people step outside their little boxes","review":"I grew so weary of reading books the pushed aside parental instinct and went with that was popular. Thank you their is a book that portrays a mother who goes by instinct and by what her children need.Hygeia Halfmoon does not hide how she feels or how she lives. congrats on that. so many people are quick to judge because they are most likely to afraid to step up to the plate. Up until maybe 50-60 years ago, primal parenting was how we lived.I love this book and highly recommend it to primal parents who aren't afraid to give their kids the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Mama!","review":"I can't say that I agree with everything in the book (what a boring world if we all agreed!) but I love that she puts her children first, follows her mothering instincts, and that she busts the myth that you have to have lots of money and lots of products in order to have healthy, happy children. In my case, she's preaching to the choir, but I found it inspiring. That said, I really was bugged by all the plugs. Every time I saw bold print, I thought \\"Here we go.\\" I realize she's both trying to make a living and a difference, but to me it messed up the flow of the book - stick a catalog at the end, and leave out the commercials. Still, a very good message - keep your babies close, eat well, and follow your bliss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I'm an AP'er, homebirther, extended breastfeeder, etc and i thought I'd love this book but i did not! Although I agree with Hygeia's belief that mothers must be with their children, I don't think its the job of the govt to see that this can happen. Its up to us as enterprising parents to make it happen. Taking hand outs is not the example that I want my child to see. She recommends in her chapter on going to a raw food diet fasting your babies!! She suggests that we not feed our babies in order to cleanse their systems!! I was shocked! Its one thing to choose a radical lifestyle for yourself but to impose this on your child, when it may not be the healthiest choice is wrong in my opinion.This book really turned me off. I found her to be way to proud of what she is doing and rather judgemental in tone towards those who choose differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible rip off","review":"In all honesty this third book felt rushed, like Tanith Lee was told to spit out another book solely for the monetary value and to heck with the quality. The Red Unicorn seemed to rip off parts and basic premise from the Wizard of Oz, Alice In Wonderland and the Labyrinth all in one fell swoop. Tanaqil behaves like an angsty, whiny teenager in response to her difficulties in life, a direct contrast to her behavior in the first two books. I was left at the end of the book with a raised eyebrow and had to confirm that yes this was the same author for the same series I had so dearly loved in the earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most dropped calls","review":"I recently moved to Cingular from Verizon due to better phone selection, and what a big mistake! I constantly got dropped calls not to mention network busy error msg. So I decided to return everything, yet that's when the real problem began. Although I used only 10 days of service, they charged me ridiculous amt of $500. I had to fight over to get some money back, yet still ended up paying 130 at the end. I thought Spring billing was bad- think again. Their CSRs also weren't too helpful as I had to make multiple calls to cancel my service. They have my lowest ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST TERRIBLE","review":"I have a Dell xps with 1024 ram, windows XP pro and 120 GB.

The enclosed software did not display properly; though, a download of EarthLink's co-branded MusicMatch software fixed the interface problem. The promised three month trial of MusicMatch MX Gold using the User ID and Password supplied on the CD envelope resulted in nothing: no trial period, no upgrade to CD quality sound from MusicMatch Radio and no access to MusicMatch MX ArtistMatch. I had been pleased with the free MusicMatch Jukebox software, even with its limitations; I am very unsatisfied with the buggy software and false promises of the purchased software.UPDATE: Worked with MusicMatch customer service to try to correct my issues. Although they were very pleasant, they were not able to figure out how to offer the three month trial period to MusicMatch MX Gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be weird, now its fine!","review":"Modification now that I've downloaded version 10. I'd give it 4 stars but I can't change my rating in editing my old review.Works fine! I upgraded to the full featured version for better ripping and burning speeds and am happy. They fixed the CPU hogging problem and though the interface is a little different from that used in Windows and Realplayer and it doesn't do video or sound editing (where you can edit your tracks - try RipEditBurn if you need that) MusicMatch is now my preferred player and ripper-burner. I used to use RealPlayer but Realplayer corrupts their own music database and seems to take forever and use up gobs of CPU to do simple things.Version 9: was barely ok. Try free download of version 10 now - much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disables your burner!","review":"I purchased this because of it's claim to create mp3 files from virtually any source. OK, fine! Actually, the recording aspect of this software does work as advertised. You can easily record from other CD's, mp3 files, or just about anything connected to the \\"Line In\\" jack of your sound card.However, try to burn any of this to a CD and you may discover - as I did - that your system no longer recognizes your burner. Not only from within Musicmatch, but from any application that previously worked. My burner does not appear as a drive letter anymore even from within \\"My Computer\\". Tech support (you can't call them - you must send an e-mail) said that their driver was conflicting with the Roxio software I also have installed. They suggested that I uninstall Roxio, then re-install Musicmatch. I did, but still had the same problem.I have no choice but to now do a system restore from within XP, and then try to get a refund for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with all Dell computers","review":"I have a Dell XPS with a CDRW and DVD+RAM.

Tech support did notrespond to my help request from their online website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Product!!!","review":"On September 29, 2003 Musicmatch released version 8.1 of their product and in December, 2003 they released version 8.2. The retail box says \\"New V8\\" and it turns out it's 8.00.010 which is two levels behind. Even though you just bought the software Musicmatch wants an additional fee to get to the current level (8.2) of Jukebox Plus! You can get the current Jukebox Plus level by loading the Jukebox Basic for free from the Musicmatch website and then paying the upgrade to Jukebox Plus (and you'd be at the current level instead of two levels back). So don't waste $29.99 for the retail version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MusicMatch","review":"I agree with all the other reviews. The ONLY reson I bought Musicmatch was for super tagging feature.

I really don't know what you buy when you buy this software? I mean who dosen't have a media player. itunes/Windows Media Player etc...? (What's the best alternative? Anyone?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Features expire unlees you pay more money","review":"I was very disappointed to find that some of the nice features such as supertagging expire. You don't really buy this product, you lease it. This is a nasty practice that was abandoned years ago by reputable software developers. Don't buy it unless you are willing to pay over and over again for the same features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it in the long run","review":"I have had MusicMatch since 1.0, and have decided to call it quits. As a player and CD ripper it is good. I would not purchase anything from them anymore from their MusicMatch download, they copyright everything and expect you to log on all the time when you play the songs you paid $1 for. Plus do not expect anything from their OnDemand, you cannot transfer it to anything else to play.The big kicker is that they let you buy WMA files and you cannot burn them to your CD, and of course with protection you cannot turn these into MP3s. At least if you paid for it, you should be able to burn it. Meanwhile real hacks out there can and they did not pay for them.Their software downloads do not support Win2K past 9.0 They are on 10.0"},{"rating":"1","title":"what once was a solid app is now complete trash","review":"I used to have the version 7.x of this program.

The arms and legs are not \\"spandex\\" material as it appears - it's all fleece, and not nearly as cute. Do a web search for the squirt costume and you'll find the fleece one out there.

I highly recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Zimmerman's Stupid Staging","review":"Lots and lots of beautiful music, as other reviewers describe in detail. Some also describe Mary Zimmerman's poor staging, but I was so disgusted I had to issue a warning:Amateur Night at the Met.Costumes and sets are crude, clumsy, cheap looking, and ugly, ugly, ugly. Staging is awkward, arch and trying to be clever when it is simply stupid.Opera fans are used to poor productions, but this one is an especially pretentious disgrace.If I've exaggerated, maybe some readers can find it better than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully staged, beautifully song, beautifully transferred to DVD","review":"I am not a Rossini expert, but I enjoy opera and I enjoyed this performance. Renee Fleming did not just stand and sing, but fully engaged in the character. Her character's joys and anguish are clear. Her performance was very athletic. The staging was fun and the video was nicely directed -- The colors were clear, there was little distraction by inappropriate pans or shots of the orchestrata during dramatic stage scenes. Issuing this in Blu Ray to get the better sound would have been nice. I still don't understand why the MET records these in high definition and then issues standard DVDs. I wish I could have seen this opera live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastical","review":"It is very obvious why Renee Fleming revived this relatively obscure Rossini opera. It is a tour de force for the leading lady and Ms Fleming gives a bravura performance in the starring role. She is ably supported by the rest of the cast, especially Lawrence Brownlee as Rinaldo. While Armida is not a great opera, it is a very enjoyable. The Metropolitan Opera's whimsical minimalist staging of the opera emphasized the fantastical elements of the proceedings making it all the more entertaining. I especially liked the ending when Rinaldo is leaving the island and Armida is literally being pulled between a cherubic \\"Love\\" and a monstrous \\"Vengeance.\\" All in all, this is great fun and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!!","review":"One of my all-time favorite performances.

Steriotyping and popular topics are more of a concern then how they figure out a case. You people who like this, enjoy your fantasy land with terrible actors. So those who like a mystery with sense. Look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fourth Season, better than I'd remembered","review":"I came very close to not purchasing this dvd. The last episode of the season struck me as a disappointment, and a few of the later episodes seemed entirely too glib for my taste.Having viewed the entire season once again, there's more to love here than I'd remembered.This season was actually longer than typical, the first few episodes of the year are actually on the season 3 dvd, and since they serve to wrap up that season's major story line, it works nicely, but the episodes in the season 4 set do make a coherent arc of their own.Editing to add: This set doesn't have a separate menu for scene selection. Not a huge problem, but I did notice the lack of it, which seems to indicate it's a feature I like to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite series","review":"I've been hooked on this show since it started! The choice of shows from the season is good. I enjoy watching it during cold winter nights to see if I can remember the details:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible fan that is whisper quiet","review":"I have installed this fan and am very happy with the performance so far. The cheap fan we replaced this with was so noisy we couldn't watch television in our adjoining bedroom when it was on, this fan is so quiet that you can't tell if it is on when the water is running in the shower. This should give you an idea of how quiet this fan is.Update: Two years later and the fan is still as quiet as a whisper and operating perfectly"},{"rating":"2","title":"an eye opener","review":"14 year old Alma lives in war torn Sarajevo. The orphaned and homeless children become family for each other and live in the abandoned Hotel Sarajevo. It is a tough town where people live in basements in fear of bombs and avoid streets like Sniper Alley.However, amongst all the carnage and destruction, there is hope in their numbers and youth. For a time. Once the gang leader begins to feel despair, the group falters under his lead and try to find their own way out of the hell that has become their home.Very moving book of the youth of a town whose home and lives are crushed before their eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that moves your heart!","review":"I am 16 years old and loved this book. It shows you how diffult and trying life can be. I feel that the fact that the whole story is told through Alma's eyes and imagination makes it much more effective. You don't need to know all of the facts to realize how horrible the whole thing was. This book was very hard to put down, and gave you a sense of how powerful love can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child's view of war","review":"This is the story of the war in Bosnia through the eyes of a 14 year old girl. It is very difficult to put down once you become involved in her world. Unfortunately, it does show it as it really is which is not always pleasant. 14 year olds in the US should read it to see how life can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better.","review":"I read the other reviews before purchasing and was hopeful this would work well but I can't justify giving this product any more stars because of the lack of quality. The adjustable size dispenser feature doesn't hold standard size glove boxes securely it tends to rattle a big unless you really pry on the two tabs which by themselves aren't enough.Second the cheap magnetic strips they use are too week to keep the dispenser in place while trying to pull a glove. Only after I went to Home Depot and bought two sets of neodymium magnets and two ton epoxied six to the back of this thing did it finally stick and stay anchored while pulling gloves. Secondly the metal thickness is so thin that when the frame flexes the epoxy was loosened. So if I have to do it again I'd probably use a pliable strong adhesive like pro-seal which would allow for flex.Then again if I had to do it again I wouldn't have bought this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"holds boxes tight, doesnt stick to anything","review":"I bought these for my gloves. Well, the magnets cant hold this up at any angle. I guess it might work for a half empty box of tissues but anything more than that the holder will fall off anything its on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item - it's functionally useless","review":"I just bought this item but should have heeded that last reviewer who stated that they've made a production switch and are now using cheap magnets.That is an understatement - these magnets are so weak if a fly lands on this dispenser it will slide down my toolbox.If I try to take a set of gloves out, it falls on the floor - this is totally useless for what it was bought for, i.e. to stick to the side of my toolbox and act as a glove dispenser.I emailed Lisle corporation asking for replacement magnets - to date NO ANSWERI would have bought the one from Harbor Freight but wanted black instead of bright red - too bad I didn't as those ones have strong magnets.Let my waste of money on this item serve as a warning to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT -- magnetic","review":"So disappointing. Couldn't get it to stick to anything. Otherwise, if you plan to mount it the 'spring' keeps a box of gloves firmly in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"Magnets DO NOT hold up..total crap for the price..had to glue it to the tool box for it to hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the original score---and not as effective","review":"As reviewers pointed out, this is not the original. I didn't know that when buying it, but upon hearing the first track, I knew I'd been duped. It is glaringly obvious that it was rerecorded, particularly on the opening theme---the creepiest melody in the entire score---that haunting little girl voice is completely mixed down and doesn't have the same quality as the original. And the entire sound quality of this CD is poor---VERY muffled. I'm so glad I still have my original crisp, clear vinyl copy of this soundtrack---which sounds better recorded onto CD than this miserable re-recorded reissue."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original...","review":"...not even \\"remastered\\" as Amazon states- it's RERECORDED and differs from the ORIGINAL soundtrack. Where the music is played well, it certainly isn't close to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheres the crunch??","review":"These are one the few protein bars that tastes decent.

Honestly though, I think drinking protein shakes made from powder is a cheaper, tastier, and more effective alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"arguably Faulkner's masterpiece...","review":"Read this book; Faulkner's extraordinary vision and attention to detail create a world so palpable it becomes a reality. In these stories he wrestles with experiments in language, images, and thematic issues. One of the greatest and most important books in our national literature, and in my opinion, arguably Faulkner's masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mumbly-Jumbly","review":"And, after the welcome respite of The Reivers and Soldier's Pay, we're back to the *real* Faulkner, the one who has weighty and interesting things to say, but buries them in page-long sentences and mumbly-jumbly stream-of-consciousness. I love the idea of this collection - eight distinct stories, all inter-related (kind of like the characters). And I especially enjoyed seeing Boon Hoggenbeck's beginnings in \\"The Bear.\\" But, as with so much of Faulkner, I just find that the sweat and blood of digging out the meaning of it all isn't worth the meaning once I actually find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Picture Words, Weak Story Line","review":"\\"Go Down , Moses\\" was formed out of the melding of a series of short stories into a novel about the McCaslin family of Jefferson, Mississippi. Extending through the life of Ike McCaslin, his youthful experiences help him to later face a crucial test about his family's legacy. The complex racial relations of Faulkner's novels introduce the reader to a world which most of us could never understand or even imagine.Like other Faulkner novels, I find the dialogue and stream of consciousness to be the most alluring qualities of the book. The thoughts of the characters, the descriptions of the scenes and the dialogues paint mental pictures of the action in which the reader can feel himself to be a part.I had a bit of trouble following the story line, but the descriptions mentioned above carry the book. Faulkner is a magician with the pen. For that, this book is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works in my existing alarm system","review":"I was looking for a replacement magnetic reed contact for my existing alarm system. The contact needed to be closed when the magnet is engaged (door is closed) and open if the magnet is moved away (door is open).

Most of the people mentioned are from the late 60's and early 70's. If you are not from that era you may have a tough time relating to the people mentioned. Overall still very entertaining as no one does insult better than Rickles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best from Rickles","review":"Maybre I expected too much, but the comedy and style were not the best of Don Rickles. Maybe its just me-maybe I'm just a hockey puck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, boring material, not his best","review":"This CD has moments, but for the most part, it's not vintage Rickles. Rickles can really bring down the house at times, and you only get a hint of what he can do on this CD. Rickle's improteau comments on people in the crowd or roasts work much better than these phony interviews. I'd like to find the best Rickles material out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This would be a better and more funny if this were a dvd instead of a cd.People like to see comedians"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Episode of the Series","review":"Mac & Dennis: Manhunters is the funniest episode of It's Always Sunny.

Very tedious. Charlie Day is too much sometimes, and tends to get annoying.I love the show, but these two episodes magnify its flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest shows I have ever seen.","review":"Season 4 does not disappoint. The very first episode of this series I ever saw was the \\"human meat\\" episode from season 4. I had already heard of this show with Danny Devito (whom I love) but had never seen it. I was immediately hooked and have since bought every season up to date and am currenrtly enjoying season 5 Thursdays at 10:00 on FX. I have also made it my mission to turn everyone I know onto this crazy wildly funny series. It's a little gem. The \\"Billboard\\" and the \\"Critic\\" episodes are the stand out episodes of season 4. But one of the funniest moments is Sweet Dee in the shoe store in the \\"Who Pooped the Bed?\\" episode. Kaitlin Olsen is a talented comedienne and should be right up there with the greats. I can see why Rob MacIlheney fell in love with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for shock value, and no McPoyles!","review":"I love this show, but the 4th season only had about 3 funny episodes. They seemed to look for the shock value this season, and the result was simply not funny. I thought the poop episode would be good, but it was lame. As Artemis went into her theory, about 1/3 of the way I simply lost interest because it was ridiculous and not clever. That seemed to sum up most of the episodes. Plus, the whole Charlie-waitress thing has been beaten to death. And not one episode with the McPoyles! They are the best extra characters on the show. I was very disappointed with this season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy. Rent or watch it on the internet","review":"I'm a huge fan of the show. However, I was very dissapointed with this boxset. For me, the dvd extras and commentaries are what makes a dvd worth owning. This season of Sunny has scant extras and is not worth the purchase if all you want is to watch the episodes. Nowadays if you only want the episodes you can watch them on Hulu or DVR them. Compared to the previous seasons dvd's whoever put this one out added no content to justify the price. This is a great show and I highly recommend it, but if you want to watch the entire season or just catch yourself up on certain episodes save yourself $20 and rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear of this season, check out the first three instead.","review":"If I had seen this season before any of the others I probably would of been a bit amused; however the best way I can put it is that this season is just a crappy version of season 3. Alot of jokes from previous seasons were rehashed and most of the new ones fell flat. I love this show, but I hated this season. Here's hoping for a brighter sun next season."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY FROM THIS PERSON!!","review":"I never received the item I purchased!!!I filed a claim with Amazon and they refunded me within a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO FUNNY!!!!!","review":"If you are not watching this show, you're missing out! This is my favorite new show out over the last few years. I wish I could be a member of \\"The Gang\\".

I use it for homebrew, and after using about 10 times, I wish I would have ponied up a little more money for a higher end mode. But for $30, I can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"This was just as it appeared and was described. The stainless braided hose was a nice addition. It worked perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hot, dirty, and dangerous","review":"I bought the SP1 jet cooker as an addition to my homebrewing equipment. I cannot recommend this cooker. It probably will give you the most bang for your buck as it has decent wind protection and will heat 9 gallons of water to 170 very quickly, but that is the only redeeming quality. The paint on this model is not high-temp. It will burn and peel off very quickly, which means soon you'll have to deal with rust. It is also very, very loud. I use this in my garage with the door open and have to shout over it. Lastly, despite going through and tightening everything back down, I have twice had a fire start where the hose meets the burner due to gas leaking out. Spend a little more and get the SP10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple but gets the job done","review":"Review after second use:I cannot recommend this product. It created a huge safety issue. I had the propane hose in a straight line to the tank with no tension in the hose. The tank was about 3/4 of the hose length away from the cooker. The hose appeared to be in good repair and not kinked. After about 10 minutes of being on the propane hose caught fire. The result was the hose burning off the cooker. I was able to shut off the propane with no other incident but there is a flaw of some kind here. Here is the attached result: [...]Initial Review:I purchased this burner to make 5 gallon batches of beer. It was pretty cheap but it outputs enough heat to boil water in pretty short order. The one downside is I wish they would either have not painted it or used heat resistant paint. The paint peeled off after the first use. It didn't affect much but it was annoying as I had to clean my patio after each use for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"Failed right out of the box. Regulator was bad. I have owned several gas cookers and this is junk. Did not look closely at box but it appears to be another quality item fom China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned the item","review":"When I got the product I was very disappointed in how the burner mechanism worked. The hose hooked to a tube that had a brass fitting on the end with a small hole in it that the flame came out of. The brass fitting was not secure so the flame could have been directed i any direction. It should have been locked in place so the flame would go straight up the tube to the deflector. I returned this item and bought a cooker from Sam's Club that has an actual burner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for the price","review":"I'm giving this Jet Cooker a 4 star review because of the paint. It works perfectly, but before the first use you should run it on it's highest setting with the flame spreader over the flame to burn off the paint. After I finished burning it for approximately 10 minutes, I took a wire brush and finished off most of the paint that would contact the flame. It will happen no matter how it's used so it would be better that paint chips don't end up in your food. The unit is a little loud on it's highest setting, but what do you expect when you buy a \\"jet\\" cooker. It is kind of implied. Overall I am happy with my purchase and will be using this cooker to boil some wort for my homebrews for a long time to come. Also, after connecting the hoses, BE SURE to spray the connections down with soapy water to check for leaks prior to igniting the burner (which was easy enough with an extended grill lighter). I did not have any leaks but it is better to be safe than to be a burn victim!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my copy was bad","review":"I had a previous Bayou Classic that was really good so I didn't hesitate to order this one especially with the high ratings it got. Mine, unfortunately showed poor quality control. The venturi (jet burner) was crooked. If it had been misaligned in the other direction a quick turn of the threaded venturi would have solved the problem, but it was crooked the other way with no way to adjust it. The flame ran up one side of the barrel tube, hit one of the \\"clover leaf\\" supports and went up one side of my wok causing uneven heating of the wok. Judging from the number of good reviews this must not be a common problem, but it is enough to turn me off of this model and brand. I'm sending it back and ordering a camp chef."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 out of 2","review":"I bought 2 of these for a large shrimp boil. While they performed admirably, one of them came with what I would guess is a pin hole in a weld on the gas line. It still worked, but there was an intermittent flame that would come out from under the burner towards the ground.By the time we noticed it there was too much heat to try and pinpoint it exactly. Other than the extra flame they were both worth the money, I would definetely recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable burner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Stove","review":"Very simple, and very hot stove. I use it for group camping on river float trips, and find it a bit bulky, but the convenient is worth it. To be able to quickly boil a LARGE pot of stew, potatoes, spaghetti and anything else while tripping makes camping great."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be pleased!","review":"I bought this primarily to do full 5 gallon wort boils, but just recently used it for a New England boil. It brought the liquid (about three gal or so) to a boil in a hurry...I didn't time it but it wasn't more than a few minutes. Very easy to use. Flame control with the valve was a snap. Like others have said, the paint will cook off the first time you use it, so don't be alarmed. The design easily held my 35 quart pot and is sturdy enough to accommodate one much larger. For bringing large quantities of liquid to boil very quickly AND safely, you will be pleased with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Hot-blooded","review":"Pretty disappointed with this, for over $5, it's just a few short paragraphs that didn't tell me anything new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great brush for the price","review":"Great brush.

The problem with this cd is her scating. I'm not a fan of scating. I am moreof a traditonal jazz fan. I love smooth jazz that is performed straight.I am a recording engineer and with my knowledge of music and the help of my recording software I was able to save these songs.I was able to safely take out the un-necessay sacting and other things that I didn't like about this original recording.This is now a cd i'm proud to own. Baby, I did it my way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one from AoB!!","review":"Like many other Ace Of Base fans, I had been waiting for this album ever since their last one came out, and I was not disappointed at all! To get a good feel for this album, I suggest listening to \\"Unspeakable\\", \\"Change With The Light\\" and \\"Show Me Love\\". Regarding a comparison, it's hard to say which AoB album is the best, because they're all really great in their own way. I guess the very least I could say about Da Capo is that it's up there with every other AoB album, and that it's what I've come to expect from this group. If you own any other AoB albums, you should definitely add this to your collection - not just because you're a die-hard fan, but because it's GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ace is Back","review":"Finally, Ace of Base is back on the scene with their long awaited follow up to Cruel Summer/Flowers. I've been a fan ever since 1993's The Sign, and even though they aren't as big as they once were in America I'm still an avid fan. \\"Da Capo\\" is a fresh sound for Ace of Base, as they seem to be leaning more towards the pop genre. It is a great album to just put on and make you feel happy. Though my personal favorite is 1995's \\"The Bridge\\". I think the lyrics and music were much more personal and more meaningful. I definitely recommend \\"Da Capo\\" to any true Ace of Base fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They were better off da capo","review":"We all remember Ace of Base for they eurodance songs in the 90's, hits like \\"The Sign\\" \\"All that she wants\\" and \\"Don't turn around\\" but lately they have not had the same sound. The Eurodance more or less died out and they have been trying to do something new without much success. I don't know exactly what to cll this, but it sound more like pure pop to me. \\"Beautiful Morning\\" is allright, it's a notable song. \\"Da Capo\\" and \\"Unspeakable\\" are both allright but songs like \\"The Juvenile\\" were just made with lack of inspiration it seems, Ace of Base have reached their peak long time ago and it's kind of sad to see their decline with album's that they never would have produced around 10 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD - but don't buy it if you want to play it on a PC","review":"This CD is PC copy protected! I would have returned mine but I found out too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ACE OF BASE DOES IT AGAIN!","review":"Ace of Base once again delivers a picture perfect album. Da Capo marks the return to the traditional ace of base sound, which include dance, reggae and pop tunes. This album has it all. With tracks like Unspeakable, Remember the Words, Da Capo, and Hey Darling you will never want to stop listening. The Juvenile gives a darker moodier side to the album. But overall this CD is an upbeat great listen for those who want to have a great time listening to awesome music. If you want to hear pop at its best get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!!!! WORTH THE WAIT!","review":"It's been over 4 years since Ace of Base released their last full length album of new material.... and it's been an extremely long 4 years! They FINALLY return to show the world that they are stronger and better than ever. While the songs may not be as deep as the tracks on \\"The Bridge\\" they definitely show a new side of themselves and continue to impress me. It's the best pop album i've heard in a very long time, straight up, fun, catchy, tunes. Ace of Base fans will not be disapointed and those of you looking for a great pop album thats not fake or fabricated should definitely check out this talented and dedicated group and their latest release! DA CAPO! ACE OF BASE IS BACK BABY!!!!!(i really hope this gets released in the USA... it's a lot better than the 'premade pop' we get)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Sound!","review":"I find it incredibly irritating when certain genres of music are assessed as too European for a US market. How narrow can one get! This usually results in \\"foreign\\" albums being edited in content (like AOB's third album) or not receiving a US version at all. To be honest, most music coming from the US, especially today's output is very bland and devoid of artistic quality yet considered the \\"in\\" thing. Come on...nothing beats the stuff such as AOB has to offer - this group just gets better and better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Ace of Base back again!","review":"I never expected to hear Ace of Base sounding in this form again! It's been a long way since the times of Happy Nation(1993) and the Bridge, even more so that they had drastically changed their image and sound to more destinct Pop after these records. De Capo, as it's name represents, takes you back to their old sound and it sure doesn't let you down!! The songs such as 'Unspeakable', 'De Capo' and 'Whats the name of the Game' are Electro-Pop fueled songs, Compossed with musical minds filled with new ideas and a desire to to re-create Sweden's Ace of base, bringing the group into a new Millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Da Capo once again!!! Best Ace of Base Album","review":"This is the best Ace of Base album, it have great songs and production! We can hear the tipic ace of base sound but more modern! The wonderful ballads, \\"Ordinary Day\\" and \\"The Juvenile\\", pop reggae songs like \\"World Down Under\\", \\"Unspeakable\\", \\"What's The Name Of The Game\\", pop songs \\"Beautiful Morning\\" and \\"Hey Darling\\", Two covers \\"Show Me Love\\" and \\"Wonderful Life\\" and the powerful dance track \\"Da Capo\\" are a good reason to buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pop music from sweden","review":"I think Ace of base is one of the greatest bands from Sweden since Abba and Army of lovers.New album is mix of Happy Nation, The bridge and flowers and it works great!.My favourite song from the new album is What's the name of the game, it has great chorus and amazing pop sounds.also Da Capo, Unspeakable, World down under, Wonderful life and hey darling includes great chorus and great sounds.Best Ace of base album is still The bridge but this works out great!. Next single from the album will be Unspeakable which opens this album. Great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop album of 2002","review":"This album is creating a lot of buzz, even though it's only been released in few European countries. Title song from the album was played on Billboard radio in the USA, and imports are already selling well.Melodies are better than ever. Perfect pop rhythms are catchier than ever, and for the first time since their first album \\"The Sign,\\" Ace of Base have 4 or 5 songs on the album which are sure to be huge hits. Unspeakable has the catchiest chours of any song on the album, but what stands out on this alubm is their cover of Black's \\"Wonderful Life.\\" \\"Hey Darling\\" and \\"Change with the light\\" remind us what a talented music writers these sibilings are.Any other pop band in the world would die to have these 12 songs as their greatest hits collection. For Ace of Base, it's just yet another album. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic pop","review":"Ace of base are back! Well, at least in Europe for now... Record company must have had the hardest time deciding which single will be the first realease, because the album is filled with amazing songs. This is definetly Ace of Base's strongest outting to date. Beautiful Morning is already a hit across the Europe and it's not even the strongest track on the album.Without any exaggaration, this is definetly the strongest, and highest quality pop album of this new decade. If Ace of Base are ever to go back to #1, this is the album that will definetly take them there. Already receiving superb reviews across Europe, \\"Da Capo\\" is called -ace of base in their bestform.-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Design Guides","review":"I like the chapters on physical design and low-power.Specifically the design guides and tips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly poor content","review":"Should be entitled ASIC to ASIC.

This book was a very emotional book, but it wasn't a favorite of mine. I found a lot of what happened in the book either very disturbing or it doesn't seem to go with the times. Since when does \\"no\\" mean \\"yes drug me\\" and How could Katherine return to the \\"ton\\" with a baby and no recriminations??Everyone was ok with this?? I understand that this is a book so an author has the liberty to do what they will, but it was just a bit harsh to me. I still love JL and I still love her books. This just wasn't one of my favorites!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose Another Lindsey Book","review":"The characters in this book are interesting, but a little hard to believe. The main character, Lady Katherine, is kidnapped, drugged and basically assaulted by her admirer, a Russian Prince. Yet she amazingly overcomes this, and the fact that she is kept as a slave and is beaten by his aunt. It is trying to be a love conquers all sort of novel, but I personally don't think it conquers the stupidity and lack of human decency of the \\"hero.\\" Even when you try to shroud it in aphrodisiacs, it is still really what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"This book really GOT to me. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because this is Johanna Lindsey, and I usually love her books.So, let's get down to it, shall we? Some arrogant prince who is too cocky (yes, down there and up in the head, too) for his own good decides that the streets of London is a wonderful place to kidnap a sex slave, so he has Katherine plucked out of the street and brought to his pleasure. Since when did the streets of London become an open marketplace for sex slaves for Russian royalty? I wasn't aware that diplomacy extended THAT far, lol.This book was too much for me. I know Lindsey has a history of creating males who are gorgeous, strong, and wise (but also arrogant as heck), but usually the male has some qualities to redeem himself. I found Dimitri irritating and too sure of himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"give me the drug!","review":"one of the best JL story I've ever read. Though I am strongly against of pushing men's needs to women in matters so....you know what.....I find this story very funny and not so degrading to read. I love the heroine on how she did fight Dmitri in many ways. Yes. That is one of the ingredient of being a strong woman. Though she's not the best faces in the crowd, she got him in her strong characteristics/personalities. Go girl! AT least, you won't get disappointed that the heroine in this story is not much of a poor victim. She depicts the strong women today even though her time is far from us, our way of liberal thinking in matters of women rights. Good work JL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Effort","review":"I usually love Johanna Lindsay books but this was obviously a lazy effort on her part. The story was as boring as it was misogynistic. I only finished it out of curiosity to see if it could get any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was recommended on the basis that the heroine was not a beauty and had other quality characteristics that a reader would perhaps identify with. However, I found nothing appealing about the plot SPOILER why would I want to see myself in such a role where the \\"hero\\" drugs me more than once in order to have sex with me? What kind of issues would I have to want to live vicariously through this female character? Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly entertaining","review":"Secret fire is the first romance book i ever read.

I don't know, sometimes 'rape' that isn't really rape is sexy in romance novels but it was more like the heroine, Katherine, was debased cruelly. She was a proud, strong woman and the whole thing just seemed....sinful, I guess. I'm generally not too uptight but this book just had me shaking my head.Good examples of Lindsay are 'Warrior's Woman' and 'Prisoner of My Desire'.

And I've collected all of them well up until a few years ago when I've felt Ms. Lindsey lost some of her fire.What I particularly liked about this book was the fact that the heroine wasn't the raving beauty everyone expected the hero to fall in love with but he just adored her.Of course you can expect the usual Lindsey formula...boy meets girls...boy abducts girl...boy and girl falls in love...something comes between boy and girl...girl flees...girl has secret she keeps from boy when he comes to collect her."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"There are several Johanna Lindsey's that I love, but this isn't one of them. The concept is intriguing, and the writing style is fine, but the characters leave much to be desired. Both the man and the woman were so juvenile and contemptible that by the end of the book I just wanted it to be over. Kill them off or fall in love, it didn't much matter. And then there is also my own personal pet peeve: There was a powerful APHRODISIAC central to the plot. That always drives me crazy, because THERE IS NO SUCH THING. Overall this book struck me as monumentally stupid but not in a fun way."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the old books","review":"This books is not like her old books where the female and male character chemistry is so strong you could feel it. Katherine and Dimtri on the other hand agrued so much I dnt understand how they fell in love. The female was a shrew and man I just dnt know. The ending was rather quick. You give your readers 323 of agruing and drugged sex which i feel he should have did more often with her attitude, but only 3 pages of a quick ending pluzz.I have all of Mrs. Lindsey books but her last three has been a let down. So I'm done buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit our 11 month-old twins","review":"I was excited when I purchased this product. The image depicted a toddler, of what appeared to be a healthy size, wearing the bib. It looked like it would be much larger than it actually was. When we got the bibs the neck was so small and couldn't expand to fit our 20 pound boys without squishing them into it and making them cry. Needless to say we didn't make them cry; we just didn't use them. It was a waste of $20 or so to buy the two.

All guides by Eyewitness Travel are full of bright full-color pictures, useful travel tips, and are presented in a very simple and user-friendly manner. The heavy-weight paper on which they are printed makes them sometimes... well, heavy-weight. But worth purchasing nonetheless. The Italy guide is very extensive, giving you the history of each region, food and wine specialties, and many many more travel resources. I highly recommend their Top 10 series as well.

I don't know of any other travel book that gives you an actual visual tour of the country, in addition to a visual tour of its history, art, and culture. Other guides are better at providing specific recommendations for hotels, restaurants, etc., and you will need them. But this book gives you an actual \\"feel\\" for the country before, during, and after your trip. The length of this guide testifies to the supreme beauty, diversity, and depth of Italy.Both the photos, and expecially the drawings, are done with such skill and detail that you feel you are holding a piece of artwork in your hand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Book!","review":"I bought this more for my grandparents and they LOVED it!

Discovering this exceptional book has changed the travel experience. Why? The guide gives you a quick overview of all of the essentials, history and sites. The difference is the following: this guide provides the travellor with the 3-D picture of every important neighborhood, with many suggested walking tours, with each site numbered for additional detailed information on subsequent pages. The travellor misses nothing because full colored pictures assist in the discovery. No other information is needed including maps and museum pamphlets.

There aren't any directions to any of the places addressed in the book. And some of the places discussed would be impossible for the average person to go see on his/her own. I used Let's Go Italy as my travel guide for my 3-month italian excursion and it was the best! Yes, it wasn't without it's errors, but nothing too off the wall.

Would rate at 4.5 stars if allowed because of moderate awkwardness of holding these steady by youngsters while tracing outline. This is a result of small margins around multiple figures on smallish sheets, therefore I couldn't give 5 stars.

Reed performs his sad, sad album 'Berlin\\" for the first time ever. The sound quality surpasses the album because there is a girls' choir, a horn section and a string section to fill out the sound as well as two fine background singers. And the returnees are no slouches either. Guitarist Steve Hunter from the original album (and, incidentally, Reed's live album \\"Rock and Roll Animal\\") rips astonishing solo after solo like a true guitar hero, and also provides tasty fills and riffs when required. Reed himself plays better rhythm guitar than on the original, and though his voice isn't what it used to be, you can see the pain in his face as he recalls the experiences that inspired the songs. Throughout, Schnabel projects interesting images behind the performers. Wish I had been there . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful register","review":"Ratings aside, Berlin is where Lou reaches the apex.

The album was is and forever shall be once of the most powerful/over produced/ ignored albums of all time. Because it wasn't \\"pretty\\" in the way that \\"Transformer\\" was. Because it dealt with the reality of the life that \\"Transformer\\" glamorized, \\"Berlin\\" is shunned. I love it as much for that as for the music it contains.Now, about this here DVD. Besides Lou's vocals, which are never as good live as they are in the studio when there is the opportunity for overdubs and retakes, the performances are great. Even Lou's singing captures new depths and embraces the anger where there was once cold observation.That said, the idiotic camera work makes it easier to put this DVD on and leave the room than sit and watch. If Andy were in the audience he would have been clubbing Julien Schnabel for butchering the visual side of this truly memorable performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agree with first review","review":"The book was easy to read and good if you are new to the software and need advise.

Of course it has the hit song \\"Stand Up\\", and its a great song, but the rest of the songs could've been written better by a 10 year old. I'm guessing they were rushed on the making of this album.

I bought this cd becuase the old one was so amazing. But dont get me wrong there are some really good songs on here, for example: radio flyers last journey is amazing ( best song ), half man half shark.... is a pretty good song, shotgun is a good song, calmer than you are is great, faso latido is great, god bless you is very awesome, marilyn monorobot is very awesome the chorus is great, jesus haircut is pretty good. Stand up is horrible and cashcow buttbell is horrible as well. If you do buy this cd please buy the old one too it is way way better but this cd is good.

People, stop hating this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"After buying and listening to A Static Lullaby's first CD, \\"And Don't Forget To Breathe\\", I was so excited about their follow-up since their debut had such great potential for an incredible rock band. Then here comes \\"Faso Latido\\". Where all the talent and creativity, all the hooks and all the originality, where all the good qualities were; was all replaced with mundane boring and nondescript electric guitars and lacklustre vocals. All that potential, and all of it wasted. Pissed away in hopes of hoping on the new mainstream punk/rock/hardcore train that such bands as Taking Back Sunday and Fall Out Boy have jumped upon. It's a damn shame that such a talented band have compromised originality and the potential to change a genre for the hopes of hearing their music played on MTV and the radio. It really makes me sad. So many bands have forgotten what making music is all about, the art of it, not the popularity. And unfortunately, A Static Lullaby has forgotten what it's about."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd sucks.","review":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! If you want to check them out, buy \\"...And Don't Forget to Breathe,\\" their first cd (it's incredible). I don't know how the second one came out so horrible but it's ridiculously mainstream sounding, not original AT ALL. Don't waste money OR time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little different","review":"ok here is the deal, the music is very similar to the first one, the vocals and melodies have gotten a lot more poppy and memorable, but in my opinion this is not a bad thing.......i think most of the bad reviews are because they have gotten a little more poppy, but overall i think it is a good second full length"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment of the Year","review":"This is clearly the biggest disappointment of the year. I'be been waiting for this album to come out for some time, and when I finally got to listen to it, I found that it was pure crap. They lost any kind of \\"edge,\\" I guess, they had on the first album. \\"And Don't Forget To Breathe\\" was absolutely amazing, and I was hoping for something along those lines for this new album. Absolutely not. It sounds like every other crap-band, and every song sounds like it was geared specifically for commercial radio.Thankfully, I work at a college radio station so I got to listen to this thing without having to pay for it.Avoid at all costs, but pick up the previous album."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my god...","review":"I'm sorry guys, but what a terrible cd. Not only have they COMPLETELY sold out...(that can't even be denied)...but this cd just flat out sucks. The melodies are so off kilter they are terrible, the riffs mundane, the singing is flat out horrible, and the screaming has become so overproduced that it sounds stupid. Leaving aside my accusations of selling out-which is completely obvious-this CD just doesn't sound good. Their desperate (and obviously money hungry attempt) at mall punk rock just comes off sounding not only mundane and generic, but horribly generic."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA, the computer's revenge!","review":"Dude, I am laughing my ass off right now, when I read that copy protection notice and I almost died! Serves you a holes right! This band is completely awful, not only do they put out horrible music but they also condone corporate honed consumer terrorism! This is what destroyed your parent's computer! This is the sweetest bit of irony I have ever heard in my life! This is so bad your computer will destroy itself just to spite you for putting it in it's cd drive. THIS IS RICH!This is one of the worst albums I had every had the privilage of hearing.

I can play and dont forget to breathe over and over again but this album i can mabye listen to two songs. For one i must say i love radio flyers last journey but i had that song long before the album came out. The only reason i created an amazon account was to rate and comment on how much this let me down thats pretty damn bad if u ask me. The only reason i would give this album one star is for radio flyer. all the rest joe just kinda wimped out and they have just done what hopesfall did with a typesevery song just repeats and becomes dull its garbage not worth listening tobut i will remain a faithful fan and hope that they do not let us down again"},{"rating":"1","title":"total crap on a disc","review":"im sorry for the what, 3 people that gave this any kind grade above a star...its junk! dont buy it.

Anyone want a cd?"},{"rating":"1","title":"COME ON YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME","review":"this is pure garbage. They sold out so bad its not even funny. they went from a hardcore/screamo style to soft sounding and in my eyes poppy. Alexisonfire did the same but they at least they didn't sign to Columbia/sony records and they kept their edge to. And to the person who said people like me don't deserve to be fans od ASL.

I can't believe I spent valuable money on this garbage cd. I don't understand how anyone could possibly listen to this album and say \\"this is good.\\" The sound quality is 100 times worse then their last album, and the guitar parts are boring and spark no interest whatsoever. Oh and on a side note, to the singer/guitarist, you look STUPID with the long hair... please consider another career. To impressionable young consumers, AVOID this album.. I repeat, AVOID THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow..what the hell is this crap!?","review":"dont get me wrong. i love a static lullaby. there first cd blew me away. from the first song to the last im in love with it. so, i heard that ASL was coming out with \\"faso latido\\" and i was like YES!!!!!!! and i was bummed i couldnt get it the first day it came out. now, im actrually glad i didnt get rush to get this cd. this cd is a piece of crap. this new cd sounds like a poppy band mixed with a wannabe screamo band. if you are a fan of ASL you will most likely become dissapointed with this cd. i mean, i have to give these guys credit. they are hard working musicians and have great talent..but what the hell man.i can honesly say this cd is a great dissapointment, but ASL regardless, is still one of my favorite bands and ihope they come out with another cd and it kicks ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no...........","review":"And the trend continues.....I got this CD and once again I've been let down by a weak follow-up album.

But it was enjoyable and had it's moments. So I got this cd hoping for some awesome music. This cd is nothing compared to the first...it's toned down. The vocals are completely different and at times completely boring. The lyrics aren't very good...and just everything about the cd is disappointing. There was actually not one song that I liked and I gave it to my 15 year old sister and she loves it...I gave it 2 stars because this band still holds a place in my heart...and I'll hope for a better cd in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELLOUTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"First let me just make something clear, it is not that the musicon this cd is horrible. It is generic mall punk at it's best. But knowing that s static lullaby made it after their And Don{t forget to breath cd is what shocks me! They might as well have changed the band name to release this.This just confirms to me that there is not one single band in the world now that can continue with their aggresive in your face style when signed with a major label. I am sure their fan base will completly hate this, and now with the oversatturation of pop punk on mtv and radio this won't be acknowledged at all, so all their efforts to get on the radio will be wasted anyways.Big letdown. Download it, but don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa","review":"\\"...And Don't Forget To Breathe\\" was an album that just worked. The lyrical styling, the driving bass (most important to myself), and the simple, yet nice guitar lines would great together.

It reads it as a blank CD! Strike 1.There is not one single song on this album that I enjoy. Not one that even comes close. This band got poppy. That's as simple as it gets. Although I picked it up for $6.99 at Best Buy, it is a complete waste. Strike 2 and 3. Well, it basically strikes out the side.I do not recommend this album to even loyal fans.

I went out to the store and bought it for 15 because i couldn't wait for it to come through the post. I rushed home and popped the CD in the living room stereo, sat down in my comfy chair and braced myself for something absolutely ground-breaking and original.Imagine my absolute horror and disbelief when i was greeted with a quadrophonia of generic riffs, tame screams, tepid emo, overall weak and totally stale efforts.All is not lost i thought, i'll sell it to my idiotic eight year old brother and forget this episode every happened. But he only bought it for 3, still guilty that i let someone else hear it and lose their innocence. Avoid at all costs. Please.

Breaking Bad together with Justified, Game of Thorns, Revenge, Once Upon a Time, Homeland, Boardwalk Empire are just great quality, great acting, good ploys, great use of cameras, effects, music, costumes, etc. Breaking Bad is ideal for a marathon day with pizza in bed: one after another.

He can handle the script, has the acting chops (who would of guessed a largely comedy actor had such drama chops) and makes his part real and gritty.\\"Jesse\\" (Aaron Paul) actually won an Emmy Award for season 1 (I think?) so I guess they gave him a larger role in seasons 2-4. Don't get me wrong he does an outstanding job, it's just his dialog parts too often seem longer and speech oriented, as opposed to plot development. I found myself disengaged a couple of time throughout the season with him.Overall, a great series about drug abuse that even points out indirectly most meth heads do not get clean (I think 3% that try have one year clean).

It has become SO SLOW! I'm not going to go into great dephts about all the flaws here, of which there are countless. For hardcore fans who still think this show works, i suggest you rewatch seasons 1 & 2, then watch season 4. It's just not the same show. Of course, for a show to maintain its vitality, making sure it keeps evolving is key. It has evolved alright; into some sort of soap-action hybrid. It has become dull. Another thing that has completely disappeared from the show, is the wonderful dark humor, evident in seasons 1 & 2. It's just not there. The downfall began with season 3. After eight episodes of season 4, i'm afraid this one is just not gonna land. This should be the last season for a show that started out great, but sadly lost everything it had going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad is right!","review":"The only reason I watch TV nowadays is for Jersey Shore and MTV in general. Wanting to expand my tastes, I heard about this show which was apparently one of the greatest shows on TV. After watching a few episodes, I was too disgusted to even go any further. The horrible acting was bad enough, but its message made me throw up. This show condones smoking meth, which is the worst drug in the world. How could the great FCC allow this garbage? This filth needs to be cancelled, and Bryan Crapson should be arrested for association. This show is the reason why our country is in decline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipity do da!","review":"Frustrating CDs...they would skip inconsistently or would not play at all.

Cranston, Paul and Giancarlo Esposito were all spectacular this year. Sad that they are only going to do 2 more seasons, but I guess it had to end sometime. Loads of great extras on this DVD. Commentaries on every episode and the ones with Vince Gilligan (series creator), Bryan Cranston or Dean Norris on them are particularly fun. Nice behind the scenes feature on the season finale too.

What I received was a book suited more for youngsters. More importantly I expected to read authentic, documented accounts of pioneer survival (definitely the impression given in the description). I was disappointed to find the book is actually a collection of fictionalized accounts of Mormon experiences. At the end of each story the author deploys a few sparse sentences to indicate the actual events that sparked her imagination - definitely not what I expected or wanted. The author has storytelling talent and therefore the book might be enjoyable for young adults interested in historic Mormon fiction, however I found it frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting!","review":"I enjoyed this audio book.

It explains very clear the main topics about Linux and about RedHat. However, some commands are not explained so you have to look elsewhere for help (rpm, vi).

Unfortunately the game is super laggy when you have a few pirates and captives roaming about. In the later stages of the game it got so bad that I had to turn all video options to low and still had the lag problems. I would have rated the game higher for fun factor but just couldn't enjoy it because of the slow motion capture effect that kept going on due to the lag of the game. Disappointed that this was the case, for the most part I had fun building the town and earning gold ect., just can't believe that MacSoft put together such a unpolished game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, money and brain cells","review":"I love James Patterson. But this book is a HUGE flop. I agree with erickson. The best use for this book is as a door stop. I was so irritated by the hopping from topic to topic and randomness of everything that happened. I didn't want to finish the book, but I wanted to get my money's worth. I'm quite upset I spent the time I did attempting to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing from an author that has done much better","review":"Everyone loves the age old battle of good vs evil and contemplating the end of the world etc, but this story with leaps in plot and silly twists and I must smile here those perfect blue eyed saviors is just too funny for words. Please go back to serial killers in DC this just isn't your arena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosemary's Baby meets Priests from Hell","review":"The subject of this book is attention getting, if nothing else. This book displays the evil imagination of James Patterson at its fullest. I found far too much of it annoying in that it was difficult to tell what was real vs. what was only imagined by the characters. The ending was no surprise to me, although Mr Patterson certainly intended it to be. I also found the character flaws of the eventual virgin to be unfitting with the story line. This one is not for the faint of heart, and I'm sure many Roman Catholics are offended by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing","review":"This is without a doubt the worst book I have read in years. James Patterson is a talented writer, so I plodded on and on in the belief that this horrible book would improve. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All does not rock!","review":"Having read some of Patterson's before, and noting a high profile in the local bookshop I expected a good read. I was sorely disappointed. The plot was shallow and hardily credible. Other authors eg Stephen King might have made something of the novels premise but Patterson did not. If I could, I would get my money back. Shame on you James!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great, but still a good read.","review":"James Patterson has put out a few books in the past with very unbelievable story lines, \\"When the Wind Blows\\", so I sometimes expect what this book delivered, Fiction. This book is written in the standard, easy to read, Patterson style, and like \\"When the Wind Blows\\", has a stroy line that is very odd, but it captures the imagination. The story flows well, and leads up to a surprise ending. All in all worth the short time it took to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I actually give this book 0 stars. I can honestly say it is the worst book I have ever read. I bought the hard cover and it was a total waste of money. I can't believe the same author wrote Jack and Jill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious nightmare","review":"James Patterson should stick to familar topics such as police investigation. He should not attempt any further writings in the religious arena. The story was long, poorly put together and boring. If Mr. Patterson wants to do any futher speculation in regard to good vs evil, he should do so within the realm of the criminal justice system. Please leave the religious speculation as to the end of the world to the Book of Revelations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Strange","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. What a waste of money and time. Very flat, one-dimensional characters. I can't believe I even bothered to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing potboiler","review":"James Patterson may have written this book while his mind was otherwise occupied, listening to the ball game or the political news. It's a reworking of his book \\"Virgin\\", published in 1980, which some people may have read fairly recently.\\"Cradle and All\\" is a disappointing potboiler from an author capable of much better work. It can be consumed while the reader's mind is otherwise occupied with baseball or the campaign. Although it may deal with \\"adult\\" themes, the reading level is somewhere around the 5th grade. Here's hoping James Patterson's next book is a good deal better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing at its worst!","review":"This book is so bad, you would think it was wrtitten for someone who was working their way up to cheap romance novels. Story is silly and full of holes, no character development, and the writing - heres an example: \\"He knelt before me and softly bowed his head. \\"I love you with my heart and soul. I know that I'll love you for eternity. I have to leave the priesthood. Then, please marry me? he asked. I knelt and faced Justin. I wanted to be as close to him as I possibly could be. . .There are GREAT novels out there, please find them, and give your mind a treat, do not allow this piece of junk to even waste a second of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"This is a piece of literary trash. Unfortunately you can read the whole thing just to see if there is any point to it. And when you come to the end it is so ludicrous it makes you angry that you wasted all that time. The wasted pages just to fill a hardcover is a sham in itself. He has pulled this trick in other recent novels. I will never read a book of his again no matter what the \\"professionals say\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Disappointment","review":"This was one of the biggest disappointments of the year, Patterson should leave the devils and virgin births to the likes of King and Koontz who know how to make these plots work. This was a long drawn out apocalyptical tale that as Shakespear so aptly put it is much ado about nothing. I love Patterson's mysteries and want him to know that this is just not his forte, go back to what you do well, please! I want to read more of the good things and not waste my money on hard back books that disappoint. Please Mr. Patterson, if I practiced law the way you wrote this book I would be sued for malpractice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-titled Rip Off!","review":"Long time James Patterson fans will be greatly disappointed in this re-titled rehash of one of his early works, formerly titled \\"Virgin\\". Except for a very few minor plot changes, some more detailed peripheral characters and an altered ending, it's \\"Deja Vu all over again\\"!(Suprise! One of the virgin births was conceived pretty much the old fashioned way which the mother \\"blocks out\\" until the moment of delivery -a minor enough change that you have to slog through almost the entire book [again, if you read it the first time] in order to confirm suspicions you develop early on.) Don't you just HATE it when an author becomes popular and regurgitates his old material in order to make more money! What happened, Mr. Patterson? Run out of new ideas? Just call me a FORMER James Patterson fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book to stay away from","review":"This is the first time I submit an interview on Amazon, and it is mainly to warn other people off this dog of a book. I've read most of the Alex Cross novels and thoroughly enjoyed them. \\"Cradle and all\\" however gives new meaning to the word \\"drivel\\". It is easily the worst book I have ever read: one-dimensional characters, rambling storytelling, horrible style... If an unknown aspiring author had taken this script to a publisher, he would no doubt have been laughed out the door! The JP trademark will probably generate a healthy turnover, but for me it is definitely the last time I shell out good money for any of his books. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from such a talented author","review":"I started this book with high hopes, and the first few chapters seemed truly engrossing, but as the chapters flew by I grew more and more annoyed with the plot -- despite the \\"breakneck pace\\" there wasn't much of a plot to move along. A few random violent deaths thrown in here and there don't necessarily mean good absorbing action. There are too many incongruities, and the outcome leaves you with a feeling of \\"That's it? Come on, there has to be more to this.\\" Even the subplots seem forced and/or too convenient. If this author has matured enough to rewrite one of his earlier novels to show his maturation as a writer, this seems to be a half-hearted effort. Patterson is capable of a lot more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disappointing Read","review":"This was possibly the worst Patterson I have read, and I have read them all...absolutely a waste of time...it read like a bad mass market paperback \\"horror\\" novel without the horror...Lets hope that when he returns from \\"vacation\\" he can take the time to bring us something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio version is lifeless.","review":"The story is narrated by one man and one woman, both of whom are very monotone and lack enthusiam in a story that definitely calls for excitement. In the story there are two young women, both of whom are pregnant despite the fact that they are virgins. The Vatican is saying that one of them is probably carrying the Saviour. Incredible! Yet I never feel any elation, confusion, fright, happiness or other emotion out of the narration. I think I need to go back and read the actual book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"National Inquirer\\" material","review":"This story should have been serialized for the \\"National Inquirer\\" or one of the similar tabloids. It does not deserve to be a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All, James Patterson","review":"I am truly disappointed in James Patterson presenting this literary trash to his fans and I am disappointed in myself for spending my hard earned money to buy same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson at his worst","review":"If you are a Patterson fan and feel you must read this book, save yourself some time and anguish and read the first 3 chapters and the last 3 chapters. You really don't need the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over.","review":"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. Like another reader, I read the whole thing, just HOPING it would get better. No such luck. It seems like all the characters are just driving around and circling the globe going back and forth between the \\"virgins\\". And, some characters are so useless they could have been completely left out. This is the only James Patterson book I've read, and if any of his other ones are like this one, it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"bizarre book","review":"Cradle and All was definitely not as good as some of Patterson's other works. This was by far the strangest of the ones I've read. I found it to be long and drawn out throughout much of the book. Towards the end of the book, the pace picked up and it became a little more interesting, but still not as good as his other books. It ended with quite an unexpted twist. If you have nothing else to read, go for it- but otherwise I'd try to find something more interesting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Your Money!","review":"I'm a big James Patterson fan, but I have to say that this book was so awful that I felt complelled to write. There was little or no character development. Many of the story elements have been used by other authors with better effect. I started to buy this book, but thankfully I went to the library instead. The only good thing to say about it was that it was a fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't be reading long...","review":"It won't take you much time to work your way through James Patterson's newest (older) offering. While the fact that the story is framed within one of the greatest mysteries of life offers the reader the potential for a great read, the book simply does not deliver and leaves you shaking your head in disappointment when the last page has been turned. A VERY quick read, so the disappointment is mitagated to a great degree by the knowledge that so little time has been invested by both reader and author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time....","review":"I have read all of James Patterson's books and look forward to them. This one was a big waste of time and money. I didn't care about the characters and the story line was disconnected at best. Where is Alex Cross when you need him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Alex Cross","review":"If this book is any indication of Patterson's forays into suspense beyond Alex Cross, he should not do so. I found this book to be disappointing in that it was far-fetched, confusing and totally beyond any reality. It was slow reading through most of the book and things, while faster-paced at the end, were a jumble of information that made no sense. I was terribly disappointed and wished I had gone to the library for it instead of purchasing. I am a big Patterson fan, but this left me with a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Been Done Before.....","review":"I realized that this was a re-working of an earlier novel, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. It was simple and fast-paced, so I went ahead and finished it, but it was really a waste of time. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot-line has been done before (Omen, anyone?). My personal opinion - the ending of this book is ripe for \\"sequel\\". I THINK that J. Patterson wants to publish a sequel to this book. However, since the original \\"Virgin\\" was so poorly received it was re-packaged, and now gets to take advantage of his fame from \\"Kiss the Girls\\". NOW this book will be widely read enough to warrant a sequel.It seems to be all about the $buck$.....I hate to see someone profiting off mediocre work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"I consider myself a huge Patterson fan, however, after reading Cradle and All, I am losing faith. Regretfully, I didn't read these reviews until AFTER reading the book, or I wouldn't have wasted my time. On a more positive note, I am glad to see that this was a reworking of an earlier novel. It actually gives me hope that the next Alex Cross novel will be back up to par. I don't know what Patterson was thinking, between this one and When The Wind Blows, was he trying to be Dean Koontz or something? Even if his future books have his traditional 'nursery rhyme' titles, if they are not about Cross, and if the chapters are not more involved than two pages, I'm not going to bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEXT TIME, JAMES, WRITE UNDER ANOTHER NAME","review":"This book started off REALLY GOOD, but then it went south on me. By page 54, I was no longer reading the book, I was reading the back of my RECEIPT to see if I could return it... or at least exchange it for something more captivating. Like maybe, I don't know, something by Dr. Seuss?Summary: I've read James before and found him interesting. This wasn't James. This was someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great From Patterson","review":"I have read all of Patterson's books, and like When the Wind Blows, this strays from his usual Alex Cross novels. I found I couldn't put this one down and I loved the ending...not something i expected! Based on the ending...I will be awaiting the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Holes...","review":"The Alex Cross books are really worth reading, but this one is a piece of fluff no doubt created in a couple of weeks. The plot was ok to start with and it wasn't until the last few pages, literally, when you got the answers that you think back and realize he left holes big enough to shoot canons through. I'm surprised his advance readers let him get away with the glaring faults in the plot. This is a nickel-ninety eight book not worth the money, the time to read it, or the space it takes on the library shelf. Shame on you Patterson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not believe that this was James Patterson","review":"I have always looked forward to the next James Patterson novel. Among my favorites were Cat and Mouse, Jack and Jill,and When the Wind Blows. I even gave him the benefit of the doubt on Pop Goes the Weasel, but Cradle and All was just inexcusable. The story had all kinds of promises that led to nowhere. I cannot express to you just how bad I thought this novel was--to the point that I'm considering e-mailing Patterson personally to refund my money. ... This novel was a bigger let-down than Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this novel?","review":"I just finished this book; at first I thought I made a mistake and Cradle and All wasn't written by \\"the\\" James Patterson. I respect his creation of characters other than Alex Cross but the character development in this book was non-existent. A former nun who is now a detective? What a great idea for an interesting character; its a shame this talented writer wasn't up to the challenge. And why did everyone believe these girls were virgins? I immediately thought Kathleen could have become pregnant the way described. Didn't we learn that in grade school sex education? I am so disappointed; James Patterson is one author I always bought in hardback. I won't again. I just wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"An unbelievable plot, plenty of stereotypes, an amateur work that leaves the reader wondering, \\"Why?\\" What happened? This is not what we have come to expect from James Patterson! A major disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE stay in your own pasture!","review":"We love your Alex Cross and your mysteries. But when we snuggle down for a hair raising plot, and get slapped from left field with a totally far out ride, I feel that I've been cheated out of the cost of the book. John Grisham did the same thing in his last offering, and I was mad as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Advertised as a \\"Virgin\\" Re-write","review":"I thought the premise of this book seemed awfully familiar -- it's nothing but a remake of his earlier \\"Virgin\\" title, same exact story. Feel like I wasted money and effort, plus the book would be 100 pages smaller with the blank space squeezed out. Hardly a bargain! Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson's worst","review":"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, but this book is perhaps his worst piece of work. Everyone I talked to said their was a big surprise ending, so for this reason, I kept reading. The ending was a surprise, I admit. My problem with the book is the subject matter/story line and I did not care for it very much. I kept thinking about the sacrilegious overtones throughout this book. It should of been billed as a work of science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know what I read......","review":"This book is definitely not a 5 star book. However, I did finish it and it took me less than 10 hours so it is certainly better than 3 stars. Hence.. the 4 stars.I chose this book because I liked the intro on the back cover. After reading 5 pages, I was hooked and I kept on going to find out what the deal was.I am very much dissapointed with the lack of description on one baby. Why did the Dr. say what he said? What was the reason? I thought I missed it somewhere so I went back couple of times to look for better description but it wasn't there.However, just like the When The Wind Blows, aurthor leaves something in the back for a future book and I can't wait to see the sequel.It's worth a paperback $ so go ahead and pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am not a James Patterson fan, but a friend was reading this book, and it sounded very interesting to me. I bought it, and loved it. It is the only book by him that I have ever cared to read, probably because it is so different from the rest of his work. I thought I had the book all figured out until the end. Those are the kind of books I love. This is one that you definetly do not want to read the end first, for it will ruin the whole book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but good","review":"The forces of good and evil converge. Two young virgin girls are both about to have a baby. One for good and one for evil. The church is not sure which one is which and therefore, moves to protect both until they can determine the evil one.The author builds on the reader's sympathy by making both girls highly likable. It is almost unthinkable that one of the two's babies will need to be destroyed. Great suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every now and again, a rediscovered book is a best book","review":"James Patterson is one of the world's most prolific and mind-bending authors whose works twists and turns and captures the reader's mind and thoughts. Cradle and All is another James Patterson novel that keeps you racing through the pages as you try to figure out....Well, then that would be telling the end. Highly recommended.Cheers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Change of Pace","review":"This definitely wasn't Patterson's typical \\"Alex Cross\\" book, but it was truly a page turner. I couldn't put this book down or read it at night before turning out the lights. If you enjoyed \\"When the Wind Blows\\", you'll enjoy this book. It was nice to get away from Patterson's usual writing style. I can't wait for the sequel to this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All - Not up to Patterson's Talent","review":"There's not a lot to say about this book. It's a lot of religeous mumbo-jumbo. Patterson would do better to leave this stuff to Steven King. If I had wanted to read about mysticism and the existance among us of devils, I would have read a King novel, which I have not done, for good reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Awful","review":"Having enjoyed James Patterson's novels in the past, I was in for an unpleasant surprise upon reading \\"Cradle and All\\". Thank God that I checked it out from the Public Library; if I had actually purchased this book, at any price, I would even more p.o.'d than I already am. This thing reads like it was written by an untalented middle-schooler. It is really, really difficult to understand how this thing got published. Please, people, if you must read this book, check it out from your local Public Library, and do not waste any money on it. Even at a four-hour read, it is an inexcusable waste of time. Terrible plot, no character development, many factual errors, obvious ending... Well, I could go on and on. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All","review":"James Patterson needs to stick to \\"who-done-it\\" novels and leave the Father, Son and Holy Ghost out of his writing.

The characters were interesting and the plot was intriguing. I finished the book in about 8 hours. It was fast-paced and a real page turner. You can't read this book fast enough!! I hope they make this one into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards","review":"I have read several of James Patterson's books and have enjoyed them all. I put down Cradle and All without finishing it however. This book was not up to the author's normal stadards in my opinion. Everyone's tastes are different and others may enjoy the book but I would not recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This book starts out badly and only gets worse.

Too bad for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much religion","review":"I have loved James Patterson from the first novel and have anticipated each and every one...but this one was just too much. I have seen too much 'time of the end' novels and movies lately. Exactly who is trying to scare us all to return to 'Organized Religion'? When I spend the time to read a novel I want to be carried away to another time & place, to live a life I could never live, to feel others feelings that I could not possibly conceive of, not to be spoonfed religious ideologies that can't be believeable. I was sorely disappointed in this novel...bring back Alex Cross"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat premise, but terrible execution, plot, and ending!","review":"The only writer who should get any acclaims on this book is the one who wrote the jacket copy! It made me interested enough to read it (well, listen to the audio version anyway). There were so many plot holes and conflicting details. And it was creepy, rather then mysterious. Do not read... pick another Patterson book, ANY other!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous Story and Reading","review":"This preposterous story is full of hocus pocus based on a \\"third prophecy from Fatima\\" that is totally inconsistent with the actual prophecy (revealed a few years after its publication). Thus it's hard to suspend belief long enough to buy into the premise of a cataclysmic battle between good and evil with two pregnant virgins at the vortex. Further stretching credibility, the audiobook is read by a woman with a clear west coast accent although her character is supposedly from Boston. There's much here that doesn't ring true, reinforcing the observations of others that the whole production (a rewrite of an earlier novel from Patterson's more obscure days) seems like a slapdash effort by the author and publisher to turn a quick profit.The book does have Patterson's usual crisp and well written dialog but his more recent efforts that don't contain hokey supernatural elements are much more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All","review":"Of all of James Patterson books he has written and I have read, this is the most disappointing one of all. Had I known beforehand what this one was about, I would not have bought or read it. Sorry, J.P. is too good a writer to put out this kind of trash.

I love the Alex Cross series and most of Patterson's books.Today I was reviewing my orders, I saw this one in history, and had to pull up the description to remember if I'd gotten and read the book; that is not my normal reaction to a Patterson book. Wish I'd bought it used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"This is the first Patterson book I have read and it will certainly bemy last. The book was just awful! Probably one of the three worstbooks I have yet to read. Its premise, two pregant virgins one presumably bearing the Christ child and the other the devil, would make a great story line. However, Patterson's development of the story was unimaginative, full of cliches, and so simplistic that my 9 year old daughter could have done a better job!...I gave it one star only because no star was not an option on the Amazon rating scale.Please don't waste your money on this book.

What a disappointment! I still can't believe this was written by the same person as books like, \\"Cat and Mouse\\", \\"Kiss the Girls\\" etc. This is such drivel! How is one to interpret this?! Did he write it in a fifth the time it would have taken to write a good book, and still get as much money? Is this a money thing? What a waste! His other books were so good - how can he live with himself getting something like this published? I'm still not convinced that the same James Patterson wrote these things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Disappointment","review":"Cradle and All, begins with two virgins, one in Ireland and one in Boston who are both pregnant. One supposedly carries the Son of God and the other the Son of Satan. At the same time, the entire world is overwhelmed with epidemics and natural disasters. The Catholic church sends two detectives, one a former nun, the other a priest to solve all these mysteries. Interesting premise, but Patterson doesn't deliver. This book is contrived, confusing and poorly written. The characters are all one dimensional and the plot has no depth, mystery or suspense. The entire book reads like a very bad movie of the week. A total disappointment. Don't bother with this one...there are too many good books out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure that this is Patterson's idea of a joke...","review":"This book has little or no merit and could only have been foisted on the reading public by a successful author who has the leverage to get a literary dog published. Oh well, let the buyer beware, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fataled and Flawed","review":"Patteson has the horrible habit of either being brillant, Jack or Jill or terrible, When the Wind Blows. Unfortunately, this is an example of the later. The book should be called fataled and flawed. This literary ttempt has a ridiculous plot, flawed character development and an absurd ending. Even if they gave this book away, it will cost too much. Hopefully, the rest of the summer will be better for the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops, a miss!","review":"If your an avid James Patterson fan, as I am, avoid \\"Cradle And All\\". It is thouroughly the most disappointing book I have read in a long time. It doesn't come close to the great writing and ploting we expect from a James Patterson mystery. Maybe it's because it is reissue of an earlier, less succesful novel, \\"Virgin\\", from a time before he hit his stride and began keeping us on the edge of our seats, but it just doesn't work for me. Yet, everyone is entitled to a bad day, so we will just have to wait for the return of Alex Delaware. If you want to stay a fan, I strongly reccommend you pass on \\"The Cradle & All\\" Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rerun...","review":"As I was reading this book, I kept getting the feeling I had read this before. In fact, it was driving me nuts. I finally realized I read this story 20 years ago. I re-checked the paper cover and saw a small insert about this book being a remake of \\"Virgin.\\" Geez...do all prominent authors write reruns and get full price? The story was interesting, but knowing 95% of the ending made the \\"thriller\\" seem boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"In spite of what other reviewers have been saying about this book - I liked it.It was not the typical Alex Cross detective novel. It is basically the battle between good and evil.The ending was a nice little twist.

Do not buy. Do not read. If received as a present, its best use is as a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful and Tasteless","review":"This was a very contrived and manipulated plot. The sexual incidents bordered on soft porn, in addition to blaspheming sacred things. The style, vocabulary and literary features I long for in good reading were sorely missing. This is the first book I have read by the author and will be the last. When I finished the book, I tossed it in a trash can in front of my students. They were amazed. I simply said, \\"if I want a little piece of steak I don't go to the bottom of a garbage can to find it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a BIG disappointment","review":"I've never read Patterson, so my disappointment wasn't that it didn't live up to his other novels; it just failed all around for me. The concept was great; that's why I bought it. (I'm one of the unfortunates who paid good money for the hardcover edition!)His writing didn't live up to the potential. I usually like straightforward easy-to-read prose, but this was too simplistic, way too expository, and I kept feeling like he was leading me by the hand and telling me what emotions I should experience; telling me when I should feel the tension. But if it were good writing, the writing itself would do this, and he wouldn't have to spell it out for me.I agree, too, that the characters were too flat and unrealistic. I finished it last night and was so glad to be done with it, but this morning I can barely remember the climax, that's how poor it was. It does look like he left it open for a sequel, but it would be a shame to waste the paper on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cradle and all","review":"What a disappointment.

I stayed with it to the end but was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This is my first review given to any book and I am especially sad to give only one star to James Patterson, I always like his books. I was excited when I got the Kindle verson of the book downloaded and started to read right away. I almost wanted to stop 1/3 into the book but I finished it just skipping chapters. I was so disappointed as the book dragged on and on with no purpose and the plot made no sense. The ending is awful as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad vs Good","review":"This is bad.

A whole lot of babble leading to nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vs. Evil not bad","review":"I liked this book eventhough there were senarios that did not seem realistic. This is a fictional story. So some of it is not possible and makes the story less interesting. I really liked the two characters working together and fighting their urges of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew the end of the world would be so boring?","review":"I am a huge fan of James Patterson and try and read as many books by him as I can. I will admit that he has certainly written worse books then this but this was incredibly dull. The characters are laughable, the plot is easily stretched out, and the whole novel is just kind of boring. The book kept my interest and it kept me turning pages but I was doing it more to rush through the whole book then anything. I wanted to like this book but it boils itself down in way too much religious blasphemy which kept me rolling my eyes. Despite how dull and lifeless the whole book in general is, it's nowhere near as abysmal as Last Warning. This book is on par with the Quickie with being a time waster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All","review":"Who really wrote this book? I find it hard to believe this novel was written by James Patterson. The voice of the author is clearly not his. Maybe that of an overwrought seminarian, or, perhaps a much younger version of the author. The story would be interesting were its premise not so outdated. An intact virgin delivers a baby? It happens all the time with nary a blink from the Vatican or anyone else. I expect much better from James Patterson and feel cheated. C'mon, who wrote this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"If your like me and a big time reader, you have your favorite authors. Patterson is one of mine. I have enjoyed his novels and have purchased them all to date. Unfortunately that includes \\"Cradle and All.\\" Save your money, fellow readers. Mr Patterson slipped out of his genre and the change did us no service. You'll fall asleep before page 12; you can skip pages, paragraphs, etc, and never miss a thing....its been done before, better.

They are just too far fetched. Maybe he just fails to make it believable. In Cradle, the details are fairly skimpy and he could have spent more time developing certain parts to make the novel seem more believable. Seems like he gets caught up with keeping his chapters to 2 pages regardless of whether he gets his points accross. I'm looking forward to the next Cross novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not Kiss the Girls","review":"I found a copy of Kiss the Girls in a box of old paperbacks recently, and read it in one day. It's such a well written and suspenseful book, I took my birthday McLean and Eakin gift certificate and went on a quest to read another James Patterson. I think I picked the wrong one. Cradle and All is a very predictible story, focused more on the religious aspects of this \\"investigation\\" into virgin births instead of developing a compeling story. I quickly figured out at least one side of the story and was very disappointed at the \\"revelation.\\" If you want to read exciting religious fiction, choose Left Behind. I'm busy looking for another story like Kiss the Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"I hate to say it, but this book is a bunch of hogwash. It is trite, unbelievable, and poorly written.

I found that I couldn't even finish reading it and put in the garage to sell the next time I have a yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Disappointment","review":"This is the sort of book that would never have been published if the author wasn't already established. The premise, about the possibility of a modern virgin birth, is interesting enough to attract attention, but the conclusion veers off into the realm of science fiction, or worse, so this work should not even be considered a \\"novel\\" or \\"mystery\\" in the normal sense of those words. The only reason I kept reading this book was my prior experience with this author's writings, and my hope he would start displaying his usual talent in story-telling, but the more I read, the more disappointed I was. The whole reading experience with this work was a complete waste of time, and I will have to think twice before I read any more his his coming works. Don't disappoint yourself with this book. Read his older works if interested in mysteries, but definitely skip this failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read all of James Patterson's books and I found this one so out of character (probably spoiled by the wonderful Alex Cross books) that I was extremely disappointed. It was surreal and the plot (good vs. evil) has already been done to death. The ending was predictable and he takes short chapters to the extreme. It seemed like every other page was blank. I love every book that Patterson has ever written but this struck me as beneath his talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards","review":"I like James Patterson and eagerly await his new releases. I ordered this on audio cassette (unabridged) and truly thought it would never end. The characters were not believable and the storyline was absurd.

Hope his next one is back to his usual page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will be throwing out this book","review":"I don't know why I continued reading the book except that I thought somewhere Patterson would find some redeeming features--not so. The book was far fetched with all the tragedies of the world, the pregnant virgins, the devil's voices, etc. Don't waster your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read.

NO, it is not a Alex Cross, detective novel; but it is Good and it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end. I think we should give Patterson credit for trying something new and succeeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out \\"Child of Darkness - Child of Light\\"","review":"When I first read the book, I thought this story line sure sounds familiar, and as I go on reading, there's just a similarity of a tv-movie called \\"Child of Darkness-Child of Light\\", an 1991 USA tv-movie starring Sela Ward. It might not be of the same scenes but it sure have the same story line along the way. Even at the end of the story, it's almost have the same ending except the ages of both children. Otherwise, it's a page-turner alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really didn't like this book........","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. James Patterson writes books that are interesting to read but Cradle and All was just a take-off on an old black and white movie I saw. I knew what was going to happen throughout the whole book except the very end. Too bad to waste Patterson's talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I echo many of the others who have posted reviews. Among other faults Patterson cannot \\"get\\" women.

Don't make the same mistake that I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I very big disappointment for a huge James Patterson fan . .","review":"I have several James Patterson books including the entire Alex Cross series, which was absolutely wonderful. This book tells that tails of disease, famon, and two virgin births. This book dives into the story of the Virgin mother of Jesus, Mary today in the 21 century. One child would be born the Son of God and the other the Son of Satan. Once again we have the epic story of good against evil with all of its flavor. It only took me two days read this book and I am sorry that I even did. It will keep you because you will want to know which baby is which, but other than that, this book is for the birds . . . . sorry James Patterson. Give me Alex Cross or give me death . . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS","review":"I could not read pass 15 pages. The premise is interesting and has been done before by writers who are not as popular as Patterson. Unfortunately, Patterson's storytelling has suffered. I was not hooked at all. The character development lacks and his metaphors are obvious. I'm glad this was a library book and not one I purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely bearable....","review":"I have been a huge James Patterson fan for many years now. Actually, I should say an Alex Cross fan, as I am usually disappointed with Mr. Patterson's non-Alex Cross work. This book was no different. Reworked from his previous novel Virgin, Cradle and All starts out slowly and doesn't go much faster from there. At times it was hard to understand as I thought I was missing something, but in actuality I wasn't. I didn't grow close to any of the characters as I do in the Cross books but that's a benefit of a series.Short chapters (as is Patterson's usual style) and wondering when the heck things will pick up are the only 2 things that kept me in this book. My advice is to either wait for the paperback or get this second-hand. It is worth finishing (if you bother to start) as things work themselves out and provide a fairly decent ending to a drawn out book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical for Patterson","review":"I've just finished Cradle and All and was very disappointed. I always enjoy reading Patterson's book and looked forward to this one with great anticipation. This was just too far-fetched for me. I especially did not enjoy the ending. Please Patterson, write more like Kiss the Girls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"Flimsy premise, amateurish, poorly developed characters; improbable plot lines, a \\"curve ball ending\\" that delivers way too little way too late. Mr. Patterson, return to your genre ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Money!","review":"This book was a great disappointment to me. The characters were two-dimensional and the plot was thin. It was more like a mediocre short story he had \\"stretched\\" into book length. I haven't read the original \\"Virgin\\" that he \\"reworked\\" to produce this book, but he should have left well enough alone. In my opinion, it was not believable and it was not a thriller. I found it to be a rather repulsive work churned out for commercial reasons only. I feel that to a religious person it would be offensive, and to a non-religious person it would be an insult to the intelligence. The only reason I gave it one star was that I couldn't give it any LESS than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demise of another author","review":"As an avid fan of Patterson's earlier books,I expected a book with an interesting plotline and some modicum of creativity. I even cointinued to read it after its lackluster start and primitive, religious guilt based storyline - expecting somehow he would show his abilities as an author and pull this one out of the dung heap. Unfortunately, it only got worse. It is hard to choose whether this book is a greater insult to the innocent reader or Mr. Patterson's earlier books and skills. If you are bored out of your mind, have nothing else to read, including nutrition labels on cereal boxes, you might want to read this poor imitation of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will you print this?","review":"As a former, avid reader of this author, I am insulted by this garbage! An author who could write a spine chilling, totally involving book like Along Came a Spider, and invent a compelling character such as Gary Sonenji, should be ashamed to put his name on this. We, myself and lots of others, bought it because we believed in James Patterson. I won't anymore. The topic is convoluted, and too many loose ends are left unresolved. The ending is ridiculous! I kept reading, hoping for things to have some redemption, making all the words become worthwhile. It never happened. Seldom, if ever, have I been so disappointed in such a long-awaited book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to my intelligence","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, I kept hoping it would get better, but in the final pages, where we end up with yet another \\"virgin\\" pregnant: that was the last straw. I can't believe that I read the \\"whole thing\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard Characters","review":"I, too, read almost every James Patterson novel. Unlike most of his books, I found this one to be poorly written with absolutely no character development. Only the plot kept me moving through the book, but I skipped about half of every page in order to avoid the agony of reading bad prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"What a disappointment! I bought the \\"newest\\" James Patterson book eager to read the next of his fascinating and challenging stories. I was unhappy that it wasn't an Alex Cross novel, but I was willing to give it a chance. Well, I read it, but I can't believe it! I feel cheated. This \\"novel\\" could only have grown out of a parochial education and a juvenile fixation on \\"The Exorcist.\\" I think Mr. Patterson decided to take the year off, but allowed his publisher to issue a \\"reworked\\" story - making money on his established named, but definately NOT considering his readers. I'm sorry for anyone whose first introduction to James Patterson was Cradle and All. If it was my first, it would also be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usually a great Patterson fan.","review":"The best thing about this book is it's length. With very short chapters of 2 to 3 pages and half empty pages at the beginning and end of these chapters to stretch it out, this book is a very fast read. It is not your usual Patterson. It lacks everything that is usually found in his books. I did read it all the way through hoping that it would improve as it progressed. This did not happen. All the characters seemed to be shallow and unlikeable and the plot strange because key points such as the plagues of illnesses were unexplained and vague. The ending seemed to be condradictory-if the Devil's child survived the drowning, why did the plagues end? And who found him and raised him with no publicity? Surely a new born baby saved from the ocean would make headlines even in the Irish countryside."},{"rating":"1","title":"UMMM...I Don't Think So!","review":"While I don't share the same anger with this book as many of the other reviewers(maybe because I didn't buy the book myself), I found it to be quite poorly written. I am only 19 years old and remember writing better short stories in middle school! The plot was highly under developed and the climax was just plain silly! I found it hard to believe that Patterson could even let something like this be printed bearing his name as the author. King, while tackling the subject in probably 500+ pages, would have definitly given a subject as huge as the second coming of Christ it's just do. And priest and nuns simply running away from their vows at the drop of a hat....COME ON! The book was more humerous than suspenseful, so if looking for a comedy, this may be a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I was waiting in anticipation for this book, to find out it was a disappointment, if it had been my first Patterson book I would not have read another. I found you could not get close to the characters, the scenes jumped around to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I have read everyone of his books and most were far out, some sickening and I couldn't continue reading. I pretty well can tolerate the series with Alex Cross. This book was stupid and boring. He seem like he got a little tired of writing good and just threw something in. Now I know why my book store sold it at 25% off. Too me it's an evil story about evil. Even his picture on the back of the cover looks intense. I don't recommend this book, buy something uplifting and worth your precious time. Read the bible if you want to know about the end of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This book was awful. Patterson what happened. It was poorly written and predictable. Not what one would expect from a Patterson novel. I only finished it because I paid the $25.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second-guessing God","review":"Thid novel is a formula pot boiler. I have read and enjoyed the stories involving Alex Deleware for years, but this story reads like Patterson's bills have all come due at once and he had to do someing in a hurry. Please, Jim, go back to what you do so well. Forget about rewriting the Bible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS SUMMER READING?","review":"THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORSE BOOKS I HAVE EVER WRITTEN.

I've enjoyed many other Patterson books. Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment!","review":"I never even thought of reading the intro, as I was reading I was thinking \\"wow is this amaturish\\" after a 50 pages I read the front cover and what a disapointment to realize that this book was one of his first works! It reads as a \\"first work\\". Pass on this James Patterson book."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Page/Last Page","review":"I could have read the first page and then the lat page and known the whole story. Too bad, because I really like Patterson. He usually writes great stories. But I guess everyone can have a bad day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless Drivel","review":"Even though the book is a rework of a previous work of his, I can only pray that he did not really write this piece of trash. This book was a complete waste of time. Thank god it read fast because of the short chapters.Patterson should stick to Alex Cross novels. I can't believe this book is still in the top fifteen of the New York Times bestseller list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna - Like a \\"Virgin\\"","review":"If books were songs, this warmed over turkey of a novel would be the old Madonna hit song. Repackaged early Patterson is selling well, but it should be selling like the original, Virgin, did when it first appeared in 1980. Poorly. This book is definitely a don't bother -- the characters are neither believable nor likeable, and the plot is thin and far out. James Patterson's body of work work since Kiss the Girls deserves the best-seller status it always enjoys. Too bad this re-hash doesn't. Life is so short, and there are so many books. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could tell where the commercials would play...","review":"Wow. As I read this disappointing release, I couldn't help thinking that I was reading an only slightly fleshed-out TV Movie of the Week script. I had been expecting the typical Patterson/Alex Cross-ian suspense and character development, and got nothing but a superficial good vs. evil sparring match. Like a previous reviewer, I finished the book only because I had paid $20 for it!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alex Cross fans beware!","review":"I bought this book hoping to spend a few hours wrapped in a mystery. I got it alright! It was a mystery to me how James Patterson could get away with writing this! The entertainment of the novel involved only in finding out which girl was the true virgin. It is a very quick read. The number of pages in the book is deceiving as the print is so large I could read it without my glasses. If you are a fan of detective mystery's, dont waste your time or money on this book. If you like John Saul you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"I literally threw this book across the room because it was so bad. There is so much wasted time on inconsequential characters and scenes and the ending makes you guess his editor just told him to wrap it up. I will never waste my time on a Patterson book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping this is not typical Patterson....","review":"This was my first James Patterson novel and although I have always heard good things about his writing, I was just not impressed with this. I felt there was no depth to the characters and I found that I just didn't care what happened to them. Instead of being absorbed into the storyline, I was continually thinking about how flat the writing was. The story itself could have been entertaining and perhaps even a little powerful in the hands of a different writer, but I ended up skipping ahead just to find out the ending in which I held only a mild curiosity. From what I have read in other reviews, this is one of his earlier works so I am hoping that his newer books will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was the worst James Patterson book I have ever read.","review":"I really did not like this book. I kept on reading it because I figured it would start to get better somewhere along the line but that was not the case. I did not care to read it after a while. I wasn't even exicted about reading the ending. Don't even bother buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually I wouldn't even give it one star","review":"I have read several of James Patterson's books, and this one is by far the worst. Like everyone else, I was disappointed by the lack of character development and the bizarre jumps in plot. That being said, I must admit I don't particularly care for Patterson anyway. His annoying little two page chapters really grate on my nerves. \\"Kiss the Girls\\" is written in that same style. It's irritating. I guess I kept reading his books hoping they would get better, but they haven't...with one exception, \\"Where the Wind Blows.\\" In my opinion, the ONLY good book by Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good holiday read!","review":"I was surprised to see so many poor reviews for this book. Although it's not the usual James Patterson style, I still found this book enjoyable and wanted to know the outcome.I read it in a day on holiday and would recommend it as a light, entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is my first James Patterson novel and probably my last if the rest of his stuff is like this!!! I found it to be very disturbing. Obviously, this man can not possibly be a Catholic-Priests lusting after nuns, priests lusting after young girls and boys, nuns lusting after priests....just gross! Do yourself a big favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!","review":"Having read all of James Patterson's previous books, I was looking forward to this read. The book grabbed on the first page and would not let me go. You have to remember it is a piece of fiction. His other books seem to sum up more completely. But this was very different subject material. I also believe that it helps to be a Catholic to feel some of the emotions the book envoked. It would have been more scarey if the Church had not recently made an announcment about one of the key points in the book. (I hate to give away too much of the plot!) I would give all of Mr. Patterson's books a 4 or 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Cradle and All","review":"Cradle and All was a very disappointing read for me. I have read most of Patterson's books and really enjoyed them, always anxious for the next one to come out. This time I feel like I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All by James Patterson","review":"The theme of this book is not believable. The characters are not believable. The story is not believable, and the fact that Patterson assumes we will all fall for the fairy tale he has written is stupid. He leaves the ending hanging, for a second book (I hope not). I would not recommend this book to anyone, and it has put me off James Patterson forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this latest book by James Patterson. I am a fan of his, particularly the Alex Cross books. This book and his last, When the Wind Blows, have both dealt with the realm of the unreal and have not done it well. I read Cradle in a couple of days but did not find it believable or particularly interesting. As others have mentioned, the characters were not well crafted. The gist of the story, virgin births, doesn't play well in the 20th century. Go back to Alex, Patterson, and give us something we want to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the rewrite","review":"Find a good used book store and look for a copy of \\"Virgin.\\" Much better book. The changes in the two versions aren't interesting or compelling enough to justify the rewrite. The change to first person (Anne) and the change in the ending were just plain stupid. It's a fast read, for sure - chapters are short short short. Each chapter changes location and viewpoint character, which fragments the story unduly. Overall, I'd have to say that \\"Cradle and All\\" and \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" (the most recent Alex Cross book) aren't worthy of Mr. Patterson and certainly not worth the price of the hardbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced entertainment!","review":"I picked up this book at eight and refused to go to bed until I finished it, from the first page to the last, this book held my interest.While the characters may not have been fully developed, the story and the intensity more than made up for that with an ending that was chilling to the bone.I would say if you prefer the Alex Cross series and hated 'When the Wind Blows' you probably wouldn't like this one, but if you enjoy it when Patterson departs from his beloved Cross characters, then you will enjoy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All","review":"The second book by this author of this type - Patterson should stick to story lines that feature Alex Cross. At least those novels have a probable plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle doesn't \\"Rock\\"","review":"If you liked When The Wind Blows, you might enjoy Cradle Will Rock; but if you are a fan of Alex Cross, you will probably be even more disappointed than you think. Like all of Patterson's work, it is fast paced, and hard to put down; but it seemed to me, he was \\"just going through the motions\\". It read more like a screenplay than a novel - waiting for actors and actresses to fill out the characters. His work always seems to be \\"Literature Lite\\"; but this goes a little too far down the path toward comic book reality, for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Alex Cross","review":"I literally lunged for this book at the bookstore. I was so excited to get the new Patterson book and so disappointed after I had read it. In very simple terms, this was the dumbest book I have ever read. Bring back Alex, PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish, one dimensional effort","review":"This is the last time I invest in a James Patterson hardback. I didn't even finish When the Wind Blows, but thought I would give this book a chance anyway. About three chapters into it, I went looking for the date it was written because it so clearly is amateurish. Realized at that time that it was a rewrite of a 1980 book. Re-releases of earlier books by a popular author are usually disasters, intended only to capitalize on the author's present fame. This book's characters are one-dimensional and the bleating of the main characters becomes incredibly boring after just a few chapters. The dialogue reminded me of cheap romance novels. A waste of time and dollars. I felt ripped off by the publisher and the author. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anger provoking","review":"I really don't know who to be angrier with - James Patterson for writing this mess or myself for reading it. I have his entire collection of novels but this is one I will put on the shelf with great reluctance. Without spoiling the ending, let me say it was totally unbelievable. As for all that comes before that, well, let's just say this. While the tension and suspense is there I was continually berating myself for continuing to read it. Anne is a one-dimensional ex-nun who cannot admit she loves a priest. The parents might as well be non-existent and the girls (virgins) just gave me the creeps. The boyfriend is a jerk while Father Rossetti is something out of \\"The Exorcist\\". And not even as believable. Please James, go back to Alex Cross and do not look back. This books must have be one of those tucked in a drawer for a dry spell filler. Doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will have you guessing till the end.","review":"Cradle and All was the first James Patterson book that I have ever read. It was one of the best books I have ever read. I had turned away from Romances and decided to check out thrillers and mysteries and was not disappointed. This book will keep you on your toes wondering what is going on and trying to figure out who is going to give birth to the \\"immaculate\\" child. And just when you think you have it all figured out--WHAMO! James Patterson knocks you down. The ending is totally unexpected. I especially loved the short chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"No typical Patterson","review":"I'm a big fan of James Patterson and his Alex Cross, and I was sorely disappointed by this book. I'm surprised it's not stocked in the religious section instead of fiction. Don't waste your time unless you like books like \\"Left Behind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Any book by James Patterson is a definite MUST READ! To the very end, I thought it had to be either one of the two girls... Freaky twists and turns caught my total attention. I can't wait until the sequel about Noelle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent Saturday read, but...","review":"You'll devour it in a day, but that doesn't mean you'll feel satisfied. You probably expect rapid-fire chapters and paper-thin characters from Patterson, but you probalby also expect some real suspense. The quasi-religous, who-is-the-real-mother-of-the-savior schtick does keep you turning the pages, but it's not exactly true thriller stuff.Anyway, pick it up, read it in a day, and then move on to better thrillers like those of the similarly-named but significantly stronger thriller author Richard North Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is not an Alex Cross book. It starts out wierd and never improves. The only reason we bought this was because we have enjoyed several others that Patterson wrote. Stick to his mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"cradle and all","review":"Did not care for this book. Was not up to Patterson style. I hope this is not the avenue he plans to go down with the new book in Nov. that he mentions in his bio."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad beach book","review":"I thought that I had read all of Patterson's books, but I missed Virgin, a book he used as the basis for this book, not even coming up with a new idea. The writing was poorly done with characters undeveloped, a story that made no sense and an ending that was the only thing mildly surprising. It was as if the author was being paid by the chapter. I'll be more careful next time about buying Patterson's books. He has fallen into the trap of Robert Ludlum of turning out poorer quality books in subsequent releases until the readership goes away. As a note, Ludlum's newest book is being released in paperback first."},{"rating":"1","title":"I normally love Patterson, but............","review":"This \\"might\\" have made an acceptable short story, but this story was really boring. Read the first twenty pages, the last twenty pages and it will still have seemed to long. Shallow characters, boring plot...Too much... I usually love books by James Patterson. This is the first one that I returned to a book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed!","review":"Like another reviewer, I bought this book purely on the blind faith of the author's name. Patterson has not disappointed me in the past, but with \\"Cradle and All\\" he has: I read to the end ONLY because I expected it to get better and because I was at the beach and had no other book to read. Sorry I wasted the money on this one! I like the mystery quality of previous Patterson novels and was very disillusioned with the weirdness of this book. I don't like science fiction and don't like super natural stories and this had smackings of both. Mr. Patterson, stick to your Alex Cross stories and I am back with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atypical writing","review":"This book was not reflective of Patterson's typical writing style. I was bored to tears and regretted sitting for 2 hours reading it. There was no suspense, and the idea of the book was very offensive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectedly Disappointed","review":"Mr. Patterson's Alex Cross novels are wonderful, fast paced and exciting. So when \\"Hide and Seek\\" came out I expected more of the same, I was sadly mistaken. Thus I purchased \\"Cradle and All\\" with reservation when realizing Alex would not make an appearance.I was expectedly disappointed with this book. I don't care for teen horror/scream films, which this felt the literary equivalent to. No real surprises and no unforseen plot twists. Although I only spent 1 day reading this book it felt like a waste of my time.Unfortunately I will no longer purchase a James Patterson novel unless it has Detective Cross in it. Too many books, too little time to waste on novels such as \\"Cradle and All\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS this really written by James Patterson?","review":"Cradle and All was such a bad read! Was this really written by the man who writes such great novels as Kiss The Girls, Jack and Jill, etc? Please go back to Alex Delaware and leave such trashy reads as this to someone else. I really wasted my money on this. BEWARE of buying this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson at his worst","review":"The book is a wonderful example of the adage \\"You can fool all of the people all of the time.\\" The book is a poorly written rewrite of his \\"Virgin\\" which was not very good the first time around. My wife and I generally enjoy James Patterson. He is a capable writer who usually has believable plots, interesting characters, and enough suspense to keep me turning the book's pages. Cradle and All is an embarrassment to both the reader, who has been duped, and to Patterson who agreed to revive this previously told tale. His editor at Little Brown should be relieved of his or her handling of Patterson. Patterson's fans are going to be suspect of his future work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reader","review":"reflects pattersons early writing style..book is not his bestbut the last 25 or so pages make it worthwhile..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do what you best, Mr P.

It is a light weight, superficial attempt to cross over to the occult, bump in the night world of King et al. It's virgin birth thread coupled with two page chapters make it laughable (if I could only forget that I spent good money for this book).Save your money and invest it in Sandford's new \\"Easy Prey\\" or Deaver's \\"The Empty Chair\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cradle should fall","review":"Abgd Rvw...I must concur with the majority on this book. James Patterson's work in the fantasy genre is terrible. The story moves quick enough but thats not enough to make this book good.

Had I believed all the reviews and that Mr. Patterson could write this bad I would have passed it up.Recommend...No purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe this was written by James Patterson","review":"While I was initially happy to see that it was not an Alex Cross story, I was disappointed with what it was and yearned to read about Alex again. Where did all this religion come from? I expected to read a thriller not something occult. I thought the previous novel about flying kids was just an a one time fluke. Guess not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for Alex","review":"I generally purchase James Patterson novels as soon as I can find them. Guess I'll be more careful next time. Alex Cross is a much better read than this wild story of virgin births and voices of the damned. I certainly hope he stops before a sequal. He could only make matters worse! Meanwhile, I'll be looking for Alex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Change","review":"I am a really Alex Cross fan, however I really enjoyed Cradle and All. Just as Patterson's When the Wind Blows was a step away from his norm so is this book. I like to see authors take this kind of chance. I read this book in just over three hours because I had to find out who was going to have the good child and who was going to have the evil. The book did have major religous issues but they did not get in the way of the book. In fact I felt that they had to be there. Cradle and All takes some twist and turns when you least expect them. I was taken by surprise at the end of the book, but upon reflection it makes perfect sense. Patterson did leave the end open to a sequel. I for one will look forward to reading it if he does write one. If you like James Patterson, I believe that you will enjoy this book. It is a great change for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Cradle","review":"As a James Patterson fan, I anxiously awaited Patterson's new novel, which arrived from Amazon last week. I expected another intricate plot, fascinating characters, and hours of entertainment. Instead, I found the Cradle empty.

I sat down one morning and didn't stop reading until I was done that night! Of course the characters could have been expanded and maybe the book could have been longer but it was scary and suspenseful! I thought I would be disappointed since it isn't a Alex Cross novel but I wasn't. Just the thought of two virgins who are pregant-one with the Son of Satan and the Son of God-should tempt readers to read as fast as possible. I also loved the ending because it came unexpected and Patterson left it were it should have been left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"I thought this book was really good. I know many people thought this book was disappointing, but me & my friends read it & we thought it was great. This book is actually what made me start reading James Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very satisfying book","review":"This was the first of James Patterson's books I have read. There weren't many dull moments at all.The main character Anne Fitzgerald kept me wondering about how her story would end, after Colleen and Kathleen had thier babies.Another thing I wondered was if Father Justin O'Carroll loved Anne enough to leave his job as a priest.Every chapter kept me curiously reading on so much that I finished to book in less than twenty four hours from the time I had started. Normally I dread reading books, or the more interesting ones take me a little less than a weak. The ending was very satisfying in the way it came very unpredictable. In fact I liked the book so well that I've already finished reading another of his and am planning on reading many more. I do recommend this book to anyone who needs to respark their imagination, whether you have a few hours or a few days. You won't be able to put it down! No BS! *Aisha Ahmouda*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time - I did","review":"This book is simply horrible. Please, do not waste your time or money.

Patterson's characters were believable, but the entire context of the novel was definitely not up to the mark. I have read nearly all of Patterson's books and would continue to be interested in reading his future ones, but this book was my very least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"This book is truly AWFUL! I have enjoyed other books by the author, so I am not prejudiced against him. I understand that this book is a re-write of an earlier work; I can certainly believe this. Without giving away the plot, this book concerns the concept of a virgin birth, as in the Bible. To those who do not believe in this concept, the book is ridiculous. To those who do believe in the Biblical story, particularly those who believe literally, the story is offensive. That leaves almost no one who should like this book. I sincerely hope that the author goes back to Alex Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have nothing better to do!","review":"It was almost like this author was paid to plug other books, movies and music. There are so many mentions of other popular pastimes.. I started to wonder if it was just an ad campaign. Besides all the problems other reviewers have listed.. I found just this one more.

It could be a good tale if it could stand on its own without the single correct religion theme that story relies on so heavily._christian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson hits rock bottom with this one","review":"This work by James Patterson is dreadful. The author, whose Alex Cross novels were once eagerly awaited by his legions of fans, has continued his downward spiral by publishing a story so moronic that one wonders if he has lost his imagination to write books that his fans will enjoy. The premise here is about two young women who are virgins and suddenly find themselves in the family way without carnal knowledge of men. Each girl is carrying a child, one is blessed and one is cursed with the child of Satan. There is a moral clash of sorts between the female narrator, a former nun, and a priest, and the two carry on a running affair that is by turns unrequited love, hatred, indifference and deep devotion. It may be that Patterson had the film \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" in mind when he penned this novel but the book lacks cohesion and credibility and is totally forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away! Run Away!","review":"I don't even know where to begin on this one. I will just say this, Patterson is a much better writter of detective thrillers. This book is so bad that words can't even describe it. Stay away from this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought the book was badly written, as if someone forgot to go back over it, except briefly, to make sure it all works. What happened to the editors? I liked the supernatural element to the mystery and have always found the good v. evil myth behind it interesting but was very disappointed with all the holes in the story and some of the scenes just did not make sense and weren't necessary. The book was too short to do the story justice. If the author had taken the time to explain things more, it really would have been great. it was the sense of sloppiness that was disappointing. I must agree with another reviewer that while I really loved \\"Along came a Spider\\" many of the later Patterson books have been disappointing in some regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If you like James Patterson's writing style, borrow from your library, skim the book, then take it back. Technically, it is flawed, subject wise, dumb, the characters, shallow. Go back to his great Alex Cross character books, and forget this poor rewrite of a 20 year old waste of time. I am waiting for his next adventure with Alex"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible writing","review":"This was a very big disappointment. I have enjoyed reading his past books and love Alex Cross. I knew this didn't have Cross in it but I was still thinking it would be good. I'm glad it was from the public library and I didn't spend money for it!!!! The subject matter repelled me. I kept reading thinking it would get better but it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This was possibly the worst book I've ever read. With all the wonderful books out there, do not waste one moment of your life on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long Wait for Nothing","review":"I finally got my hands on \\"Cradle and All,\\" thinking I would love it after reading the premise of the story. I'm a big fan of Stephen King, and enjoy most books about mysterious, supernatural events. I flipped through the (extremely) short chapters, waiting for the story to come together. Waiting to care about the characters. Waiting for a conclusion that made sense... A long wait for nothing. Readers, don't waste your time with this one. A one star rating is too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I've read practically every James Patterson novel, and this was certainly not his best. I love the Alex Cross series and most of his other works because they keep you guessing throughout the entire book. This novel, on the other hand, pretty much tells you the catch and simply repeats itself over and over from Part 2 until the ending. It was so messy that the act of reading it gradually became annoying. It is, however, a quick read (I finished it in less than a week) so even if it is a terrible novel, it doesn't waste too much of your time. By the way, the only reason that I give this book 2 stars and not 1 is because it did have a mildly ammusing epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise - Disappointing Outcome","review":"I found this book frustrating. The premise of the two virgin births and the two detectives attempting to divine (pun intended) the truth was promising and intriguing. But it jumped around too much, the characters weren't as well developed as I would have liked, and there were a few too many unsubstantiated leaps of illogic. And the rather obvious setup for a sequel at the end left me feeling unsatisfied.I also found the structure of a bazillion 1-2 page chapters irritating. Nothing was ever finished before moving on to the next chapter. It felt like amateur hour. I've not read any of Patterson's Alex Cross books, but I did read the similarly quirky \\"When The Wind Blows\\", which I liked much better. If you're thinking about starting up with Patterson, this ain't the place to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All","review":"A frustrating read. It never developed the characters so that the reader felt any connection to them. It read like a \\"potboiler\\" and left this reader wondering why he spent the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't believe how utterly bad this book was.","review":"This was the first James Patterson book I read and the only reason I ever read another of his was someone gave it to me. Cradle and all was a total disappointment, I cannot believe a book of such poor quality could even be published. Its setout is very annoying - many many very short chapters and lots of blank pages, what a waste. The characters were unbelieveable and the plot ridiculous. I am all for this kind of story if it can be done in a believable way but this one just falls to bits really, the ending is pathetic (as is the ending in the other book of his i read - 1st to die). Please people, do not waste your time with this book - the author should not be rewarded for writing such absolute drivel, it would only encourage him to do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle and All -- James Patterson","review":"This may be the worst book I've ever read. Normally I don't write reviews, but I feel compelled to warn others. I literally finished it by a cozy fireplace--and then tossed it on the fire! It wasn't worth saving and loaning out to any other poor, unfortunate souls. The suspense is great--too bad it goes nowhere. There are all kinds of seemingly important hints and clues that add to the mystery but die on the vine. There is zero explanation for why a new deity is going to suddenly come about, nor is there reason given for why the birth immediately ends the mysterious plagues, etc. The ending is so anti-climatic you will regret those few hours of your life which you can never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesn't even deserve 1/8th of a star","review":"What the hell was this?I really loved anything by James Patterson, but this has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. The opening prologue was good - two young virgins pregnant and about to give birth, both saying the births will be miracle births..but that is about as believable and interesting as the story gets!I have to admit that I love the fact that Patterson writes very short chapters, if it wasn't for that, I would have dumped the book ages ago so I actually did finish it within a couple of hours, but it was a terrible book. The plot was pathetic, the characters were wooden and very silly and overall, I was very very very disappointed with this lastest book from Patterson.If you a big Alex Cross fan or just love anything from JP, leave this book on the shelf and if you want good vs evil, get Stephen King!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure schlock!","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this book. I was so disappointed in it. I normally like Patterson, even when it is not a Cross novel, but this was a complete waste of paper. Makes you wonder if he just need the money or something. The plot was short on imagination and the writing choppy. You got no real feel for any of the characters and nothing in the book made you feel like you wanted to know more. The end, which was supposed to be a twist, was just too pat. You could see it coming a mile away. If you must read this book, get it from your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near his other works","review":"I have loved all of Patterson's work up until this one. A total piece of garbage. If you like Patterson's other books, this book will be nothing like you have read before"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should have known better..........","review":"Well, I thought I would never say it, but.....this was the worst book that I have ever read! I didn't think that James Patterson was capable of writing such junk!He has tried to mix religion with the occult...didn't work! He researched the Catholic Church pretty well, but didn't give enough credit to the faith of those folks.....the very idea that there would be another virgin birth...hey, why did you go there? I thought after the children that were able to fly was written he would settle down .... didn't happen did it?Stick to Alex Cross, James........you're good there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing new here","review":"I usually read the back cover of a book before I purchase it. However, in the lone exception of James Patterson I refrain from doing that because he always entertains with something new and original and I don't want to ruin the surprise; That is until \\"Cradle and All.\\" I read this book almost ten years ago. Patterson wrote \\"Virgin\\" in 1980. Same plot, same locations, some derivations from the original. Save your money and get \\"Virgin\\" from the public library. No more blind faith for me... sorry Mr. Patterson, in the future, I'll review the story and determine if it's something new, before I take out my credit card."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe that I read the whole thing!","review":"I can't believe that I read the whole thing. What kept me reading? There was a good degree of suspense. I wanted to see if I was right about the ending. It was so very predictable with poorly developed characters. I thought Anne had potential as a nun turned private investigator, but in the end... Some of the reactions about the Catholic Church might have had a basis in reality hundreds of years ago, but I doubt that the hierarchy or the people of the Church would react that way now. I haven't read a book this bad in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A friend of mine loaned me this book and told me it was a great thriller and suspenseful..so I really had high hopes for this book. I found it to be predictable and boring. His descriptions of Boston and New York were believable but when they took the story overseas I don't think he did much research. I also thought some of the adjectives he used to describe people were overdone. I really really really hated this book and I only read it all the way through just to get it over with. It only took me a few hours to breeze through it anyway. When I finally got to the end I was quite annoyed at the lame ending...all that build up for nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time","review":"The \\"Cradle and All\\" is not the only thing that has fallen with this book. The standard of writing has tumbled down into new depths. This is easily the most poorly written book I have been unfortunate enough to read in many years. The writing makes Sidney Sheldon look like Shakespeare. The plot is not just unbelievable, but ridiculous. I had to finish reading this book to see if it would end as badly, but I was a bit disappointed. It ended worse than I could have even imagined."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disppointment for Patterson fans","review":"I didn't know this book was a re-working of Virgin until after I'd read it, but it shows some of the shallowness encountered in a popular author's early works. I am a fan of the Alex Cross novels, and I knew this book did not have the Cross character in it, but I wanted to read it anyway. I was disappointed. This book seemed very much like a meet-the-publisher's-contract-quota book. The characters are undeveloped, and there are gaps in the story that are unexplained. I found chapter-ending dilemmas that were not resolved. I was carried along, but skeptical at the same time. For that reason, I gave it two (instead of one) stars. All-in-all, not a book I would recommend to readers accustomed to Patterson's quality of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment !","review":"Gee, I wish I had taken a moment to read the customer reviews. Please know this book is not the usual wonderful James Patterson novel. All authors will ususally write that one \\"turkey\\" book, and I am afraid this one fits the bill. It is a quick, lackluster read and I kept turning the page, hoping it would improve. But it didn't, so save your money for this hardcover novel and wait for the paperback, if you want to give it a try. This was quick easy money at the expense of his loyal readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"truily disappointed","review":"I feel as though I don't know James Patterson after trying to listen to this book on tape. I really wanted to read an Alex Cross Mystery. I am a true die hard fan of these great mysteries that keep me in suspense all the way through. I met James Patterson this past fall and he was magnificent! He's great, so Alex Cross, please come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Typlical Patterson","review":"I just recently finished reading Cradle and All, and must admit that I was reading through it like a mad woman just to find out what happened, but all in all, I was diappointed in the book. Patterson did not portray the usual realistic Mystery book of his usual writing. This book brings in a bit of the supernatural and religious world that makes it more of a fiction \\"Fiction\\" book. Now, I am a a Catholic Christian, and do have thoughts of the end of the world, but this plot of the book does not make me by into the story. Also, the cover reading of the book doesn't really illude to this interaction with the mystery. Good book, but wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was 13- and thought it was a page turner!","review":"It was easy for me to understand and very enjoyable. It was a great theoretical book -it really kept you thinking at night. I personally think about religion a lot, though I am not Christian, and found the book very suitable to what I like- mystery, suspense, a little romance, internal conflict, and those what if's."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know what I was getting into!","review":"I must admit that I had not heard of this book before I purchased it to read while on vacation. It sounded like I would like it. As it turned out, I was wrapped up in it! While my family was in the pool I was busy reading the thriller \\"Cradle and All\\". I could not put the book down. A few times I had \\"goose bumps\\" while reading. The ending was INCREDIBLE!!!! I had the pleasure of meeting James Patterson at Book Expo America in Chicago in June. He graciously signed his new book and gave me a T-shirt with all of his books listed. Besides being a great writer, he is a very kind and soft spoken man."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about a \\"Zero Star\\" rating?","review":"James Patterson, what were you thinking about when you wrote this book? If you are a lover of Alex Cross novels, forget this book, he is not here, neither is anything else worth reading. The entire book is nothing more than nonsense and drivel. It is pointless in getting into the nitty gritty details of the book because there is nothing good to say about it except, once again, there are the short chapters common in Patterson's novels. This one ranks at the top of the list of worst disasters along with, \\"When the Wind Blows.\\" Mr. Patterson has proven his unsurpassed talents as a writer; however, now and then, he seems to get side-tracked in becoming a creator of illusion, leaving us wondering where the ideas come from and what could have possibly been going through his mind when he chose his subject.

Then I read it. Oh, how awful. I really do love Alex Cross, even when he gets bad reviews. But this was an abomination. Two women who are virgins are pregnant...one possibly with a newborn Christ and the other with the devil. Sorry, this just didn't fly with me. I have enjoyed novels that dealt with Catholicism, (The Genesis Code, etc.) but this was totallyboring. The only reason I finished it in 2 days was to go on to my other favorite authors who had books released the same day. James, Alex Cross is your best bet. Plot a story and stop relying on your name to sell a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Trimmings with this Turkey Dinner!","review":"Reading this book was like sitting down to a tantalizing turkey dinner without being able to eat any of the trimmings. When all you get is turkey, it's not a great meal. Patterson didn't flesh out his characters enough. The idea behind the story is intriging, but underdeveloped in the final product. I was disappointed by the fact that this was not a new book, but a rewriting. Reading to the end was an effort, but I was pleased with the little twist at the very end of the story. This book gets 2 stars, but then I'm easy to please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Story","review":"The writer has enticed me from his past work to purchase this. Big mistake buying this book.

Read When the Wind Blows and loved it.Read Cradle and All and kept looking for the happy ending. When the book focused on satan and his beasts I thought Mr. Patterson was trying to alert people that there really are devils on earth trying to entice us to join them in hell. His story was a vile ridicule of the birth of Jesus and of the Blessed Virgin Mary. I don't believe I will ever buy another book of James Patterson.I am certainly NOT giving this as a Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unprejudiced view","review":"Considering this was my first James Patterson novel, I did not have the opportunity to compare it to his other novels like some of the other reviewers. I bought this book because of its contents, not because of the author's name. After reading a few more of his books, I realize that this was a different kind of book for him and appreciate his effort (which I happen to think he pulled off better than most of his other \\"normal\\" books.) Anyway, this book stuck to what I was expecting from it, a quick, decent read about good and evil, and it's what I got. The ending was a little bit of a disappointment, but overall, it kept me reading well into the night, not wanting to put it down. The characters were a little underdeveloped, but I still liked them. Well, if you want a good book that's a quick and good read, pick this up because you like what it's about...not because you're a faithful Patterson fan, because it is a bit off his normal track. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster if that","review":"As a big fan of Alex Cross and Patterson's mysteries, I picked this one up with great anticipation. I was sorely disappointed. This clearly reads as a work that Patterson wrote very early in his career. As I described it to my husband, \\"Don't bother - Nothing happens - there are supposedly two virgins bearing the child of god and the child of satan - one has the child of satan, the other turns out to be the victim of a crime, and then (surprise!) there is a third virgin. And she has the daughter of god....\\" I kept waiting for the horrific scientific explanation, or ACTUAL conflict to ensue between good and evil. Or for the characters to do something that made them likable and interesting. Alas, I made it to the end of the book by sheer perserverance, and was never satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 1st and the best of Glass Harp.","review":"What a great album despite Phil Keaggy's demise into Christian rock.

I am, however, disappointed with it myself and would recommend looking at other publishers' editions for modern translation of Shakespeare.Because instead of translating Shakespearean English into modern English, the Prestwick House edition just transliterates it - moves the words around to form a modern sentence structure, drops in a few synonyms for out-of-date words, and changes punctuation.Now for most of the book, this works fine. But sometimes the language needs more of an interpretation than is given, and that, as they say, the rub.Plus the thing is riddled with typographical errors. Come on, you're selling this to an education market! Do a little editing!All-in-all I'd look elsewhere for a modern Shakespeare translation.

Hickman likes to have fun with her music. And while her lyrics often deal with love and relationship, she tends to shift the focus in ways that are both imaginitive and refreshing. Her imagery unusual and poignant -- quirky in a way that is all her own. Most memorable are the songs \\"Too Fast\\" and \\"Claim on My Heart.\\" The first is about an after-work rendezvous between playful couple in love (or is it merely lust). The second is a first-person narrative by a woman that would like to give her lover everything, but hopes that he will settle \\"for a claim on her heart.\\" It's a song that risks being sappy, but instead comes across as being sincere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dissapointed","review":"After the rave reviews of this CD, I decided to take a chance and buy it.

The only downfall was that all my pictures from my vacation were taken on HQ and not SHQ so when I expanded them, they were a little fuzzy. Just make sure you keep it on SHQ if you plan on enlarging your pictures. And in the sun it is hard to see what you are taking a picture of, but that happens in all the digital cameras.

While SOAs and web services architecture are all fascinating - when one gets down to the development - one needs a thorough understanding of SOAP - its various implementations - and current stumbling points.This book provides all of the above for 'java' soap (it was written prior to Axis release - but still contains enough useful information). For .NET soap - I use OReilly's Programming .NET web services - which is also excellent. I have no complaints about this book - I got what I needed from a developer's perspective and also some from an architectural perspective (for e.g. - the author illustrates how using JMS with SOAP provides a truly resilient and flexible SOA)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technology Review Only - Little Practical Information","review":"This book does not really explain HOW to develop SOAP applications. Instead, it just spends page after page describing all the different technologies competing in the SOAP and web services arena. Upon completing reading this book, I had a much better understanding of what was happening in the chaotic development of SOAP, but I would not be able to develop anything using SOAP. This seems to be typical of this author's other books. I've read three of Brogden's books and they all tend to get bogged down in specification versions, generic overviews of APIs, and other occassionally interesting but not usually very useful informaiton. Then he doesn't take the time to carefully explain HOW to use the technologies in a practical way. This will be my last Brogden book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"I had read this book during the Englisch lessons and I find it very interesting. The Story deals with a love triangel between the main characters . The language is easy and you can understand it easily. The book describes the ssituation of pupils who grow up very well. I find it very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age","review":"We had to choose a book which we had to read during our English lessons.Our choice was \\"Coming of age\\" and it was a good choice.The story is real and honest. It\`s about life and future of young colored people in American cities who live between gangs and wealth, drugs and education, childhood and being an adult. But it\`s also about the problems teenagers have. The theme could be interesting for people at the age of 16 and older. It is very interesting how the social bachground is described. Sometimes it was hard to read because I've never read slang before. But it was an interesting experience. I like this book a lot!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A total waste of time & money\\"","review":"The novel \\"Coming of Age\\", written by a black 18 year old, tries to give an impression about white/black/light-black problems. It tries to use a black slang for the black characters. This ,however, is a total failure, because it isn't real slang, nor is it normal language. This makes the language boring.The story isn't very interesting or complex: A black snob, Ruthie, realizes she loves a black athlete, AJ, and, to be sure that she keeps him, tries to destroy his ex-girlfriend, Erika, emotionally. Reading the book, it seemed that Ruthie is the \\"perfect\\" model of a student: hard-working, is in the Student Council, gets a scholarship, is the smartest, and makes everyone love school. The book bored me so much, that I didn't even finish reading it, even thought, we had to finish it for school (that's the first time I didn't finish a book that I started to read). A very disappointing book, and a total waste of time & money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great story that I first read years ago and even today it still touches me in a deep and emotional way. Teens can easily relate to this book and adults will reminisce. This book is not for the timid reader. Ms. Hewett keeps it real as she tells an urban, modern day tale that will never grow old of first love, envy, discipline, making choices, and staying true to yourself and your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Coming of age is about Ruthie, AJ, and Erika. Ruthie is always accused of acting white, because she always hang out with the white crowd, since she can't relate with blacks. Aj is the star athlete, also tryin to raise his brother. Erika is his girlfriend, that is mixed. They go through the problems that all highschool students go through, fallin in love, teasing, and fighting. I really liked this book, it brought old highschool memories back. The only thing the author made to points about color complexes, and made all the light skin characthers really shallow, but that's happening in majority all book by black authors today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The story \\"Coming of age\\"takes place in Denver.It deals with social,racial and gang problems between different groups at a High School.There is also a developing love story between the two main characters Ruthie and Aj who come from a different social background.This fact makes the story even more interesting. It is a book that deals with a variety of problems. Although there is a lot of slang in it, it is not very difficult to read. Because of the slang you can imagine the emotional situation of the people very well and makes it more personal. Up to the end it is a thrilling story. I like Ruthie the most because she shows the most emotional feelings. Furthermore, I think she has got the strongest character."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the ultimate low budget filmmaker's guide.","review":"This is a useful book.

Damen was the perfect male lead. He was intelligent, honest, witty, romantic - and he treated Stacie as a human rather than a pretty face. I wa relieved that he didn't have mistresses on the side and that he worked for a living rather than just living off his title. Their love was refreshing, real and entertaining. This novel isn't going to strain your mind, but it's a very enjoyable novel to lose yourself in for a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is supposed to be a Regency Historical? You're kidding!","review":"This reads more like a contemporary than a historical novel, with the characters all speaking and acting as if they walked in a modern city, not 1813 England. It was blatant, not something that was only occasional in the text, and I find it stunning and more than a little disappointing that an editor would read and approve of publishing a book that so badly misrepresents the Regency period. It wasn't even a good read because the very incongruity of the modern actions of the characters with the historical period was constantly distracting. It's writing like this that will end up ruining the Regency subgenre."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous","review":"This was the first book I read my Andrea Kane and I couldn't wait to read the next one-- \\"The Silver Coin.\\" Now I've read many of her books and enjoyed them all, but the \\"Coin\\" books are still my favorite.

Kane's books since her debut book, Dream Castle. The last 4-5 books have all been a let down. Within 100 pages the main characters express/acknowledge their love for each other and spend rest of the 355 pages solving a long drawn mystery. There is no intensity, doubt or mystery in their romance and I was very disappointed. Within the first 1/4 of the book the couple make their feelings obvious and join forces to fight some other problem. What is left in a romance novel to read after that? The mystery and the lovers search to solve the puzzle was all so boring. Everything in the romance was so rosy, too rosy almost all through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting historical inaccuracies","review":"The author should do a lot more research into the Regency period before she attempts such a novel. I find the historical inaccuracies very distracting (to put it mildly). Some examples: Noblemen of that period did not earn their living through trade. They were the landed gentry class and derived their wealth from their landholdings & estates. Anastasia was refered to a number of times as Mrs Damen Lockewood when she should in fact have been addressed as the Marchioness of Sheldrake. Ms Kane is also obviously not conversant with the mode and speed of travelling in those times. How can the villian who is in Kent and his informer who lives in London meet on such a regular basis late at night when the informer has to be back in his office by the next morning? These irritatating inaccuracies have spoilt my enjoyment of an otherwise interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I found this book disappointing regarding the romance aspect. I will give the author the benefit of the doubt seeing as how this is the first novel I've read from her, but overall, this one did not hold my interest.

If you're an avid shooter then you've got spares of everything that comes with this kit which is why I suggest it for new shooters to the .22 caliber and I gave it a 4 star because it's nice but basic.

Her characters are real and completely three dimensional, with both good and bad characteristics. Sometimes you want to hate them, but other times they're heroic.

While very busy seeming to care about everyone in his town, he seems to have very lttle emotion left for his young daughter. Remie Lelourie, his former lover, and leading suspect in her husband's death, is quite insane. Yet we are supposed to find these very unappealing characters, romantic star crossed lovers.

It was clearly the best written scene in this entire book.After that, the little history lesson on King George III and Charlotte, and the heroine Kia's astute observations on her good fortune in being raised in middle-class America, I was DONE with this book. Can I stand another shallow \\"gurlfriend\\" character? Can I stand anymore superficial references to God from African Americans (in books, media, entertainment, etc.) who have not displayed anything in their actual lifestyles to indicate any importance placed on God?Perhaps Ms. Gregory's film background hasn't as yet afforded her the mettle to develop characters with more depth.If you are a reader who cares about being challenged and surprised by an author, this book is NOT recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"This book was excellent.

I've read half a dozen others that discuss eating plans related to the 'low-carb' approach. This book is not a diet book. It's like having a couple of intelligent, research-oriented doctors with tons of experience sit down and explain things about nutrition and health to you in plain english. Each chapter addresses a slightly different topic, so that you are able to see how everything fits together, and why there is no one thing which, done in a vacuum or alone, is likely to be a good answer to better health. The Eades cover related areas that are very much needed, such as foods, drinks and drugs that work against low-carb eating plan weight-loss success (and why), and more.

Then, of course to fill space they tell you to exercise in spurts, and learn another language, and to get sun???? My favorite part was calling a number in Colorodo for buffallo beef--you don't want to know the price per pound.

I don't know anyone else with this, so I can't say whether or not it's a common problem, but I do know that I'm taking it back very soon to replace it, probably with a Panasonic SV-AS10D. I thought perhaps it was a power issue, but it has full battery. I can only owe this problem to something with the machine.However, I must admit that I like the HD screen very very much, and the sound quality is beautiful.

Her words are precise and her sentences connect to each case as-a-matter-of-factly. The crimes are skin tingling and mind numbing. Each murder is explained then the investigation reported. Related court cases follow and the verdict ends every crime file.

This audio CD was very disappointing by comparison. The stories are frequently disturbing without really having anything suspenseful happen, no big surprises in terms of investigation, etc. It's almost just like a chronicle of some of the more sensational cases she wrote about during a certain time period, but none of it gave me much insight or kept me on the edge of my seat.The Audio CD format was pretty similar to the other one I had listened to, namely, it involves a female professional reader who reads in a very dispassionate way, which I prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Old newspaper stories put into an overpriced book to make Ms. Rule some extra spending money.

The rest of the soups in this book are hard to make because there are ingredients I cannot buy in my grocery store. Most of the ingredients are expensive to buy year round and not worth making.

I am however able to go around in Romania, do my shopping, make myself clear in conversations and not feel totally helpless. This book does not waist time on useless practices.

Alex Cross is a pretty decent character in that Patterson tries to make him a believable human being, but he is at a complete loss in dealing with Shafer who is simply a motiveless monster who enjoys killing. As an MI6 agent, he is also highly skilled which makes Cross seem even more bumbling.The body count is astronomical during the first part of the book which makes it difficult to understand why Shafer and his cronies would spare the life of Christine. The Shafer we have seen, and see later, in the book would have dispatched her within milliseconds. So Shafer's killings seem motiveless. The book begins with a vignette on Shafer and ends with the villain which apparently signifies that we cannot escape a malign universe. If your idea of fun is a day at a slaughterhouse, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Usually I enjoy Patterson's books, but this one leaves a lot to be desired.

It starts out good, with a terribly devious villain, but the last third of the book is boring, unsatisfying, too wordy (I was skipping whole pages without missing any story) and without logical connection to reality. It almost makes me not want to read any more of the Cross books, except I probably will because you can always find them in airports..."},{"rating":"1","title":"good story...bad details","review":"All the Alex Cross books that I've read are good but when an author doesn't get his detail right it really ruins a book. Case in point...when Alex take the safety off on his Glock. Glocks don't have safeties you can switch on and off like most guns do. So what we have here is an author whose trying to make his character cool by using a cool gun but the author doesn't know enough about what he's writing to be real. This is not the first time Patterson has made this mistake which only makes me wonder how many others he's made. Kind of makes me think he did just enough research to find out what the police in DC carry and that was that. He tells a good story but he needs to get his facts straight to make his books very good to great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better....","review":"Patterson has grown to be one of my favorite, but this book left me wanting something... the trial, Christine's disappearance, the quick deaths of the Horsemen.... I felt like there was not enough time to develop any of these things... Like a movie that can't be more than 2 hrs... I'm sorry but this one does not stack up high on the Alex Cross list... I know Shafer will be back and I hope Patterson will be back the type of story telling that has may many of us follow him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting villain, nothing much else","review":"Reading a Alex Cross book by Patterson means that you will get a pretty good characterization of the villain while every other character in the book , including the protagonist, is glossed over and given very superficial coverage. The plot is OK , but falls apart in the end, and dialogue doesn't seem to be one of Patterson's strong points. What is one of his strong points is, like I said earlier, the in-depth look he gives at his bad guys, explaining the motivations and origins of these characters. If Patterson seemed to be half as interested in exploring Cross and his supporting cast as he is the villain, his books would be a lot better. Also his plots usually hold up better than they do this time around. If you have to read every Alex Cross novel just check this out from the library, otherwise don't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pop goes the Weasel","review":"My favorite author failed his fans this time.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Disappointed in the villain; his rather dry and relentless trail of kills; the bland romance and the now shop-worn descriptions of his family life. Even the ending was TV-movie stale, a convoluted \\"happily ever after.\\" Does this mean I won't line up to buy Patterson's next book? Of course I'll be in line, while re-reading \\"When the Wind Blows\\" and hoping for something a little more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cranked out book","review":"After reading this book, I will not read another by this author. It appears he was given a large advance for a quick book. It was not proof read as there are several obvious errors with characters, timelines, etc. The story line was weak and unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Goes his Talent","review":"Like John Grisham, Patterson seems to be grinding out schlock, hoping readers will give him the benefit of the doubt. This book suffers from gore for gore's sake, a villain too psychotic to engage the reader, and a thin, derivative plot. Earlier Alex Cross books were far better, and Patterson is in danger of ruining a good character by making him boring. He should take more time to do research before writing, and find a better editor, because this book was a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"James Patterson has scraped the bottom of the barrel for this one. Gross subject, poorly written (especially the dialogue between Alex Cross and his daughter), plot full of holes, and an ending that is laughable. One of those books that makes you wonder if his editor and publisher actually even read the thing before they sent it to typesetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"Sometimes a bad book just keeps you in. In this case, the ending proved that you just wasted your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do writers change","review":"i have always enjoyed mr. patterson's books, but again another writer has fallen into the mode of other male writers of mystery/thrillers. i don't understand why they have to put a woman as a center of a book and write on and on about that one character. this book was more like a barbara cartland read then a good mystery/thriller type book. it had all of the markings/makings of his previous book, but he was engrossed with the female character and his family. sanford did the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again!","review":"I thought I would give James Patterson another chance, but never again. Why does every other chapter need to have Alex Cross become mushy about how much he loves his family? I think it's great that they are so close, but it does nothing to add to the storyline. In addition, the dialogue is not believable and the errors are ridiculous. I almost stopped reading after the error in chapter 40. In fact, I skimmed the last 100 pages because I was so bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I'm sorry I wasted my money buying this book. It gives the impression that it was dashed off by Patterson just to have another book on the market. It's like a committee produced \\"work\\" and a poor one, at that. At best, a poor sterotype of the species. I was attracted to it, not only because of Patterson, but because of the Wash. DC setting. Unfortunately, Patterson shows that he knows very little about the city and didn't bother to do much research. His geography is inconsistent and usually wrong. I would not recommend this book to anyone and wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial Hollywood screenplay","review":"A very disappointing read I had to will myself to finish. No suspense whatever; characters are sketchy caricatures. Not even a particularly interesting story line, in that everything was absolutely predictable. Grade B Hollywood stuff.I had the strong sense throughout that the author simply dashed this off in his spare time. It's also most unfortunate that he found it necessary to use bipolar disorder as the principal motivator for his demented wacko serial killer. There are LOTS of these unfortunates out there, and they have their hands full just making it from day to day. The last thing they need it the additional ostracism that will likely follow wide popular acceptance of this novel.Save your time and your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This was the first Patterson book I read and, after all the hype, I was expecting great things. But it's shockingly bad!The villain is presumably intended to be the ultimate in evil, a sort of Hannibal Lektor for the new millennium. But Patterson just can't write like Thomas Harris and the villain is written on such a one-dimensional note of wickedness that he becomes laughable. And for a supposedly fiendish mastermind of evil, he's actually pretty inept.Even worse are the scenes with Detective Alex Cross's family and fiancee, which are glutinously cliched and sentimental. Does anyone in the world really talk this way?There's a splattery conclusion which boosts the body count but which is even more unbelievable than the rest of the book.Crude, inept and very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plop Plop Fizz Fizz","review":"I have read every book in the Alex Cross series and this one is, by far, the worst. First of all, I would suggest that James Patterson do some research on diplomatic immunity and some other small legal doctrines before he decides to write books about such topics. Secondly, the character of Alex Cross needs to have more flaws. In all of the books with Alex Cross, he seems to be able to do no wrong. Finally, I found the whole kidnapping plot, especially the end, incredibly hokey and unbelieveable. I found myself saying \\"yeah right\\" at the end of the book and shaking my head in disgust. I have about had it with the Alex Cross series. Unless the next book is 100% better, then I am through with Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"W O W !","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a fast read and I must disagree with some of the previous reviewers. I am not that familiar with the DC area so the complaints about the errors in local don't mean anything to me and I don't think they should. It's fiction. And if I wanted a lesson in drugs I would go to the reference section instead of the fiction section. This stuff does not matter. This was one of those books that keep you reading into the night-and that is hard to find. I'll agree the editing could have been better about the engagement. it was kind of confusing. At the end I was still flipping pages so I hope this story continues. I thought it was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Damn Shame","review":"It's a pity Patters knocked out this book.It's got the 'Oh what the hell, those idiots will buy and read anything I write' label slapped all over it.Well, he was right.

The fantasy games and The Weasel were certainly innovative, but the impact that this traumatic case might have on the lives of his family (don't worry, I won't spoil it by saying more) are touched on in such a superficial way it's almost offensive. Alex Cross loves his kids, fiancee and old nana, right? I would have appreciated it if he spent more time on them during his narrative. He seems almost as uninterested in the effects this case may have on his family as the Weasel is about his ex-pat clan, and the Weasel is a sociopath! Show us a little more humanity, and we'll carry Alex Cross around with us a little longer after the book is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he serious?","review":"James Patterson honestly had me going the first few chapters of this book. As I read on, not only did I become frustrated but I started to look for the receipt for the book so I can take it back. The plot was very thin and chapters were even thinner. I sure hope whatever Alex Cross sequel comes out , it'll be 10 times better than Pop Goes The Weasel.Patterson is lucky I couldn't give him one and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has he EVER been in DC?","review":"I don't think he KNOWS DC, perhaps he read about it in a book... His dialogue (especially African American's \\"speak\\" in DC) is horrible!Filled with cliches and trite conversations... unbelievable for anyone who knows the District of Columbia!UGGGGG.... pass this one up!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Goes the Series","review":"The plot and climax of the latest Alex Cross serial killer chase leaves the reader wanting the book, if not the series, to end quickly. The villians in this series are getting more and more cartoony, and the dull detours into the personal life of Alex Cross almost bring the novel to a halt. There is little doubt where the novel's plot will lead, and the climatic scene is difficult, if not impossible, to take seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone ever edit manuscripts anymore?","review":"There are tons of errors in this book that even basic research and editing should have caught. It is almost as if more than one person wrote the novel and they did not keep each other informed. An example: At the beginning of chapter 27 Alex Cross tells his family that his girlfriend has agreed to marry him. They are all very happy. At the beginning of chapter 40 Alex says, \\"Christine and I are going to get married soon, and then we'll all live together.\\" \\"You asked her?\\" they all exclaimed. Yes, in chapter 27 when you all got excited the first time. It makes for very choppy reading. You stop believing in the integrity of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be \\"Plop Went the Weasel\\"","review":"Too many sub-stories, short chapters, and an excessive cast of characters are used to convey an over-abundance of information. The author seems to deliberately distort and exploit \\"Manic-Depression\\" symptoms to create the mind-set for the crazed villian. Once again, Alex Cross's family members and/or love interest serve as the central target for the book's villian (ho hum). The ending expects a lot from the reader who will turn the last page, shake their head, and wonder if they want to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Good entertainment. Patterson has interesting characters and good plotline. Listening to this novel while traveling makes a trip seem shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"James does it again.....","review":"I have been reading all the Alex Cross books in order. I was impressed with this one. I especially liked the ending - there was a nice little twist to it. It is an easy book to read with nice short chapters - the only problem is you tell yourself you are just going to read one more and then before you notice you have read another 100 pages ! BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the Thriller Junkie","review":"Pop Goes the Weasel was intense and I just couldn't stop reading. A sucker for a good novel about serial killers, I thought the book was engaging and I got deep within the characters. My complaint is always that a book like this is easy to digest but leaves you still wanting more. If you are a thriller junkie you will love this book even if you haven't read any of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second strike - next one and he's out!","review":"What a disappointment! I didn't think things could get much worse after the \\"Wind Blows\\" disaster, but this book is terrible. Talk about unbelievable. And, it's full of holes and outright plot errors. In the past, a Patterson book was a delight to read, but his last two have been a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is far too generous","review":"Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. The dialoge is awful, the plot is very predictible, and the characters are laughable (especially the villian). Very clumsily written. What ever you do, save your time and money and stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable with no thrills!","review":"Having read all of James Patterson's Alex Cross novels, this one falls short of what I have come to expect of the Ace Detective. The book somehow as not connected. The murders, the game, the characters playing the game, the trial, the wife, the family, the doctor. . .TOO MUCH. By the time I made it to the end, and it was hard getting there, I was a little pleased. Despite this book I'll read the next. PS, three of us in the family have read the book. We each had the same reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editors/Proofreaders: Where are you!","review":"I am a voracious reader and like nothing better than a great plot and great writing. There's nothing worse than being completely engrossed in a book and then having glaring editing errors throw you out of the story! I've read the other reviews here and am glad that others noticed the same mistakes that I did. The same announcement to Cross's family on two different occasions; the recognition of a caller's voice, when in fact the previous contact was made by e-mail; and the fact that a conversation with the murderer's wife that occurs several days after one of the murders is remembered by Cross as having occurred on the night of the murder! For an author of Patterson's caliber, it would sure make a difference if he slowed down and the editors/proofreaders speeded up. I have enjoyed all of Patterson's books (with the exception of When the Wind Blows) up until now. Next time, rather than buying the book in hard cover, I'll get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"The back cover states that James Patterson is the nations #1 mystery (or was it thriller?) writer. I doubt it. Have you ever read a passage of dialog so bad it's painful? Mr. Patterson manages it over and over. Basically, the book is not worth the time required to read it. I gave it one star since the form wouldn't accept 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin, very thin.","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present and don't have the heart to tell the person who gave it to me how bad it really is. I'm disappointed with this book because: 1. Patterson delights in using graphic detail to compensate for his lack of literary style; 2. The plot is superficial and the character development is virtually nonexistent; 3. When an author writes very short chapters, it often means that they cannot provide any depth of detail...a case in point in this instance; and finally: 4. How many times can a writer overuse a theme before they're found guilty of a complete lack of imagination?"},{"rating":"1","title":"pop goes the weasel","review":"When Jim Patterson first started writing, his stories and characters had depth, maturity and interest. Now with his last two novels I find his writing and storylines to be immature and geared toward an 11th grade education level. With dialogue that is right out of a high school play. I expect more from Patterson. Maybe he should stop worrying about producing the next \\"Alex Cross\\" novel-that he believes everyone is waiting for -and start concentrating on producing a novel that talks to his original \\"mature\\" audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great writer ... great read!

Keep reading folks. You are almost there. There is an end in sight. Really there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old dribble","review":"A few years ago I abandoned James Patterson because every book was exactly the same. I decided to give him another shot and I can't believe I wasted my time and money on this. I enjoy a good, fun, easy read as an escape from non-fiction and heady stuff. I also hate to not finish a book... even if it's bad. But Patterson is, in my opinion, an incredibly tiresome writer. His books are cluttered with totally unimportant, irrelevant and unnecessary details and dialogue, and are therefore entirely too long. I could be more specific, but then I'd be guilty of the same authoring shortcomings of which I accuse Patterson. Simply put, this book stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thriller that is too thrilling...","review":"If you're looking for a book to distract you while you're exercising this book is fine. Otherwise it can be very annoying. Much of it is unrealistic and simplistic. A lot of it didn't make sense. The bad guy does all sorts of horrendous deeds over a period of years and never screws up. He also escapes over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game is ON!","review":"In Pop Geos the Weasel, Dr. Alex Cross takes on a intelligent, ruthless, spineless, black heart of a killer named Geoffrey Shafer aka the Weasel. Dr. Cross gets caught in the middle of a game, that very quickly turns out to be personal. Once the lovely Christine gets kidnapped, Alex is determiend to find this heartless killer. With the help of Detective Patsy Hampton, Sampson and a few others Alex tries to keep playing the game that the Weasel has established and fears constantly for Christine's safety.For me this was a really quick page-turner and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I'm a big James Patterson fan, and this book surely doesn't disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't wait to get to the end....","review":"This was another great Alex Cross book. I listen to most of them on tape and simply adore the reader for Cross's books. I cannot understand the failure of this book to be a 4 or 5 star book as it's another amazing adventure, both in crime and in Alex's love life. I've found all of the Cross books and Murder Club books by Patterson to be simply wonderful reads (or in my case 'listens'). Most of his other books are great too, but a few are a bit off the wall. I'm thrilled that he writes so many books every year as he's become one of my all time favorite authors. His women are real women, not unlikeable bitches like so many male authors write. His men are real men. And unlike other authors, I don't get tired of the same characters. Great read...get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing","review":"Too bad, the book would have been much more of a pleasure if the editor (or the author) had taken time to realize that the same surprise announcement is communicated to the Cross family twice, once in Chapter 27 and once in Chapter 40"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Alex Cross?","review":"Pop Goes The Weasel starts out with a bang. The villan is incredibly compelling. Unfortunately, he's the best thing about the book.\\"Kiss the Girls\\" made me a fan of the Alex Cross series. This book does not measure up to the earier installments. In fact, Dr. Cross has become a very annoying, schmaltzy character. I couldn't stand to read the \\"home\\" scenes, I felt like I was reading a bad Oprah self help book on happy families. When Dr. Cross's fiancee is kidnapped, I couldn't have cared less.I skimmed through the the 2nd half of the book. This is the end of the series for me, I won't pick up another of these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost me with the ending","review":"I LOVE Patterson's series and this book was as captivating as any other of Detective Cross' cases...UNTIL the end...It seemed all to rushed and out of nowhere. Usually Patterson ends his stories well and yet leaves enough room to wonder about the next book. But this one lost me with the ending. I guess it was a good plan in that I HAVE to read the next one...when it comes out in paperback of course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but I hope that this doesn't end the Alex Cross.","review":"I enjoyed this book. I read it about 2 days which is very usual for the James Patterson books. Once again James Patterson proved that he is a great writer.

I just hope that this does not end the Alex Cross series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"Utterly predictable, Patterson gives away his plot \\"twists\\" with all the subtlety of a rubber mallet between the eyes. The endless repetition of the \\"police ignore the murders in SE Washington\\" theme made my eyes cross. Its also poorly edited--- in two different places in the book he tells his family about his engagement, and its mighty weird that they're surprised the second time, and then whoops and hugging follow, yet again. I generally enjoy Patterson's works, but this was tedious beyond belief. If the power hadn't been out, leaving me with nothing else to do by candlelight, I probably wouldn't have finished this."},{"rating":"1","title":"First poor Alex Cross novel","review":"Patterson's slide into unequivocable decline was most obvious here. It is merely a retread of previous Alex Cross plot devices cobbled together under a different title.

Stop it. Now! Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting storyline ...","review":"This is the first book I've read by James Patterson, and mostly due to peer pressure from friends who couldn't believe I had never picked up a book by this author before... Patterson certainly has a way with storylines....and knows how to draw the reader into the script. There is enough action, details and excitement to keep the reader hooked.I have one negative comment when it comes to the way the story was constructed: Patterson tries to counterbalance the 'evilness' of his scenarios by using a 'perfect' hero (in this case Alex Cross) with the perfect life, perfect family etc.. If you have a difficult time with sappy characters, this can aggravate you after a while. I think Patterson tried to show the good versus evil stand off by doing so, but it comes out of left field."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIFIC AUTHOR BUT A DISAPPOINTING BOOK!","review":"Anyone who has read James Patterson's earlier books knows he is a fantastic author, so what happened here? It seems that Mr. Patterson was in a terrific rush to give us something new and wrote this in a frantic rush to satisfy our craving for a new book. The result was disappointing. Few children, no matter how exceptionally brilliant and mature for their years, think and speak like Alex's daughter. The family scenarios, and the entire book for that matter, reminded me of little more than an over-dramatic soap opera. From the abduction of Christine to the final ending, the complete episode was just too weak, far-fetched and lacked substance.Mr. Patterson is a fantastic author. Anyone who has read his earlier books, \\"Along Came a Spider,\\" \\"Jack and Jill,\\" and \\"Kiss the Girls,\\" for example, knows how talented he truly is, but this book showed very little of the creative writing of the James Patterson we have come to know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Boring Book!","review":"This book is extremely boring and predictible. If your time is of any value, stay away from it.It is a pure waste of paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, this would be easy to abridge","review":"Why? Well, the guy can't write. Not only does he need a ruthless editor who could send it back with a note saying \\"Please do not use a thesaurus until you've read more widely.\\" He needs a reader who doesn't mind characters who have no depth and little hint of anything below the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Loved all previous Alex Cross, but should have know Patterson was losing it when he wrote that \\"Butterfly girl\\" sci-fi wannabe. Who was that man disguised as Alex? And the bad guy? - - couple of sick scenarios, but no suspense or backbone. What a bore! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Patterson I have come to expect","review":"While I enjoyed the characterization a great deal (Patterson is wonderful with putting the reader into a character), the story, I felt was thin on plot compared to his past works. I found myself asking, is there something the author is holding back until later in the story? I was disappointed to discover there wasn't...the book was too predictable, also. The villain was probably the most convincing character. Patterson remains a gifted writer, but I have a feeling fans might feel a little let down by this formulaic storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't hold my interest","review":"I skipped most pages of this book and I dont' feel like I missed anything. The weasel would kill someone and that would be that, no character development of the victim. I'm done reading the Alex Cross novels. Lifeguard was great, you would have thought a different author wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross Ph.D., Is The Man.","review":"Without a doubt,James Patterson has captured the attention of me, when he created the character Alex Cross.I've now read all but two of Patterson's books surrounding Alex Cros Ph.D.to date, and I'm still as mesmerized as when I picked up the first one.When you have been brought up listening to radio and had to use all of your imagination to create the essence of a story, I guess you'll understand why this character is so great.It's the \\"suspense and the unknown\\" that's the head of these plots with Cross. He's a brilliant detective as well as an accomplished psychologist. The two together makes one continue to sit on the edge of their seats, biting their nails and waiting for the unknown to occur.I will continue to read the Alex Cross Series, until Patterson creates another to replace him. Until then, Alex Cross Ph.D. you're the man........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This is my first Patterson novel. I found the characters shallow, the writing style sophomoric, and the ending not only highly unlikely, but also frustrating. I plan to read \\"Kiss the Girls\\" just to have another data point, but if it is not significantly better in all respects than \\"Pop Goes the Weasle,\\" it will be my last Patterson novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to James Patterson?","review":"Boring, predicatable, Alex Cross is getting old and tired way to early in his literary career.

I am reminded of the Sean Dillon series of novels by Jack Higgins. I swear to this day that someone else is writing the Dillon novels and putting Higgins name on them. Do writers sub-contract? And now we have Pop Goes The Weasel. Either someone else wrote this book or Mr. Patterson himself is somewhat bipolar. I found myself frustrated through nearly the whole book. The manner in which Christine is kidnapped, held for such a long time and not harmed at all is so totally unbelievable that I am embarrassed for Patterson for having conceived it. I just hope now that John Sandford doesn't fall Prey to the affliction that has struck Mr.Higgins and Mr. Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross - thank god you're back.","review":"After trying his hand - and failing miserably with - a Dean Koontzesque thriller (\\"When the Wind Blows\\"), Patterson returns with Dr. Alex Cross and scores big. If you've never read Patterson's Cross books and you like this genre, pick them up. Cross, Harry Bosch, Lou Boldt and Lucas Davenport - four names you should know if you're into thrillers.With this book, Patterson introduces a well-crafted, complex foe for Cross to battle.If you've ever read any of Patterson's Cross books before, this one won't disappoint. If you've only ever read \\"When the Wind Blows\\", don't let that scare you off - give this book a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"a primer type book, typical of pattersons style","review":"altho i admit that i enjoyed reading this book, and would love to have a friend like alex cross, the primer style writing of a much too predictable plot is a disappointment. what a pity that he enjoys the reputation that he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Empire Strikes Back\\" of Alex Cross Series","review":"I am a huge fan of James Patterson's writing. I even liked \\"When the Wind Blows\\" -- a lot. However, I found this long-awaited novel sadly disappointing. \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" read like it was written for the movie screen rather than for the avid reader and seemed like a set-up for a sequel. It had some wonderful passages but was mostly predictable and disappointing. How could you, James?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better, much better","review":"While the plot of James Patterson's Book, Pop Goes the Weasel, has potential, his writing style and character definition do not. The reactions and interactions of his two-dimensional characters are unrealistic and corny. It was like reading a (poorly written) romance novel. I wouldn't recommend it to mystery buffs or general readers and will not buy another of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Star","review":"What amazes me is how anyone can rate this book.I'm finished with Patterson.Get into Jeff Deaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mystery. Predictable","review":"As an avid James Patterson reader, I decided to give him another shot after reading When the Wind Blows. Now, after I painfully completed \\"Pop\\",I will have to reconsider any further novels by him. I found this novel predictable and without mystery at all. The characters were boring and the writing \\"sappy\\".There was no intrigue to the murders and even Samson was weak. The children's dialogue were overgrown and Nana got on my nerves. The only positive thing is, is that I borrowed this book from the library instead of purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing for the highly acclaimed author.","review":"I've read the other books in James Patterson's series following Alex Cross, but I must say that this was far beyond dissapointing. After a friend of mine suggested I check it out, I went immediately to buy it. It seems as if it were a story made for children with its overusage of plain disgustingness. The only reason I rate this book with any stars at all is because of the excitement of it. It went at a fairly rapid pace, and even though the plot was in one word stupid, it was a good read if you're looking for shallow. I was on the verge of putting this book down several times, but I need credit for classes, and for some reason or another reading this partiular book was said to raise my grade. I'm not so sure it will after the degrading report I give of it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson Strikes \\"Gold\\" Again!","review":"A novel that is followed by the thrilling \\"Cat and Mouse\\", Patterson again shows why he is one of today's best thriller writers. A non-stop, page turner that is sure to caue some lost sleeping hours due to the anticipation of the next chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson and Cross Keep Rolling","review":"5th in the series and the Alex Cross books rock! Patterson is a dynamic writer who easily sets a scene, creates a thrilling plot and has provided us with characters of depth who we care about. Easily one of the best writers of our generation and the Cross series is at the top of the genre. Can't wait to continue all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same...","review":"James Patterson repeats his usual formula: impossibly clever and strong bad guy threatens Alex Cross's loved ones. The plot was interesting in the first few books but now feels tired and worn.

If you like boring, ugh, books, go for it...ugh"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the scariest","review":"This Book is by far one of Patterson's Scariest books. The Villain is just beyond INSANE. THIS IS A MUST READ! A thriller above thillers. Only to compare to Kiss the Girls. Non stop. My husband who is not a thriller book fan, read it in a weekend non stop.This book is faced paced and wild. It also has political twist' and turns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to please everyone - and fails","review":"This book attempts to please too many fan genres - romance novel, thriller, cop story. It is impossible to try to appeal to a guy mentality and overtly appeal to fans of cheesy romance novels. I personally kept rolling my eyes at his over the top use of prose. The main character is this weird blend of super cop/dad/emotional wuss.The plot is fairly predictable and got old fast. It would have been far more effective if it was half as long. Shame on his editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow writing","review":"I thought this was one of his worst books. The writing was very shallow, the character development was weak. The author did not exploit the characters feelings in any significant way. When one's fiance is kidnapped and disappears for over a year, you would expect more from the loss than the occasional sentence indicating that he still felt bad. I found myself reading the story and wondering what else the author had going on in HIS life, obviously he wasn't real interested in writing this book. I felt like the author was in a hurry to write the book, and I found myself hurrying through the book so I could get on to something better.It left me still hungry for a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Alex Cross yet!!","review":"I have always found it difficult to put an Alex Cross novel down, but I simply could not stop reading Pop Goes The Weasel! Cross is up against a most brilliant, demented psycho who 'hides' behind diplomatic immunity!! Geoffrey Shafer is involved in a dangerous role playing game with three other ex-British intelligence individuals. Are they really only 'playing' or are they real, cold-blooded murderers? Cross's fiance, Christine Johnson, is kidnapped while on vacation with Cross and his family and although Cross knows that Shafer has something to do with it, he simply can't prove it. Shafer tries to frame Cross for the murder of a fellow DC detective and almost pulls it off! He constantly taunts Cross and is so clever at it.I felt really cheated when I finished the book because I really didn't want it to end. I envy anyone who hasn't read it yet, cause you're in for a real treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest entry in the Alex Cross series.","review":"I have read all the Patterson books featuring Alex Cross and like all series books they become increasingly routine and in the case of the current entry, downright dull. The bad guy(s) aren't menacing enough and the plot is so predictable that you know exactly what and when it will happen. Like Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books, the Patterson books have become too dependent on his family life. In this one his girlfriend Christine becomes a main player. If you like a quick read without much thinking, then this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Entry to the Alex Cross Series","review":"I did not like this one in the least as it deals with a group of people who murder in a role-playing game they create over the internet and ends up coming off like a very bad Italian splatter movie complete with a banal plot, obviously no concept of internet security and wire tracing, cornflakes box characters and nothing of the kind of intelligence or pace that went into other Alex Cross books. Also the Cross backstory takes horrible turns becoming something like the Brady Bunch. Get the originals or a sequel like Cast & Mouse rather than this failure concept. Patterson totally lost it with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Had Saved My Money","review":"I loved \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Along Came A Spider\\", but this book put me to sleep.It is predictable and I personally am tired of the \\"filler lines\\" about Cross's perfect children, perfect girlfriend, perfect partner and let us not forget the perfect Grandmother.It is almost becoming drippy! And Patterson repeats himself more than once in this book.I think the Weasel could be an interesting villain, and the game certainly kept my interest...but almost NOTHING ELSE DID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When reading a book, it's either going to be good or bad.. fairly simple. I listened to the CD version and I was so turned off by two narrators that I didn't care to listen to it any longer. I love James Patterson's novels and I was really looking forward to this one. However, I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I thought this book was REALLY BAD, and I have no idea why I even read the entire thing. It was predictable and silly. There were no surprises, and the villian was boring. ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Dung, But Needed to be Read","review":"I have read, and will continue to read, all of Patterson's novels, but this one was boring, with a \\"capital B\\". Anyone who thinks this book measures up to Kiss the Girls or Jack & Jill is off their rocker! Patterson should stay away from the law, as he knows nothing about it (as shown in Pop). In conclusion, while Morgan Freeman is a great actor (side note - the movie sucked), I keep picturing Denzel Washington as Alex when I read the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alex needs more ?","review":"When I first discovered that James Patterson had written a new book I broke my neck to get it. After reading it though I find that it really wasn't worth me killing myself over it. Mr Patterson keep me enthralled with Kiss the Girls. \\"Pop goes the Weasel\\" makes me want to do exactly that POP! There is no depth or understanding to Alex's character, and Christine seems to get only passing mention in reference to thier relationship. If you want to make a movie out of this one you'll have to have stronger actors in order for the movie to carry it's weight. Might I suggest Laurence Fishburne or Ving Rhimes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Alex Cross Masterpiece!","review":"Pop Goes The Weasel has topped my books read so far in 1999. Fantastic Alex Cross experience of suspense. I'm happy for Alex & Christine. I held quite a bit of hope in my heart that she was ok. Geoff Shafer is another amazing and shocking character. As for Nana and the kids. Keep 'em in the books. They are and must be a part of every Alex Cross suspense thriller. Great job Mr. Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"POP goes Cross!!!!!!","review":"Patterson latest shows signs of early retirement for the author. Dull,dull, and more dull. Is this the same guy who wrote \\"Along Came A Spider\\"? Even his photograph looks different."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-rated for violence","review":"This is the third James Patterson book I've read or listened to. I listened to part of this. The violence was too graphic. I really didn't need to know the details of the gruesome murders. Then when the sociopath killed the two teenage girls and arranged their bodies ... well, I hit \\"stop\\" and \\"rewind\\" on my tape recorder. I don't need to have that sort of thing clatter around in my brain.I like Alex Cross because he's so loving and gentle. I know there is going to be violence in a murder mystery, but this seemed perverted to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"More garbage.......","review":"Fool me once......Pop Goes the Weasel only confirmed what I suspected after finishing When the Wind Blows. Patterson is written out. Either that or he is subcontracting out his books. Never again for this reader. This makes two hardcovers I want my money back on. Pure drivel. I just finished Micheal Connelly's new book \\"Void Moon\\". If your want to read a truly great book, pick that one up. You will feel your money was well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos in Kindle","review":"This is really a question for Kindle readers.

Was not able to put it down!","review":"James Patterson writes another entertaining novel. His latest work is a book readers dream. The characters and story move at an avid pace. As a readers you will never feel as if you could put this book down. Once again the character of Alex Cross is the main focus of the story as we go along with him on his latest journey and we learn a little more about the intricacies that make up the man. Recommended to all of James Patterson's readers and to those who will become new followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"If you consider McDonalds and Adam Sandler \\"great\\", then you're among the 5 star reviewers here and would think Pop Goes The Weasel is \\"great\\".The Alex Cross narrative is painfully amatuerish, the villian is flat, even the murders are dull. Although I'm sure its all just fascinating for anyone first learning to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop goes the Weasel","review":"Fantastic book!

Stongly recommend any of the Alex Cross series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing noevl","review":"I've been hearing so much about this series that I finally decided to go out and read this book. Unfortunately, I thought it left much to be desired. The writing is incredibly simplistic, and the plot is way to predictable. I have no way of comparing this to any of his other novels, so maybe I'm just not a fan of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you guessing until the end","review":"James Patterson has created Alex Cross so well, that he can be hard to distinguish from reality. He is a wonderful father, an upstanding citizen, an excelent cop, and a brilliant psychologist.Pop Goes The Weasle, the latest installment of Alex Cross, gives his fans almost everything they could ask for and some they don't want!.Just when Alex is the happiest he has ever been, the events surrounding the latest psychokiller threaten to make this the worst time of his life (even worse than when his wife was killed).Will Alex pop the question to Christine? Will Alex prove to be a \\"bad cop\\", or worse yet a murderer? Will Alex lose what he holds dearest to his heart?Read this book, and these questions and more will reel you in and keep you hooked until the very last page.One caution! Don't read this book if you want a long read. I read this book in about 12 hours with no trouble!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GIVE ME MORE!!","review":"Fantastic - another James Patterson hit!! I have become addicted to Alex Cross, John Sampson and the rest of the \\"crew\\"..Give me more!! Another thriller that kept the pages turning, as quickly as I could read. Edge of my seat suspense as I waited to find out Christine's fate and whether Alex would be the victor in another game of 'Cat and Mouse'...James Patterson, my question for you is: Can't you write faster? I wait months for your next release and read it in a night! Definately worth the read, especially if you are already a James Patterson/Alex Cross fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be negative star ratings for books like this","review":"The plot has the makings of a good novel. Unfortunately James Paterson has no idea how to write one. There is no tension, thrills are ironed out with bland passive writing, and in the end who cares what happens to Alex Cross. I tried another Paterson novel and it was a clone of the first. don't waste money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"Previous books by James Patterson were pretty good; why was this one rushed into print? The story starts out OK, but the farther I got in the book the more I found myself disbelieving, disappointed, etc. It just doesn't make any sense, and left me feeling that I had really wasted my time. Most paperbacks that I read get resold or donated; this one went straight into the trash. Didn't anyone (including Patterson) take the time to read it before publishing it, and see how terribly weak it is? The main character is unlikable (so perfect you hope he gets taken out), the villain is completely inconsistent, the situations implausible, there are too many loose threads, the ending is ridiculous. Actually, there is no ending, it's just a setup for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Bad book. This guy's talent has entirely dissipated.

Reading all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story is too Predictable and Ended Like a Romance Novel","review":"I am normally a big James Patterson fan. I have read all his books and usually feel they are \\"page turners\\"Pop Goes the Weasel isn't a page turner. There were key places where I predicted what was going to happen and sure enough - it happened just that way. I like to be surprised.I think he gave the sappy romantic ending away early in the book. It wasn't obvious but it was there.Not the suspense I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alex in Wonderland","review":"I have always been a fan, so I am going to give the benefit of the doubt and attribute the weakness of this latest to exhaustion and a lapse in literary judgment. One thing that struck me as particularly odd about this book is the amount of attention given to Alex's age and good looks, especially since the role of Alex Cross has already been portrayed by Morgan Freeman, who happens to be one of my favorite actors but is certainly no longer even close to age 41 or so strikingly handsome. Well, I don't imagine that any producer in his/her right mind or Morgan Freeman would risk money or career on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing...","review":"I could not wait to get my hands on this new James Patterson novel. Alex Cross is my favorite! However, Pop Goes the Weasel was certainly not up to par with Patterson's other works. I finished the book with feelings of boredom and disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Goes the Weasel","review":"Sloopy! Too far fetched! Example: When Weasel goes to trial, why don't they attempt to use the evidence from the old cab? After Alex has chased this guy for almost five hundred pages the ending was like McDonalds when you expect steak. Did Weasel kill the cop? Seems kind of convenient and almost an afterthought as to how Christine got mixed up with \\"War\\".Been a fan of the other two books but, in my opinion, this one is not one of Mr. Patterson's best efforts. However, he is still making a ton of money and I paid the twenty something dollars for this sorry effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"PEEEWWWWW","review":"After three chapters, I laid this down, in fact I gave it away. Has to be the worst of all of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson, puh leez","review":"I read Kiss the Girs, a serial killer. Then Spider, aha, another serial killer. Now Pop Goes the Weasel, well he popped and we got that krap all over us. This book is for those who have a choice, Nancy Drew or Pop Goes the Weasel. Patterson uses quantity instead of quality. Forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me??????","review":"back to back lemons. Jack and Jill and now this trash! Patterson, come on!!! Was this the initial draft??? Yea, the ending was as unbelieveable as the Cosner movie, DragonFly. I wonder who stole whos idea with the child at the end. Anyway, if you wish to read a good Patterson book, read Lifeguard, Honeymoon, Judge and Jury or Kiss the girls. When you get this book in your hands, treat it as if it were a rattlesnake and just drop it. Why was Christine Johnson kidnapped? They (bad guys could of used her far more than they did. What was the purpose of her kidnapping if it were not to keep Cross from the investigation? They could of put her on the phone to plead for cross to stop the investigation.

Hopefully regains it next time.","review":"This book in hardback is not worth the hard cash. In paperback, it probably is. If \\"When the Wind Blows\\" was 1 star, this has to be at least better, but not by much. There is no suspense, intrigue and mystery, as in \\"Cat and Mouse\\" and \\"Jack and Jill.\\" The story is so-so, not particularly creative or innovative. The characters are almost typical, and starting to wear thin and, in retrospect, become boring. Perhaps it's time to wrap up these characters, adopt a bit more hard-core approach, and less long-winded \\"sappy\\" style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near the action of previous Cross books","review":"I've always enjoyed his Cross books. They've been written well with plenty of action. I got bored with the love scenes and would have liked more cop scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many family sidebars","review":"I love James Patterson books..they are quick reads with a nice quick pace and lots of suspense. However, one criticism I have and it really comes into play in this book--is his overuse of the family of Alex Cross. It is really too \\"cutesy\\" for my taste. The bad guy in this book was really cool and I loved the premise of the guy being untouchable, but let's lose the bogged down family interactions. Keep it to a minimum please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I am new to this series having read \\"kiss the girls\\", Is this the same author?

It's always a good read, over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex is back...","review":"I love the Alex Cross series. In this adventure Alex must find a serial killer who is involved in a computer role playing game. Alex is also facing increased pressures at work with a boss that doesn't want him around anymore. However, Alex has found the love of his life...Christine.As usual, JPatterson does a great job of weaving each of these story lines and providing enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. The last 100 pages is so intense, you can't put it down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great hopes, - greatly disappointed.","review":"I was very excited to read about another Alex Cross adventure. From the beginning of this tale I was dismayed at the formula writing about the characters who had been developed so well in previous adventures. Then, to add to my disappointment, every time the story line seemed to sag, the author tossed in a far-fetched twist. Alex Cross had been such a strong character with viable and well researched story lines in the past. This book read more like a Nancy Drew mystery novel with a few bizarre red herrings. The storyline was strong enough to make into a memorable novel. I hope the author continues with more Alex Cross stories without cheating himself, his readers, and Alex Cross with another slip-shod attempt like this one. I'd recommend it to readers who have nothing else to read on a rainy day and had to borrow a loaner book. Not a keeper for a library collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot OK, Writing awful","review":"Though the plot of this book was interesting and worked well for its genre (suspense/thriller) the writing style was so juvenile and incompetent that I couldn't believe it had actually been released as is. Patterson seems to have only a basic notion of grammar and sentence structure, is addicted to cheating the reader out of drawing any of his/her own conclusions, uses cliche startlingly often, seems to adore passive voice and seems to now be a big enough name that his editor is afraid to correct him. Perhaps he should transfer his storytelling talent into screenplays, as his narrative voice is abysmal. Recommended only if you can overlook writing ability in favor of plot--I failed, which made this a frustrating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one stinks!","review":"I liked Patterson's other novels but unfortunately, this one stinks. Poorly developed characters, contrived situations, holes in the plot. It bothers me that Alex received the message following Christine's kidnapping by email, but later in the story he \\"remembers\\" the kidnapper's voice delivering the message via telephone.I almost put the book down right then and there, and now wish I had. How quickly did Patterson dash this one out anyway? It also borrows heavily from his previous novels. This book smells of commercialism -- leaves you knowing that a sequel is on it's way (fast, I'll bet) to the press.

I was disappointed with Roses and decided to try an earlier entry in the series. Patterson won't get a third chance.Pop Goes the Weasel put me off very early. Our hero is a widower with small children at home and an extremely time consuming job. When he has spare time he goes for romance when he really should be spending it with the kids. Yet Patterson portrays him as a model father. Frankly, I got disgusted with the combination of over the top villains, attempted family realism and cliched romance. I gave up.The Alex Cross stories are very popular. The reason escapes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"There are some books that you don't expect much from. Books that you know will not be well written or that will not change your life. Yet we read them with no expectations other than a fast food kind of read.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON!","review":"I ordered this book believing it was the complete version, since in the preview \\"Contents Table\\" shows it as the complete version.

Instead, order the cheaper reduced version, or go to your local bookstore and buy the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. This Album ties them with Dream Theater","review":"Ill admit it. At first I thought the vocals were junk compared to the previous albums. But it really grows on you. And christ it is the same singer through out the entire cd, he is very possibly the best vocalist I have ever heard. This being their new cd too, its good to see that they keep progressing (unlike Dream Theater whose last album was horrible music writing with excellent muscianship, still doesnt work, plus Kevin Moore owns Rudess). And Michael Romeo's guitar playing has also progressed, which is good to see, and while hes definately not the most skileld guitarist out there. He definately has an amazingly creative style. You can definately feel his Paul Gilbert influences. Their keyboardist is amazing as well, some very beautiful stuff in this cd. I would buy Divine Wings of Tragedy first, but this is definately their best album and definately worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"The music on this CD is really good; the guys in Symphony X are very talented. However, I outgrew all that jazz and nonsense about dragons and mystical eyes many years ago. I really don't like the lyrics on this CD. If I were to recommend better progressive rock music to listen to, I would say you should check out EVERYTHING that DREAM THEATER has ever done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I can't help but feel that Symphony X are one of the most overrated bands around. There is nothing here you haven't heard before and it's been done far better. Almost all the songs here feel unfinished and there is a distinct lack of good choruses. The choruses are big, but the band seems to lack any true melodic sensibilities. The first track is pretty good, the second is terrible and the rest vary from poor to solid.The vocals are completely cheesy and in some of the softer sections, are so sweet that Celine Dion fans would cringe.I would say that The Damnation Game and Twilight In Olympus are both superior, though still far from brilliant. This one just isn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring.","review":"When I first heard Symphony X, I was bored. I'm a musician myself, and I must say, they have technical talent. Yet, if you consider songwriting skill, they are unoriginal and lack any flavor. If you combine Dream Theater, Pantera, and Yngvie, you get Symphony X. With Yngvie, it was proven that neoclassical is just a pointless heap of exaggeration with weak musical substance. The point is, this album no better than V, which was overall boring as well. Odessey's long epic rips-off Dream Theater, and then precedes to be monotonous. The rest is just, well, Symphony X. Nice try, not good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I heard of this band from watching a World of Warcraft Rogue PvP video (Endless Sacrifice 5, by Eryx) and i immediately ran out and bought the CD. It's just simple amazing how it sounds(and the PvP wasn't bad either :P)"},{"rating":"2","title":"PROG Metal Heroes","review":"What an outstanding band. You need to purchase this as well as their entire collection. These guys put Dream Theater to shame. These guys know when to hold back...they don't go too far, although the drummer does repeat that chuca chuca rythm too much. Nevertheless, this is ear candy: great arrangements, great singing, great music! I almost took off a star for the chuca chuca factor - can get annoying sometimes. But their melodies are absolutely PROG GOD LIKE. The Odyssey is an amazing piece of music. Accolade II is unbelievable. Highly reccommended except for some of the drumming."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my first power metal albums!!!","review":"This was one of the first power/symphonic metal albums that I bought. It surprised me, since I was new to this genre.Lots of loud guitars, fast and simply beautiful.The Odyssey part of the CD is breathtaking. Great music, great lyrics. Everything about this 20min masterpiece simply amazes me. They are a very talented group of musicians.Another one of my favorite tracks has to be the last one, \\"Masquerade\\". Very interesting arrangement, it's very different, but excellent!!!I'd reccommend anything by symphony x. They truly are the master's of power metal. Awesome, amazing, and breathtaking.Looking forward to more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different bonus track for Japan","review":"First off, this is a very good album, probably my 2nd favorite CD of the band beside \\"Divine Wings.....\\". The opening track Inferno (Unleash The Fire) might be one of the best power (not prog) metal songs of all-time, as Russell Allen sings his arse off. The Accolade II is better than the first (off of \\"Divine Wings.....\\"), in my opinion. The re-make of Masquerade is infinitely better than the original, off of their first album. The title track is obviously very long, but is brilliant in some spots, and keeps your interest all the way through.Anyway, just wanted to let you guys know there is a Japanese issue of this CD which has a 10th song, titled \\"Frontiers\\". It is very hard to find, but the song is nothing to write home about."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE SYMPHONY X..RUSSELL ALLEN IS THE BEST ROCK SINGER OF ALL TIME.MICHEAL ROMEO IS THE BEST METAL COMPOSER EVER AND HIS SYMPHONY ARRAINGEMENTS ARE AS GOOD ANY STEVEN SPILLBERG SOUND TRACK.THESE GUYS ARE SO GOOD THAT ONLY YES AND KANSAS HAVE A CHANCE OF EVEN BEING CLOSE IN COMPOSITIONS TO MICHEAL ROMEOS...THIS IS THE BEST NEO CLASSICAL,METAL/VOCAL FUSSION MUSIC EVER WRITTEN.iF YOU LOVE ROCK..AND SHRED GTR WITH GREAT SONGS AND SOLOS,WITH THE BEST VOCALIST WHO HAS A TRAINED VOICE I WOULD BUY SYMPHONY X NO ONE ELSE IS EVEN CLOSE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very epic","review":"I'm very glad I chose this as my first Symphony X album to listen to.

One of the most overlooked bands to come from Lawrence (Status was an overlooked label also), Reflector was a 3-piece that played with ease like a 4 piece.

Very reader \\"unfriendly\\". I had to use this book for a symbolic logic course at the University of Alberta. I found it very frustrating because the examples were few and far between, and were not explained well at all. One has to \\"guess\\" an awful lot.

Now that I'm done University, I'm selling mine......another student can now be frustrated to no end."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAR FROM THE MADDENING CROWD","review":"The film has a zombie feel to it. Daniel(Alton Milne) is fleeing infected humans in his Volvo when it runs out of gas in the Scottish countryside. He manages to make his way to a farmhouse where there is a young woman and nurse (Sandra Louise Douglas) who has managed to survive the viral outbreak. She is a tough cookie who shoots first and doesn't need to ask questions.She has a past that is explored in flashbacks. Daniel is not as tough as her. The film examines the pyschological aspect of a \\"zombie\\" killer, someone who might be a bit insane to begin with. Then another woman shows up who Daniel does not want to kill. The film uses flashbacks and dreams, but not effectively. Ho-hum. A bit lame.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"Well to start off, 25% of the movie you can't hear what they are saying. Poor sound and the background music being way too loud. That is the most annoying thing about this movie. The movie itself has issues as well. Poor lighting bad camera angles it's just irritating. The whole movie seemed to be lacking. You never feel any emotion towards the characters (and you kind of wish they would both die). To add on top of that you have a plot twist that makes no sense (when the girl is kidnapped). Just a bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the best part 1","review":"This album could be called Part one of the high point in the early configuraion of Yes.

The problem is getting the video+audio on another media, ie, DVD or whatever. They have one export feature and that is to AVI, and all it does is export the video. Why have a microphone to record sound and no method to export the audio+video. Anyways, called Sony, and they told me that this camera was not designed to do that. Quote, \\"it was designed to playback on the computer only.\\" What kind of junk is that? 1 star!So if you only want to see the audio and video together on the computer, then this is for you. If you ever want to export your video recording to DVD or anything else, forget about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"I did a fair amount of research and found Canon to be a highly regarded cameras. I have to agree, now being an owner. I previously had a Sony that had slow response times between shots and less then impressive colors and clarity.My family just finshed a week long cruise and used the Canon quite extensively. Very few times did I have to delete a picture because I was unhappy (unlike the sony). I am still getting use to the various 'presets' for diffent environmental setting (portrait, highspeed, etc.).I also bought a 1 gig Ultra Memory Card ($129 @ Best Buy). Must have! Inserted the card, set the camera at the highest resolution, and the camera read 325+ pictures available!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good All Around Camera","review":"The s70 is a good all around camera for the secrete paparazzi in you. At its highest resolution you get amazing detail in the pictures. The digital zoom does make the picture a little grainy, which is a bummer. This is one camera where you need to read the manual if you want to take advantage of all of its features. I was a little disappointed in the TV viewing of my pictures. Perhaps it is my TV but the images are black and white.With this camera you really must upgrade your flash RAM to 2GB. You can pick it up from www.newegg.com for about $100. The high rez pics are very large. I also bought the lens adapter and the tele-lens. Haven't received them yet so I can't let you know how they work.Over all rating of this camera is good. With the other accessories; tripod (large and pocket size), 2GB memory, lens adapter, lens, remote control, and spare battery this setup is great for the dad looking for a camera to capture the family moments in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something getting in the way","review":"This is my first digital camera. It takes great pictures. However, the sliding door is becoming more and more of a nuisance. Just about any contact with it causes the lens to close. Picture a group of smiling friends or relatives. As soon as you hit the shutter button, the camera turns itself off. Then you ask your friends to re-pose. You snap the shutter. Darn, the lens goes in again. You try again. The lens goes in again! Eventually, you succeed in taking a shot. Just about every important shot you want to take, you have to put up with this nuisance. Before long your friends don't want you taking their pictures with this camera; and you don't want to either. Well, I'm actually looking to buy a new camera and thought I'd share my experience with you. :-D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"This camera is great for taking personal photos.

I expected more from a Tom Clancy game."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for Gameplay, But Quality Sucks.","review":"Just another announcement:Basically, the PS3 version is not worth purchasing. The quality of the picture is too blurry. Just creeping around, achieving undetected from your enemies is just a waste of time, since you too can barely see them haft the time. It's like playing a PS2 game on your PS3. A very bad port to the PS3. I'd get the sequel, Rainbow Six: Vegas 2.DON'T BUY IT FOR THE PS3!!! Either get it on the 360 or just get the sequel. The picture quality is important when playing. I don't understand why their are so many perfect scores when the picture quality sucks... unless someone can help me with it. Don't bother telling me about HD... it's like tell someone about Wi-Fi, 3D movies, the IPhone, Droid, the world is round and it revolves around the sun. I got it. That's not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... Its ok","review":"I just purchased this game today from Gamestop. I've played it on the 360 and it was alright. I enjoy squad based shooters, but not this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but only for the people that like squad based shooters, I'm not a big fan of em.

It's okay on co-op but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Just Terrible!","review":"I feel relived that I bought this game used from Gamestop. That allowed me to return it if I didn't like it. I returned it the same day I bought it. This game is just terrible. It was created as a PS2 game, but then was just created on PS3 and Xbox 360. All the company that created this game did was take the PS2 version and write it onto a PS3 and Xbox 360 disc. The graphics look terrible and the lighting effects are worse. It is very hard to see and you sometimes have to use nightvision in plain daylight just to see two feet in front of you. Also, the terrorists are just plain stupid and will stand around and get shot sometimes. At some points in the game, you just sit around wondering what to do next. I know the reviews on this game are great, but please take my advice and rent this game before you spend $30 bucks on this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAST CROSS PLATFORM GAME I BUY ON THE PS3","review":"Well I bought this game yesterday for the PS# console, and once again I was dissappointed. I have bought other games on the PS3 and none of them have impressed me. Now I have all three systems, so I am not biased to anyone of them, but the PS3 calls itself the most powerful gaming console on the market. Well it needs to have games that look like it! This game gets blurry at times and the sounds are way off. For instance, at a few of the times in the game I commanded my team to open a door via explosion and the explosion would happen before the door opened! I must say that this is a fun game, but the \\"jack up\\" graphics deter from this games potential. Lets not talk about the online multiplayer.... It looks like a PS2 game. The whole game looks like a high end PS2 game. So I must say, If you own a PS3 and you doint mind a sub par graphics, then pick this one up. If you own a 360, then pick it up through there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Game Don't Buy","review":"This game looks like it was made for PS2 not PS3. The graphics are muddy and blurry. It is impossible to see more than a few feet. The AI is stupid at best. I don't understand where the good reviews for this game are coming from. Have these people played this game. I feel jipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok - but only allowed to have 1 saved game - thus 2 stars!","review":"Very bad if you mess up, there is only one save point. At the last level it appears there is a glitch where many game users are having a problem with reloading the level (Nevada Dam - Warehouse)where you see Irena thru window - then game crashes destroying the one and only save point. This has happened to several users. According to UBI support you must delete the one and only allowed saved game and reload/restart the game from the beginning again. I tried this twice, and it crashed twice! So I gave up! UBI programers need to learn how to allow multiple save points.Overall the game has good picture quality. Content ok. But for PS3 there are no updates. So I advise buying it used and trying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for Profit","review":"The gameplay gets somewhat old after a couple of hours. There isn't really a chance to get new weapons. The AI swear tons and aren't very smart. The graphics look ps2 at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad scripting cannot replace good A.I.","review":"The game has many good aspects, particularly gameplay dynamics. The controls are effective and intuitive (good cover system) and the graphics are OK. For some reason, though, the game insists on preferring 1080i over 720P even though this creates a hazy pixellated mess out of otherwise first-rate graphics; be sure to disable 1080i/P on your PS3 before playing this title.The storyline is OK but the gameplay is plagued with horrendous scripting and ridiculous spawning (i.e., a terrorist \\"appears\\" behind you in a sealed room and pops one in the back of your head). This makes for an increasingly frustrating experience as the levels become more difficult. It seems as though the only difference between difficulty levels lies in the number of goons that rope down to your vicinity when you walk half way through the rooms.Overall, too many flaws to save from bargain bin status"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"There isn't too much replay value. If you're not a die-hard first-person shooter fan, then you won't get too much pleasure out of the game. It's a little difficult to get used to the \\"right joystick aiming\\" and it has a bit of a learning curve. You can modify the sensitivity and reverse the default aim directions (i.e. moving the joystick up makes the screen move up by default, but you can reverse it).After you beat it, the missions that are unlocked are fun for some time, but you can only enjoy killing terrorists for so long. If the online play doesn't appeal to you, then you should probably wait until the price drops or borrow it from a friend. The graphics aren't amazing like Ninja Gaiden Sigma (1080i vs. 1080p), but the gameplay does get you hooked once you pass the frustration stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible translation to the PS3.... Sorry I bought it! Stick with the 360 version.","review":"I have both the 360 and PS3 and am very sorry I bought this game on the PS3 instead of the 360 - I was thinking that the PS3 version would be better refined and higher resoltion graphically but I was WRONG.It doesn't hold a candle to the 360 version graphically or ease of play wise (if any part of this game can be called easy!) - the 360 version is much more responsive and graphics make a HUGE difference when you're trying to get the bead on a naughty terrorist...Avoid this game on the PS3, buy it on the 360.Sorry to all the PS3 pundits out there, but this is not the best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Competes with COD4, but not quite!!!","review":"This is a good game. It's almost as good as COD4, but not quite. It's a totally different game. COD4 is like a run and gun type of game. There is not a lot of sneaking around. There is a lot of explosions and open area shoot outs. Now, RB6V is more tactical. You are going around from door to door and figuring out ways to get through a door and engage an enemy successfully. It kind of puts you in the mind of Metal Gear, except with a team. You order your team around and they help, tremendously. Most games I've seen that uses a team, their AI sucks. Socom comes to mind. Some of the firefights are intense. The enemy will flank you the best way they can. Plus, you can hear them talk, cuss, and command each other of how to engage you. Very realistic. This game is very good all the way around. If I could grade this game, it would be a B and COD4 an A+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juego de calidad regular","review":"El juego sí es entretenido, sin embargo:Es sumamente corto, predecible, y tiene el final más sin gracia del mundo (y así pretenden que uno se compre la segunda parte).Para tratarse de un juego de PS3, los gráficos son de bajísima calidad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual hero","review":"The story's plot isn't exactly unique, but what made this story a cut above the usual fantasy was the uniqueness of the hero Bransen AKA The Highwayman from the title. He breaks all stereotypes yet he's still heroic and strong in his own way.
