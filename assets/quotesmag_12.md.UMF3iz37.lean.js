There were misspellings and grammatical errors throughout the entire book. It was unbelievable. Never will I read another book by this particular author.... I bought this book based on the synopsis which was grossly over-rated. In the future, I will be leery of trying any new author - to spend the amount of money on a book that took about two hours to read - that had no substance, that was irritatingly in error at least every fifth page - never again. I cannot believe a book of such low caliber was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple story","review":"I would agree that it is a quick read. However, I found the storyline to be rather simple as were the characters. I was shocked at the number of misspelled words and poor punctuation in the book.

I have to thank the author for such a wonderful story. I love to read and I Love Thrillers. I am a harsh judge on writters. I usually only read Thrillers written by Dean Koontz, because I love his style. In addition to that, I will never read books written by Steven King because I do not like his style. I was hesitant to read a thriller by an author other than Koontz, but I gave it a change and I am happy I did. I really enjoyed reading this book, and I was drawn into the book just as I am drawn into the novels of Koontz. I think the author has the nack of writting thrillers and I will be adding her to my list of writters who's Thriller based novels I MUST READ!!Thanks for the suspense and thrills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Awesome Book!","review":"When my wife (an avid reader) recommended this book to me I thought she was nuts. I had anticipated a mushy teenage thriller that you could read with an egg timer. BOY WAS I WRONG! What unfolded was riveting suspenseful story that produced one of the greatest roller coaster rides my mind had taken since the sixties. In fact after I read it I gave it to my teenage daughter to read (my intent was to scare her away from freeks on the internet).

Because of that, the reader can see that she did not take the time nor the effort to research primary resources. The entire book is a compilation of gleanings from other secondary sources. One chapter had only one source, making it more like a book report than a work of historical quality. The stories seem to wander around Colorado and the region as much as the outlaws themselves did. I would expect the same level of writing from a 6th or 7th grader, not a serious researcher of history.

The author's credibility is supported by a three-generation family history in grizzly bear country. His true experience, though, is reflected in his down-to-earth sincerity and simplicity of reporting. Reverence, balanced with pragmatic humor, sets a very ageeable tone for this fascinating book. With only one very moderately bloody-nosed bear photo, you could quite readily share this book with children. I grew up in bear country and now live in the heart of tree-hugging country and I found this book to be true to the core of both. And a darn fine read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple","review":"It seems as though the series needed a filler, so they blew some dust off one of the older series' scripts, changed the names, and let the cameras roll.

I've been idly watching through some of them on Amazon the past couple days.I saw a 2-star review for this episode. I didn't really bother reading it; I know there's some Enterprise hate (which it doesn't TOTALLY deserve). Then I remembered.\\"Oh, wow, not THIS episode.\\"I recognized it as the one where T'Pol teaches a bunch of prisoners or whatever some ridiculous \\"forward roll into a leg sweep and then punch them in the face\\" martial arts. It's just an utterly stupid episode. Why would you ever write something like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are episodes #2 and #24 for Enterprise Season 2?","review":"It is really cool to be able to download episodes and play it on the computer. The Unbox player works well, but sometimes it freezes when switching from full screen into a different mode. The down side? Well, the first disappointment was that I was not able to play the files on my Zune. The second problem is that Season 2 has two missing episodes and Amazon was not able to explain why (at least until now, and after asking twice). If the episodes are not available at least the web site should have mentioned that the season was partial. I would have given more stars but the partial set of episodes spoils the package.I also suggest care on using the \\"brightness\\" and \\"contrast\\" controls of the \\"Unbox player\\". When the player is initially installed both controls are set at 50% be default, which generates a horrible image (at least on my computer). You may want to adjust the controls to get a better picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omg...","review":"Wow. Just another great example of unbelievably. I can hardly believe that they wrote this. The story and writing is totally sophomoric. They have the drop on them and instead make an unrealistic capture. It is the worst, but then maybe I don't watch enough TV. I never do. I guess that is why the writer's focused on T'Pol and her skin tight suits. It must be what kept it on the air for 4 years. Almost all the crew had a fantasy reenactment with her. It must have been on the writer's fantasy too. I only wish they would have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"Overall i enjoyed the episode very well. He's one of my favorite characters for Enterprise so it was fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"So far one of the best episodes of an overall impressive series.

Time travel, alternate universes, transporter accidents, blah, blah, blah!The creators stuck with a formula that seemd to work for three other shows, but with Enterprise they had a chance to do something really special, and they blew it. There was absolutely no feeling of going where no one had gone before, because all the humans really had to do was download the Vulcan data base.

I rather enjoyed it, especially the scenes with Trip and the loquacious alien."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Enemy Mine\\" rip-off","review":"In 1985 a mediocre Sci-Fi movie came out called \\"Enemy Mine\\" where an Alien and a Human crash land on a desert like planet....at first they fight and almost kill each other, then they end up helping each other. I know Star Trek has been known to rip-off other Sci-Fi books and movies (and it frequently re-hashes it's own material), but this is almost straight up plagiarism. Just watch the trailer for \\"Enemy mine\\" and you'll have watched this episode: [...]Aside from that whole fiasco, the episode itself was quite laborious to get through and the ending felt contrived and rushed. I'd recommend skipping this one, it's rare that I say that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny twist","review":"The story was fun with the attitudes of both human & vulcan being tested.I like that it was presented as a story over dinner.Not knowing if it was true or not until the very end...( Tpau's memento was good.. a postcard from the 1950's would have been a good touch..)Anyway...a fun show."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland","review":"After Pacino's gem of a diatribe near the end of the movie, I expected even more from the book. But that part, the invention of a more talented screenplay writer, was missing; and the dialogue and story line were flat. A Keanu Reeves movie beats the book it was based on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book, see the movie.","review":"Unfortunately, the book has none of the style, wit, or raw seductive power of the movie. To be fair, it's probably a mistake to compare the two, as the storylines differ in vitually every way. Those who like myself, bought the book because they enjoyed the movie, will probably be dissapointed by this. On it's own, however, the book still cannot stand on its own merits. It's a prime example of supermarket fiction: one-dimensional characters, silly dialogue, and ridiculous plot. It thoroughly lacks believability, and at times appears to be a blatant rip-off of an earlier bestseller written by a certain ex-lawyer from Mississippi. All-in-all, it's definately a book for the undemanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"I was prompted to buy this book based on the film. I adored the movie. It has become one of my favorites. Imagine my surprise when I opened the book to find not just a bland, slow, tiresome read, but a stylistic atrocity! Neiderman writes like a sixth grader. His use of rhetorical questions and foreshadowing plays to the lowest common denomenator. It boggles the mind that anyone would publish this hack (speaking of which, there are numerous blatant grammatical errors... what the hell was the editor thinking when he allowed this to go to press?) When writing a book about a place where people actually live there is some need to research (Long Island towns don't have small town mentalities, especially in Nassau County). Needless to say, don't waste your money, but definately see the movie. The screen writer deserves an academy award for turning this pedestrian attempt at a novel into such a thought provoking film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you wish for a 0-star rating...","review":"If you have enjoyed the movie, then by all means do NOT buy this book: aside from the movie and book stories being almost completely different, it is poorly researched, poorly written, the characters are uninteresting, the text is full of clichés, and the ending is so atrocious it'll make you want to throw up. Go see the movie, instead. P.S.: Kudos to the screenwriter(s) that managed to turn this book into a very nice movie script..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"Don't waste your time.

More often than not, a book trumps a movie hands-down, though some adaptations have turned out to be decent efforts. This book is from the same man who ghostwrites the V.C. Andrews novels (and the books he writes under her name are just god-awful) but I figured that if someone wanted to make a movie from this book, then the book had to be good... right? Right???NO! The screenplay is actually better than the book! I could see echoes of Neiderman's lame \\"VCA-esque\\" writing in here especially with the bland dialogue. Some parts were all right, but overall the book fell rather flat and it left me surprised at how such a good (if somewhat disturbing) movie could have been greenlighted from this book. It is definitely better than a one-star, but I just couldn't bring myself to give it anything higher than two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK SOLELY BECAUSE I LOVED THE DVD AND PRESUMED (WRONGLY)THAT SINCE THE SCREENPLAY WAS BASED UPON THIS BOOK, THE BOOK WOULD COMPLIMENT THE MOVIE AND OFFER MORE INSIGTHT.

Most cds have those few hot songs where you might skip a few tracks, on this cd you'll surprise yourself if you skip over one. All in all this is one of the best wu solo cds, an instant classic. I am kind of surprised on how good it is. All tracks are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bangin","review":"Straight bangin, and Mike last time I checked Killa Sin was a member of Killa Army who are Wu so get you facts right prior to your review"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I expected much more from this cat. Why? For two reasons. First, he's always been one of the standout emcees on Wu collabos, and after Gza he's my favorite in the Wu. Second, with Ayatollah handling half the production, I expected much more. The only stand out cuts on this lp are \\"Vendetta, That Nigga, City High and Framed\\" with G Rap and Streetlife. The rest of the album is garbage. The beats are awful (where the hell was the RZA, and Pete Rock? Why didn't deck produce any of the joints?), and songs like \\"Get Right\\" (the hook is terrible) and \\"Bumpin and Grindin\\" sound like joints you'd expect to here from lame cats like Jay Z and Nelly. The lyrics are not vintage Deck, and the beats are very sub par. If you can come by the four cuts I mentioned earlier without buying the album, they are worth having. As for the album, it belongs in the two dollar bin at your local Wal-mart or K-mart. Leave it alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not quite up to par","review":"I expected this album to be a lot better after the under the radar classic \\"Uncontrolled Substance\\". Sadly, this CD is pretty poor by Wu Tang standards. There are a few bright spots, but overall this album sounds too commercial to be a Deck record. Still, INS is a great lyricist and I wouldn't give up on him yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot to Deck","review":"NIce. Exceptional hooks and incredible lyrics from deck. Real good s***.

Some of the beats could be better on here, but when Deck is on he is on and you often get into the beat more because he rhymes so well over it that it begins to fit his style. Best songs are Vendetta, Framed, Big City, Thats that Ni**a and Get it right. Some are easily skipable because of a horrible hook or just flat out boring beat, but this album has it's moments as usual from Deck so it is worth checking out if you are into Wu Tang or just like great lyricists."},{"rating":"1","title":"He has betrayed the Wu-Tang Clan","review":"Inspectah Deck needs to go back too Shaolin and train in the 36 Chambers. Don't let the title of this album decieve you. Instead of \\"The Movement\\" it should be called \\"the run the hell away screaming.\\" It is definitely the worst Wu album I have ever heard. It's nothing like his last album. If you buy this album you will end up crying. I can't even say that the lyrics are good...that's how bad this album is. Get the RZA ~ Birth of a Prince album instead of this. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"First let me say that I \\"LOVE\\" Emmylou Harris. If I don't have everything she's done, it's not for lack of trying. This CD just isn't very good. I think one of the other reviews called it \\"lackluster.\\" I think that's being gracious. Back in the bad old days before CDs and the internet, record companies used to pump out LPs of floor sweepings and sell them on the strength of the artist's name. They got away with it because they controlled the reviews and most of the time it wasn't possible to listen to any of it before purchasing it. That's what this CD impresses me as, floor sweepings. There's not one single \\"HIT\\" on this whole stinking CD. Soooo....if you \\"LOVE\\" Emmylou, and you have $16 you don't know what else to do with....just send it to her direct and spare yourself the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing album","review":"All the \\"songs\\" on this album sound alike, same cadence and just what do the words mean?

I thought Wrecking Ball was ok with some really great songs and several duds - the production was muddy but fit several of the songs. Unfortunately she has continued again with the very muddy production sound here which would be ok with great songs, but here the songs are just BORING - just like Red Dirt Girl. They all sound exactly the same! zzzzzzzzzzzz Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossibly Beautiful!","review":"My guess is that if you are reading this review, you are already a fan. You already know that Emmylou is in a class by herself and is impossible to classify. Labels like country, rock, bluegrass or folk simply don't apply. Her music is all of that but also goes way beyond any of those definitions. This new CD is exquisitely beautiful and a must buy. These songs are almost like prayers. They are filled with grace, love and passion. They bring tears to your eyes and put a smile in your heart.This is the 4th Emmylou CD since she broke all conventions and found her own voice. What started with Wrecking Ball, Spyboy and Red Dirt Girl is now fully realized. If you loved her because of her links to Gram Parsons, you will love her even more now that she has emerged from his shadow. This is the music she was destined to make and somewhere in heaven Gram Parsons is smiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emmylou Harris is Depressed","review":"Emmylou Harris is depressed!Her voice on this CD is flat - minimal emotional affect - no highs, no fun, little hope. Her photos all look down at the ground.The lyrics are OK but there is little in the music that is tuneful or melodious. It is more like a wake!At least the production is much better than the awful effort on \\"Red Dirt Girl\\".Sadly Emmylou is in need of help.This one will go to the bottom of her CD's - it is that bad!May she have a speedy recovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for EH to rethink","review":"I can't believe those Emmylou Harris fans gushing over this CD are actually listening to it. It really is inferior to most of her work. And I liked Red Dirt Girl a lot, and thought Wrecking Ball one of the great pop recordings ever made. But this ... it's professionally done but just lifeless. I've given it a few listens, I swear, but probably not any more. I think she is one of the great voices of our time, but she needs to rethink...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant but forgettable","review":"A few nice melodies, a couple of interesting lyrics, the voice that still sounds as pretty as ever - but nothing here is all that interesting, and on the whole, this falls way, way short of the standard she set with Wrecking Ball and Red Dirt Girl. All of these songs sound like leftovers from the previous two albums, stripped of the production that Daniel Lanois and Malcolm Burn gave to them, even though both are involved with this new record. It just never takes off. The first forgettable Emmylou Harris album in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dud from Emmy","review":"If you liked Red Dirt Girl, this one is for you. If you lovedthe old Emmy with the beautiful sounds and harmonies withacoustics instruments, avoid this one at all cost. Music isrepetitive and lifeless. Emmy is not a song writer and MalcolmBurns is a very poor producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Song Does Not an Album Make","review":"Emmylou Harris is a wonderful singer, but after listening to this album, she should continue singing other people's songs, and stop writing her own (All of these songs were written or co-written by her except \\"Plaisir d'Amour\\" which she arranged). All of these cuts sound almost the same. There is one marvelous song, the next to the last one on the album: \\"Lost Unto the World\\" which has passion and character. As for the rest of the songs, the lyrics are poetic, but thin and the music is lyrical, but without a winning tune in the batch. I love most of her work, but this one is a LARGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"professional but boring","review":"I used to be a fan of Emmylou and love what she did in the 70's and 80's. Since Wrecking ball she's taken a turn I find hard to like, record by record. This is the worst record I've spent money on for a long time. The cover art work is worth one star and I cannot deny that the album is a work well done, it's just that she's lost her voice, she's trying to be so off mainstream and serious about what she's doing and just ends up being sooo boring! There's not one single song I want to listen to again after giving it a try three times. Emmylou, try to loosen up a bit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could age this gracefully","review":"This is an intoxicatingly beautiful record.

The fact that various real-life events were referred to proved that this was not just another fictional thriller but someone trying to make a statement of reality concerning the situation as it actually is. However truthfully this reflects the state of affairs in Britain, it does also (& perhaps more so) for that of the US.If more time & care had been taken with this film it would have been truly great. But since as with so many films it cut corners, I can only give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A profound lesson for my young children","review":"While my young children and I were visiting my dying mother, I read a chapter a night of this marvelous book to them. My daughters were 11 & 13 at the time. My youngest daughter was so affected by the moral of the story that she wrote to the author, who wrote her a very lengthy letter back. My daughter decided to take sign language in the hope of meeting the author one day and being able to communicate with her. To this day, 13 years later, this is one of our favorite books. It had the impact on my daughter the way the movie, \\"Imitation of Life\\" had on me at the same age.

He looked through the ingredient list and said he could see why it might give a little relief. I had gotten mine from a local natural remedy store that is no longer there. So, I'm glad to see it offered on Amazon. I will definitely buy another bottle as soon as I find out I'm pregnant again - placebo or not it helped and is definitely worth $14.95.

As most movies are, it isn't nearly as good as the book was, but I still found it very entertaining and recommend it to movie lovers of any age.

If it weren't for the antics of Cantinflas, this movie would be totally worthless. David Niven's Phileas Fogg is a bore who does nothing but play cards and look at his watch. Shirley MacLaine as an Indian princess? Even the character of Detective Fixx is a bore.

Now though 50% or more of the movieis spent on travel scenery and it's not even impressive scenery like like sayLawerence of Arabia. You can see better scenery on the National Geographic channelor the Travel Channel.The rest is slow. The comedy too silly for the subject matter. David Niven's characteris wholy unlikeable. The 20 something woman falling for the 50 something man cliche' fromthat period is completely unbelievable.

It also deftly explains the concept of \\"constitutional avoidance\\" as a basis and strategy of resistance.

For a b-movie about strippers, I would have expected more than a couple quick glimpses of flesh. If you bought this movie expecting block-buster quality acting and cinematography, you will be disappointed. As expected it is a typical low-budget b-movie but it is funny at times. I had hoped that they actually wrote some sort of plot but they didn't. The plot is ripped off from \\"Zombie Stripper\\" with only minor changes. Not sure how they kept from getting sued for the rip-off since it is so very nearly the same exact movie.Low budget movies are what they are. No stars off for that.1-1/2 stars off for a lame \\"strippers with cloths\\" theme. :(2-1/2 stars off for being a total plagiarized ripoff of the real \\"Zombie Strippers\\" movie.Save your money and buy the actual \\"Zombie Strippers\\" movie, at least it has more skin and Jenna Jameson as a lead character! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It didn't suck","review":"I bought this DVD and Zombie Strippers at the same time, and let me say that Zombies, Zombies, Zombies was the DVD I expected to suck. It was, however, just the opposite. Zombies, Zombies, Zombies was actually pretty darn good for a low budget horror movie, and even with its big star, Jenna Jameson couldn't save that other piece of crap.The plot is your standard zombie movie story with some refreshing twists. No military experiment or radiation here. Crack whores smoke glowing crack rock thus starting the zombie epidemic. Plenty of laughs and gore to keep things moving along. The special effects are pretty rediculously awful in a few scenes, though. Good dialouge and characters, especially the Samuel L. Jackson-ish pimp guy. Sure, this movie is bad, but its a lot of fun and definately way better than a lot of low budget horror films out there. I liked it a lot.I'd recommend this DVD over Zombie Strippers for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even bad in a good way","review":"First off I am a huge zombie movie fan as well as just good ole fashioned low budget films. Therefore, don't think my low rating of this is because I just don't \\"get\\" this kind of movie. The acting is horrible even for a low budget which you can get passed if there is nice gore and a good nudity-to-bad acting ratio, however, for this film there was not. Drop the cgi special effects and stick with fake blood and common household items. It looks better and can be taken a little more serious. Not to mention the character they tried to make into a Samuel L. Jackson got about as close as being his retarded cousin.

However this album from one of the best songwriters of the last 50 years really is something special. Not a compilation at all in fact, but complete re-recordings of some of his finest songs.Recorded with vocal and grand Piano only this is exactly how you should hear any great songwriter, whether they are playing the Piano or not. The combination of voice and Piano is unbeatable for letting you hear the beauty of the music. Now of course Randy Newman is a very good pianist, but he's an even better songwriter who manages by some quirk of fate to be blessed with the ability to write tender love songs, as well as satirical and ironic tales on American society and the world in general.This is a magnificent album by one of the most underrated musicians and songwriters out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine Newman","review":"Randy Newman is to music what Michael Moore and Al Franken are to books. Newman's album presents a liberal critique of the American political landscape, and includes a few personal observations about life in general along the way. However, Newman's critics, who charge that his songs sound too much alike, will not be quieted with a casual listen to v.1. Newman's critics are wrong. One needs only to take a second journey through v.1 with a more concentrated ear to observe that each piano-driven song is uniquely different, each has its own purpose, each has its own beautiful comment on American life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best suited for Newman devotees","review":"The first thing you notice about this retrospective is that Randy Newman's voice has really grown quite gutteral and craggy, more so than usual. That's not to say that it takes away from the music, but it certainly gives a sense of looking back on a great career - Newman has been writing songs for 40 years now and has achieved the position of a real statesman in the business. For a Newman fan like myself, this release has a kind of 'photo album' feel to it. Newman revisits most of his classics, just him at the piano, and intersperses the songs with short instrumental selections from 'Awakenings', 'Parenthood', 'Avalon' and 'Ragtime'. It is a laid back and beautiful listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Blondie?","review":"Came on, does anyone here feels a close similarity with Blondie?Well I do, and it seems to me they want to transmit what Blondie did in the 80's: originality, strength and passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Cherry is the Pits","review":"The promotional review of this album was correct instating that Black Cherry was a departure from Goldfrapp's(successful) style in Felt Mountain. With Felt Moutain,I absolutely fell in love with this band. But, withwith Black Cherry, the love affair is on the skids.Personally, I believe that a band should make at leasttwo albums in the same style when they know that styleworks. Too bad Goldfrapp decided to go astray so early.Black Cherry sounds like it belongs back in the 1980swith all of its primative synth and tinny vocals.As a previous reviewer noted, the sound is reminiscentof what we heard on their \\"U.K. Girls\\" cover.This will probably please fans of that style. But,for me it was an unwelcome change. I firmly believethat one should give an album three full listeningsbefore rendering judgement. And, after doing so,my copy is headed for the used bins.Goldfrapp, here's hoping you can return to yoursmooth, seductive Felt Mountain weirdness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Geeze, what was this suppose to be?","review":"Talk about derivative, this group (or whatever) steals from everyone. I'm not talking mood or style, but actual riffs of dozens of songs from early Simple Minds to Pink Floyd. You go through this thinking, \\"hey, I remember that\\". It doesn't help that every song is embellished with bug zapper squawks and all sorts of wee-oh stuff that sounds like a theremin trapped in a garbage disposal with a drum machine working the switch.The pity is that some of the song ideas and the vocal performances are quite engaging. This thing desparately needed a producer strong enough to enforce a unified groove and tell the girl(s?) when to leave out the electronica.

Although I bought this on amazon, I spotted it first in the electronica section of a local music store where the write-up sounded like this was pretty much just a new-age disco album. Anyway, the reviews here tipped me over the edge, indicating as they do, that this is something different and special, but now I have it I gotta say that although this isn't really a disco album it ain't electronica either. The music reminds me of a tame, laid back Donna Summer laid over a beat box and casio keyboard and some electronic sound effects thus the 'electronica' misnomer. It's great if you like pleasant background music with some neat hooks occassionally and the eponymous single is pretty good but it not enough to carry the entire CD. It's more grey cherry than black cherry, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This black cherry is sweet.","review":"Ever so the hybrid band that Goldfrapp is, they are really a success creatively (if not commercially). If you like their debut Felt Mountain, Black Cherry will definitely be on the top of your CD purchase list.Brighter and more sensual than their 2000 debut, the duo comes back with an album that perfectly blends the new wave 80's sound with a touch of industrialism that's seldom seen. On the excellent debut single, a mechanical experience is created while the vocal of Alison Goldfrapp adorn the hyper rhythm. Elsewhere on the album, a dreamy landscape unravels with Forever.On Black Cherry, you'd get a little of everything without ever losing sight of the road ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic, flourescent and daring-but I prefer Felt Mountain","review":"After listening to this CD, those three words came to mind. I'm a little biased because I was recommended to Goldfrapp's 'Felt Mountain' CD on a music association website, bought the CD and immediately loved it! But I do like this CD, and am still a fan of Goldfrapp. The tracks on this CD are a little bit more erotic, risque, and throbbing with catchy beat sequences like 'Tiptoe', and 'Strict Machine'. Her song 'Twist' has lyrics like \\"put your dirty angel face between my legs and knicker lace\\"...etc. On this CD, I think you will hear a sexier Alison Goldfrapp than the ethereal jazzy one from Felt Mountain. There are a few blissful tracks that will be a treat for Felt Mountain fans-tracks like 'Hairy Trees', 'Forever', and if you buy the Japanese import -'Big black cloud little white lie'... Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM IS HOT!!!!","review":"Allison's beautiful opera like vocals with the creative electronic beats are a genius combination.

After a few years in the shadows as a guest vocalist for the likes of Orbital and Tricky, Alison Goldfrapp (aided by collaborator Will Gregory) emerged to remedy that shortage with a cocktail of ripe carnality and sinister beauty. The duo's albums, Felt Mountain and Black Cherry, are exotic middle-European fantasias co-scripted by Christopher Isherwood and Hans Christian Andersen: music for black forests and red light districts. ENHANCED. Added to your discotheque!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disciplined lipstick electronic excellence","review":"There's a form of OCD that must weave its way through the DNA of all electronic trip hop music artists. It's a fusion of shiny black latex and cold chrome that sets the pace and the mood, but never let's you inside.Tracks like \\"Strict Machine\\" are flawless in their precision and executed with glorious attention to detail. It's an certain and unique art to be able to cunstruct something with the perfect symmetry of Goldfrapp's sound.

Always at the cutting edge of timidity, however, PBS stopped doing so for fear of losing government money. It was made in England as an Afternoon Special for teenagers, but caused so much controversy there it ended up being shown late at night, after they'd all gone to bed! It's hard to believe a film as benign, loving, and informative as this could cause any such consternation.I searched for this lovely story on video for years and was delighted to see it available. It concerns two of the sweetest and cutest high-school boys in London who find they love each other, and must run away together in hopes of finding a place more accepting. They don't, unfortunately, but they learn what it means to have each other. Their story of discovery is unforgetable and positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional film for me","review":"Having been a child of the eighties in the UK.

I shed a tear when I watch this film and think back on how difficult it was to be true to yourself then.

It's fluffy yet warm, and has a nice soft feel. However, I had to get a duvet cover because it left little white linty pills all over my dark sheets. The full/queen size is definitely accurate -- it's slightly undersized for my queen, which is fine with me because I don't need a comforter that falls very far on all sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like down","review":"While it is certainly warm and reasonably light, this comforter does not have the texture of down. Unlike most synthetic down alternatives, it cannot be machined-washed, but says that it must be dry-cleaned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a down alternative, but a good comforter at a bargain price","review":"It is too heavy, too thin and not fluffy enough to be a down alternative. It was also very stiff, but got softened nicely after a few nights of use. And it stays in place in duvet better than down. Over all, I'm happy with it.You may get disappointed if you are looking for something like down. But it is a good comforter if you are looking for something warm at a bargain price of $29."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value.","review":"I wanted a lightweight comforter to use under my quilt for the winter, and this comforter is perfect!

Boy was I wrong...the comforter was flat and the appearance I was going for (similar to the look you see in your local department store) was a comforter that would fill the duvet like a soft fluffy cloud. I am pleased that this comforter keeps me fairly warm at night. Well, I guess I can't really complain because the comforter was fairly cheap. You win some and you lose some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the Rave reviews at all","review":"I ordered this comforter because of all the rave reviews. But when I used it, it wasn't very warm at all nor light weighted. It also had all this fuzz on it that is hard to get rid of. It kept on getting onto clothing, the carpet, even my curtains.

If he hadn't won the attention of Julius Shulman--as a photographer and client--he would probably be forgotten, so few are the surviving traces of his modest mid-century output. When he died, in 1988, poor and embittered, few took note. This self-inflicted failure (Soriano alienated Entenza, Eichler and several other key clients) challenged Wolfgang Wagener, an architect who practices here and in Germany, to reevaluate his achievement and develop a complete list of buildings and projects.

I pressed the 2 and it cooked it for 2 minutes. It turns out the moment you push a number it cooks for that many minutes. Setting it is like defusing a computer controlled bomb. You have to press the right combination of buttons the right number of times to set the thing. And you have to know its weight. It doesn't weigh anything or react to what it cooks and you can't just enter the time. I find the product so useless that I am throwing it out after having it for about a month.

Ms. Borysenko is surely one of many so-called spiritual gurus who have no substance at all but talking. Just like the other self-annointed false prophets, she cherry-picked good stuff from all of major religions in the world, blended them with psycology and tried to turn them into her own spirituality. However, she failed since I didn't see any originality or creativity in her presentation. I want to call this 'potpourri spirituality' that smells good but has no real vibrant living things in it. I gave the one star becasue that is the lowest point I can give."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Colony book reivew","review":"The Colony by John Tayman covers an interesting topic about the hardships faced by the exiles of Molokai but does so in a humdrum way. The first few chapters were mediocre at best and only got worse as the book went on. Having to finish the book soon became a daunting task that I didn't look forward to doing. This book was far from engaging and was tough to read for more than several pages at a time without getting bored. It was also very choppy making it a difficult read. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited...","review":"I found the writing of this book mediocre and the editing poor. There are many unclear passages where the author will say something like \\"10 people were diagnosed... all eight died...\\" Or \\"Four men were killed...the three bodies were buried...\\" Very annoying. And don't get me started on his requent use of word SNUCK, which makes my blood run cold. I found the latter chapters of the book to be full of minutiae of the lives of a few older residents, that was of little interest or poinancy. Seemed like filler. Overall, the topic is very interesting, and parts are well-rendered, but the writing is somewhat jerky and overwrought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I originally listened to this book on tape because my son spent two months bumming around Hawaii and I wanted to have my 'own' Hawaiian experience. I was so taken by the factual accounts of the brutality and the lives of the Hansen's patients, that I am buying extra copies for my four children - I want each of them to be introduced to a part of American history that hasn't been taught in their classrooms. Wonderfully researched and well written, this book is a must read - especially today, in the face of AIDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai","review":"The word \\"harrowing\\" in the title only begins to cover what the exiles encountered. The account is well-written and seems very well documented, even to the chilling photo of poor Father Damien on his deathbed...two days before his death.As a child I was aware of the struggles of the lepers of Molokai, and Fr. Damien, because of my Mother's interest and her subscription to the Maryknoll Mission magazine, which, I think now, looking back, must have published many articles regarding this subject matter.I have always wanted to learn as much as possible about the leper colony at Molokai, and now am doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraught with Inaccuracies","review":"The inaccuracies start with the cover. The picture is not of the cliffs of Moloka\`i but the Amalfi Coast of Italy. The use of the word \\"true\\" in the title is an insult to the remaining residents of Kalaupapa.I am fortunate to know some of the individuals interviewed in this book. When they were shown the proofs, they attempted to correct the misinformation both about their lives and the history of Kalaupapa. Their attempts were rebuffed.See the NY Times article of 3/27/06 entitled \\"Book on Leprosy Settlement Draws Fire\\" for more details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Endorsed","review":"The author's own note reflects a lack of credibility and respect for those he writes about extensively in this book.

While I've attempted to be responsive to their concerns, I recognize that they do not agree with the editorial decisions I have made and they do not endorse the book.\\"For greater historical accuracy and correct context to the quotes used in this book, I recommend: Holy Man: Father Damien by Daws, Pilgrimage and Exile: Mother Marianne by Hanley, Olivia: My Life in Exile by Breitha, and audio books of stories told by Makia Malo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, But Dull","review":"Just can't seem to develop a real interest in this one. The information is provided in a long drawn out manner. The story is one the world should know more about, but can we condemn people for doing what seemed, at the time, necessary to protect the rest of society? The author records the information he has in rather a dull manner. Nothing springs to live. The reader becomes an observer of life on the island, not really caring about it, but feeling guilty because of what happened. One thing of particular interest was learning that there were no lepers in the Bible - only people with skin diseases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, Confusing and Bungled Account of a Great Story.","review":"This book reads like one of the wandering pathways the author notes in his book...it seems to ramble on forever, all the time you are wishing you were at the end of it. The story itself is fascinating subject matter, but the author unfortunately leaves many loose ends, delves only shallowly into the characters' lives, and seems to have a bias for white male characters so much so as to make us all wonder if there were actually any women or people of Hawaiian heritage in this colony worth more than a footnote (I'm sure there were!). Were it not for the curiosity in me on the subject matter, I would have tossed this one aside after page 10. Perhaps when (if!) I ever finish it, I will change my mind, but now half-way through it, I think the verdict is in: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalism sells but the truth doesn't.","review":"Why would the author of a \\"complete history\\" and a \\"work of non-fiction\\" on the history of Kalaupapa use a doctored photograph of the Amalfi Coast of Italy as its cover? The choice of this photo sends the message that the cliffs of Molokai are not \\"harrowing\\" enough to fit the story that Mr. Tayman has chosen to tell. Unfortunately, this book is more like a novel \\"based on true events\\" than a true history of this most treasured place that was designated a National Historical Park in 1980 for the education and inspiration of present and future generations.The cover, as well as one-sided sensational descriptions of the early residents that have little to do with reality, led one talk show to comment:\\" . . . Hawaii may make you think of swaying palms and beautiful weather, but this one desolate spot on Molokai seems more like King Kong's Skull Island.\\" http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail975.htmlNothing could be further from the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and highly fictionalized","review":"The author takes tremendous liberty when recounting his -- highly flawed, especially shallow -- version of Hawaiian history. The historical background that he uses as a backdrop to the story line is, at best, problematic. This book should not be considered a serious or academic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story. Great Read! Could Not Put It Down.","review":"As a history nut, I buy a lot of non-fiction. (A few recent faves: \\"Devil in The White City\\"; \\"Manhunt\\"; \\"Under the Banner of Heaven.\\") Had not heard of \\"The Colony\\" until I caught the author being interviewed on C-SPAN by Rep. Ed Case, the congressman from Hawaii who represents the area described in the book. The story sounded intriguing, so last Saturday I ordered a copy from Amazon. It arrived Monday. Today's Thursday--I spent the last three nights wide awake reading, unable to put it down. And yes, I'm exhausted.This is an amazing book, fast-moving, horrifying, filled with vivid characters and unimaginable circumstances. Opening the cover and starting in with the first chapter--a manhunt of sorts--is like settling down in the theater. In fact, it's apparently been sold to Hollywood and is going to be made into a movie, which is a logical development, given the richness of the story. But do yourself a a favor, read the book now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Harrowing!","review":"Having heard my grandmother's stories about Fr Damien and his work on Molokai and then living in Hawaii for four years, I just had to read this book. I was not disappointed -- The Colony was fascinating and yet caused me to spend time reflecting on those afflicted with Hansen's Disease. The only downside of reading this book was the deep saddness I felt for those forced into exile. It is a poignant story.On a positive note, I found the book very easy to read (I had a difficult time putting it down). The personal stories meshed with the government's policies and actions were interesting. There are a limited amount of pictures, but they are helpful in understanding and not offensive.For the academic folks in the crowd, I found the endnote documentation excellent.I recommend this book for anyone interested in the subject. I especially recommend it for those who may someday visit Molokai. It will give you a whole different perspective of Kalaupapa."},{"rating":"1","title":"tooo long","review":"A very detailed and exhaustive treatment of the happenings at Moloki from about 1860 to the present.

Tayman is a superior writer, combining trenchant research with a story-teller's finely hewed skill, his book is a heart-stopper and mind-bender -- medical, social, political, religious, history stirred up in an accessible haunting, irresistable tome.The story is important, part of coming to terms with our own history. But, history rarely is rendered this immediately, this affectively and effectively ... this well, in a word. This is the kind of book that some will be shoving into the hands of mere acquaintances demanding they \\"read this, right now!\\"If only there were more Tayman to read but it seems this is it for now.

I was livid at him called a sovereign King William Lunalilo of the Sovereign Kingdom of Hawaii \\"whiskey bill\\". This book is insulting to the Kalaupapa residents in particular, and we Hawaiians in general. As for his representation that the royalty did not care for their people, that is so inaccurate. It is documented that (then) Princess Liliuokalani (future Queen) went to visit her people at Kalaupapa and gifts were sent on a regular basis. I am distressed that Tayman is getting away with this gross insult."},{"rating":"2","title":"audio version of The Colony","review":"I RECENTLY BOUGHT THE AUDIO VERSION OF THE COLONY, A NON-FICTION ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY OF THE LEPER COLONY ON MOLOKA'I.

Evenutally, this number grew to over 1,144. They were tortured, abused and used as guinea pigs by an ignorant government system that thought they were being kind in allowing them to live at all. With all of this there are many remarkable stories and humans that fought to make the best out of a horrible situation. This is a long story to read, the book drags on in parts and glosses over others. Very text-bookie in sections and repetative in others.

I just this moment finished viewing this mess, and though I am still reeling from the beauty of the music, I cannot forgive the production. The first act ensemble staging antics were embarrassing to watch. The second act was a jumbled mess. What was with the intoxicated singer in male drag? The third act was almost passable until the final moments when Manon became a murderess at the last moment!! And the last act was so flawed I don't even want to open that can of worms or I'll be here writing all night, and I have much better things to do. One other thing, I think our other two reviewers were much to kind as to the singing abilities of Des Grieux. His \\"money\\" notes for me were actually painful.

This is a terrible perversion of Manon Lescaut. I can't think of anything as bad, except that awful M/22 Seraglio, but at least that was well staged and sung!!! I thought Astrid Weber was barely competent as a singer and a horrible actress. She displayed no innocence from the outset. On her way to a convent? Oh, come on! Geronte was played by Kouta Rasanen, who looks like he's barely old enough to vote. Zurab Zurabishvili, Des Grieux, would be okay as a concert singer, but his acting skills are poor. No one in the cast was the least bit likeable. The updated staging made the whole thing even more absurd.

A tempestuous, immature young man goes to Europe, has a fling, and becomes the sort of fellow who could and will marry the girl next door. Frances is unappealing in either incarnation although neighbor girl develops color in both her cheeks and her personality during her summer away from him. The most intriguing character is his dead mother; perhaps she died from the stultifying intellectual blather of her family and friends.Along with his transformation from cad to mensch, Frances goes from Francophile to All-American.

I am sure that this book might help some intermarried people deal with their issues, but the approach and normative tone of this book is so at odds with its content that it almost renders it null.As the product of an intermarriage, I can tell you that it is far better to for a non-jewish spouse to learn honestly about Judaism from an authentic source than from one which attempts to legitimise a less-than-ideal situation.

I hope the authors and others who are considering this book will care enough to find out what being Jewish and what jewish marriage really menas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Song for Bobby Long","review":"I really loved the movie, so I ordered the CD the very next day online @ Amazon & found it!

These combined elements make this, the sixth season of The Cosby Show just as pivotal as its predecessor.Here, we're introduced to child actress and future recording artist Raven-Symone as the deliciously cute and vivacious Olivia, as well as the emergence of Joseph C. Phillips as Lt. Martin Kendall, after a previous guest appearance as one of Sondra Huxtable-Tibbadeaux' dates. Other reviewers may have their opinions about why the Kendalls were brought into the cast. The way I see it, it wasn't my show.

A challenging and difficult read, Memories of My Father Watching T.V. is both a devestating social critique and an honest and heartfelt personal journey. Grappling with complex themes which focus on identity formation and masculinity, White masterfully constructs his novel around the ways in which a father and son are constructed by 50's and 60's television shows. While some of his subtle allusions to Freudian psychoanalysis may be jarring and grotesque, his narrative is seamless and eloquent. Particularly interesting is reading Memories while also reading Montrous Possibility, essays in which he talks about himself as a writer, and more specifically as a postmodern writer. Edgy and daring; I loved the book and highly recommend it.

Had the mouse been helpful, such as making lunch for the children while they sleep it would have been cute. But, there is no humor, the mouse it in it for himself, and he leaves a mess.

She loved it so much that our soft cover copy is in tatters and I need to get a new hardcover one. I had a broken leg a few months after we got the book and so she would have to go and get her own book and bring it to me to read. This was the only one she brought for weeks at a time. We could hear her reciting it to herself sometimes in bed at night, or when she was taking a bath, just about all the time.

Every chapter begins slowly and personally, but there are segments within the chapters that are as piercing and insightful as my favorite CS Lewis excerpts. The chapter on Jesus: The Loving God is a great example, as I think Nouwen captures, in a well-written and succinct nutshell, both the problem with and the solution to the world as we generally know it. I don't think he set out to solve the world's problems, nor do I think it's easy to do so. But, as Chesterton said: I am (the problem with the world); and this chapter by Nouwen explains precisely why I am the problem. This one, like the best by Lewis, deserves reading and re-reading. It is devotional and challenging at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never received my book","review":"I wrote to the seller 3 different times when it was close to the receive date and I hadn't received a \\"it shipped\\" date yet.

The only \\"secret\\" revealed is that it can be done, but not a word is said as to how. Finally, the 6.08-6.10 \\"update\\" is a very brief, uninformative appendix. The book is really about Release 6.06 and before, i.e. it is seriously out of date, despite its recent publication date.

It's not. The first chapter opens with the main character in bed with his mistress. If the fact that he's scarred figures into the story at all, it's only ancillary.

The longer it was playing, the more often I kept on going back and checking if I was still listening to the same album. Then I realized that that is what made it so great. This is a great Chill Out album without the repetition or boredom.It's hard to believe that this is all from the same artist/composer; he is so versatile, setting off so many different moods, not monotonous (like so many albums that we've all come across where the artist is playing the same theme over and over).

I just couldn't get through this book; the characters seemed whiny and the dialogue was very unnatural. You *want* to feel bad for the characters, like how Dodge is estranged from his family and how Kay lost her baby, but I found myself not caring about them at all.

The reason for that is that they somehow managed to put the first episode of Season 4 amongst this set and that really don't make any sense on why they would want to do that. Just like the first \`5' volumes this is the same way, all episodes on one disc, not leaving to put anything else with them. While I like having the set for the episodes but how the series has been handled, makes some wonder if this was the way that they had planned for the series which in a way not good for the company.

The book is an aggressively pro-white, anti-Indian piece of crap; how any respectable publisher would put this out as any kind of true history is beyond me. As is how the writer managed to get a TEACHING gig at the University. What the book says is basically that every land swindle, act of aggression or simple rotten behaviour of whites toward the tribes was understandable, and every act or word of Native protest against the mistreatment was wrong. I think the writer must have some kind of link to the KKK or something.

I was fascinated by their experiences in Washington etc & appalled about how they were conned & moved about in a relatively short space of time to reservation after reservation.

Nevertheless any study of Soros's multi-billion dollar Hedge fund style investments will show that he has not only funded democracy but he has invested heavily in these countries to earn a profit. Keeping democracy alive mostly is in self interest to the Soros pocket book, rather then any benevolent idea of helping the 'people' of Eastern Europe, who mostly remain poor and starving, subjected to terror and mafia style corruption that did not exist under totalitarian Communism. In the end the people of Eastern Europe traded the false-god of Communism for the equally false-god of investment banking and cowboy capitalism, with Soros at the forefront.A dangerous text full of self obsession and slight of hand regarding Soros's personal investments in these societies, smacking of conflict of interest.Seth J.

The atmosphere is that spooky land of something just around the corner waiting to happen. You know it's there; you know it's coming. But for whom? To whom? When? The characters are indeed flawed and vulnerable and therefore completely recognizeable as human beings.

It also shows the research that the author must have done to so clearly illustrate the period of time in which this story took place.

Lavishly illustrated with rare photographs, with numerous quotations from Durrell's personal notebooks thrown in for good measure,this book sheds a new light on the life of one of the most amazing men of the 20th century. However, this book is recommended for Durrell fans, and not for the plain inquisitive who want to bone up on the life and times of Gerald Durrell.They would do better to stick to the Gerald Durrell accounts .The author has a tendency of repeating parts of the Durrell accounts in his own words,and relying too much on the Durrell works as his guide( but then again it is difficult to pick up the thread of people and events as many as 50 years later, with a world war inbetween ). All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable 600-pager that Durrell fans will devour in no time at all. Judging by this one,the Gavin Maxwell biography should be well worth reading .."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book contains little new information.","review":"I have always loved Gerald Durrell's works, and thus was looking forward to learning more about him as a person. I am now bogged down half way through this large biography, and must report that I have learned little or nothing new of any significance. Indeed, the first half of the book consists largely of material from Mr. Durrell's own works. After pointing out several times that Mr. Durrell's writings were often inaccurate, Mr. Botting's reliance on them for his own biography seems somewhat inconsistent, to say the least. One can obtain the same information more enjoyably and more informatively from reading Mr. Durrell's (and, indeed, Jacquie Durrell's) own works. The essence of Gerald Durrell may be found in his own writings; it will not be found in this biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy cleaner","review":"Bought this for my mom as a present.

There is nothing in the instructions to explain the differences or offer any explanations for how they work.The actual building of the robot is very limited, so the educational aspect is pretty much limited to figuring out what the behavior of each control board is. My kids got board with the limited interaction in about 10 minutes.This product does not get my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy instructions make it worthless!","review":"The instructions don't match the product, and are impossible to follow.

My husband tried when we got this 3 years ago, when my son was 10. He couldn't do it. I tried just now, I couldn't do it. At this point it's either throw it away, or let the box take up closet space until my son, now 14, learns enough electronics to maybe use it for something else.As a toy for ages 8 & up, as it says on the box, a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No exaggeration: worst exam prep book I've ever seen!","review":"A monstrosity. Privately published, evidently by some guy in his garage. This is not a joke: the thing is spiral bound, and the font suggests it was crafted by some old-fashioned typewriter. None of this means the book is bad though, although this book is bad nevertheless. It's almost unbelievable. Undoubtedly the worst book that professes to prepare a student for the AP economics exam.There is no explanations section; there are no free-response questions: there is nothing but practice multiple choice questions. But these are highly abstruse, riddled with errors, contain no explanations of the answers and, most inexcusably, decline to employ the kind of terminology and graphing models beloved by the makers of the actual AP Exam. In fact, there is not a single graph anywhere in the book. You probably think I'm kidding."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Historical treatise !","review":"Much as I enjoy the Southern works of Frances Parkinson Keyes,I found this one to just too much like a text book work on the Civil War with just a few extraneous characters thrown in to make a story of it.It would probably be of great interest to students of history with its descriptions of battles and military personnel,but,without having a particular interest in the Civil War (or as she always referred to it-The War Between the States ),I found it to be rather heavy going and did a lot of \\"skipping\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title misleading","review":"If you are a Civil War fanatic, this is for you.

I love this controller. It is great for all of the games, and I am about to buy it again and that is the problem. The controllers last me about a year before the buttons start to stick in. My first wireless controller had one of the top button start sticking, and then the left analog stick wasn't responding right. My current controller has an X button that likes to stay down at inopportune times. I am not a serious gamer, these controllers should last better.Bottom line: Great controller if you don't mind refreshing it every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"wireless that works","review":"This controller is the only wireless you should buy.

I understand Logitech is aware of this problem and they will replace the unit if your buttons stick, but it doesnt matter because the unit they will replace it will also has buttons that will stick eventually since the construction is the same.

I mainly bought this device to replace the 3-4 broken, or nearly non-functional controllers from Sony. I swear, Sony poorly designed some of their controllers on purpose. However, Logitech has pulled through again with a fantastic device that easily replaces the Dual Shock 2, and even other wired/wireless controllers on the market.

It happened after playing Kingdom Heart II for a second time. The X button started to get stuck (sunk all the way in) when I needed it the most. This X button is now useless, for it does not longer spring back when you push it down. It stays down.I have been playing games PS1, PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube, and I have never seen a controller behaving so badly after just a few usages.I will not and cannot recommend this wireless at all. Now I need to replace it, but I can't find any other brand or company which will satisfy me.I am glad that Sony itself will deliver a new controller (not the bumerang controller) ,which is wireless for the PS3. I think that even the wireless Xbox 360 controller is better than this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"great device but .......","review":"I have the same opinion as everyone else, the controller is very convenient, appealing, affordable and fun, but......it suddenly stopped working....i think there are some problems with the wireless connection, and its very frustrating being in the middle of the action and BOOM....your controller stops respondind..... and you get killed.....IT SUCKS!!!i see that a lot of people have the same problem that i do....what i do to solve it, is changing the batteries and then putting them back again, or use the dual shock for a while and then plug the logitech again...that has worked for me.....it sounds silly but somehow works....so, if you want a great wireless controller, this is it, but be aware that this problem is a little annoying and you probably will have it too......"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will never miss the cord.","review":"I am very pleased with the quality and performance of this product.

The joysticks have a non-slip coating that is excellent. I will return this device because of one reason, the tenth of a second delay on the buttons. It is just enough to make action games like \\"Black\\" twice as difficult to play. It is a real shame because everything else about this device is fantastic. One more small complaint, the pictures here show the buttons on the right are color coded to match original controler, mine were not. They are marked with circle, square, triangle and X, but all in black and white. The really sad news is that I have not found any other wireless that is any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome remote!","review":"We purchased this remote to replace our original corded remote that was on its last leg.

I've heard several good things about this particular one and decided to try it for myself.And they were right! This is THE BEST wireless controller out there!I've had ZERO problems with this one so far and it works like a dream!It's shaped and looks like the orginial PS2 controller so it's not overly big and fits into your hand comfortably.It connects almost instantly and the buttons require only a tap for you to do what you need. Also the analog sticks perform smoothly without any hesitation from your game. It also won't interfere with other controllers like it so multiple players can use like it.Forget all those wannabes, this is the ONLY controller worth spending your hard earned bucks on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent wireless controller","review":"Our PS2 is about 10 feet from our couch.

I read that sometimes other 2.4GHz devices may interrupt the signal, but I have such a device (a cordless phone) in my bedroom and it worked just fine until now.So basically, everywhere I go people say this controller is so great, and the company Logitech provides LITTLE TO NO SUPPORT on the product. They just have documents that say how great the product is. Pathetic.That is what bothers me the most. The fact that the company does not provide support. The darn thing DIDNT EVEN COME WITH A MANUAL.10 thumbs down on this.

The big problem we see is that if you press the D-Pad control and you get the tactile feedback of the button clicking the push may still not register. You have to apply more pressure to the pad beyond the point at which you feel the click. As a result your control is severely handicapped since you never know if you've pressed hard enough. My 8 year old son will not use this controller because of this way the D-Pad works.The analog joysticks are very responsive. The problem is only with the D-pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless Router Users Beware!!!","review":"This is a great controller. But if you have a wireles router in your house, or if a nearby neighbor has one, there's a good chance this controller won't work. Both this controller and a wireless router (like linksys or D-link) work on 2.4 ghz frequency, which means that the router interfears with the wireless connectivity of this contoller. It'd be nice if Logitech made a controller that utilized a different frequency, but they don't. I experienced lag that was so bad, it made my games unplayable. But as soon as I turned off my router, the contoller worked fine, so I know that it was the router that was causing the problem. It broke my heart because this is a fine controller with rave reviews.

Now that really only effects 2 games in the PS2 library greatly. Metal gear solid 1 and 3. MGS2 works fine 90% of the time, but MGS 3, its near impossible to quietly put away your gun without firing. Even though I slowly release the square button, it still fires your gun 80% of the time. It's real simple on an official Ps2 dualshock.

This book made me realize that there is no time to waste - I cannot conceive of our family member going through what this author has.All I can say is thank you for telling your story, it will help others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get much from this book","review":"I was disappointed with this book. Jocelyn Golden provides a detailed description of being bulimic, but that's about it. I didn't find anything informative or helpful for recovery in this book. The story was fragmented and not too well-written; it was actually hard to follow at times. Several times while reading it, I wondered if I had somehow gotten an unedited copy. I've read quite a few books about eating disorders and recovery, and this was probably the weakest.Still, my heart goes out to the writer, whose difficult childhood experiences lead her into long battle with a debilitating illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triggering to say the least","review":"This book is NOT a book to be read by those struggling with EDs! One of the cardinal sins for successful intervention is that we must not discuss weight. Not only is this triggering to readers who may suffer from an ED - but EDs are NOT not only about food, but they are certainly not about weight or any other numbers for that matter.It's fine to write a book about one's experiences with their eating disorders...it does help others feel a sense of universality - that they are not alone in this battle. However, there are very fine lines that must not be crossed due to the very fragile nature of the beast.I strongly recommend that those of you who are experiencing disordered eating or a full blown eating disorder NOT read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"As a counselor, my graduate education included a course on eating disorders; however, when I read this autobiography about a person suffering from Bulimia, the nightmare dimensions of this disorder became concrete. The author shares details of her daily pathological behaviors. I appreciated her candor and accuracy. I will certainly offer this book to others who may be experimenting with Bulimia. The Bulimic journey is so brutally self-destructive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"This book provides excellent insight into the psychological and emotional issues that drive anyone with an eating disorder. As the book eludes to, this disease is really not about food but rather the emotional and psychological issues the sufferer can't effectively cope with. If you wish to have a deeper understanding of the root of this disease I feel this book will help you greatly. As stated by earlier reviewers, this is not a self help or book about treatment. Treatment is covered albeit briefly at the end. Understanding the underlying causes of this disease provides one with a much better chance of a succesful outcome. This should be recommended reading for anyone dealing with or treating an eating disorder sufferer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful production","review":"I agree with the reviewer who called it EUROTRASH. Absolulely true. I can't add anything to what was written about this production. What a shame that such productions are staged. I have a list of names of stage directors I avoid in any DVD that comes out. I won't go to see their productions in the opera house either. Some day I would like to see a production of a classical themed opera (such as Orpheus and Euridice) that actually had appropriate sets and costumes representative of the time period of the story. Avoid this DVD at all costs. I bought it and regret the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do these directors come from?","review":"I know we viewers are in trouble when the director indicates he doesn't like music by staging the overture. I agree with all those who find the staging perfectly ridiculous. There are many incongruous oddities such as why the servants and Margaretha have dirty faces. Surely one would want cleaner servants. Is this to convey that they are evil? (Golo is grimy at one point.) There are other absurdities too numerous to mention and the crowds move around aimlessly like zombies. One would have hoped that in the centennial of Schumann's birth someone would honor him by reviving this opera as he intended it to be seen. Musically the conductor and singers do a fine job. However one needs to cut off the picture and just listen. Directors who stage operas in this way do so because they are ignorant, untalented, and egotistical. What I can't understand is why opera companies hire them."},{"rating":"1","title":"AGREE","review":"I absolutely agree with the previous reviewers,specially with Mr.Cahill.This DVD is pathetic and why would someone watch it or go see the production at the opera house is beyond my reckoning...I would love to see his list of \\"banned\\" stage directors,since I likewisehave one and we probably coinicide.If you want to appreciate GENOVEVA get the audio MASUR set on BERLIN CLASSICS,.That is \\"THE GENOVEVA.\\"Fernando Funes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of talent and resources!","review":"The problem with this opera is director Martin Kusej. I tried to watch it to the end, but in vain; it's just too bizarre and boring. The set is a sterile white box and the action is just plain weird. Where have I seen this trash before? Answer: In the only Don Giovanni production I've ever seen that I didn't like. Ditto, Die Zauberflote. Both productions were directed by Martin Kusej. Beware of wasting your time and money on any further projects of his! Although it does take an unique \\"anti-talent\\" to transform a work of art into trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Opera books I have don't mention this opera, so I was curious and expected something! I was disappointed, the music is nice and some parts are quite interesting, but not very much excitement. On top of that, the staging of a non-so-great libretto is obscure (even in a bright white cube) and over-sophisticated. No wonder that many revival attempts of this opera have failed. I still think that with the right staging it could have some merit, or at least become a pleasant opera to listen and watch, but it is certainly not the case of this DVD. The only reason to purchase this DVD is for the \\"real\\" curious opera fun who wants to see one that will probably not be recorded often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children","review":"This book is a direct transalation with no attempt to make it accessible for young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTFUL AND PRACTICAL","review":"These bowls arrived in perfect condition and are absolutely beautiful.Their sizes are very practical as well.

A college professor invites a bunch of his students to spend a weekend at his cabin for a bit of R&R.; Naturally the cabin is in the woods in the middle of nowhere and a ski-masked parka wearing killer soon begins slicing and dicing the students one by one. They have a van but once they discover a couple of their friends slaughtered in the house do these genius' run for the van and take off. Of course not-instead they stand around and argue and act terrified-they argue some more-then they start accusing each other of being the killer-then they argue some more then someone suggests \\"let's get outta here\\". By that time the killer has tampered with the van and they ain't going nowhere.The explanation for the gory weekend has a bit of a twist but it's still baloney.

No messy watery stuff at the bottom like people complain about with other products. I picked this one because we have a large family (it holds 7) and also because I didn't like the idea of our bristles hanging around together in a pool of collected water. Your toothbrush stands upright (so you can use the battery operated ones, too, because it doesn't matter what size handle it is)and the bristles never touch the other ones. This is a really great product and just what I was hoping for. I don't know if it's coincidence or not, but we haven't been sick since we started using it.

This is a well balanced book and after reading it, I came away with a much different impression. I still blamed the government for what they did, but ultimate blame is with Randy and his wife. They used their children as human shields because they were too afraid to step up and face the consequences to their actions. Randy Weaver comes across as a milk toast character who can only listen to his wife and basically follow whatever she is teaching him. Once she is killed, he then looks to his child for guidance. I found to be a very unlikeable person, quite the opposite of what I had originally though. The real victims are the children, as usual.

The sleeves were much to wide the chest was closer to a 50 than a 40 and when I tried to cinch the waist to improve the look, it was comical. The only way I could see this coat looking good is if your waist is somewhere in the 40-50in rage and a chest that large is needed to give you an impression of a waist. On top of that the bottom was about 4 inches off the ground, taking a few steps in this ridiculously over-sized coat could not be done without tripping over my feet.

Ultimately, though, the product did nothing for me -- by the end of the day, it was as if I hadn't put any deodorant on at all. I was stinky! And this was in early Spring, when it was still relatively cool out.

And this early 60's session does swing and shows good chemistry between the two. Their styles couldn't be more dissimiliar - Edison's minimalism against Davis' voluminous sound. But the band is tight, the charts solid and solos interesting if not innovative. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because as a Sweets Edison fan I compare all of his outings with tenor players (including those with Zoot Sims, Illinois Jacquet and Prez) to his infamous session with Ben Webster.

I came across this 8oz. version, and thought for the price I just had to order it ($24.45 for 8oz?). Should have realized it was too good to be true. First, while the page says it's a spray, it became a \\"splash\\" once it got into my cart, which I never noticed (who would?). So, I didn't get a spray. Secondly, it just didn't smell like PS. I've been using it for over 25 years, exclusively. So I think I know the product. This one was just not right. Box was not sealed, neither was bottle. Not that that means anything, since there are plenty of legitimate reasons why there might not be any shrink-wrap, or other such seals, and still be legal. But the smell is off.

I don't know, but the result fell short. The early sections on classical mechanics and probability are necessary, brief, good (though conditional probabilities should have been discussed), but the main QM exposition has many faults: (1) sticks to wave functions in position representation instead of using Dirac notation; (2)should feature graphical and matrix ideas from linear algebra, and (of course!) the spectral theorem; and (3) writing is verbose, too much adumbration (foreshadowing) and summarizing. There is a real need for a book covering this ground, for interested neophytes, but this one isn't good enough at the job. Likely a treatment using Kronecker product space of position and spin-1/2, then doing most calculations with the latter, would work out better."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting...","review":"i tried to read this book, Russia's Coffee House, but its a little over the top for me.

This is loosely based on that movie. This dvd collects some of this pretty good show. I thought the plots were engaging and the production values were what you would expect from a early 60's tv show. It's black and white and has the excellent actors Michael Rennie and Jonathon Harris as its leads. The prints are very watchable but full of artifacts and lines in some areas so this is by no means from the master prints. But then it's a cheap set and is very cold war in feel. It's worth getting some vintage tv and such a low price because this show is a decent show that deserves not to be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nostalgic Series","review":"I remember this series from my youth.

The zither music is there, and Michael Rennie, sounding more American than English,plays Harry Lime well; Jonathan Harris is amusing as his aide. The plots are simple yet effective, with a frequent European backdrop (via establishing shots and lovably obvious sets). One can see many character actors (e.g. Alan Cuthbertson) active in Brit and American films and tv in the late 50s-60s; Oliver Reed appears in two episodes. This set seems to be the only one being currently offered of this show. Let's hope others will follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dated","review":"I was curious to see how The Third Man series made for TV had travelled with time. I remember enjoying it as a teenager in the 1960s. The sad answer is not very well. The plots are pathetically thin and most of the acting wooden and the characters not very credible. As I watched this time around, I realised what had attracted me all those years ago. It was the romance of flying to what then looked like exotic and exciting settings in far away places; London, Rome, Paris, New York etc. These locations were fairly inaccessible to most people then; not true anymore.

While it's not essential by any stretch of the imagination, it is still worth picking up for some good cheese metal anthems.Bai Bang seem like the Swedish version of Poison or early Warrant. Mind you that these guys are not Jani Lane or Brett Michaels, they still have that pop metal sound down pretty pat. Calling this album metal may be blasphemous to some, but hey, it was the early 90's. Just about every song on this record is listenable, and no song really sticks out as filler to me. I really liked \\"Cop To Con\\", \\"Run To The End\\" and \\"Adrenaline\\", but like I said, every song is good.Even though I don't consider this essential, if you like 80's style pop metal you should give this album a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"5-star playing, 3-star DVD","review":"The playing is what you'd expect of Kogan, which is jaw dropping. I was disappointed with a couple of aspects of the production. First of all, though the DVD clearly indicates a 60 minute running time, it's only a 47 minute program, and part of it is Kogan providing only marginally insightful introductions to each piece. So you've only got about 40 minutes of music here. Second, at least a few of the tracks (though not all) play slightly too fast, as evidenced for instance by the FAE sonata which sounds a half step sharp.Overall this disc is definitely worth owning for the Kogan enthusiast. The playing is stunning and the camera-work, though a little distracting at times, still gives you some very nice looks at Kogan's impeccable technique. The short program and odd playback speed make it not a GREAT value at $18 though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to impressed","review":"I bought this book because I had seen a few terra cotta designs on the web and wanted more to decorate my home and garden.

It's a little bit hard to turn since it sits flush against the speaker, but not too bad. I like the blue light because it reminds me to turn the speakers off when I'm not using them.It comes with a power brick that's kind of big, not really a problem since I have it sitting under my desk and don't see it. The speakers are connected to each other by a cord that's about 6 feet long.

These are definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I give this three strikes. 1) the bulky \\"power brick\\" mentioned by others. This would make portability a bear and if you don't need portability buy at least a 2.1 system! 2) Weak preamp. Some of my tracks simply will not play at useable levels because the normalized sound levels are too low for decent playback. 3) Very low sound levels before distortion!!!I was impressed by the passive radiator idea, many of the finest high end systems use this approach to try to achieve the low end and punch of a ported system while preserving the tightness and upper bass range clarity of a sealed system. These speakers do acieve fantastic sounds - but only at low listening levels, and with loud tracks. They'd work in a hotel room, that's about it. I hope Philips re-does this speaker & gets it right!I'll be choosing between the Klipsch ProMedia Ultra 2.0 and the Bose Companion 2 Series II 2.0, both at $99.

It's a cheap plastic disc stuck on the side of the right speaker (notice how none of the pics shows that angle). There isn't even a knob or a groove for your thumb. You have to PUSH HARD and HOLD DOWN on this round piece of plastic then turn. Who decided this woudl be a good idea?

VERY disappointing for a Philips product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!","review":"A friend kept raving about these and I had to check them out. I was skeptical of his claim that they sounded almost as good as his home stereo speakers but cost only $60. So I tried them out thinking I was going to run them back to the store the same day. But he was right. These have crisp highs, a decent midrange, and tight and booming bass for small desktop speakers. I had to lower the base in my computer properties because it was too much base at first. I have no idea how these speakers can do that without a subwoofer. I listened to them using several classical scores and found they sound better than the 2.1 Bose system on my other computer. And these were much cheaper. I have had them for a while now and am still impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new generation of PC speakers","review":"In the past year, new 2-piece speaker systems from Klipsch, Creative Labs and Philips have set a new standard in sound, especially bass response, for PC speakers under $100. I have not been able to perform A/B tests with the Klipsch Promedia 2.0 or Creative Labs T20, so I cannot say if this Philips system is better or worse. But it does have very impressive bass, and sounds very clear at healthy volume levels. It definitely sounds better than any other self-powered 2.0 system I have heard. It's comparable to a modestly priced stereo home system.The only drawback would be that these speakers are not really portable. The supplied amplifier is almost as big and heavy as the subwoofer in most 2.1 systems. So you won't want to lug them around with your laptop.

But the book doesn't say very much about periodic motion. It doesn't mention pendulums (what Physics book doesn't have the pendulum equation?, for example, or oscillations of a spring.(Luckily, it DOES mention the spring force and constant.) It could use planetary motion as another example of periodic motion -- it could mention \\"Simple Harmonic Motion\\", but doesn't!So I'll continue my search.

In this book he combines his Zen insight with his university training in liturature to explain Basho's poetry. The book should be read by anyone interested in Zen, and perhaps even more by anyone interested in poetry or literary criticism, since it shows what a wise person can do improve our reading of poetry.

I enjoyed the Plutonium Murders in spite of some shortcomings, the most notably being the book ending abruptly and without any closure.

An enormous amount of spelling and grammatical errors take away from the book and any meaning or story the author wished to convey.

How many working physicians take months away from their practice to take a course in Russia. This clown doesn't seem to know as much about AIDS as one could find in a Time magazine, nevermind an actual medical journal. The plot is contrived. The author did not research his locales(for example, the St. Louis zoo in nowhere near the best zoo in the world; Imo's Pizza in St. Louis is pizza fast food, not \\"a fine Italian restaurant\\" and Boone's Lick, MO is NOT in the Ozarks). The author also needs to cut down on his use of similes. Once in a while is fine(for a good author), but four or five in a row, especially as contrived examples as are used in this story, leaves the reader laughing at the story, not with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, prolix and rambling","review":"I listened to this book on tape, and only continued listening because the writing was so bad, it was funny. I had a good time sharing the overwrought phrases with my children; to wit, \\"Like a felled 2,000 year-old redwood, he toppled to the ground.\\" Or the phrase that went something like this: \\"The bullets ripped into his brain like a stick into an overstuffed pinata.\\" At one point, he said something about panic running all over the airport.(?)Dr. Davis, I can only hope that your patient chart notes reflect more clear and concise observations than the thing you call your \\"novel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book, but had its shortcomings.","review":"After Davis's previous book, The Plutonium Murders, became one of my all time favorites, I expected a bit more. I found plot of The Doomsday Kiss to be excessively complicated, and the book was so layered with scientific jargon that a true understanding of the plot was difficult to obtain. However, I did find the close escapes of Dr. Seacourt and the international espionage to be fascinating. Were this turned into a movie, I would not hesitate to go see it.And the grammar, I might add, was far better than in The Plutonium Murders. I noticed few mistakes in this book. Those few are forgivable, for to err is human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe ANYONE Would give this book any star!","review":"A thinking, well read person would be insulted an author would try to sell anyone this book. The grammer is as bad as the first book written by this author. As for the reviews listing possible actors interested in participating in a movie, do the actor's know their names are being used?

This movie is a MUST for anyone thinking about going into healthcare or those teaching students in healthcare. The majority of the movie is portrayed from a patient's perspective, down to filming the ceilings while a patient is lying on a guerney in the crowded emergency room. It is a fast paced, enjoyable film though at times there is strong language used. As a registered nurse with many years experience working in emergency rooms, I highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"The movie arrived early.

If you're an Eric Burdon fan, that makes this even better.As the director states, this is not a concert DVD. Rather than experience Eric Burdon from a fan's point of view, you will experience their journey back to their roots as one of the insiders. I felt like I belonged backstage with the band as I watched this DVD. Watching Eric walk the streets of his hometown and reminisce about his memories there gave me a unique perspective into his life.I also enjoyed watching the band's interaction when there was no audience to perform for. I got a chance to see what they were really like when no one else was around.All in all, it was a wonderful, matchless experience. If you are an Eric Burdon fan, you must own this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author needs to do his research","review":"This book is TRYING to organize well the history of musical theatre, but he gets all jumbled where he talks about 1999 and then moves back to 1984 and then goes to 1997, and you just wonder where he is taking you, and you can easily get confused. He also made some false claims, especially about RENT, where he said that the creator died of AIDS on the night of the first preview. Johnathan Larson did not die of AIDS, and it was the opening night of the NYTW try out. He also makes vague generalizations of the plot and everything of different musicals, and he just isnt complete where he should have been, and instead wastes alot of the time with just boring pointless BLAH. If you want a good musical theatre book, don't look here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonathan Larson","review":"I just wanted to clear something up about a wonderful role model Jonathan Larson who created RENT. This book stated that he died of aids. Get your facts strait! After a visit to the hospital complaining of chest pains, he had been given an all-clear from the doctors. But then, a few days later, he suddenly died, at the age of 35, from an aortic aneurysm. It was the evening of the dress rehearsal. If you are going to write a book, maybe you should get your information correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, heartwarming, inspiring story of redemption...","review":"Having just reread this book for the third time, I thought it was time to write a review and let others know about this beautiful little gem of a book. The story is set after WWII and centers around two souls who were damaged during the war. Mary, a Polish immigrant, suffered greatly at the hands of the Nazis. Nelson, a young American G.I., lost part of his leg to the war and thinks his life is over. Both of these souls feel unlovable and unworthy, but find that through God's grace they can begin to love and trust again.

I'm not sure if it was a day, week, season, year or millieum. Did'nt really anti-matter. The production, lyric's and musicianship are mystifing.

For Natalie Merchant fans, probably the most fascinating tracks will be the earlier ones on the video, since they feature footage of her dancing while on stage and performing concerts in small venues, filmed in elegant black-and-white. Her dancing and enthusiasm and spirit are wildly infectious and her beauty is inspirational and awe-inspiring. Seeing this video, one is reminded that music comes from the whole body, and is also best celebrated there. The video contains some footage of home-movies showing Natalie as a child, musically involved even then, and proceeds forward in time and includes professional studio film productions of some of the later hits of the group. An image that stays in mind is from the footage of Natalie falling, literally, through space, in one of the final tracks. This video is totally enjoyable and an incredible bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This video is a must for any 10, 000 Maniacs fan.

I didn't like it. In a lapse of judgement this weekend, I bought Jump Start Advanced First Grade. I don't like this one either. It is completely complicated. It will say move the balloon into the correct area, and it won't tell you HOW to move it. Playing it the first time is completely trial and error. There are no clear directions, so a first grader can't do it alone until he/she has done it several times before. The whole thing is supposed to be a scooter race. But, it doesn't tell you how to get the tokens you need to start the scooter race. I don't like this at all. I won't buy JumpStart again. I don't like the story line of the game and the game is confusing to play. I don't know if the educational part is good or not, we're still dealing with HOW to play the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY BEAUTIFUL CARDS AND TRUE CHRISTMAS CARDS!","review":"I love these cards.

Five of the songs (half the album!) are among my all-time French Caribbean faves, and there are no dogs. You can't help smiling during \\"Parfum des Isles, a good-natured instrumental. The live Kassav cut, OK but not one of their best, is the only true driving zouk on the cd. The rest are more laid-back, but rhythmically more interesting and appealing, with an almost Brazilian feel. The four of us at work all love this cd, and it has held up well after repeated listenings. We recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine sampler of Franco-Caribbean musical styles","review":"A nice, smooth set of modern pop songs drawn from the French-speaking islands of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, lingering on the more tuneful and diverse end of the Caribbean musical spectrum. For someone like myself, who quickly tired of the manic, monotonous landslide of \\"soca\\" and \\"zouk\\" records during the 1980s, this disc came as a pleasant surprise. It's very listenable and engaging, a nice selection for someone looking for some accessible, poppish world music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brit-Brit's Best Friend Forever","review":"I purchsed this book for my birthday.

The author describes the visual appearance of the chorus on Greek vases and reliefs from the eighth to the fourth century B.C. He then discusses the choral performances themselves, whit reference to the literary sources, and emphasis is given her to the development of the meter, which was fundamental in providing the rhythm for words, music and dance. In some cases, where we have both textual and pictorial evidence, we can visualize the chorus and at the same time discover the tempo of their dance. The interplay of the traditional and the original is of great importance to the development of the Greek chorus. Professor Webster explains how far the Greek chorus was based on tradition, when and where innovations were made, and to what extent different types of chorus influenced each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this coat!","review":"This coat is such a great buy.

Certainly, postpunk stalwarts The Fall and Wire occupy places of honour in their record boxes.That being said, though, this EP is a great addition to the genre.

The EP format seems to have been a very smart choice as I was left wondering by the end whether or not their sound could properly sustain a full record.All that aside though, the fifth track on the EP (May B 1 Day #2) is almost worth the price of the record alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve Winter: Promoter of Easily refuted heresies","review":"Steve Winter had all of these videos online at one point. These videos contain very poor quality bible \\"studies\\" that promote nothing but Winter's personal heretical beliefs. Winter holds to positions similar to the United Pentecostal Chuch and the majority of the Oneness Pentecostal movement. These doctrines are easily refuted with the Bible.

Now, they wait for me to turn it on before naptime and start swaying to the music before it even starts. Mom and Dad never tire of listening to it - an important consideration as it will become a favorite in the nursery! The a capella voices are heavenly. There are male and female artists on the album, and the use of all kinds of interesting instruments from different cultures.

We have another CD of Brazilian lullabies that we listen to every night, but this naptime CD is amazing. More often than not, by song 5 (Arriba del Cielo) they are fast asleep. They both recognize it as naptime / quiet time music and they both love it. Interestingly when our oldest was about 1.5 years old he'd sing his animals to sleep by singing \\"Naima\\" (the main word in the first song) - one of his first words. Our little one - completely unexpectedly - started doing the same thing when he started talking - to him when anyone is sleeping, they are \\"naima\\". :) This music is a fixture for us, and we never grow tired of listening to it as the boys rest.

In order to preserve one's position, and more importantly, contribute at the highest possible level to an organization, HR pros MUST transform themselves into strategic partners. For many, that is a daunting task. Ulrich is the father of strategic HR thinking, and this book, written with Brockbank, is a superb roadmap. Along with explaining the concerns that inform strategic thought, the authors provide a step by step means to assess and address the strategic concerns of one's organization. HR professionals who are motivated to leverage their own value and deepen their organization's real strategic strength could not do better than starting their study here.Amie Devero , Author ofPowered by Principle: Using Core Values to Build World-Class Organizations"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing \\"HR Value Proposition\\" Purchase","review":"I received this purchase within a reasonable time, 3 days.

The book has a distinctly \\"practical\\" tone in the best sense of the word, giving the practicing clinician a clear set of ideas and concepts to work with.

The first movie is so delightful, so much fun to experience that you KNOW he can fly. The rest of them are also superb, funny, heart warming and just plain entertaining. They aren't \\"old\\" movies, they are timeless. Christopher Reeve was an extremely talented actor, producer and director, as he proved in his subsequent work. The Superman movies, however, are my favorites because they make you believe that good will always win over evil, and that escaping for a while into a movie that makes you want to have a Superman around when you need him isn't silly after all. Christopher Reeve's life was one of hard work, love, talent, and strength. These movies help us all celebrate his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"good classic harlequin romance, set in England","review":"Freda loved her work in the world of antiques, and when Bob Arnold proposed to her she felt marriage and its ties were impossible for her.

The flow was strong, it kept me cool at night and kept the fresh air circulating easily in my apartment.Unfortunately, it did not even last the summer before I woke up to the smell of smoke and saw that one of the fans had burnt out and was barely moving. To reduce the risk of a fire, I clipped the two power leads leading to it and left the other fan running on low.

Yet, it stopped working in less than 8 months of easy usage. We never left it out in the rain, or using it while it's raining out (as that could possibly let water seeped into the motor).As far as its peformance, I had no complaints. It aired out my little kitchen as I expected from its size. It's light enough that it's easy to remove from the kitchen window after I'm done using it.So, for its size, I think it performed as expected.

I knew we didn't need anything great, and this fan is just that. It moves air and has NO extras. Its a little loud, the fan blades are small, and it only has 2 speed settings. The \\"biggest\\" deal is you have to physically turn it around in the window. We've had a \\"good\\" Bonaire window fan in our bedroom (...) which is fantastic and has tons of features.

It is powerful enough to cool our bedroom at night within minutes. It can also be turned to blow air outside rather than bringing air inside. The control panel for the fan speed is accessible from both sides, which makes it very convenient to operate in either direction. We've had ours for one year with no problems so far.My only complaint is that the grates are large enough for insects to fly through, so unless the fan is on at all times, bugs can enter through the grates. I'm not sure it would even be possible to fix, because making the grates smaller would seriously restrict airflow, making the whole unit less efficient, but it is an inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under-powered!","review":"Bought this fan to exhaust air out the window in a 8 x 8 room.

Also, having a thermostat come on, as on other fans, to blow in the hot air only when it's hot defeats my purpose for the fan's use too. I WANT it to come on when it's cool (night) and off during the heat of the day, hence this fan + a timer = beautifully cool nights.It's quiet and cools down a decent sized bedroom.You do have to turn the fan around if you want it on exhaust or vice versa.The spacer doesn't always stay in place (the lock doesn't seem to want to stay down) but it works for exactly what I want it to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died within a year","review":"I used it in the kitchen to vent the smoke from cooking.

If it's hotter inside than outside (which living on the upper floor it usually is) and you put this fan pointing inwards it acts just like an AC unit and blows glorious refreshing cool air into the room. I feel safer leaving my windows open with this tucked in them, less bugs get through and I don't have to worry about my dogs poking their heads out the windows (no screens)The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because if you want to reverse the direction of the air you have to take the whole unit out of the window and turn it around, which can actually take a good bit of time if you had it all set up.Otherwise a great product, super happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little fan","review":"I bought this fan at the end of May, and it has been running almost 24/7 since then. It is quiet and circulates the air very well in my small room. As of today, I have not shut it off for about 10 days straight, and it shows on sign of overuse. The only thing that would make it a perfect purchase would be if it had a reverse switch. Taking it out of the window and putting it in backwards is a bit of a pain. Asice from that minor quibble, however, I reccommend this fan to anyone who needs a small to medium space cooled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a terrible fan, but...","review":"It only has the two speed setting, and while one is high and the other is low, there doesn't seem to be much difference and both pretty much feel like medium. It was simple to install, though the accordion-like extension part is a pain and even with that plus the hard slide on extender piece, it didn't go completely across my window. That isn't a huge deal though. I like that if you flip it around, there's also a switch on the other side. So not a bad fan, it gets the job done, but if you want something with a lot of power to blow hard, this probably wouldn't be the one for you.

We see the construction of an authentic greek galley of the period, and share in Severins trials as he and his crew learn the peculiarities of the craft.Then we journey with him from the Aegean sea through the Bosphorous into the Black sea all the way to Georgia. There we learn about the tradition of laying sheep fleeces in the rivers to catch the gold deposited from sources upstream, the source of the legend of the \\"golden fleece\\".A lovely travelogue of Greece, Modern Turkey and Georgia.

Here, he's a mute slave who keeps trying to escape from the plantation of evil overseer Mario Almada (in a rare villainous role). Norma Lazareno is Almada's daughter, who comes to visit and becomes involved in the plight of the slaves, enamored of Marquez (although the relationship is, essentially, chaste). There's action, torture, interracial sexual tension, political subtext, an uprising and violent death. Plus, it's shot on location on what looks like a Caribbean island (I could be wrong) - very scenic, with lots of lush jungle and striking coastlines. Norma Lazareno is pretty sexy, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"New arrival cigars","review":"The cigars were exactly what I was looking for at the best price.

Loretta's books both this one and \\"The Winter Walk\\" depicts much of how I learned everything I know about my culture and lifestyle. Even into the 1950's, life as these books depicted was very similar, times were hard, we had very little western cultural influence, sure we now had books and knew the english alphabet so we could document information but basically we still lived in a harsh environment with only basic necessities and even though times were hard, it brings back fond memories.

Von Karajan is in my humble opinion one of the best conductors ever and even in old age who shows his true mettle. This recording starring Placido Domingo is nothing short of sublime. Un ballo in maschera , is an opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi with text by Antonio Somma. The opera is based on the 1833 French play by Eugene Scribe whose play was about the 1792 murder of the Swedish King Gustav III. The booklet contains 208 pages. It contains well written essays by Gary Tomlinson and Gilles De Van.

In general, they are some of the best introductory radiology textbooks available, with great organization and well selected content. However, the Musculoskeletal Requisites has little in common with the other books. It is organized into a series of neverending lists, which, while perhaps suitable for a study guide, make the reading of the book a chore. While none of the Requisites books are definitive texts, this one has more holes in its content than the others as well. Hopefully the book will be completely revamped for the second edition.

However, thankfully I was given a head's up and learned that there are other sources out there that are far more accurate than what Cote produced about Dolley. I prefer to read and use books that are written by historians, those who have Phd's in history. Cote has a B.A. in political science and journalism. He also uses A LOT of secondary sources in his bibliography. To me, this is a red flag, especially when there are an abundance of primary sources on Dolley.

Is it not safe to assume that producers/writers of this film have yet to graduate from Junior High? This is obviously their level of development. Rent \\"Prefontaine\\" with Jared Leto.

It goes through major sections of Daniel and then proceeds to Revelation.However, the author fails to explain key points in some of his more controversial interpretations. For example, one of his first statements is that the time, times, and half a time is equal to 3,278 years. As this is not an interpretation that I have seen before for this particular item, I would very much like to know how he come up with that number.This is a pattern that I find throughout the book: the author makes a number of interpretations without backing them up. While this is not a bad description of what one person believes the book of Revelation, if you are looking for an indepth study on prophecy, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot more Down to Earth","review":"This book overflowed with new ideas that spurred a lot of new thinking. It included some fascinating parts on conspiricies involving the vatican to the massive multiplication of information in the twentieth century to the synergistic theories of R. Buckminister Fuller to the semantic E' theories of Korzbski to James Joyce. In comparison to the first one this was is less drugged out and makes a lot more sense. The first one seemed more fanatastical and less factual in comparison. The style of the book jgreatly contributed to my interest in it. It is pretty much like ten or fifteen different yet semi intertwing ideas/essays that are broken up and spread out throughout the book. This made alot more interesting than reading a typical book on philosohpy or on a specific conspiracy because the change in ideas keeps pushing you along wanting to see what he is going to talk about next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but hard to time","review":"It works temporarily but hard to time and hold while holding the leash.

A tree is planted over the mass grave and the dead stay quiet. Over a century later the tree is bulldozed down to make room for a mall and the dead rise up. They are not rotting zombies, but eerily beautiful looking creatures that want to blend in with the community. Their goal is to lure people to join a cult and become immortal, soulless creatures like them.This novel takes cues from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and vampire stories, but creates its' own monsters. Jensen is best at evoking domestic suspense moments like feeling watched through an open window or a stranger staring at you from across the road. There are a few gruesome scenes and a general sense of xenophobia that make this novel an uncanny read. If you like your horror leavened with humor Ruby Jean Jensen is not for you.

By that time I was finally able to convince a customer service rep at Denon to send me a replacement unit because they could not repair my original unit. Two weeks later, they are still giving me the run around. No one answers the phone or returns messages. Bottom line, if you need to buy a Denon get it from a place where you can return it if it breaks. Denon is useless. I've never had this much trouble getting something repaired by a manufacturer.

This is a complicated piece of equipment, and if you don't want to go to school to learn how to use it, it will be the audio/video hell you've never imagined existed. I do not believe it's Denon, but any new sophisticated audio/vidio equipment. I don't blame Denon, I'm just disappointed someone can't build better simplicity for us baby boomers who have outgrown owners manuals. This system is integral to the operation of all of your audio/video equipment. I get the system working, and my wife, who can barely operate a car, has it all day, and I come home to no sound, no DVD, no you pick it.

Their products are made from all natural ingrediants, are very high quality and many are comparable to more expensive products. This is a gentle face scrub with a soft, lemon pie smell to it. It leaves your skin moisturized and toned. The only complaint I have is that the exfoliating action could have been a little more intense, and also I did get poppy seeds stuck in my pores on a few occasions (not fun).

That is until I read the reviews here on Amazon. After doing some checking online I've come to the conclusion that almost everyone who has purchased this has ended up with a defective copy and the producers ignore the fans who contact them.

There is a vogue for pretending women saints of the past were secretly dismissive of orthodoxy, and were really closet feminists or Gnostics or sybarites or whatever happens to capture the author's imagination. Yawn. This is just another one of those. I truly wish I had a dollar for every time I heard someone assert that Mary Magdalen or Hildegarde or Teresa was secretly a rebel against the established religious beliefs of her day. The fact that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever for these fantasies doesn't seem to stop people from having them.What would really be interesting to read is a book that takes those women for who they actually were: passionate, driven, and orthodox to the core. Hard to fathom, yes, but why not give the truth a whirl?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzz.......","review":"Impossible saints? Impossible to read.

The Arista Albums cds have been transferred from vinyl record albums to compact disc. The great dynamic and frequency ranges afforded to the listener by the compact disc are not utilized to their potentials with this release; I am sorry to inform you. The reasons for the unavailability of the original masters is understandable. My guess is that Sony/BMG allowed the license to Acadia Music and a second rate job to transpire so that it could gain an easy profit: no need to undergo a proper job when a Mickey Mouse job will pay the bills.That being said, if you have never heard the music on the cds, I recommend hearing it in some form: through LPs or these CDs. Just remember a crude, yet true axiom: You can't polish a turd. Transferring sound from an LP to a CD does not make the music sound any better. Transferring sound from master or multitrack tapes does offer better dynamic range and frequency range than an LP, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful beliefs","review":"This book is interesting.

The images are all very flat, and some of them don't even show the colors right. For example, in Flaming June, the blue in the sky is totally lost. Some quality loss can be blamed on the limitations of the printing process itself. However, we purchased the catalog for the exhibit, and many of the same prints are shown in that catalog with much better results.Buy the book if you want to learn about his life and get a general idea of his work. But if you really like his work you'll be disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greedy Publisher, no new material","review":"What a rip off! I bought this book based upon the description here, thinking it was a new book about collage techniques.

Only by chance did I see this book at my local B&N, checked it out and discovered the hoax. Otherwise I might have ordered it and been really mad because I have the other 2 books.

Since I don't own any of the books the other reviewer mentioned, I don't know if material has been copied - I CAN say that the photos and brief \\"how to-s\\" in this volume were inspiring! There are lots of techniques to explore, and yes, if you want to try and reproduce the EXACT works, you could - but for me, and I suspect for many other artists looking into modern collage ideas, this book provides a number of starting points for further exploration. The works are well photographed and labelled, with artist details included in the text, and overall this book is well produced and presented.If you're interested in exploring collage, this is a great kick off."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book for methods and meaningful projects","review":"I was surprised when I received this book because I was expecting more a technical listing of supplies and methods.

Nothing in the description about that! I like the lamp but hate the lack of detail on operation and incompatibility with CFL bulbs. Needless to say I am returning this lamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"This is the first book by the Thurlo's for me. I got it yesterday and finished it today!!!! I loved it!!!

I'm disappointed. First of all, when the carrier is inflated and rolled, it's quite large, and I'm at a loss for a place to stash it that's out of children's reach. The first time I used it, I rolled the carrier with the puzzle's edges complete, and when I unrolled it, many of the pieces had broken apart, and some had fallen out of the carrier. Also, since the velvet fabric has creases from it's initial packaging, it provides a less than smooth surface, which is difficult to work on. The best I can say is that the product is not very expensive, but it's not at all what I hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"puzzle nightmare","review":"This product doesn't stay aired up.

We have not had this long, so I cannot vouch for it's ability to hold air over a long time, but it seems to be made very durably and comes with a patch if it gets a hole. The puzzle side of the mat is felt while the other side is plastic or vinyl and the 'noodle' allows you to smoothly roll the puzzle up. It is pretty large to store because of the 'noodle' but at least I can put it up on a closet shelf to get it out of the way until we want to work on it again! I'd buy this again, it is very handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This puzzle mat & carrier is a great concept but it didn't work.

It's tough to categorize the books because the topics are so wide ranging. There is material on credit card security, request tracking, data obfuscation and more. And all of that within a slim 200 page frame.I can't recommend this for everyone. This is one of those books that you have to read the table of contents on to know if there is enough material in it for you to justify the purchase.

It played movies and old tapes just fine, but I tried recording on both SP and SLP modes on two different new tapes, and the quality was awful each times. The colors were off and very streaky (sp?). Also had a grainy look, more than any other VCR I have ever seen. Audio quality was fine though.I will never buy a Sony VCR again...they may have been good years ago, but not anymore.

There's nothing like roasting marshmallows to bring all ages together. I especially enjoy this design because the fire is completely contained. I'm confident in leaving the fire without dousing it with water.- Good size for small backyard fire.- Cut outs add to aesthetics.- Works well as a BBQ with a fairly large amount of charcoal. Small grilling jobs are better done on a smaller BBQ.- Fit and Finish is good but not excellent. The protective ring around the top does not line up cleanly leaving a small gap. Otherwise sturdy and well made.- I appreciate the added depth compared to what some other brands offer. Allows for a satisfying size fire.I recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fire pit!","review":"I just bought this item and had some friends over the other night. It was chilly outside and so we started a fire. This thing works great! I like it because it is deep and it holds pretty large pieces of wood.

This is by far one of the heavier albums Neurosis has ever made. Harkening back to bits of \\"Souls At Zero\\", but with newer feeling like \\"A Sun That Never Sets\\". Steve Albini has mixed an excellent album with Neurosis, and I hope that this combination continues for another 22 years. The Limited Edition is in a Digipack Sleve, ten tracks, booklet and lyric sheet. Neurosis also limited DVD Documentary on the making of this album available also, a must have for a collector, great to see the band give their thoughts on what they produced. Check this album out, a must own, and great intro for newcomers also."},{"rating":"2","title":"They still do it better than anyone else.","review":"Neurosis has that distinction of being the progenitors of experimental metal. They've used their creativity and recognition to not only further their efforts, but to support budding musicians as well. This album isn't as outlandish as some of their other material, but it definitely goes to show that in rapidly expanding post-metal scene, Neurosis still does it better than anyone else.The album is pretty rocking from start to finish and goes back and forth from ambient soundscapes to blistering chaos. The songs that stood out to me the most were the title track, Water Is Not Enough, To The Wind, Distill (Watching The Swarm), and Origin. I recommend the album for metal fans and highly recommend it for metal fans who're getting into groups like Mastodon or Isis."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe Neurosis chef d'oeuvre","review":"These guys prove that metal can be a form of art when played by talented people with artistic integrity and who are free to play the music they want. The kind of musical landscape they create is perfectly illustrated by the beautiful artwork of the CD. As usual with Neurosis, it may take some time and several listenings to fully appreciate the music, but it is a rewarding effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing album","review":"I have been a fan of Neurosis for awhile now. My favorite was \\"Enemy of the Sun\\". I think this is one of their best release's ever. This album is heavy as lead, but it also can be beautiful. Epic and lumbering, no one can express sorrow like Neurosis. The dynamics on this record is amazing. Honest music with integrity, and dripping with creative talent. If you do not know this band you should!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one.","review":"This is a 70 minute, 10 song borefest. There are better albums out there for you to spend your time, and money on.

The writing on this one far, far exceeds the others I have read. Although written in 1917, it has a very modern style to it, not \\"difficult\\", as people have claimed about some of the other writers within (give or take) 25 years difference.Taught and emotional, with a selfish main character you can't really feel sympathetic with, under the circumstances, but whom you certainly share his tension. You can't really feel too sympathetic for his love, either, for accepting him as he is, no questions asked. All in all, a very interesting conundrum for the reader, and one which the author wraps up very neatly (a little too disappointingly neatly) at the end.Beautifully, beautifully written. Superb style. Almost felt the sounds and smells of early 20th century New York, and the dank, scouring despair of a coal village. Will definitely download more by this writer.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Randy going strong","review":"This is a beguiling compilation from the tapes Randy California left behind. The sound quality is excellent, the guitar licks as ever hauntingly sensual, and Randy's vocals are a delight - listen to the fantastic self-harmonizing on One By One. Close to You has almost replaced Dark Eyed Woman as my all-time favorite RC track, and has some wonderful J J Cale-style runs. Both CDs include the usual attractive amalgam of blues, folk, sampling and jazz. Both have their highlights - but I especially enjoyed CD 2, which is described as a bonus disc. Most musicians would die to have written ONE of the so-called bonus tracks.

Tibby is lonely and frustrated because she isn't allowed to do anything, for fear of old Miss Pomeroy. Then one day, Miss Pomeroy discovers Tibby playing in the old day nursery, rocking on the magnificent old rocking horse therein.This is a great book for girls that love magic, horses, and mysteries.

Furthermore, he plays upon anti-Jewish themes, such as Jewish control of the media, of the US government.Ben Dib may think of himself as being a critic of Israel, however his cartoons betray a deep anti-Jewish animus.

Having two stories in one book is one of the things I think keeps readers interested. I must say, though, that Josie's story was a little weak. Josh's story was much better in terms of the plot and picturing the scenes in your mind. However, Stine killed a Senior that I was really fond of, so I was a little disappointed. Also, the end made me a little teary-eyed. However, this is a great book, so I would advise all the Stine fans out there to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"o.k.","review":"this was about as good as the first one.

(Their paths only cross for a matter of minutes in the book so I don't know how much there is to dispute. Only a 3rd party witness could confirm.) I can say about the book that...- It was hard to put down.- It was more about the author's life than her rescue. I enjoyed this intimate look at an Iraqi's family life as much as the rescue.- It seemed at times too fantastic to be true but that may be simply because my everyday life is a cozy one in America compared to the author's in Iraq.- Some of the atrocities are hard to read about.

The book demonstrates that the majority of the current canon of the New Testament has been standard from the start while at the same time telling about books which were strongly considered and rejected by the early church (as well as why) along with books in the current canon which were questioned by the early church.

The packaging was also very misleading because it said it supported Windows Media files and it does not. I am returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for multiple folders","review":"First backdraw I noticed: It doesn't have any kind of strap to make it comfortable to carry with you. You have to carry it on your hand, which is highly bothersome if you plan to ride your bike or go jogging or... go fetch a glass of water.I also found this player to be pretty unstable, it tends to skip or even stop completely with any sudden movements, although it says there that it has the protection to avoid taht exact same thing from happening. It might be just an isolated case, and I the only one experimenting this...But then there's another backdraw: it doesn't display the song's names. And it is not easy to \\"navigate\\" in an MP3 cd which contains many folders. You have to go one by one, because it doesn't have the \\"next / previous\\" folder feature separated from the \\"next / previous\\" file feature. So you must know the number of the folder and the number of your song and keep presing the same button until you get there.Had I known this, I wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but poor quality","review":"I bought this for my daughter and was very disappointed when it arrived.

The toy pincers, etc. do not move and are made of the lowest quality plastic. I am planning to throw away a number of the parts of this toy and then supplement it myself to put together a decent Christmas present.

I'm sure the scrub gown will be torn in no time. The stuffed animals included are cheap. My granddaughter did enjoy the stethoscope and wrapping up the family's arms and legs with the bandage.

Twice the work, and totally irritating. Isn't the whole idea of a USB drive that they're meant to be convenient?I haven't used it with the PC yet...

I couldn't run any programs or do anything while the device was attached to my computer so I called tech support. The very first question the guy asks me: Do you have Musicmatch or Nero, because there is a conflict. I look over my shoulder for a camera or something. Um, yes I do have musicmatch, how did you know? This is a common problem with the device. So after I disable Musicmatch it works beautifully, so I ask, can I just remove the U3 crap cuz I don't really need nor want it, and I like the other stuff on my computer and I didn't even realize it had this crazy U3 stuff on there so how do I get rid of it, can I just delete it?

I did some research and learned from other consumers that, even though its retractable, there is no cover, and it doesn't take long for the lint in your pockets to its their toll.

The mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives: a fast and higlhly compatible interface. Any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability.

If your a guitarist looking to get a Hendrix Tribute together this would be great a few songs I love are Crosstown Traffic, All Along The Wacthower, Voodoo Chile(slight return). Also make sure you have the Electric Ladyland on CD before you buy this so you can play along and also get the song down note for note.

These included the aspects of friendship, loyalty, trust, and responsibility. It also instilled a feeling of parental camaraderie showing that one can work with their parents as a team to reach a common goal.

Scripture is USEFUL or PROFITABLE NOT sufficient or enough for all Christians. It is the Church which is the \\"pillar and foundation\\" of the Truth (1 Timothy 3:15). I am now within that Church.

It's not a compilation of research that the authors have done; rather, it is a compilation of other authors and things that they have written about dogs. The writing style bothered me too... although this could be a personal peave that bothers only me.

There were also not enough hints/instructions given that described how to protect particular vulnerable body areas (like joints or back)for the more difficult moves.

The intense heat transfer makes it impossible for the toxic coating to adhere. Honestly, if you're in the market for this quality of pan, your cooking skills probably aren't that great. Trust me, my wife had these when I met her. The very first time you burn something, the non-stick separates from the pan.

It has a good plot and it is a good detective story with which you never know where it will take you. It is written in an amusing way (even in situations that describe something serious the author inserts some funny comments -sometimes even sarcastic- that you can't help laughing).I don't assign it five stars since at some points (not too many, though) it becomes too descriptive and therefore distracting from the main idea. However, if you like books about crimes and people trying to find the murderer, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"black flood","review":"good stuff takes a while to cook and will unleash a black /purple flood on everything you mix with it kinda spennndy for a lil bag o rice though"},{"rating":"1","title":"To much work.","review":"I have to admit upfront I am lazy and not a good cook.

The top notes are very pleasing and women love the smell but it doesn't help this fragrance if you only smell it for 30 minutes and have to be neck deep to smell the dry down. I own about 60 fragrances and growing, this is one that collects dust due to its spotty sillage. A shame, this had potential.

My 4 year old told me he would prefer using the puppy pen instead of the regular one!The only drawback is that if the pen does not hit exactly on the dot then it registers as incorrect. I think it would have been ideal if the actual answers were written on the dots instead of beside them. (For my young children tend to want to click on the actual answer instead of the dot.

Second, is a cheaply made after-market replacement that most likely will not properly fit your air cleaner, leading to a lot of noise and a lot of dirt being blown back into the air. The reason that these are being sold is that Honeywell, instead of continuing to manufacture several sizes of filter to fit their assorted air cleaners, went to a modular system. Your Honeywell machine will take either one, two or three of the smaller modules. My model 17000 requires two of the HRF-D1 filters, and these are a true Honeywell product. The price of these modules is about $20.00 each here at Amazon, which makes them relatively similar in price to one of this POS knockoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite fit","review":"EDITING THIS REVIEW!My husband actually go the the filter into the unit, got the door closed and apparently it's working (the orange \\"filter problem\\" indicator light finally went off).

I purchased this for our 17000 unit and it is NOT the same HEPA filter that came with the unit. It has this weird lip on it that doesn't allow the filter to sit down in the compartment, and as a result the unit door can't close flush on the side. Doesn't work, isn't quite the same.

I started shopping around and they were pretty expensive. This one was the right price and it is very cute. The material is thin, but the belly is foam formed so it gives him a Scooby Belly - (too many Scooby snacks), and the head is cute although it is a little floppy.

If your child has his/her heart set on the costume, order the next size up and expect a cheap costume. Otherwise, just save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Deluxe Scooby costume, this is the standard.","review":"Do not confuse this costume with the Deluxe one that is very plush and stuffed head. The head on this one is a very simple hood with a cutout attached to the top. The cutout does not stay in place and flops around. As others said it runs very small. My son wore it often for about two weeks and the seams came apart. Good for only a few uses. Thin, cheap material. I would recommend the other more plush style Scooby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"This is a poorly made costume. The snout of Scooby as seen in the picture (looks like the bill of a cap) is very poor. It doesn't sit down like you see in the picture unless you hold it there.

This is typical of the entire book.After reading Douglas Wolk's excellent \\"James Brown Live At The Apollo\\" in this same series I was really looking forward to this. What a disappointment! Hardly a page goes by where the author doesn't try to tie Sly's legacy with modern rap music, as if Sly's impact on hip hop was ever in question. The writing style is trendy and cute and the author never misses a chance to include himself in the text. There is nothing here that can't be found in cd liner notes or David Marsh's \\"For the Record\\" Sly and the Family Stone oral history (which I do recommend).\\"There's a Riot Goin' On\\" is genius, and deserves a much better book.

After an hour or so, it ripens and becomes chic and urbane, and so French. It's brisk yet sensual, and once you get the lightness of touch right, simply divine. Woodsy and cedary with overtones of lavender and a mere hint of sweetness, it's definitely a winter fragrance.When I wear this, I always feel taller, thinner and richer; as though I'm strolling on the Champs Elysees dressed in Dior or Givenchy with a poodle on a Vuitton leash.

When I read it again as an adult, having worked for several years as a professional editor, I realized that it was trite and ham-fisted, an obvious vehicle for the author's personal beliefs-not just his philosophical thoughts but his objectivist-libertarian politics as well. If you've ever read B.F. Skinner's \\"Walden Two\\" and been put off by its heavy-handedness, \\"The Soul of Anna Klane\\" will elicit the same reaction, only more so. This book does have a few good bits; two of them are excerpted in \\"The Mind's I,\\" edited by Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter, which explores a whole range of epistemological topics and is far more suitable for thoughtful readers.

After wearing this for 1/2 hour I went to get up and my foot was still stiff (when wearing the night boot and getting up foot is not stiff. Therefore, I know that the tendon/muscle was being stretched while wearing the hard boot.), meaning that there was no stretch while I was wearing it.

Most of the menu options are in Chinese and the battery life is extremely poor. I charged the phone overnight and the battery would still be exhausted by the end of the day. If I forgot to charge it overnight the battery would be dead in the morning. The phone is not compatible with any service I know of, for downloading ringers and screensavers.

Even for the price this thing is CHEAP! The large frying pans handle/latch that is supposed to hold the hold kit together when assembled doesn't! It's way to loose! I thought about sending it back but figure I'll give it to my friends for their kids to play with... it's THAT bad. I am still shopping around for a decent set of stainless steel pans for backpacking. As always amazon shipping was reliable and quick! But I can not recommend this set of pans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Texsport Stainless Steel Mess Kit","review":"the product it horrible and cheap the handle bent on me the first time i opened it. the coleman is cheaper price and better quality. i regret getting this and i would hope they read this and refund me the money . as for the product i threw half of it in the trash the bowl part i gave it to my dog so he can eat out of it when i take him hiking. otherwise this was a bad investment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"This is a really nice travel/camping cook set. The steel is much stronger than aluminum and you can feel it. I had an aluminum set before this one, and one can feel the quality difference, for only a few more dollars get this steel set.Some reviewers say that it is not thick....this is a travel/camping set and one does not want a really thick and heavy cook set if you are backpack camping. This works great for backpack camping. The lid on the one pan needs to be lifted carefully so you do not burn your fingers as the knob is small, but that is a fact on any stack-able cook set like this.Toss the plastic cup, it is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better","review":"I ran into the same problem as others. The top and bottom didn't seat correctly, they kept falling into each other. The handle/bracket that was supposed to seat them together was no-where near where it should have been to hold them together (there was a 3/8 inch gap). Haven't put it to use yet, so can't say if it will buckle when heat is applied for cooking. My recommendation, go to a reputable camping store, and do a visual for fit and function before purchasing. As for me, I'm returning the product and will check out other recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the aluminum","review":"I bought two of these after having the aluminum ones from walmart. These will hold up much better to the rough treatment they get from boyscouts. They arrived on time and the price was very competitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Aragorn toy!","review":"This is just a superb Aragorn! My son loved it and it is so detailed. Great for the kid or collector in your house."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE KING IS HERE","review":"Alright, so you wanted Aragorn in his Pelennor Fields armor, now you got him, complete with the sword Anduruil (Narsil reforged)! He's got fantastic articulation, even though he has no special actions. Aragorn comes with a removable cape, Elven hunting knife, and Anduruil. This is a very nice figure. The facial sculpt could be a little better, but over all it's a must for your Lord of the Rings collection. The detail in Aragorn's armor and clothing is gorgeous and even bears the White Tree of Gondor! Can't go wrong with this figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS THING ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the most awesome Aragorn ever made! If you love \\"Lord of the Rings\\" this is the toy for you! It's a MUST HAVE for your collection. I compared the \\"Two Towers\\" Aragorn to this one and this one totally won. I have never seen an Aragorn like this before!"},{"rating":"2","title":"these rule","review":"the is one good figure the coolest parts are his new tunic with the white tree of gondor on it and anduril (nasil) his sword and knife given to him by galadreal in loren thwe one bad thing is there is no sheth for andurilps i am 14 and have 73 lotr action figure and nead an Esterling so if eny one know whare to get one online could u let me know"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nativity, The life of JesusChrist (in Spanish)","review":"This is a low budget movie advertized asNativity: The Life of Jesus Christ (Spanish)(?) in Spanish, but the only Spanish contents are the titles at the begining and the credits for the music.Then, all dialogs are in English with no subtitles in any Spanish.The voices have been doubed in studio by non professional actors and with no care for the acoustics. A character could be distant but will sound up-front, too close to sound convincing and natural.Some \\"poetic licences\\" : angel Gabriel is a female character (?)Does not follow narrations from the gospels. Pitiful movie. A waste of money and time by the producers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not recommend","review":"I am Indian and could not agree with Lukas Jackson's comments more. I would only like to add one other comment though. I personally do not believe in any organized religion and would love to hear an objective criticism of Hinduism and Islam. But this book did not do anything for me. In fact, what bothers me the most is Naipaul's language. It is very condescending and imperialistic. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is before he came to understand India","review":"This is one of his weaker books. In this, he recycles rather silly psychoanalytic ideas of Sudhir Kakar to describe India, and falls flat on his pace. Nevertheless, it is a useful book to see the evolution of Naipaul's understanding of India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good word play but totally biased and not true","review":"Naipaul writes well but he is heavily biased and most of his musings are just garbage and deserve to be in the dustbin. I would recommend Amartya Sen's An Argumentative Indian for anyone who wants to know more about India."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the dot!","review":"As an expat, and with a broader perspective than the usual cocooned Indian, I very much agree with Mr. Naipaul.India is a sick civilation, surviving much like the common roach through thick and thin, though to questionable purpose.Can be called a parasitic civilization, evolution gone wrong, peopled by psychoses.With as much of an inviting lifestyle as Pond-Scumia.I suggest an objective reading of the book (with a good dose of self-psychology)- especially if you think India is a \\"great country\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book written don't know why.","review":"A complete crap.I had not read any book in my life like this. First of all, the writing is completely unstructured. All the opinions are formed based on a limited communication with set of people. The author frequently takes reference from some old books as well as old drama which any indian would have hardly heard of and morever, the intention of the book seems to be spreading abuse and improper image of indian civilization. A few facts are interesting but difficult to digest in such a way of writing.I strongly discourage people to read this book and form any impression about india present or past."},{"rating":"1","title":"A jaundiced view","review":"The book attempts to describe a country that the author clearly does not understand, or worse, chooses to misunderstand. Like the world-view of a jaundiced man, the book reveals more of the author's view than the reality of the world he is attempting to describe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse Into India","review":"Perhaps it was the setting, for I read this book in its entirety on an overnight flight to Delhi where I was about to immerse myself in northern India for about a month. But it's a fantastic book that seemed to me throughout my journeys to be as relevant today as it was when it was published in 1976. There's no way to really explain India to someone from the west who's not been there, but V.S. Naipaul's writings are a glimpse into the hope and hopelessness that is India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but unsatisfying","review":"For those who want an introduction to India's politics and culture, look elsewhere. V.S. Naipaul writes beautifully --- every sentence is carefully crafted --- but his impressions do not amount to much. While I read, my head was filled with one vivid image after another. I assume this accurately reflects the complexity of India. But by the time I was halfway through, I was lost. What's he trying to say? What's really happening in India? The final third mentions Gandhi (and his complex legacy) on nearly every page, but little of what Naipaul has to say taught me anything. Although this book was a pleasure to read, I'm afraid I can't recommend it. It's simply too scattered and unfocused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus artifact came with the book!","review":"This very thoughtful and considerate bookseller included the fragments of a dust cover with the book. As I'm doing research this additional matter was very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book gives so much insight into the life of Jesus and brings you closer to His character. Absolutely recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the life of Christ.","review":"This is an easy book to read but is also one of the most inspiring of the books on Christ I've read. Very accurate to the Bible account - great for devotional reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Watch","review":"I am one who watches movies from start to finish (even It's Pat) - I ended up reading a book while this was on in the background. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riveting? I think not.","review":"Anyone who is even marginally tech savvy knows where this movie is going inside of 30 minutes. I failed to see what was riveting, horrific, or job dropping as the description implies. At most, the lead male character is easy on the eyes (ok, he's hot!)and the lead female character a pathetic creature who clearly needs a support network and some therapy. While I am certainly by no means diminishing the life in which she lives, recall that her husband says she chooses it. That's her lot. As for the purchase of this video, shame on the writer whose teaser line convinced me to rent this sham. Save your money, this movie sucked. It deserves a negative star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish all right!","review":"I believe that this film should actually be called \\"SUCKER\\". Jeez, I'm glad I didn't buy it. The hype was very good! Too bad the film was not. If by now people don't realize meeting people by way of the internet is a \\"crap shoot\\" than the are really naive."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A DOC","review":"Staged--and obviously so--from beginning to end, this is a movie that purports to be a documentary. I'm guessing that was the distributor's idea, but whatever the deal, anyone who buys into the notion that CATFISH is anything other than a complete fabrication clearly hasn't seen many documentaries. As pseudo-docs go, this one is no worse than THE LAST EXORCISM or PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. It's entertaining and at times suspenseful, but branding it a documentary is misleading, and the story loses a lot of its impact when you realize (roughly ten seconds into the main character's attempt to act convincingly, in my case)you're watching a made up story rather than a documented account of a loser tricking a gullible narcissist into believing in her cyber-fantasy. Had I bought the thing rather than checked it out from Netflix I would've sued the filmmakers for false advertisement."},{"rating":"1","title":"obvious fraud","review":"If u really believe this movie to be real, you are the kind of person this movie is aimed at. Google catfish movie and you will be able to access many articles and blogs that expose the obviously preplanned hoax this film is. The acting was not convincing to me from the beginning. Do a little research and the truth will become obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Documentary I've seen in a while.","review":"This documentary starts as a documentary about something completely different than the direction it is intended to go. I started watching the MTV show \\"Catfish\\" and decided I needed to see where it all started. Amazing. I love it and I love Nev too, he's an awesome individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"This was fascinating and perfect for my teens to see so they are stay aware of the creepers on the internet without their \\"parents\\" trying to scare them all the time. We now watch the TV series. I would love to see all the people Nev contacts that don't want to be met. That would be pretty funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable film","review":"Even if you know the background to the movie/tv show, it is still worth a view. Surprised how I felt about all of the players at the end of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was entertained","review":"I knew the big twist in the movie going in to it thanks to the TV show but it was still enjoyable. Even knowing what was going to happen I still felt a lot of anticipation about what was going to happen next. There are a few moments that are a little hard to believe that they had a camera right there right then but if it's not real it's at least really convincing. Considering renting it on here was less than a dollar different than renting it from Redbox and I don't have to pick it up/return it I'd say it was worth the rental, I probably wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"it is what it is. not bad but not great. but now i know what facebook is and how to avoid being played"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"This film was promoted as \\"A riveting suspense thriller with a jaw-dropping twist\\" but I found it to be neither riveting nor suspenseful, with a \`twist' that fell flat. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, then it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much. It turned out a lot different than I thought in the beginning, but I was very pleased with the way they accepted what the outcome was without trashing her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!~","review":"I saw Nev Shulman on The Jeff Probst Show talking about this documentary which intrigued me enough to want to see it. I loved it - but the reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I'm not sure I would have been able to follow it as well if I hadn't heard many of the details on Jeff's Show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money for something better","review":"I can't believe the amount of favorable reviews on here for this movie. There is nothing shocking or interesting being said in this movie. The marketing for this was telling you to watch this before all your friends so that no one could spoil the ending. There is nothing shocking about this \\"twist\\" ending. If you're over twelve and know that sometimes people lie about themselves when they're online, you'll see the ending coming a mile away. The movie was setup as a documentary but the actors were not the least bit believable. I'd expect anyone in the age range of the actors/filmmakers to be smart enough to know that something was up. Honestly people, don't waste your time on this movie when there are so many better ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE!","review":"What a waste of time! I saw the preview and thought it might be a indie horror flick and it turned out horrible.

No. It's just sad, and I don't believe this hip cool guy was taken in for a minute.If it is true, then his narcissism as he poses for her portrait of him is unforgivable, and just as psychotic as her compulsive lying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of time","review":"A sad movie with sad protagonists that run into a sad character.

The description reeled me in, but it was less than what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is suspenseful","review":"I heard good and bad things about this movie but all in all I would say it is good and is suspenseful, if you can believe it. You immediately start trying to figure out what could be wrong in this scenario but I think it did proved a little twist and something that wasn't my first guess. I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Let me save you some time and money. Don't watch this film. Knew nothing about it, but was totally predictable, and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"The description of this documentary is a bit misleading. It isn't a wild thriller or anything like that. It simply documents this man's online relationship and how it doesn't turn out the way he would like. His girlfriend wasn't exactly honest with him. The description makes it sound like it is an exciting and thrilling adventure. It really isn't. But all in all, I did enjoy it....for what it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This movie is fantastic. The quality was great. The story line was even better - its honest, gripping and suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a thriller","review":"**Spoilers Ahead**The cover and marketing were extremely overhyped. I felt like I wasted my time watching this movie. It's not a thriller, it's not even that unusual of story, it's just a sucker falling for a housewife pretending to be a hot chick. If I had known it was a facebook documentary I would not have felt so duped. However, I think it they are meta trolling the audience by pretending it's a twisty thriller, just as the guy in this movie was fooled by the sad housewife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you must watch this movie, please do not watch the trailer in advance. You will discover the advertised \\"twist\\" at the end of the movie simply by watching the trailer alone. When you get to the end of the movie you will be expecting something else to happen in addition to the \\"twist\\", but nothing else happens. The movie simply ends pretty much as you assumed it would. There are a few completely non-disturbing details that are revealed to explain the obvious \\"twist\\" and the meaning behind the movie, but nothing that will shock you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I am a film fanatic. I have lots of respect for amateur film makers and independent projects. I go to film festivals whenever I can, and make donations to various colleges for film school scholarships. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON CATFISH. It simply just doesn't deliver...I don't know who paid off the movie critics, but it's obvious that SOMEONE did. Probably Nev's family are the culprits, as they are very wealthy NYC socialites. That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe this docu-drama to be a hoax","review":"I believe this to be a scripted docu-drama-- where the audience is as taken in as the young cinematographer appears to be.For me, it's just too coincidental that a road-trip to find out the truth taken by cinematographers should wind up exactly like a well-plotted mystery film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but in the end it's just the same old story...","review":"Well I didn't waste 90 minutes, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone else. It was an interesting story, but at the end I felt that I was given nothing over the expected result of anyone who has ever been on these sites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pissed Off!!!","review":"I am extremely annoyed that I fell for all the hype surrounding this contrived piece of crap! First off, there is absolutely nothing \\"suspenseful\\" or \\"thrilling\\" about it. I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better, or even interesting for that matter, but it never did. It's central premise and big reveal were so anti-climatic that I couldn't understand why anyone would waste 1 1/2 hours on this pathetic example of fake filmmaking. I think the filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank because they pulled a fast one on all us unsuspecting fools! I don't believe a single frame of this garbage!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Hooked On CATFISH (the movie).","review":"I saw this movie in the wake of the Manti Teo news stories. I found CATFISH to be very touching and real, bringing out feelings of compassion and empathy for all concerned. I can see why it was a sensation at The Sundance Film Festival (practically in my backyard). Forget everything about this being a \\"Thriller\\". That's all misleading. I have watched this movie twice already, because I found it that compelling. I will be watching the MTV series. I'm interested in the \\"Why's\\" of these deceptive online or telephone relationships. Take my word for it, you owe it to yourself to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling documentary for millennials","review":"So there's a show on MTV now...

It is well-made and 11/2 hours well-spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catfish","review":"The movie left me with a depressed feeling. The movie did not fit the description as a suspense-thriller. Would only recommend if I wanted to make someone feel sad or to keep my daughters off facebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"something different and very entertaining","review":"This film works best if you don't know the story going in, but even if you do, it's still fascinating viewing. I was hooked from the first frame to the last. If you are at all into social websites, Catfish is a must see. There is some controversy as to whether this film is a true documentary or somewhat scripted. I don't know, but I do know that the complex range of emotions it exposes in its subjects and the like emotions it produces in the viewer are all very real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, sad, honest","review":"Interesting glimpse at the duplicitous trend in Internet relationships. The resolution is sad but brings the truth to light and is done kindly. I admire these filmmakers diligence in pursuing the truth and exposing the thought process behind misleading Internet relationships"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"This documentary is the story of Nev and the family he met through Facebook. He begins to have feelings for Megan, but things soon begin to not make sense. If you have ever seen the show Catfish on MTV then you will know who Nev is. It was a great documentary that had me laughing at some points and shocked by the end. I loved getting to know Nev's story and makes me love the show Catfish that much more because Nev understands what the people on the show are going through."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont see it.. you'll get catfished","review":"dont see it.. you'll get catfished. There is no movie here. No Hitchcock.. no drama... just a sad story.The movie goes nowhere. See the trailer, the big surprise is ... its all a lie fabricated by a 40 year old woman.She's very sad, is living a hellish life and just needed a fantasy world to get her through her misery.

Sad all around... leaves you with a very empty feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"To those of you expecting a graphic twist","review":"The trailer made it seem to have a great end twist.

The big supprise is that people pay to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hook, line and stinker","review":"\\"Catfish\\" is not a horror movie. It isn't even a psychological thriller. It's psychological only in the fact that anybody who made this bit of nothing into a film must have forgotten to wear their brain bucket on a head-first parachute dive.\\"Catfish\\" is akin to a 90-minute build-up to an orgasm that somehow gets sidetracked into volunteer work at a hospice center. This is \\"Paranormal Activity\\" if you took out the paranormal and the activity. I was robbed. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't make it to the end, even the last third, loathed it.","review":"From the opening credits, to the intro shot of our \\"hero\\" talking with his mouth full (watching, hearing, that food, in too close, jerky photography) my stomach began to turn - I hated this movie. I'm not sure I'd call it a documentary. Can narcicism be a documentary? He's right - he's not that interesting. Oh, photography and self absorbtion, look at my cell phone, look at my ipod, look at my cell phone, see how relevant all this irrelevance is, that makes a story right? Click. Click. Photo computer screen. Ahhhhhhhhh, run, run, run.I just fast forwarded it through it all and felt dirty having viewed it. It's like a dull 16 year old's head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catfish","review":"The trailers and advertisements for this movie made it seem like it's a thriller movie, which it's totally not. It's a very boring, over rated movie. I personally couldn't stand the main character at all, he was annoying and didn't seem real. I wouldn't recommended this movie. It might have actually been a cool movie if the person at the end was a serial killer, like the ads for this movie made it seem like, but like I said, it's nothing like you think and is very boring. The movie is about meeting a person online who has false identities and IS NOT A KILLER. So if that sounds interesting to you, than go ahead and watch this boring movie. I was very upset at this movie because of the false advertisements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Good","review":"Simply put, this is a very good, interesting documentary about what can happen on facebook done by three young men who, in the end, are quite kind-hearted, considering. You don't really need to know more than that. Blu Ray is quite good considering the wide range of equipment used. Probably end up buying a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trailer better than the movie","review":"Trailer leads you to believe that there will be a big twist at the end but it never comes.

A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I saw this in theaters after being told that \\"not knowing about what happens in the movie makes it better.\\" This was apparently a common thing critics said. Well, it turns out that they were right. Not knowing about this movie would make it better. Walk away now, before you waste even a moment of your life on this poorly plotted, predictable, anti-thrill ride of a non-adventure.Edit: I know you're probably thinking \\"wow, that guy's review didn't tell me anything about the movie.\\" So here's a bit more detail: You know that guy who keeps emailing you about wiring $10,000,000 from his family's fortunes? Do you think he is who he says he is? Congratulations. You've just discovered an analogy for the plot of the film: people aren't who they claim to be on the internet. SHOCKER."},{"rating":"1","title":"get real","review":"First of all, if you think this is a real documentary, you are unbelievably gullible. It's clearly a \\"fake\\" documentary like Paranormal Activity or Cloverfield. Second, the marketing campaign for this movie made it seem like a scary thriller. It's not. Not at all. Not even close. It's a drama, and not an entirely bad one. But I was left disappointed due to the bait-and-switch of the ad campaign. If they had marketing it honestly, I wouldn't feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ REVIEWS BEFORE VIEWING","review":"Don't be like me and watch the trailer and not read the review. Like many others, I was sucked in to the trailer! The trailer ended with a quote pretending the last 40 minutes of the movie were going to be intense. I got to the half way point of the movie and couldn't wait to see what happened, especially after he looks into the barn. Then I waited and waited and waited for something to happen. I was like a kid on Christmas morning opening up socks after socks, waiting for a toy! This movie is not a thriller, barely a drama. It is a made up story of some weird lady on the internet. It would have probably been a great movie if it had been a thriller or action movie for the last 40 minutes. Please save the 1.5 hours of your life and do not watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow- pretty much a waste","review":"While the movie isn't bad, and has an underlying lesson that today's social networking-obsessed populace would do well to take to heart, there really isn't anything in this film that makes it worth spending 90 minutes of your life on. I can save you the time and trouble just by reinforcing what you already know but probably have chosen to ignore in order to feel connected to the disembodied avatars on your friends list: you cannot truly know someone until you meet them face to face.

As uncomfortable as this situation was, I thought it was fairly well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I Expected","review":"This movie was worth the money. Just recently I have gotten into documentaries and Catfish is what started my obsession. Of course I didn't give it 5 stars, and the reason behind that, was it lacked any plot twist.

But hey, it is a documentary for a reason right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catfish the movie","review":"I gave this movie 5 stars because is was something original. It was exciting at first, then heartbreaking towards the end.

Don't trust so easily, someone on the internet, to fall in love with. I never have and never will.Buying this movie wasn't for myself but for my young friend at work. He's only 23 and loves the internet. This could be helpful for him.The characters are real and I felt all of their emotions in this roller coaster ride, of a movie.I cannot say enough about it.

Having Men for Dinner covers topics as dark and gritty as the Old Testament stories themselves, such as ruthless revenge for rape victims, the threat of war and genocide, and cold-blooded slaying. A feminist scrutiny of the metaphors present in the biblical tales, and how they speak both to the generations of history and to the modern era, distinguishes the meticulous tone of Having Men for Dinner; study questions to stimulate further discussion round out this excellent supplement for private, group or instructional biblical studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"lay reader","review":"This book was much too technical, a good book for academics but much to technical for lay readers.

Just the idea of a (cool, popular) guy making an (uncool, unpopular, nerdy) girl into his (cool) dream date sickens me. All through the movie I silently beg Rachel Leigh Cook's character to show some spine, to act independently, to act like herself. Instead, she is voluntarily molded into a clone. Was this girl so horribly deformed in character before? No. She was simply herself--apparently something these people couldn't live with.This movie sets a terrible example for teenagers--that acting and thinking independently is something to avoid.

The plot-if you could call it that-is very ordinary and echoes about a zillion sterotypes about teenagers. I don't mind the fact that the film is superficial: a film can get away with dealing with superficial characters or situations so long as it has some originality, like Clueless. It's just that the screenplay is second rate and the sort that you can imagine just about any wannabe writer putting forward. It lacks *imagination.* Oh and the acting's not too good either, and the jokes are quite feeble. The only things worth checking out about this movie is the final dance scene and the soundtrack. If you wanna see 'teen movies' with a bit of originality and imagination I rate Cruel Intentions, American Pie and Clueless."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"i just plain hated it.

No features, only a music video (great video). Some people on other websites have said this DVD has only 2.0 channel surround sound, even though the case says 5.1, I didn't really noticed because I saw this DVD two years ago. The movie is a really cute, funny and definitely a date movie for sure. The picture quality is good on the DVD. By the way there are two versions of the music video out there the \\"She's All That\\" version and the \\"Dawson's Creek\\" version, the video is of \\"Kiss Me\\" by 6pence none the Richer (great band), the difference is that the She's All That video has the cast from the movie in it, the \\"'Creek\\" version has footage from the TV show.

At least one reviewer from Michigan seemed to have some sort of feminist agenda in her negative remarks about this picture. My advice is that you watch without your agenda filter on. If you do that, you'll find this to be one of the better teenage romantic comedies to come around in a while. In my opinion, it's better than \\"Ten Things I Hate About You\\", a teenage Taming of the Shrew which I also liked.Having said that \\"She's All That\\" is a good motion picture and worthy of your time, I must warn you that you'd be better off seeing it on VHS than DVD.

John Hughes movies (and others like them) were okay for the 80's because they exemplified the materialistic and conformist attitudes of the era.

Rachel Leigh Cook was a good actress, Freddie Prinze was a good actor, the girl who played taylor was horrible. She is going to end up like the guy who played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs.

And depressed, because if these are real teenagers, then our future has little hope.The video quality is suprisingly good, so I annoyed my wife by playing with the settings on my television and the player.

It's in no way a classic. She's All That really tries to be a good movie, but never quite hits the mark. The first thirty minutes or so was pretty bland. The plot sounded okay (even though it matched the plot of Clueless quite a bit), but the movie didn't meet the expectation level I had of it.

Shepherd presents a good outline of the horrific Gunness case with all its twists and turns and complexities, and provides some social analysis as well: the fact that the trial happened during an election year was highly significant, and your opinion on Ray Lamphere's guilt tended to hinge on whether you were Democrat or Republican. Although there were a few too many misspelled words for my liking, the writing is also good, if not extraordinary.I'm surprised that there are so few books about Belle Gunness. In fact I can only find two besides this one. You'd think there would be more, given how many people she killed, the grisly circumstances, and the mystery as to her own fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Groundbreaking","review":"At first glance this book looked really good however, once I purchased it I found out that it was oversimplified. Mainly just pictures of patterned movements of where to strike an attacker, with no hope of replicating the movments in real life for the average person.

I like the weighted handles for better leverage in twirling the rope. However, it is not so weighted at the handles where the rope snaps from the handles like some other weighted handle jump ropes.Since the rope is shipped with a rubber band around the leather rope, the user will need to flatten in a nearly straight line and allow several uses to remove the tangles."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reliable jump rope","review":"i have no problem with this jump rope, it does not tangle, and it seems rather durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont ever get it damp!","review":"Initially I was very pleased with the purchase for the price. However, the handles are quite shoddy, and the rope itself is not very weighted despite it being leather. I used this about 4 times a week at the gym. On one occasion I got the rope slightly wet from water in the locker room. The smell it gave off is indescribable. It can only be equated to a chemical urine smell that does not go away. Really worrisome as you wonder what chemicals they treat the leather with to make it smell so atrocious ."},{"rating":"1","title":"same=same as the Titanic","review":"It died on the 1st outing. Totally worthless. I did a class at Bally's. The handles don't grip so it slipped out of my hand and hit the floor. The wood broke off the handle.

An inferior prod."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic weighted rope, great for cardio","review":"I've jumped rope for 7+ years for cardio and just purchased my 4th pair of these. I have a a cheap plastic one and a weighted rope (this everlast leather weighted). The plastic one costs only a few dollars that I use if i'm traveling for more than a couple days, and sometimes to mix it up. The weighted rope is a good cardio workout which also tones your upper arm extremely well.This is my 4th pair because the others have eventually cracked through, which happens when it drops repeatedly against the floor at a bad angle. One of them also just wore out in the center where there's alot of friction with the floor. I tried another plastic handled brand, but that cracked around the same area as well, and even sooner.This is a classic, and fully recommend. it didn't receive 5 stars only because it needs to be replaced every couple years. but then again so do all the others. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a sturdier rope","review":"After only 2 months of daily use, the rope detached from the wooden handle. Now I can't even insert it back.

After only 2 sessions, I wore halfway through the rope. A definite disappointment, since this would have been the most obvious thing for a designer to avoid. I feel like Everlast just stamped it's name on mediocrity knowing it would sell anyway...Definitely do not buy this one. I wanted to go entirely back to Buddy Lee jump ropes (which you should do if you jump inside or in a gym), but those aren't made to jump in the cold with (the rope becomes rigid). So I'll still have to look for a good cold-weather leather rope. If you're in europe, the French brand \\"Excelerator\\" is not that bad--much better than the Everlast, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is garbage - BUT - The company gets an A+ for customer service .","review":"This jumprope broke at the handles within 20hrs of use. Its completely garbage because once you look at the design of the handles and how the rope and weight is secured in it, you know it won't last 2 weeks.. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM OR YOU WILL BE HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED ------ I will say this though, the company asked me about my purchase, I told them it was garbage, and they automatically sent me a refund (I didn't ask for one) and it seems like all these other ropes are built the same way around the handles so this isn't the only company doing that... to make a long story short I was disappointed in the rope but very impressed with the customer service of the company. Impressed so much that I am going to purchase another rope. Hopefully this one works out better"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"This is not the jump rope you see pictured. I have bought Everlast jump ropes in the past.. the last one being in 2001. I finally needed to replace it. I ordered this listed rope from Amazon. It's not as it appears.

Initially, I thought that the jump rope didn't have much weight, but after jumping for a few minutes I changed my mind! It really gives you a good shoulder workout. I do 1-2 mins of rope and then switch off with abs and pushups. I gave it four stars because it gets a little bit tangeled and I can tell that after enough thwacking on the floor, it'll eventually give out.

If you can get past that to the actual content, I do agree with some of his ideas, like if you are seen as \\"not provocative\\", most women will see you as a friend, not a lover.

A state funded health program that in my case has a cost of $972.00 per month, is not a realistic option. Sure I can save money by purchasing a seperate policy for the rest of my family, but how realistic is insurance for our family at $1,200 to $1,500 per month? If I have high income then, OK, I've got the savings. But who worries about the savings of $1,500 per month when you have to pay out $1,800 to get it? Answer: a person with lots of income.

You'll want to have a basic knowledge of the French Revolution and invasion of Spain for everything to click neatly in place, but the script does a beautiful job of weaving fact with (total) fiction.

However, I was disappointed as this seemed to be a surreal, directionless look at 18th century(and beginning of 19th) Spain. Each scene was stunningly beautiful to gaze upon, but it flip-flopped between ideas and the focus seemed to shift every 10 minutes or so.Bottom line, it is sloppy and seemed to be missing important plot points."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"This film is an example of one of those can't miss projects that somehow just fell apart. A dream cast, a great director, a brilliant subject - all failing to click in the saddest of ways. I so wanted this to be another great Forman epic like Amadeus , Larry Flynt or Cuckoo's Nest. But while it has all the expected beauty and panache that one expects from Forman, finally one has to admit that it's a noble failure. (But let's be honest, any Milos Forman film, even the failures, are better than 95% of what hits American multiplexes these days.)Don't expect much and you will be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality item","review":"DVD wouldn't play due to minute scratches / didn't return it due to cost of postage nearly equal to price of the used DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story; weak resolution","review":"Some spoilers later:This story is not so much about the artist Goya as it is about some other people in his life during the late 18th and early 19th centuries: an innocent woman condemned by the Inquisition and imprisoned for years; and a monk who impregnates her, then flees and leads a secular life, not knowing where their daughter is.The cast members do an admirable job with some unpleasant scenes--and I will admit to fast-forwarding through the two torture scenes--although I don't know if I completely buy Portman or Skarsgard in the roles of Spaniards. Javier Bardem, by contrast, is perfectly suited to the task.The resolution leaves something to be desired. Portman still doesn't get to locate her daughter and has lost her mind as well; while Bardem is dead and Goya...well, who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie with an important message!","review":"This movie shows you what religious fanaticism and the non-separation of church and state can lead to. Once upon a time the nations of Europe were basically Christian theocracies and we had the Catholic church arresting people for heretical \\"crimes\\" such as being gay or practicing Judiasm in secret.Those arrested had no rights and would be tortured to confess. Movies like this are an important reminder as to why theocracies are so bad and why the separation of Church and State is so important."},{"rating":"2","title":"History through art","review":"Forman takes a perspective of history in Goya's Ghosts that could be applied to anytime and any place. Using the characters of Inez, Lorenzo and Goya who observes them both, Forman demonstrates the cruelty and absurdity of mass hysteria, brutal war and the assumption of unrestrained power. Inez is an innocent metaphor for artistic vision and Lorenzo a portrayal of fanaticism. Watching them both is Goya, unable to rescue anyone in a world gone mad with violence in the name of right. Observing the tragedy of Inez and the blindness of Lorenzo (given a taste of his own cruel medicine over a dining table)reveals to us what would have driven Goya to paint the images of Saturn devouring his children in his later life. Important for its portrayal of these historical events, the film is not pretty to watch, or uplifting, but sobering and thought provoking. With solid performances from the principles, Natalie Portman, once again, proves her weight. Excellent production values."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong with this movie?","review":"I kept thinking this was supposed to be a great movie. The performances are wonderful; the settings are sumptuous and astonishingly beautiful. But the story?? Was anyone watching?At the beginning of the movie, it seems that Goya himself is in trouble with the Inquisition for the prints from his \\"dark period.\\" But nothing comes of it. It is never made clear why the beautiful young girl is really singled out for torture and permanent imprisonment. If it is hinted that she is intended to implicate someone else, it never happens. When the beautiful young girl is released from prison and is found by Goya, why does she never clean up? Stringy hair until the end.Many of the same problems as \\"Barry Lyndon.\\"Sure. Watch \\"Goya's Ghosts.\\" Sit back and enjoy the beauty; just don't try to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"MILOS FORMAN, OPUS 12","review":"**** 2006. Written and directed by Milos Forman. The 1792-1812 period in Spain seen through the eyes of painter Francisco Goya. Don't expect here a biography of Goya, Milos Forman is only trying to demonstrate that the role of the artist can be but passive in history. In this perspective, GOYA'S GHOSTS is a very pessimistic film because we never have the feeling that Goya's interventions in order to save Inès may help the young woman. The production is gorgeous and the actors top-notch. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it was almost funny. Almost.","review":"Natalie Portman's acting was horrific. Fifteen years of torture and all she can do is shuffle her feet and stick out her lower jaw like she's packing a dip? I've seen more convincing portrayals of torture victims in community theater. And after 15 years of being imprisoned she'd barely aged!Also, it was ridiculous to cast Portman as both the mother and daughter (adding a mustache to the latter to differentiate the two didn't make it any more convincing).The script relies too much on coincidence to be believable.I love Spain. I love Goya. I love Milos Forman (Amadeus is my favorite movie). I wanted to love this movie. Unfortunately it was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen.

The Clinton White House tried to rebut Senator Lott, but Delgaudio's book spells out in detail how Red China has gained a foothold at the vital Panama Canal. The book also reports some of the until now untold political history of the Panama Canal.

By contemporary standards Solaris, Ikarie XB1 and 2001 a space odyssey are some of the few exceptions and TV generally fairs no better. The glaring exception of course is The Prisoner but more often the insertion of action scenes or horror is perceived to cover all bases. Therein lies the problem. This collection is rife with this kind of pandering. After the first story, A Clean Escape, (which holds up the best), the series descends into a fest of clichés.

She hated it and said it wasn't authentic sci-fi to her. Sure, there were a few good moments here and there, but most of it was extremely disappointing. Too bad!

How about renaming this the \\"Amateurs Of Science Fiction\\" instead?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Failed Effort","review":"Why can't the movies or TV, for the most part, get science fiction right? Simply, they select the wrong stories and screenplays to make into TV shows or movies - with some notable exceptions of course (and Star Wars or ET NOT being among them). This short-lived series is no different, but it wasn't the acting or special effects, it was the poor stories used as the basis for the teleplays. The adaptation of Howard Fast's The Awakening, for instance, was puerile and an obvious political knock on the USA. The other stories were far from the best of the authors chosen - Ellison, Heinlein (who is not so great in any event), and Kessel.The result was uninspired productions and a quick cancelation.

This collection is along the lines of the \\"Twilight Zone\\" with a mix of different, sometimes pretty odd sci-fi stories. Overall, they are worth watching. I'm somewhat suprised that Stephen Hawking lent his name (and time) to this, didn't realize that he was that 'off the wall'. The acting is mostly pretty good and you'll recognise quite a few 'named' actors. Also, the stories are written by several top of the line authors.

I can hear it two rooms away, it totally dwarfs my PS, 3 120mm fans, and 5 hard drives. I would guess it is ~twice as loud as the rest of my system combined.Thoughts: I read reviews that this card was quiet (a major selling point for me). It isn't quiet at all, it just goes whsssshhh. The fan doesn't sound bad (clicking or whining), it just sounds like it's stuck on turbo. After an exasperating duke out with XFX support, I was finally told contrary to previous messages that recommended nTune and Rivatuner that the 8600GT doesn't have a variable speed fan. It is the 2 wire model, not 3. Anyway, if you don't mind a jet engine under your desk, it works fine and games well. I am very disappointed with the noise though, my only option now is to replace it or buy a $30 heatsink that's actually reasonably quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really shouldn't blow up","review":"I had my XFX 8600 for almost exactly a year and a half. Nowhere included in the box or on the box was any notice of warranty, nor was there any notice on or in the box that one must registered on-line in order to extend the warranty beyond the original warranty period of 1-year.Two of the capacitors on my card exploded one afternoon, and brought my system to a screeching halt. I would not recommend this video card at even a quarter the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise Is HORRIBE!","review":"It scared me to death. I installed this thing in my new DELL computer. A few weeks later I turned the computer on and heard a loud clack, clack, clack, clack. \\"Oh, no,\\" thought I. \\"My hard disk is failing!\\" But it turned out to be this AOC system blower. When I discovered the problem, I thought some wires might be contacting the fan, but this was not the case. On the one hand, I'm glad it wasn't a hard disk problem; on the other, I'm disappointed in the AOC cooler. I even tried contacting the manufacturer, but AOC is apparently out of business or, if not, its website isn't working. Bottom line: Stay away from this.

As soon as I started gaming like a month ago 3 capacitors blew up. It was pretty nice while it worked. I hear you can replace them and they are very cheap.

The air quality within the home is much better and, with a newborn in the home, it really does make a difference.Pick these units up here for a definite cost savings over the exact same unit at your local Sears store.

The main focus of the book is on the positive change brought about by the Khatami presidency.The one drawback is perhaps a bit too much name dropping, a common problem in books written by journalists who meet famous people, but it's a venial sin, the book is well worth reading though it is becoming obsolete as the situation in Iran has changed after the departure of president Khatami from power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Git-R-Done","review":"My husband and I love Larry the Cable Guy.

I was really shocked to hear him making fun of the mentally challenged, the handicapped, small people, God, prayers, etc. His material was totally NOT politically correct in what he called these groups of people. It's one thing to make fun of stupid people and rednecks and life. But to attack people who can not help who they are is just rude. I still love Larry with Blue Collar, though.

The instructor goes way too fast and barely demonstrates the moves. The moves also change rapidly. I think one of the things that bugged me most is the instructor's incessant fast talking. She never stops. And like another reviewer stated I didn't feel any real work out. The flirty workout is actually more stripperish than flirty. My recommendation is to stick with Jennifer Gilardi and Kristin Jacobs--they are really good instructors and you get a good workout. I hope they do more 10 minute dvds.I am adding an addendum--the last two workouts (Swing and Ballet) on the dvd are actually good and finally got me breathing which makes me feel better though I am glad I didn't pay anywhere near full price for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good moves, really bad music","review":"I forgot that the 10 minute solution series have really cheesy music, it so bad that I really don't use this DVD.

I really enjoyed the segments in this one. It was fun to do the moves, I only found a few of them a little difficult at first. I especially liked the Sculpt segment because it was a lot of moves that we actually do in ballet class and it actually felt like a workout not just dancing about. The reason this did not get a five stars is because of the instructor. She is very breathy and kind of \\"sings\\" out the steps. So kind of have to ignore that and just enjoy the moves. Good video overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I was excited to try this as a few reviews were fairly positive. I put the DVD in the player and all of a sudden this Paris Hilton wannabe stands in front of the camera posing for every syllable. It was difficult to take and going further than that would have been cruel torture as this gal doesn't have much of a personality that seems genuine. She is a good dancer, I'll give her that and keeping up was difficult, but that is only because I am not a dancer. I am sure somebody could get a lot out of this DVD if they can get past her and the personality that she was trying to portray. All I know is, for me, in my opinion, I can tell if somebody is really wanting to make a difference in the lives of the viewer by getting them into shape and/or lose weight or if they are just in it to make a buck and stand there looking pretty for the camera. If it's not real and genuine, it's not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlook the wardrobe and dance!","review":"OK -- I admit it. I'm playing fashion police. This otherwise excellent dance workout DVD suffers because of a MAJOR bactarian wardrobe issue in the first workout segment.

Shall I start on the singer? Or should I say \\"siren of Metal\\" as he is called in the booklet, he honestly has the worst voice I have ever heard. I'm not kidding, it sounds like Pee Wee Herman doing metal. I bought this at a used CD store, just for laughs, and thats about all I got.Its funny reading that other positive review here, it sounds like Jack Black wrote it. This is not Power or Prog Metal, its just loud and terrible.

Many people claim this tea is different than what they sell in Canada which may be true but this is good tea regardless. It's certainly not as strong and bold as the British style tea I'm used to but it is a great tea for afternoon relaxation. It has a light flavor and goes down smooth with a nice aftertaste. I plan to keep supply of this tea at home at all times from now on. I love it in the evenings with a book. Don't judge just because people say it's not the same as the Canadian blend.

She sounded like something from another planet. The setting, the costumes, the look (those gold/silver paint on her face), and the acting were so ridiculous. But, I can give it as the director's concept. Was the singing also the director's idea? What a bad idea it was. I own this DVD sometime ago. I brought it without reading the reviews. What a big mistake I made. I really struggle to watch it to the end. Then I throw it into the trash. It was so bad. I give it a one star here, which is the lowest score I am allowed to give.

The air actually felt remarkably clean and fresh. It was a night and day difference. I was overjoyed. I haven't coughed in my room since.

Honeywell -- and Amazon -- should be after these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Honeywell filter","review":"I find the greatest thing about running this filter is that we need to dust the house significantly less often.Another reviewer here recomended vacuming your prefilter. Unless you are doing that outside or you have a true HEPA filtered vacuum, I would suggest you don't do this. You risk making airbourne again many of the things you bought the filter to trap in the first place.

A note: If you have a younger child who reads at a higher level, these books are clean! Not too heavy on the Christianity, either, although Christian ethics are definitely present.

No other tag sewed into the side as would be appropriate if it showed from either side of wear. Whatever. It doesn't matter, if you don't care about brand names showing.

I understand that Lennon didn't have much time to practice, but the majority of the songs were simply blues-based. With Clapton alongside, they could have jammed these songs for a while. It seems to me possibly, that Clapton didn't jam and get into it, because each time there was a break Yoko would start her screaming and throw off any creativity.

It's very tiny yet fun to carry around. I have small hands, so the keyboard is not too difficult to type on. The swivel screen becomes a tablet and is great for taking notes on the touchscreen, which you can use either your finger or the included stylus. The screen is bright but the resolution makes it a bit difficult to read the tiny words onscreen. It's got more features than the ASUS EEE and other mini portables. There's a pcmcia card slot as well as an SD card slot. Plus it has WiFi and bluetooth. Even with the extended battery, it's lightweight.

They have \\"relations\\" not once but twice and then he tells her that he doesn't have time to rescue her until the next night. Of course the next night there was an ambush waiting so she couldn't be rescued.If you like the type of novel where the two MCs do nothing but fight while they are secretly madly in love/lust with each other and then they come together for no apparent reason you'll like this novel.The only reason why this got two stars from me is because the external plot involving Elizabeth I was researched and accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very romantical!","review":"The reason I chose this rating is because I just loved this book!

At first I was very happy with it because I wasn't looking for anything fancy, and I thought the chair was just fine. I only used the ottoman a couple of times because I was more comfortable without it. When my baby was 3 months old the chair started to squeak. At first it wasn't so bad, but IT GOT WORSE. My husband and I tried tightening screws, loosening screws, and used more WD-40 than I have ever used in my life. Nothing worked. The squeak was so loud that we could no longer use it. We have finally removed it from the baby's room, because if you accidentally bumped into it while the baby was sleeping, it would wake him up. I am really disappointed because the chair was basically good for only 3 months.

I have used the glider every day for over a year, and it is still in great shape. The cushions are not exactly the most comfortable in the world; they are definitely on the thinner side of things. Also, the glider does not recline so it is not a chair for an adult to fall asleep in. The chair itself, however, is very sturdy...well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"My husband, my brother(and sister-in-law) and I purchased this chair for my Mom for mother's day. We all have babies and \\"Grandma\\" is always watching our kids. She needed to have a smooth and comfortable rocking chair for her house and she didn't need to spend a fortune on one. This came with the ottoman and was such a great deal. At first, I considered getting a more expensive chair and no ottoman, but it is so much more comfortable to rock a little one with your feet up (sometimes you need to rock for a LONG time!!!).The chair's glide is nice and smooth and it is very comfy. It is also easy to put together. I did it myself before my husband came home! The fabric is not bad; it's good enough for what you pay. Most chairs cost more than this one without the ottoman. Do not be afraid to purchase this chair; especially if you are on a budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP!!!","review":"We liked the color and the price - but this is a bad choice. First, the arm rest cushion was missing a snap when we took it out of the box. We called customer service, and they did send a new one - after 6 weeks. Then the arm of the chair came loose, and the thing has been falling apart since then. A very cheap chair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"The chair has turned out to be more sturdy and more comfortable than I expected as I assembled it. After two months of use we have had no problems - still a smooth and quiet glider.The snaps that hold the arm pads in place are not very strong, but so far I think they have stayed put."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for price!","review":"This glider is just wonderful! It was assembled in 15-20 minutes, and is the perfect accent to by new baby room. It DOES NOT squeek, has a very smooth, long glide, and matches almost anything perfectly. It is not a glorious size, but that's just what we needed - to feel tucked in to hold the baby. I wouldn't trade it for another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"3 Month Glider\\"","review":"I am so disappointed in my glider and the fact that Babies 'R Us will not help us. We sent them tons of customers through baby registry, and yet, when we have a problem, they are not willing to help us at all. The glider is falling apart. There are shards of metal on our floor from the grinding of the screws in the base of the rocker. The glider has the most annoying squeak I have ever heard! It is so loud that I can hear it in other rooms with the doors closed!We bought this glider the day we brought my son home from the hospital. Babies 'R Us stated that they would have helped us if it had happened within 90 days of the purchase. This start 95 days after purchase... Needless to say, this is $150 down the tubes!

The chair is completely comfortable, I have trouble sleeping and this put me out within 20 minutes. It was easy to put together, the ottoman came assembled and the only thing we had to do was put on the back of the chair, the arms, and the cushions. The one thing that I didn't like was the color of the cushions, they don't really compliment the color of the wood. Other than that it's a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"14 negative reviews and my friend","review":"I was thinking of putting this glider on my registry but my friend warned me not to.

If you type babies r us customer service complaints in the yahoo search you will find a website dedicated to this glider and the customer service nightmares pertaining to this product very very bad and to boot it is from 2005.I have to surmise that the glider is not worth the price and that the customer service from babies r us is not worth the price of purchases either.

Once we began to but it together we noticed that the base of the glider was missing the holes for the screws. I called customer service, they siad they send out a new base no problem. I called to check back on it they where very rude and tok me to just wait. It been a month and we finally got the base and it the wrong one.

Third, The glidder make all shorts of noises it does not rock smoothly at all it wakes up our daughter if we try to use it and so now it is in my FIRE PLACE because that is about as good as it will do for me.

Thank you..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate it lower I would...","review":"This is an extremely CHEAP glider not only the look of it but the quality, construction, feel, you name it. I could not return this item fast enough!! Trust me you will be much happier spending a little more money for a nicer one."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a few months","review":"We were so happy to find this combo. The price was just perfect. The chair is definitely narrow but it was comfortable for me. I wondered why the price was so much cheaper than the other chairs besides the fact that the cushioning was lacking and it did not glide as quickly or, should I say, as smoothly as the other more expensive gliders. Then after 5 months of use the arm started to break. Even though we got 5 months of use out of it we wish we spent the extra couple hundred dollars on a better glider. We are now shopping for a more comfortable(better cushioned) and higher quality chair. My advice to those considering to purchase this is to spend the extra money on a better chair unless your funds are very limited. Keep in mind that you do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out! It falls apart!","review":"Firts the arm fell off, then the front of the other arm fell off. The back felt unsafe and I was afraid to rock my son in it. We were finding screws here and there. I'm glad we found them before our son did!! Not the most expensive but turned out to be the worst! My sister bought one from Wal-mart that lasted longer! Think hard before choosing this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"we have this glider for 4 years. it survived over two years of nursing and bottle feedings of two kids. it is undestroyable and also very comfortable for either nursing or bottle feedings! it's the best value for your money! i think it had to be lubricated on two occasions, because of sqeeking. i highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glider/Ottoman Combo","review":"Ugly color in person. Really small distance from arm to arm. I could never fit my newborn and Boppy when I sat down to breastfeed. It was a VERY tight squeeze. The left arm broke after 2 years of owning it. Uncomfortable, rough texture fabric. Always covered with a blanket. Not a great buy at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it...","review":"I received this product within 3 days after ordering it with standard shipping which has made me very pleased. The directions were direct and easy to follow. It was extremely easy to put together since the gliding portion of the glider and ottoman were already built upon arrival. The wood frame is really nice, glides very well, and is sturdy. The foam cushions on the other hand are a bit on the firm side and seem cheap, but I wouldn't say uncomfortable. Definitely have them dry cleaned because the smell may take some time to dissapate, unfortunately, they can't be machine washed. I personally believe that the website portrayed the cushions as beige as opposed to the color they really appear to be which is more of a tan (my mother-in-law on the other hand disagrees). Overall, I think it's a good product for the money.

SYBEX encodes all their product with a over protective licensing scheme, the first several pages of their manual are dedicated to talking about how to install and deinstall your one license.In order to use the software they require registration via web or phone. In my case, the registration number did not come in the factory sealed package and there was no customer support during the weekend.

I saw two of the concerts and was absolutely blown away by the emotions they stirred up in me. Their music is timeless, and their voices still wonderful...richer and more full of life than in their young years. They still have the ability to blend their voices together in a heartbreakingly beautiful way. I disagree that they were lifeless in their concerts. That was certainly not the case in the concerts I saw. I saw two old friends loving their songs and the audience. It was a shared experience of respect and affection between artists and audience. I am so grateful that they repaired their friendship and came together once again to give us the \\"Old Friends Tour\\".They gave me memories to hold in my heart forever. I hope the outpouring of love they received from the audiences gave them memories to hold in their hearts forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"Saw the concert live in Anaheim, CA and the CD did not live up to what I remember at all.

I found Mike Binder to be annoying and ridiculous beyond measure and the absolute implausibility of the storyline caused me to roll my eyes so many times I had a headache by the end of the movie! The whole nun thing was awful. And as has been said before in other reviews here, the likes of Janeane Garofalo and Juliet Stevenson are wasted.Oddly enough, despite my negative impression of the film as a whole, I have a great desire to see Alan Rickman do more comedy. I adore him in his dramatic roles but he has a gift for symphonic sarcasm that keeps me wanting more. Who knows, however, why he chose this project. I sincerely hope some smartly written comedies (let me stress this again, this was not smartly or even well written) come his way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rickman's Comic Genius","review":"I paid an arm and a leg to get this movie to add to my Rickman collection before it was widely available, and it was worth it. Alan Rickman has described himself an instrument. He is most known for \\"playing that instrument\\" as a heavy, and even as a romatic lead. He does each brilliantly. But in Gissing, he proves that he also has perfect comic timing. The movie is a little choppy in its transition editing, perhaps because someone thought this was creative. It is not. However Alan Rickman's performance is incredible. If you are a Rickman fan, you absolutely must own this. If your don't know much about him (where HAVE you been?), you will be a fan when you see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & Witty","review":"Alan Rickman is funny as hell as a British business man doing whatever he can to prevent an American equal from looking good & taking his job!

Quite a departure from his bad guy/romantic guy roles. His comic timing and deadpan delivery had me howling at times...while the physical comedy was just plain funny. Worth the money to see him in such a different incarnation. The deleted scenes/outtakes are priceless, and I agree with the others the dance scene over the credits is both sweet and funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"If you are considering adding this film to your Alan Rickman collection, don't bother.

We also had grinds in the coffee even filling it to the fill line. Did not like that the top was plastic rather then glass but I guess that makes it a little sturdier for camping.

He almost sounds like he's sick and has a throat ache and a big hocker in the back of his throat for most of the songs. Standouts, not much, Don't the Apples look mellow is good, but not essential Big Joe. No liner notes either.

One kindly neighbor woman who has worshipped the merpeople warns her secretly but is too late. The heroine has been chosen by the merman as his mate and she carries strange lost scrolls that may help the merpeople avoid a terrible catastrophe. The merman has a powerful enemy among the renegade merpeople though and that merman may endanger everything - the heroine, the hero merman, the merpeople, and all the earth.

I had to bypass it and run straight to the pump from the battery so now all I have is fast speed/full pressure. Just last week my pump quit too. I pull it off to look at it and surprise it says made in China, just like the speed controller. Add to that the fact that the battery and all electronics are obviously part of the whole sprayer and it's pretty heavy when full and can hurt your back.

My left pedal jacked up my calf, and the chain and gears jacked up the paint on my chain stays, but luckily the hub seems undamaged.Anyway...buyer beware.

The bottom pan was already scratched by the time I received it in the mail, just because there's such a thin layer coating it.

I say it is not quite as described because almost 30 minutes of the 51 minutes running time describes the situation of the Jews in Nazi Germany prior to the conference, leaving only 20 minutes for the conference itself. I think anyone who would buy this video knows most of this information, and wants information about the conference and what happened there. There was very little in the way of details in that regard. The production values were also slightly below average, with the audio of the narrator's voice being drowned out by the music.

Well now the dead have a voice... Out of the evil empire, a voice emerged to tell the story that academia and the media didn't care to hear. This book is haunting, because it brings historic fact to the table from someone that lived firsthand in the Soviet Gulag state.

Allows 2 headphones to connect to one device and provides a certain level of volume control between each headset so both listeners can listen comfortably. Not much else to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality","review":"I use this splitter frequently as an inline volume control to decrease noise from my laptop's headphone jack, as well as on planes where volume control is sometimes limited. I'm happy with the sound, but not with the build quality. One of the two output jacks now only produces sound in one ear/channel, so I always have to use the other one. Also, the outer rubber coating is splitting open on the cable at the connection to both jacks, so I'm now looking to replace it -- with a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A costly headphone splitter","review":"Pay heed to the review below titled \\"Volume control is practically meaningless\\".I had wanted to split my PC speakers and a pair of headphones out of aSoundBlaster card without having to swap the plugs.By the description of the product, I would have thought that \\"Individual Volume Control\\" meant from 0 to 100 (with 0 being completly off). The controls here are more like 90 to 100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool little product","review":"I got this thing so I could split the audio out from my MacBook when watching DVDs. My viewing companion and I each plug in our headphones to each end of the split consoles, each get good crisp sound, and each get to control the volume that comes through the wire. Only complaint would be to maybe have the sound control bar a little longer/broader to effect a broader volume control.

Sliders for volume control a little loose and can be moved easily, but good level control. Do not leave this plugged into a laptop and move around. The pin with bend out of the body fairly easy.

I was so excited when I finally received this product. I thought that this was the answer to my craft organizing prayers. Folks, do not waste your money on this product. It's not worth the frustration. The box is so thin that as you struggle to open the lid it practically bends in half. Once you pry it open, the individual containers are of the same quality and lack of craftsmanship. Some lids are so big that I can't even see the point of putting it on the container. Others are so tight that it takes you 10 minutes just to force it open with a flathead screwdriver! I will never purchase this item again. I understand that aluminum is a plyable material, but if it's so plyable that you can no longer make a good quality product then it's time to switch to something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was recommended to me by a good friend.

I think I was done in three days. There is profound truth and wisdom in this book, and it deals with many things in addition to mental illness. Even though I'm done with the book, I still open it up to read a couple of my favorite \\"must says\\", the intro to each chapter, every once in awhile.

Of 100 questions, I only ran across 3-4 that covered material not in the book. Note: I think Tischler focused really well on concepts, but not as well on contributors to the science. Accordingly, I spent additional time on Wikipedia for some of the bigger names associated with Socioligy (ie, Cooley, Mead, Weber, etc). Overall, it was an informative read and I feel like I came away with a comprehensive handle on the major concepts of the field.

I'm pleased those same experiences are still around for my son and I to share and enjoy some 25 years later. What a program! For those who have a hard time digesting the political inferences and self-analysis that Mr Applebome makes in his book, I say to you; the story is only about a dad learning and growing with his son and ultimately becomes a better person for having those experiences. That is precisely what the scouting experience was designed for. I'm pretty conservative in my world view and found that if everyone thought like me, what a boring life we would live. Cheers to you Mr. Applebome, just let us know when \\"Ben\\" makes Eagle."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed, I cried, I fell off the sofa. When's the movie?","review":"This adventure story is non-fiction, but it reads like a comic novel. Only Dave Barry made me laugh as loud - and he doesn't write as well as Applebome does.

They are examined through a cast of characters so zany you wonder how they all ended up in Troop 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful adventure","review":"I often hesitate about writing these reviews, mainly because I'm horrible at writing period. However, for this book I am willing to make an acceptation. This book not only discussed the controversies that surround one of the countries most famous youth organizations, but also took you into the role of a parent in a Boy Scout troop. With believable characters, and unbiased points of view this book is by far the best work of non-fiction I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't judge a book by its cover","review":"As a Cub Scout, then Boy Scout, and now Cubmaster I picked this book up hoping to read about another fathers experience with scouting. However what I found was nothing more then a hard-left liberal political agenda with some stories of camping mixed in.The story about leaving a campout to go to the local water hole just to watch a basketball game made me question his true commitment to his son.There is a clear line between true Scouters and those just going through the motions.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still a good book--- despite the author","review":"Applebome's a good, solid writer, and the book has plenty of fun spots.It's a good read and makes me want to get back into scouting. I'm an adult Eagle Scout and this book reminds me why I loved scouting: the adventuring ethic, the stress on personal initiative and not competition, the new doors and new horizons that open up. I played plenty of organized sports, lettered in high school and college, and this said, scouting was still far more influential to me. When all is said and done, boys/young men are still motivated by high ideals and principles, by tall examples, and this is the stuff of scouting."},{"rating":"1","title":"the education of an urban sophisticate","review":"I suppose it's quite a feat for a self-styled urban sophisticate to reduce himself to the level of scouting. The author's high level of sophistication is made evident because, gee whiz, he doesn't know the first thing about putting up a tent, or building a fire, or anything else that country bumpkins acquire by sheer instinct. To the reader's ultimate relief, the author manages to get through his scouting experience without having to shed too much of his leftward leanings. After admonishing the scouting establishment for their rigidness and intolerance, Applebome displays the left wing variety in full force, holding the scouts to standards of PC rectitude that he would dare not expect of any other private organization. His book amounts to one laborious backhanded compliment."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Author's chance to sell his side of an issue.","review":"Well written book, I enjoyed his research on the history of scouting. But Mr Applebome has a hatred for scouting and uses this book to sell his point. For every chapter of his experiences as a father's unlikely foray into the woods he has two for why he hates scouting.I would not recommend unless you would like to see the hatred for scouting out in the \\"real world\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other great use for Deep fryer","review":"Just a quick note.

It is approaching winter and there is talk about preparations for war the following year with his fiancee's rebellious countrymen.What attracted me to the first book, Fortress in the Eye of Time, was the drama of the child-man Tristen, and his growth from innocence to adolescence in a time of war and unrest. I though this would be the natural continuation of the sequel, developing his character further and providing insights into his origins. The book is more about palace and provincial politics in an obscure fantasy planet, and not what I was looking for. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fortress series","review":"I enjoyed the book and the series.

Solid performances, striking cinematography and a truly unsettling score more than make up for the lack of budget. And although the story meanders in one or two places at the start of the film, it offers a solid balance of dark humour, decent scares and moments of the truly bizarre.

I wouldn't call this a psychological thriller but I will note that it disturbed me in an insidiously head-shrinking way (there goes another adverb). There are no real shock moments until the end but there are tons of behaviors that I didn't expect and couldn't decide how to interpret; therein lies the power of \\"Unhappy Birthday\\". That power fizzled when the ending turned out to be convoluted, \\"jumping\\" from nowhere with ****** ******** and ***********.

Aurelie Dupont looked superb and in control of her strong body, as did Manuel Legris. I was especially pleased by Nicolas Le Riche's dancing, which was strong and subtle at the same time. There is an interview with the choreographer that I enjoyed because he explained how he was first drawn by the music and then how he worked with it to create the gorgeous movements the dancers did so well. This is not the classical ballet Sylvia but a contemporary version which still preserved the integrity of the story of Sylvia in a more dramatic and modern perspective, which is necessary in order to move the art of ballet forward and keep it fresh and relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sylvia reinvented","review":"While watching this ballet my thoughts brought me a feeling once experienced when I stood contemplating Michelangelo's David in Florence.In fact, mutatis mutandis, Neumeier did through coreography what Michelangelo did through sculpture: giving life,emotions and sensuality to beauty,revealing the essence of the human being,bringing it out from just pure yet soulless perfection.One cannot say it is a neoclassic ballet or a contemporary one.The essence of the steps is classical,the four dancers \\"étoiles\\" are true \\"danseurs nobles\\" but Neumeier reinvented all in an outstanding mix of sensuality,eroticism,colour and inner human feelings.In my opinion it is certainly a masterpiece made only possible with the involvement of Dupont,Legris,Gillot and Le Riche each of them contributing with intelligence and skill to this great achievement in ballet.Last but not the least,the extremely beautiful, colourful,sensual music of Léo Délibes,under Paul Connely direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"love/hate","review":"Wonderful music, brilliant dancers, hideous choreography.This looked like a Saturday Night Live parody of a ballet.

How France loves to subvert its own great composers (always did--just ask Berlioz!). Frederick Ashton's more traditional Royal Ballet production, originally staged in 1952, was broadcast in Britain by BBC Two in 2005 in a lovingly and sleekly reconstructed version. It's a stunning presentation with the classical sets, costumes, and choreography--and the broad emotional gestures--one expects to encounter in a 19th-century romantic ballet based on Greek mythology and featuring the gods, heroes, nymphs, and shepherds of the ancient world. Darcey Bussell doubles as host and star (she's magnificent), and she's accompanied by no less a hunk than Roberto Bolle. BUT--the BBC hasn't yet seen fit to issue this treasure in its DVD series.

At least the primary tune is addictive, adding some fresh twists to their trademark style, particularly with prominent rapping (mostly in Japanese) on the first version. On first listen, my impression was that the P5 were jumping on the j-pop/rap bandwagon...and perhaps a bit tardy for the party compared to some other j-pop artists. Then a few days later I realized that I had played the CD at least a half-dozen times. Obviously any sense of initial disappointment disappeared by the 3rd or 4th play.

Part of the horror and part of the sadness was that vampires within the gamesystem were no longer able to be human. In THIS series not only can they run about during the day BUT one of the laws of the city is that they CAN'T kill a human!

There are so many dymaics played out in the relationships between the characters in each story. There is a lot of exploration into just and unjust violence. As well as an exploration into how language frames our actions towards ourselves and others. All of the stories are worth reading more than once. I especially liked \\"The earthquake in Chile\\" and \\"The Betrothal.\\" I highly recommend putting this book on your must read list. Life will be different after reading Von Kleist. Many of the stories deal with something which is oddly familiar, yet mysterious at the same time (uncanny)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A writer of genius","review":"H. von Kleist is one of my favorite writers.

This is not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Balanced View","review":"Reese has written a book that can be daunting to someone who may be looking for quick answers. The Vatican is such an arcane institution that it is impossible to give a short, comprehensive answer on the operation of the Curia. As a researcher, I found Reese's work immensely informative; it also provides some balance to the more sensational allegations of Luigi Marinelli, although I doubt that his work is to be discounted either. It shows an institution that is prone to the same errors of judgement and behaviour in its denizens as any other, but with a higher degree of moral rectitude expected from it. It is a fascinating excursion into one of the world's oldest surviving bureaucracies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbiased","review":"WHITE LIGHT DARK NIGHT: THE REVOLUTIONARY LIFE OF JOHN PAUL IRarely have I seen a book written about the Vatican which is as unbiased as this one.

The protagonist deals with many issues confronting every one: spiritual ambiguity and conviction, passionate love, tragic loss, and one's sense of place and community. The novel moves in three timelines: the doctor's growing up in Europe and courtship of his wife, his imaginary tale of Gulliverian wanderings in the mysterious land of Antipodes, and his hometown of Dayton 13 years after the doctor's famous letters from abroad.

You get sucked into the book by the pure pleasure of the fantasy but then discover that as you have been busily digesting the tasty story, you are also ingesting healthy morsels of philosophy and faith. Of course, this is probably what Dr. Uyterhoeven (aka Hansen) intends all along, much like the way I hide my dog's medicine in a piece of cheese.

If everyone accepted chaos, there would be no war.On the side of this being a big joke, I laughed a lot while reading this, especially at the 3rd commandment. There is some really great absurdist jokes, and hilarious stories.What you think of this book will depend entirely on how you read it.

Malaclypse The Younger avoids running around his ideas and giving hints to the reader. Instead he forces a reader into a head dive sucking him into his world. A true work of poetic terrorism.To some this might seem as an explanation for just another religion, to others a blasphemy and a selected few as a whole new way of approaching the world. This book is a must have for any chaos magician, a big giant sigil designed to awaken your mind.CAUTION: After purchasing this book expect Eris to play head games with you and tasting chaos early in the morning.NOTE: Principia Discordia and Principia Discordia or How I Found Goddess And What I did To Her When I Found Her are the same book except for a special afterword and a collage found at the end in the later book.

As a lifelong Lakers fan, charting back to the West/Baylor/Chamberlain/Goodrich era, following up with Kareem & Magic, it is certainly satisfying seeing the Lakers doing so well now. I wasn't a big fan of the falling out between Shaq and Kobe (don't know how anyone could be) and I could almost sense the end of another era coming when they split. Kobe, however, is too fantastic a player to give up. And now backed by All-Stars Gasol and an energetic Fisher, the new Laker dynasty is something to behold and is charted very well in this DVD. Some solid extras, but ultimately the story of how the Lakers struggled and overcame to win in the end is magnificent.

Game 7 starts and they just show a bunch of slow-mo shots and then they say that the Lakers won. I've seen homemade youtube highlights with better story telling. It is almost like they couldn't get broadcast footage of the real game so they had to use other cameras and practice footage.Also, the DVD is letterboxed and looks horrible on a widescreen TV.If you like the Lakers, then you'll probably enjoy watching your team shoot shot after shot with a lot of slow-mo.

History is rewritten to suit our modern sensibilities - Jodha was neither Akbar's only wife nor a skilled swordswoman who loved cooking and caligraphy, Akbar was not an athletic and handsome ruler with a democratic heart, and the existence of his evil, politically powerful wet nurse is yet to be documented. With its veneer of authenticity, well-chosen songs, lavish costumes, and numerous reenacted battles, the movie succeeds in recreating the golden age of Mughal rule in Northern India.

I only wish some of them were in the film itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star plus epic","review":"Magnificent movie!. I saw the movie before reading the reviews. I totally disagree with those who criticized it and totally agree with those who gave glowing reviews. This is a not to be missed movie not just for the acting, the set designs, the costumes or for the lovely romantic story but also for the excellent spiritual message. The music is also awesome. We did not have a problem playing this on our DVD player although we did have to play it on normal instead of widescreen in order to see the subtitles but it didn't detract from the movie. LOVED IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is the most beautifully filmed movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching! The set designs are very exotic, the costume and jewlery out of this world, not to mention the native India beauty of the people. I also thought the acting was very believable. The one striking scene I absolutely loved was the Sufi singing on the marriage day, how Akbar's experience with God was illustrated, and the raising of his Kundalini in praise to his God while dancing. Jodhaa's singing to Krishna was also beautiful. Could go on and on, but basically I thought it was an outstanding film. Kudos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is a FAKE!","review":"This DVD is a pirated version of the movie. We saw the movie in theaters and it is an AMAZING movie. We highly recommend everyone to see it in theaters or wait for the official DVD set to be released. This DVD is missing portions of the movie, the sub-titles are either wrong, make no sense, or are missing all together.Do yourself a favor, and wait until the official copy comes out. The sub-titles are so bad that in some scenes it completely changes the tone of the movie.Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai are wonderful in this movie.

The acting is appalling, the staging pathetic and as for the battle scenes, with thousands of extras, they were laughable. When you can witness scenes such as are achieved in say \\" Kingdom of Heaven\\" and see this travesty. I wonder that the producers dare inflict it on an unsuspecting public without some warning on the box. The extent of the violence seems to consist of a lot of fake limbs being lopped off and quantities of red paint being sprayed around. I have never really understood \\"Boolywood\\" movies and if this is an example, I never will.Even the costumes looked as if they were made of plastic armour and the cannon were a joke. Singing and dancing do not make up for an abysmal movie. A total waste of money. Caveate Emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aishwariya the worst actress ever!","review":"Total disaster.

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very old story","review":"Recorded, translated, edited and annotated by African epic scholar Thomas Hale, who has, by the way, done extremely detailed work. \\"The Epic of Askia Mohammed\\" is recounted by a griot (the keeper of the spoken word)--a form of storytelling indigenous to Africa, unlike the novel, which is a European creation. A large part of the African epic poem is devoted to prayer. Another large part of the poem is recounting genealogies, as one of the griot's main jobs is linking people of the present to their past. Not a very exciting read (unless, of course, you found \\"Beowulf\\" exciting), but if you're interested in learning more about African epic poetry, this is definitely a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to learn about jewelry design?

The subtitle \\"Universe of Design\\" is most misleading as regards this member of the set--I have not read the others, so I can't review them. The book is simply a puff piece about Van Cleef and Arpels: names various members of the family, discusses some ongoing motifs in design, and does a lot of name-dropping.

The cover shows a small block Chevy with a large Wiend blower sporting two 4500 series carburetors and the caption reads \\"How to build horespower for maximum street and racing performance\\". While there are plenty of respectable 350 builds for the street, only one is over 383 cid at 406 cid and only 513hp. Again, a heavy hitter on the street but not even coming close to the capabilities of the engine pictured on the cover or what the write up suggests. The one blown SBC they do build is a mild 470hp. There is a lot of good info in this book but the cover and write up is very misleading. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that good","review":"Seems like it was written 10+ years ago... not really what I was looking for at all.

It has a great selection of words, sentence fluency, and organization. What will happen next???"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's nowt better than a Dalziel/Pascoe mystery","review":"Reginald Hill brings serious talent to bear on the often-debased mystery genre. His stories never fail to compel the reader's attention and (often) emotion, and in \\"Fat Andy\\" Dalziel he has created a monumental (sorry) character. And that's not to downplay Pascoe or Wieldy -- but Dalziel's shadow is a hard one to get out of.\\"The Wood Beyond\\" is a particular favorite of mine. I thought that the WWI and present-day plots were extraordinarily well tied together, not always the case in stories using \\"time-shift\\"techniques. It's further proof that Reginald Hill is one of the best writers -- not just mystery writers -- working today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wondered about the name?","review":"This is one of Hill's better Dalziel and Pascoe novels, marred only by the author's continued insistence on showing off his extensive knowledge of the English language. It may be heresy, but I rather prefer the TV adaptations, which tighten and speed things up a bit while keeping the essence.Ever wondered why Dalziel's name is pronounced \\"De-ell\\"? It's a Scottish surname. At one point in the series we are told he was born and brought up in Yorkshire of Scottish parents (now there's a nature-nurture mix to conjure with - growing up in Scotland I was told that a Yorkshireman was really just a Scotsman with the generosity removed!). In the original Gaelic the name has a character that early typographers though looked like a \\"z\\" and rendered it so in print, even though it was not pronounced like that. Other Scottish surnames have undergone a similar fate - Menzies should actually be prounced \\"Ming-iss\\" and still is, in Scotland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least readable","review":"I love Reginald Hill, but this book was not very readable. It jumps back and forth, not very successfully, between WWI and the present day. If you are a history buff who is interested in WWI, you might enjoy this. I'm not, so I found myself skipping sections. Not my usual style when reading R. Hill. I usually savor every word. Not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Mr. R. Hill reaches unknown heights in this marvelous saga, which intertwines a vary sad and depressive past with a flamboyant present story. Congratulations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Lacks either humor or suspense","review":"This novel is very disappointing. Pascoe's invovlement with his forebears just doesn't make for even marginally compelling fiction. The environmental aspect is doubly disappointing because it reveals a political correctness, which we knew Hill felt close to his \\"soul\\", but had wisely jettisoned (except for Wieldy), and Hill tries to have his cake and eat it too. He presents environmentalism as a positive good, but also presents it in such a way that it comes across as absurd. Dalziel is depicted callowly (Was he in the novel?) NO way in world that FAt Andy would go for the girl Hill has chosen for her. Finally, the novel is shrouded in \\"fog\\" (miasma) I realize Hill was aiming for something special, but for this reader he missed wildly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting detracts from otherwise excellent performances...","review":"I saw the excellent Pierre Boulez production of this opera, loved it and wanted to see another. When I saw this and Golaud appeared in a 19th century parlour sitting on a wing chair remarking that he is lost in a forest ... And then shortly finding Melisande lying on a table covered by a cloth ... Whew! What a stretch of the imagination this production demands!!! It only gets worse, with Melisande eventually hanging out of a huge chandelier, which is supposed to represent a tower. Etc.The performances were fantastic in spite of the setting. All deserve five stars. Even so, I thought Richard Croft as Pelleas and Christian Oelze as Melisande were too \\"normal,\\" compared to Neill Archer and Alison Hagley, who somehow managed to portray an \\"other-worldliness.\\"If you already know the story, then you will enjoy this production, too, in spite of the setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pans","review":"These are great pans for baking.

You really can't go wrong with anything by National Geographic, their name is synonymous with quality. The maps are beautifully drawn and provide a good amount of detail. Even though we have a GPS, you still need to pull out a map once in a while. The atlas has a nice little section with writeups on some of the most popular national parks. I actually planned my 2009 summer vacation from inspiration I got from this section. The atlas is large and softbound, but it has a sturdy plastic front and back cover so it is very durable - you can throw it around in your car and it will stay in great shape.

I need equipment that works. I have no time to be fiddling with a toy. This card has been a disaster. From the moment it was installed, it started blue screening with stop errors related to the drivers. Calls to support did not help. Even Netgear doesnt know why this card doesn't work . I have downloaded new drivers, Quadrupled the RAM to 2 Gigs, and hired a network technician to fix it. It routinely causes a stop error, and all data is lost. This slows down my business.

After their shallow warranty period has ran out, they insist you purchase a service plan.

First, it took me 3 days to set up my network because it could not capture the proper IP address. When I contacted Netgear, they told me to disable my firewall and security settings. That worked, but wasn't safe for my private information. The card worked fine for about a week. One card is no longer recognized by Windows. The other card mysteriously changed its own settings and no longer recognizes the network, nor can it connect to the router 5 ft away. I've tried everything tech support advised. Uninstalled, rebooted, reconfigured, and even reinstalled the O/S. Tech support has not been helpful. If you look at the Netgear User Forum, it is infested with customers with the same problems. Netgear is not addressing these issues. Buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The start of a great series...","review":"Combining the technical story telling of Clancy, with the cultural interactions present in Babylon 5, \\"Terra Prime: Ripton's Ride\\" lays the groundwork for the first in a multi-book series.

I haven't even unlocked all the characters yet and I've had it for over 2 years. The music is awesome (except for one song that is so annoying it actually beat my sister in annoyance) and the amount of time you can spend skating around without actually touching the ground is amazing.

Horrible pre-1982 graphics and actual dialogue boxes that interrupt your game.

What did they leave out?? Smoking....maybe in the later levels but I'm sure it must be in there...this game has all the juvenile qualities of a under the age of 9 epic disaster"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid GAME!","review":"I've owned this game for the last few weeks and have come to the conclusion that it is a terrible waste of money. The entire point of the game is to do graffiti. The levels are extremely easy and the handling of the characters is sickening. One of the big things in the game that you are supposed to do is rollerblade and grind on rails and jumps. This part is fine except when you want to stop. Many times it will take multiple minutes before you can stop grinding or you have to completely stop what you are trying to do and jump off in the wrong direction, which gets very irritating. Also numerous times when you try to turn around, your person will begin grinding and is virtually uncontrollable. In conclusion I wouldn't buy it unless it came with the Xbox(which in somecases it does along with a good game, Sega GT 2002)."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is so boring","review":"on this game all you hear is who ha when who ever that person jumps and if you ask me it is the worst game for xbox ever since xbox came out don't wast your money on this game like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"DUMBEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED!!!!!!!","review":"This game is stupid!

I dont know maybe in japan this is a popular style of game but i cant get anyone to play it for more than 15 minutes before they beg me to put something else in.

The much-exalted soundtrack is really above and beyond the call of duty (It makes Tony Hawk's sound [bad], basically). The idea of the game is fresh, it combines genres nearly seamlessly.What may (or maybe not) be overlooked, though, is that the game is incredibly beauitful. I bought this game while away at school, and playing on my small, old, (in a word: poor) television, it still looks gorgeous. I can't wait to see it on a tv with s-video. Aesthetically, the game pleases most of the senses (haven't tasted it yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"JSRF","review":"I'm glad this game with my x box cuz it's just odd. there is really no plot.

Graphics suck, to animated and the camera angles get so screwed up. You Spend more time recentering the camera just so you can see where the hell your going.

Sproul doesn't waste words in this short (230 pages) overview of Reformed Theology. The first half of the book explains the major ideas of Reformed Theology: centered on God, based on God's Word alone, faith alone, devotion to Christ and a proper view of the covenants of Scripture. The second half of the book explains the acronym TULIP (total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irrestible grace and perseverance of the saints), which is often called the Five Points of Calvinism. Using direct, readable language, Sproul explains that God is sovereign in all things, including salvation. Obviously, Sproul writes from a Calvinist perspective, but he is respectful of other theological views. The last chapter of the book, Perseverance of the Saints, is outstanding. It is a great source of comfort in that it explains that true believers cannot lose their salvation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works Like It Says","review":"This does allow for much less chlorine.

It's a large book with large photos and it covers a wide variety of subjects.

This is an extremely slight book that offers no real insight and says nothing new about any of its subjects -- Transcendental Meditation, the Maharishi, or the Beatles (who appear very little). We learn that practicing TM has benefits but is not a panacea; the Maharishi was not all he was cracked up to be; and celebrities are treated differently than other people (and bigger celebrities more differently still) yet they are human beings too. Stop the presses!The best thing about this book is the photographs, many of which and others can be seen online at www.thebeatlesinindia.com.

But consider that this product sells to health conscious people. Such people are likely to take vitamin pills already, and so any additional dose is redundant at best.I am disappointed. I have been looking for gum containing baking soda for a while.

For the longest time, I have been wading through grammar books in my attempt to become conversant in Farsi. Most grammar books go on and on about grammar and introduce very little conversation or new vocabulary words at the start. They emphasize how to write the Persian script which is complex to learn and all new words are written in it so these grammar textbooks insist that you can read and write Farsi before speaking it. Well, since I need to be able to communicate with Persians in dialogue this book is much better. Not perfect but quite useful to quickly get basic level of speaking skill in Farsi."},{"rating":"2","title":"ketabe khub!","review":"I liked this book a lot. I took a college-level Farsi class and found this was more helpful than any of our textbooks in our conversations. I thought the dictionary in the back was also helpful because I could follow the logic. For example, in my full dictionary, I couldn't find \\"pet\\" or \\"pets.\\" This book explained that dogs especially aren't commonly kept as pets, which was interesting.I did not like the English transliterations. I thought they were distracting. I was also learning to read and write Farsi, so I wanted to look at the print and see words, as opposed to seeing something that needed translating.

It uses background music from what they call the Crum Sessions, and constant background noises allegedly enhancing the listening experience and heightening imagination. This review is a CAUTION for those that do not like background effects, as nothing in the description mentions dramatization.While I appreciate the time and production that went into marrying a great voice artist with the appropriate background sounds, I find it very distracting and annoying. This is an adult themed book, it doesn't need juvenile background foley effects.The book itself is charming, touching, shocking, and humorous.

Wow, I thought, perhaps this is a jewel of a writer that's somehow flown under the radar. Not so much. The profanity and hillbilly humor is overboard and there were two scenes with boys watching a woman urinate, which seems like the authors fantasies coming out onto paper. The main character is an outcast and not one of the characters is well defined. By the end you get the sense that you none of them and if that's what Maynard meant to portray, then it was a story not worth telling. As a young writer with little experience I felt absolutely great after reading Crum, knowing that I could write down whatever fell out of my mouth and have it published.

It doesn't take long to detect Maynard's extreme ill-will is rooted in his pent up hostility about his homelife or lack thereof, noteable with his constant references to his living quarters in the \\"shed\\" and the cold or indifferent upbringing he is subjected to. Just as the storyline is limited to vulgarities and ignorance, Maynard's vocabulary is limited in the use of the mountain dialect which is generous with repetitious profanity. This misplaced malice slanders a bible belt culture and propragates an already negative sterotype, leaving this reader yearning for Maynard to sort out the real nightmares buried in his mind. How unfortunate Maynard has chosen to put forth a literary value that is just as ignorant as the fictitious characters he depicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I couldn't put this down and read it in one sitting.

You get different shots of the same snowy mountain peaks and a few pictures of villagers wondering around, a road or two of somewhere in Iran, and nothing else. I mean, nothing else.

I've seen them live more than once, and this DVD does an excellent job of capturing the energy and feel of a live show. They sing all the old classics, and if their voices have dimmed a little over the years, their passion for their music (and the cause) has not. This wonderful DVD could serve as a soundtrack for the Troubles; the Wolfe Tones certainly worked hard to publicize and popularize their political views over the last 40 years. Now that the Troubles are thankfully over, they seem to have mellowed a bit, but their love of Ireland still shines through every performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WOLFETONES","review":"This was probably the worst example of Irish music we have watched,,,merely an anti-British political statement by a bunch of drunkards,,,We only watched about two thirds of it until we gave up in disgust,,,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly candid","review":"A very candid, raw view of life on the streets, vivid drug use..for me, too many recantations of drug episodes to a point of disbelief, although I do not doubt Ms. Brown's life as a troubled teen. A marvelous look into the works of divine intervention!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I knew very little about this book when I bought it, so I had no preconceived ideas about the story. Unfortunately, it doesn't take long to realize this book is a fabrication. I realize family law and social services of the 1970's were substandard, but the custodial chain of events in this book makes no sense. And never have I heard of an 11 year old child taking to alcohol and drugs from the first MOMENT of use. And if she did abuse drugs and alcohol to the level described, there's no way this VERY detailed account could be possible. I have experience in this area.... I know! The entire tormented-rebel account of her early years has a self serving quality to it that is similar to the depiction in A Million Little Pieces. I'm sure Mrs. Brown's real life story would have been far more interesting than the embellishment presented here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh Don't Read","review":"This book is seriously bad. I'm baffled by some of these good reviews. The story seemed interesting at first, but it is horribly written. It is not interesting and for literally 150 pages it's just \\"I went to work loaded\\", \\"i bought some crack\\", \\"i bought some more crack.\\" The writing style and skills of the author are horrendous. Most chapter-ish things end with \\"Little did I know that wouldn't be the last time I made that mistake.\\" Dun dun dun. Please. It's like fifth grade writing. And I also agree with others questioning its accuracy. The whole custody battle seems very odd - I highly doubt the state would force children to go into foster care when blood relatives want them, and then she says she keeps a job even though she sleeps on the floor and comes in drunk. I don't know about that. I'm kind of mad that I wasted my time reading this inane book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Cake is a piece of junk.","review":"Memoir? It reads more like a fraud-moir. Little in this book rang true, but it fails even if one takes it as fiction. The writing is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book of inspiration and determination.","review":"This is a great book to inspire those in addiction who think they can't change, or make it back. It is also a great look at the things that cause a person to fall into self destructive habits, i.e. abuse, broken families, and preditors. It is a great guide for those seeking to work with abused and addicted persons. It identifies what is required from you to hug someone back to life. Thank you sister Brown, May God continue to Bless you to be a Blessing for us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging","review":"It takes a lot of courage to write this great read.

Through her story you know that you yourself can do anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and rewarding","review":"I don't normally read memoir's, but the cover caught my attention first followed by the brief description of the book and the author. The history of Ms. Brown's life was riveting, insightful, and surprisingly inspiring. I feel as if she wrote this so the reader wouldn't feel pity, but rather could really understand what she was living through. I gained so much understanding of drug addiction and I was inspired by her recovery. So much so, I am incorporating some of her 12 step lessons into my own life.Buy the book, you won't be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Inspiriational Memoir","review":"I was drawn to the cover of this book that was sitting amongst other biographies and memoirs on a table of the bookstore. It looked happy and inviting. Although this book has a happy ending Cupcake Brown's journey to get there was truly Hell on Earth. Her story is shocking and nothing short of miraculous. She reaches a bottom that is truly in the deepest and darkest of trenches and was able to climb her way out and soar above it all. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"REDUNDANT","review":"Overall this book was a good read but 3/4 the way, it started getting repetitive and drawn out. Nice ending. Happy for Cupcake Brown. Her story was quite inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read but full of LIES","review":"This book was a pretty good read and a page turner, but it's a memoir, and should be called \\"A Piece of Fiction\\". How the HECK CAN SHE REMEMBER ALL THESE LITTLE STORIES AND BITS OF INFORMATION when she was drugged and high?!?! For her to write such a long book describing small details of what went on during the years of crazy drug use and \\"blackouts\\", she would have to have THE BEST memory on the planet, even after years of drugs and waking up next to a dumpster.And sorry, but no law firm would hire a girl that came in dressed like a slut, talking back, and hadn't brushed her hair or teeth in weeks.Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read!!!","review":"My friend recommended this book to me and I just finished reading it today.

I soon came to be highly disappointed by this book though because it seemed so cliche\` in the fact that almost every drugged out junkie seems to find a god and heal themselves; then discuss it for 15 chapters. Aside from that fact, almost 3/4 of the book was about doing various drugs, I felt it was drug out too long and could have been summed up in fewer chapters. It got to be monotonous and tiresome reading about the authors junkie habits over and over again. Although the book had great potential and could have been one of the greats; I felt it became monotonous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book is shocking, entertaining, inspiring, and absolutely wonderful.

A very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed fabricated","review":"The book started off very interesting, however as I continued to read a lot of the story seemed fabricated. It is obvious by the way the book reads, that the author has made a lot of the details up. If you're looking for a good auto-biography this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story starts well and ends just so so.","review":"For the first 250 pages this was the best memoir I have ever read. I touted it to all of my friends, neighbors, and anyone who would listen. When I got to the last 200 pages, however, I was bored by the writing style which seemed (forgive me) lazy.Overall, however, Ms. Brown's story is absolutely incredible and she should be commended for getting through adversity that would have killed anyone else. I loved the way she wrote so candidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book could have been 120 pages but with all the lies she make it over 400 pages. If you can get this book from the library or a friend please do so. I had to read it for my bookclub but was very disspointed. She repeated a lot of stuff and it was hard to beleive most of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my money","review":"This book was a selection for my book club and one of the few books I wish I had gotten at the library.The book was poorly written and honestly hard to believe. I may be jaded due to the \\"Million Little Pieces\\" fiasco, but this book, to me, is quite similar. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that A Piece of Cake turns out to be a chunk of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"This woman has risen above some terrible circumstances;I agree to this fact 100%, but with that being said her editor should have really taken a red pen to this horrible writing style. Considering Cupcake is now a lawyer I would think she would be a stronger writer? Also, something about her story feels exaggerated, as if they exploited her life even more. Overall there are a few golden moments in the book but many key characters are never fully developed or simply disappear leaving a lot of unanswered questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of triumph!","review":"Unbelievable story of life's cruelty inflicted upon an individual, only to turn things around against all odds. Great story. A true story of triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Amazing Read","review":"This was an amazing read. It was certainly a page turner. I was inspired by Cupcake's fortitude. She is living proof that no matter what you go through in life you can overcome any obstacles so as long as you believe in yourself. I liked how she was so candid about her past without leaving anything out. The fact that God was carrying her through such turbulent times allowed me to understand her message. God is always with you. I was excited to see how in the end everything she went through had a purpose. I emailed this author and to my surprise she responded. It made me love her that much more. I will recommend this book to everyone. I bought a copy for a friend and my brother. Both of them loved the book as much as I did. Her life was full of so much pain, but she overcame her triumph and her evil demons. This is certainly a five star read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Review","review":"I am not a prude but, while life as it truly was for this girl, it is a pretty raunchy book for a teenager (I am a Senior Citizen).If you are buying with thought of giving to a Teen, I would encourage you to read the book first to see if appropriate for \\"your girl\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"This a wonderful book about resiliency and survival. The book focuses mostly on Ms. Brown's experience with drug abuse. Its a great inspiration to \\"change your life around\\". I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves memoirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece Of Fiction","review":"I had my suspicions that the majority of Cupcake's stories were completely fabricated, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt... until the part about a bunch of hardcore, murderous, 1980s Crips dressing up in sheets, going to a toga party, and chanting \\"TOGA! TOGA! TOGA!\\" Yeah I'm 99.9% certain that NEVER HAPPENED.Cupcake, in her repetitive and nearly unbearable writing style, recounts the many scams she employed to pay for her lifestyle. I think her biggest scam of all is probably this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Fake? Four stars entertaining One star believable","review":"This book could could be categorized as fiction and it still would sell.Does it remind you of A Thousand Little Pieces? Yes, too much does not sound believable. Why? She claimed to have lied on her resumes to get hired in law firms and for several office jobs. How did she managed to stay employed as long as she claimed when she came to work high? How did she manage to be competent at work while being high? And no one checked her references and checked out her background? How does she recall so much detail when she was using drugs, pills and alcohol? Her friends she claimed also helped with memories. But many of her friends were getting high with her. The times when she wrote about experiences they were written as if she was alone and she claimed to be high. So, how does she recall so much, while claiming to be so high and no one was with her to recall the incidents as she claimed to remember?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"I read the previews of this book and thought I need to get this book!! When I recieved this book I began reading immediatley a remarkable story, Cupcake had a lot of ups and downs in her life but with God and supportive people around her any thing was possible!!If you havent read this book I suggest you pick it up a true page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Piece of Cake: A Memoir","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It kept my attention, it was an easy read and most importantly, it gave me a better understanding of the life of people who unfortunately get involved in alcohol, gangs or drugs--the \\"street\\" terms used for drugs or gangs, why people get involved in gangs and drugs and what affect it has on people and their family. What's even more awesome is the fact that through everything Cupcake endured, she went on to become an attorney. This book (and Cupcake Brown) is a definate motivator for anyone regardless of their idiosyncrasies. I highly recommend this book............."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATING...AWESOME","review":"Cup has written a masterpiece regarding all aspects of her life's battles. The memoir covers child molestation, death of her mother, abandoment of her birth father, drug and alcohol abuse, sexual abuse within foster homes, gang banging, several abortions and rape. However, when her life was at its lowest point, she finally overcame her negative obstacles. She entered a drug rehabitation program and then enrolled in a community college. Cupcake worked diligently for several years and later obtained BA and JD degrees (graduating magna cum laude), gained employment as an attorney with one of the best law firms in the San Francisco area. This memoir proves that you can survive and have your \\"Piece of Cake\\" if only you desire to achieve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing","review":"This book was written at first grade level. I was not impressed with any part of this story and I find it hard to believe that anyone would find this story interesting. Any human who has destroyed their mind and body with the amount of drugs as told by this author, would surely not have enough brain cells left to write a book and certainly not enough sense to get a law degree. If this book is a true memoir, there is nothing to brag about. Many people lose their mother and many people grow up in destitution but they choose to be better. There is always a choice and plenty of government assistance for those who really want to be better than their circumstances. This life story made me sick and I am sorry I paid money for it. Don't waste your time or your money on this poor excuse for a memoir"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and wait for the movie, it'll be cheaper and someone else will write the screenplay","review":"The writing in this book was so poor, despite what promised to be an excellent and inspiring story, I gave up after the first chapter. The irony of course is that in the acknowledgements Ms. Brown praises her editor (and the rest of the known world) to high heaven. I had to scratch my head and wonder what exactly did the editor do here? Coming fast on the heels of the James Frey debacle, I'm glad that the author was careful to validate the veracity of her memoir, but as big an injustice as Frey committed with his lying, you have to give him credit for one thing. At least his book was a page turner. A Piece of Cake is just a bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torn","review":"I thought this was a riveting story with a great ending. However, some things didn't add up for me. I don't do drugs and I can barely remember what happened 2 weeks ago, let alone 10 or 15 years ago in as much detail as Cupcake. I do wonder how much of it is actual recollection or and how much is her own paraphrasing of her memory. However, the thing that bugged me the most was how or why would any decent law firm hire someone that dressed like a [...] and didn't brush her teeth? That makes no sense. I can't imagine they were that desperate for help. Also was it me or at the end of her book did she not say she didn't charge for speaking gigs, however, on her web site she has fees listed. I don't have the book in my possession so I can't vouch and correct me if I am wrong, but, I just thought it was hypocritical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard-hitting memoir which brings readers right into those rough streets","review":"Thirty years ago Cupcake Brown woke up wondering why her mother hadn't awakened her as usual: her mother's death would lead to her life as an abused foster child, prostitute, and gang member before Cupcake would evolve from the ruins of childhood as a capable adult. A PIECE OF CAKE chronicles how the eleven-year-old survived the child welfare system, ran away from one mishap to another, and how she survived drugs, alcohol and a life on the streets until a shooting changed her life. Her story comes alive in a hard-hitting memoir which brings readers right into those rough streets.Diane C.

Inspirational without being cheesey. I think everyone should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crack Addict Tells Her Misfortunes","review":"I liked this book. I never got a true sense of empathy or understanding for the main character because even as life events are described there is still some detachment from the voice to the reader, I found it interesting nonetheless. Cupcake, whose mother has passed, becomes a prostitute as a young teen and later becomes a struggling drug addict. It gives the reader an uncut perspective inner city life plagued by poverty, drugs, and abuse. If you're looking for a shocking drug memoir this book would be a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was an Amazon recommendation for me. I saw that I could read pages from the book, so I did. I read every single page they allowed me to. When the book arrived I started reading and could not put it down. I read at work, I read at the traffic lights, I read in the drive-thru...I simply could not stop reading this story. I finished it in one day.Many have said that it's not the best written material but yet I believe the purpose of writing a story is so people understand and enjoy reading it. I so enjoyed hearing this sister's story and have recommended the book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should be read by everyon","review":"This book should be read by anyone who wants to understand what it is like to lose a parent at a young age, go into foster care with a woman who is a foster parent just to make money, to be abused at the hands of her foster parents, and to have no support system. I couldn't put it down. This woman also joins a gang and gave me huge insights into the reasons young people find gangs attractive. She is an alcoholic and a drug abuser--and yet is able to finally break free of her demons and soar. I bought this book for both of my foster daughters (now adults and part of our family). This book is one of the most compelling books I have ever read--and increased my understanding tremendously of people living on the margins. No young person should have to go thru what Cupcake Brown endured. I give her a tremendous amount of credit for turning her life around. What an inspiration! She has definitely been in the trenches."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome story!","review":"I read this book in 5 hours-granted, I am a speed reader, but this book caught me by the first chapter and I couldn't stop reading it until it was done. At the end of the book, I put my head down and sobbed. I sobbed because I could identify with Cupcake even though I've never been abused or on drugs or anything like that. I sobbed out of joy that she was able to make it thru such a horrible past and overcame to make something of herself. I love this book-I do feel that it got a bit repetitive which is why I gave it 4 stars. I also wish she had expounded more on her law school experiences and what happened after law school. This book was so entertaining that I didn't even notice any literary style-that wasn't the point. The point of this book is to uplift and inspire and it did so with flying colors. It also makes for one unforgettable read-I still think of her story everytime I get scared to go back to school. I think, if Cupcake could do it-so can I!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"One of my all time favorite books. Funny, moving, and amazing.

It got to the point I refused to drive when we went out so I could read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cake I've ever tasted","review":"This memoir is indeed the best book I've read in years. Cupcake Brown takes us all through a series of emotions starting with sadness due to the horrible loss of her mom when cup was only eleven, and many other emotions in between such as anger, joy, and disappointment. I laughed, I cried, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book from beginning to end. Some of the other reviewers find the book to be unbelievable as if to ask how can one person go through so much, which only begs the question how can people be so ignorant? There were no embellishments in the book, and there is nothing fictitious about this book at all. I can only imagine how difficult it is to survive after being orphaned, and completely stripped of everything you knew to be stable. The best and most impressive part in the book was when Cupcake overcame her demons and later became a successful attorney. Truly inspiring. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kit for camping","review":"i bought this kit almost ten years ago...(the cups back then were blue). it has come on every camping trip ive been on since and has been a great mess kit. over the years ive lost the plasic cups, but they werent too helpful anyways. it has held up very well, seeing what i put it through each trip. eventually the plasic on the handles will become a bit brittle, but i usually bring along a pot holder anyways, which makes that a non-issue. the set fits together very well and the copper bottoms help with heat distribution. i gave it 4 stars because its great but not perfect. the handles fold out of the way well, but eventually the plastic wears out. the plasic cups are CHEAP-but who cares. the sack mine came in was plasic (useless)...and im not sure if thats changed- if not, id suggest getting a mesh stuff sack. overall, this is a great set for camping-its too heavy for backpacking. the stainless steel is a welcome change to anyone used to using aluminum.

I've been using a sandisk memory stick with this product up until I got my microsoft zune. The included audio cable worked fine. I decided to buy the Zune FM Transmitter (see that review...blah!) and quickly went back to using this.I will say that it sounds better when you connect an audio device instead of using a memory stick. With a memory stick, it seems like you have to turn the volume of your car stereo up higher, which causes slight static (nothing too bad though). When I crank my zune all the way up and connect it to this device... I only have to turn up volume on the car stereo a little... and it sounds perfect... so clear you'll think you have a CD playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Don't waste your money on this product.

The one I bought worked fine initially, but stopped working in less than a year. The transmitter part broke. If you want something that could last, you are not advised to buy this one.Another problem: It does not remember the exact position you stopped playing last time, it only remembers the song. So next time when you play, it starts over from the beginning of the song. This is not an issue with songs (usually 3-5 min short), but a big problem when you are listening to some sort of long recordings (say stories more than 10 min long)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"This unit lacks the capacity to use the 87.9 frequency that is seldom used by actual radio stations, and is therefore a good choice for a modulator if you want static free and distortion free reception - especially if you live an an area where the FM band is crowded. Unfortunately, we had to buy the unit to discover this essential defficiency. I feel ripped off and I would advise others to avoid both this unit and this manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works as described","review":"For the price from Amazon I have no complaint. I tried both SD Card and USB cards.SD cards work a bit faster but that may because the USB card I used was 1 GB while my SD cards were 512 MB. All in all I am pleased with the unit. I have had it for two months and hope it will hang in for months to come.Why not 5 stars ??? The warranty is only for 30 days. That time is far below the industry standard for electronic. Sort of a red flag that this company has no faith in the durability of this unit.I use this unit in my motor home and find its transmission range is very good. FM radios in the rear pick up the transmission signal with ease. Would say range is about 30 feet or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"Mine didn't last more than 8 months.

I have not yet tried using the USB input, but I think the sound quality would be even better. I am completely satisfied with this product. The only reason it got four out of five stars is because I feel they should offer it in black and the lcd display is not the greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Made","review":"This product plays music through my car stereo very nicely. The problem is that you cannot read the display screen on it unless you pull over. The swivel head stayed in place for about a month and then it kept falling so you had to keep pulling it back up to change songs. I dissasembled it thinking that there was a screw to re-tighten... wrong. It is just a plastic barrel that snaps into place, when it lossens up there is no way to tighten it back up. The 2 gig SD flash card that Amazon recommended only seems to hold about 3/4s of a gig. I have not been able to figure thast problem out yet. All in all this product is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor sound quality","review":"I was so disappointed with the sound quality of this device that I returned it. Music files that sounded great on my computer were noticably reduced in quality due to the FM transmission. I thought Audio Books would work, but there is so much hissing and buzzing that it was hard to concentrate on the book. BE WARNED there is NO REWIND or FAST-FORWARD through a track. There are only forward and backward track skip. If you have a large audio book file and lose your place or forget to pause when you leave the car, you cannot get back to your position in the file. The device \\"remembers\\" which track you were playing when it loses power, but it starts over from the beginning of the track, not at the place in the track where you left off, as in a CD player. The lack of a power switch seems quite odd to me as well. Overall, the device seemed like a great idea, but it just wasn't thought out well enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this junk","review":"I bought this and within ten minutes it failed. I was completely dissappointed with this purchase. I loved the concept, but the product is cheap and will not hold up to normal use. Lesson learned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work, don' buy","review":"I have a Kingston 2GB USB drive. It doesn't even recognize it. Nothing happens when I insert my usb drive.Poorly implemented USB support.If there was an option to rate below 1 star, I would have done that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic customer support","review":"This is an amazing device. I've had one for over 2 years and it worked flawlessly until i wore it out. I ordered 2 replacements but one had a problem and wouldnt work. However, VR3 gave me a refund and took care of the issue in a very professional manner.Great device, even better customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive","review":"This item is almost double the price of other similer FM Modulators.I would suggest buyers to look similer products with almost half the price at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for audiobooks and podcasts","review":"This product worked great for me. What I like most is that it will pick up on the track where it left off, which makes it great for use with audiobooks and/or podcasts. Since it starts at the beginning of the track, I use an mp3 editor to split large audiobook files into 2-3 minute segments. Then if I turn off my car, it will pick up again no more than 2-3 minutes before I left off. Not perfect, but this trick works like a charm for me. Some static from time to time, but nothing I can't just ignore."},{"rating":"1","title":"USB didn't work","review":"I was looking forward to getting the transmitter because of the SD port. Well, the SD port was the only thing that was decent about it. It played good but the display did not read \\"true\\" ID3 tagging like it was advertised as having. It reads the name of the mp3 file - ONLY.The USB slot did not work at all. I tried a Lexar and a Sony. The lights on the drives lit up but the display on the transmitter did not change and it did not play any music at all.The other bad thing about this is the display does not work (and not supposed to) at all with an mp3 player!If you read the \\"fine print\\" - about the display feature, it says \\"when available\\". I guess I am expecting too much out of a $50 technical item.I'm sure one day, another company will come up with something like this that will work and advertise everthing accurately without any hidden statements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Good for About A Year","review":"I purchased this product about 1 year ago. It worked great using SD and USB memory. After a year the unit began to fail. Now it may or may not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for a short time.","review":"This device worked pretty well considering its small size and many features. Most of my files have artist and title linked, and you can read the display if you absolutely need to. A big improvement over earlier transmitters that cost much more and had to be in line of sight with the antenna, plus this one does not even need an mp3 player.Unfortunately, it worked just under 60 days and now displays \\"no media.\\" I have had a VR3 head unit in my van since Oct that plays mp3 cd, usb, line-in, sd card and reads the new hd signals. It was $89 and has performed impressively."},{"rating":"1","title":"mp3 modulator","review":"This is the second one that I have bought and I have yet to get this thing to work. I've tried using key discs and SD cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Just Fine","review":"I have no complaints on the VR3 which I purchased. It works great. For the price and what it does no one can go wrong at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER WORKED","review":"Just the first time, I used it, the signal was little bit noisy (even with the adjustemnts), but then I pluged it out for the nigth, next morning I pluged in again and it symply never worked again."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned two of them...","review":"Length:: 0:13 MinsSound output was very low with some static; a printed page included in the packaging insisted I press and hold a button to fix that... it didn't. It never recognized either a USB or SD inserted into it. Returned it, got another one, same problems, returned it too. Not in the mood to try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many movie references, but otherwise a wonderful book","review":"I find it a little pompous of other readers to thumb their noses at this werewolf volume because it includes so many references to modern day serial killers. Obviously they missed the author's whole point! I loved this book BECAUSE it draws such a clear connection between the types of crimes traditionally attributed to werewolves and those commited in modern times by men such as Jefferey Dahmer. This book is also FILLED with traditional folklore from Europe, Asia, AND the Americas. My ONLY complaint with this book is that it wastes so much space on cinematic werewolves and the actors who have portrayed them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Werewolves etc etc etc","review":"I picked up this book thinking that I was getting a book about werewolves. Although it does contain some werewolf lore, it also contains a lot of information that is really a stretch to relate it to werewolves. I agree with others who've mentioned serial killers--why here? Also there is repetitive information in entries with no cross reference to other places where the same thing is discussed--seems like padding as other reviewers have mentioned. There are some interesting tidbits here, but a werewolf or shapeshifter book, it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Werewolves? Start here","review":"If you want to take your study of werewolves and other shape shifters out of fiction and into the realms of history, science and the occult this is the books to start with. Not only does The Werewolf Book have entries on all manner of shape shifting beings from myth, and accounts of supposed real life were-critters, it also encompasses the books and movies that influenced the image of shape shifting and werewolves throughout history and made it what it was today.Nothing is treated as trivial, not even the effect comedy, such as Abbot and Costello's monster movies, has had on the mythos. And while the encyclopedia isn't exhaustive in its entries it does offer a plethora of titles to seek out for further research. Certainly a core directive in the study of shape shifting beings The Werewolf Book is an essential part of collections that cater to researchers, occultists or fictionists.Contains: some disturbing descriptions of witch trials and tortures"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the author best work","review":"I enjoy a lot other titles from the Brad Steiger, maybe 'cause the topic difilcuty or lack of something, I consider the author miss the mark w/ this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't read but looked inside...","review":"Check out the viewable sample of the book first! I looked through the index and it doesn't even have an entry for lycanthrope or lycanthropy. What kind of Werewolf Encyclopedia would omit the scientific terminology for a werewolf?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad.","review":"This is one of the worst attempts ever seen at being an authoritative sourcebook. The author references himself, often in this very same book, numerous times throughout. Nothing new here as every entry is culled from other, better sources, and many of the excerpts are shallow at best. Overall writing style is poor.Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. If you recently bought it, return the thing and save some money with which you can buy some decent books on lycanthropy. Whatever you do, do not take Brad Steiger's words seriously.Of course, it *could* be good for a laugh or two, but what little bit of rubbish isn't?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slack and inane","review":"This is one of the worst put together books I've ever seen.Consider Steiger's author blurb on the back - \\"more than 150 books to his credit\\" and \\"his interest in werewolves was piqued when he saw ... The Wolf Man\\". There you have it - his main qualification is that he likes werewolf movies, and, considering how many books he has to produce, he writes in a hurry. So what does he do in this book? Flings in everything he can find that has the slightest possible connection with anything occult, violent, animalistic or just badly behaved. The book cost me #11.99, and there's about three pence worth of thought in it.His information comes mostly from movies, all of which are more entertaining than this book, and Eisler's \\"Man Into Wolf\\" - a very intelligent book, well worth reading, which Steiger doesn't understand at all and has mangled into an inane pop-psychobabble mess. Just read Eisler and save yourself some time.A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a dog...","review":"There are numerous unforgiveable errors (miscaptioned horror stars etc.), irrelevant entries, and general bad writing and research. There is a link between serial murder and the werewolf myth, but Steiger's either unaware of it, or doesn't trouble himself to investigate it in his copious pointless coverage of sundry random serial killers. The real tragedy is that given the space in terms of generous pagination, and budget evinced in the prolific illustration, there was the space here for something definitive. Instead, this is a mess. This needs more than exposure to the full moon to transform into a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Book","review":"The Book contains coutless Movies, Myth and Legends based on Shapeshifters, Demons and Other Myths. I read through the entire thing the when it arrived and i was intrigued by the number of sources and information it had in it. I reccoment it to any fan of a good Moc-Historical Myth Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource for Werewolf Information...","review":"The Werewolf Book is a tool. A great tool. It is a launch pad; an introduction into the far reaching corners of another world. With in its 600 pages, it covers a vast history of myth, legend, and even film, leaving no stone unturned. As a writer, I felt it extremely useful. It was and is, extremely easy to pick up and read. Written in an encyclopedia form, allows me to jump to a needed subject matter in minutes. It also opened doors for further study.If you are looking for a book that will help you study the varied world of werewolves and their alike, then the Werewolf Book is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"I got this book from this very page, and I must say, it's great. It's not excactly the best Werewolf guide made, but its a great book. You REALLY SHOULD HAVE THIS if you're a Werewolf lover like me. It also includes some other shape-shifters and a few serial killers. Its got reviews of most every Werewolf and transformation film made! Plus some ways to \\"become a werewolf\\" that old villagers and writers said. A great book. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the novel, it is a play!","review":"I bought this book expecting it to be the novel, but it is a play adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a good bedtime story....","review":"This book is only good to read when you are unable to sleep. The turtle chapter was pointless. It did not get better as it went on. It got more boring. We HATE this book. We do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond words!","review":"This book seemingly has no point. Despite it's philisophical ideas that are highly intelligent and meaningful, Grapes of Wrath still sinks. The main ideas of being nice and decent end up being bogged down in 30 page chapters of the endless rants of Car Salesmen who cheat customers or the pointless plight of a land turtle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bite me Steinbeck...","review":"If one could have rated this book as a negative star amount, I would have been that person. This book is 600 pages of pure torture. My opinion is that the law enforcement agencies should use the form of this book on tape, along with some Woodie Guthrie Dust Bowl Hits, to force criminals out of hostage situations. I, along with my fellow A.P. classmates, were subjected to this horrible display of literature by the ever lovin' Mrs. Ehteshami-Afshar fo Morris, Illinois. The ending is as if Mr. Steinbeck was bored out of his mind, so he just decided to stop writing and tie up ends. This book reads more of a history document than of anything closely resembling a novel. A.P. students unite, and rid the classroom of this boring work of literature!
