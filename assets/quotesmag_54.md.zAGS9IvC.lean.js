This has to do with the fact that gluten free flours may be more or less dense than conventional flour. So I decided to purchase a kitchen scale. Since all the recipes that were tried and true with weights were in grams, I decided to find one that weighed in grams. I did not want an electronic version as I do try to be good to the environment. Upon reading the description for this scale I thought it was exactly what I wanted. If I want to weigh in kg it is perfect, but my recipe calls for 2 weights of 15g. I can only approximate.

The ratchets are an interesting idea, but I did not find them easier to use than the typical bolts used on other frames. It seemed to take more time and effort to get the fabric to scroll with the ratchets than with the bolts.Since this is made of plastic, the vertical side pieces are flopsy, for lack of a better word. I can grab the vertical side pieces in a wood frame and they will not move. If I grab the vertical side pieces of this frame, they easily push up or down. This makes the corners of your fabric go from being a flat surface to a surface with sides that jut up or jut down at an angle.In general, I found this frame to be difficult and time-consuming to deal with, so it is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Project not tight in the middle","review":"Bought the 24\\" frame, the ratchet design is a great idea and it would great, but the \\"S\\" dowel doesn't hold the fabric in the middle. I can scroll up and down easily, but the fabric is too loose in the middle of the project and after working on it for a couple of hours it becomes so loose that you need to take it apart and set it up again-which is not an easily task since the fabric slips out of the S rods. This might work better for smaller projects, but is a waste of money for large projects. They need to do a \\"snap in place\\" rod with the ratchet design, that would work much better.Eve in NJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully arranged traditional flamenco music","review":"A rare find.

Three paid telephone calls resulted in voice mail, hold forever, and then a rushed, rude response and a refusal to provide the three pins that were omitted from the box.No matter how good the product, one rude person can ruin a company's reputation.

Unfortunately, the socket on the one I received was not welded straight - it was off enough that the T-bar, when attached, was off from level nearly 1 inch over its approx. 3' length. In addition, there were no instructions (assembly is intuitive enough, though), and the very torn cardboard packaging was inadequate for such a heavy item.

She points out where sources conflict and presents various viewpoints on controversial topics without coming across as biased or judgmental. The text reads well and quickly. At times the author's sense of humor comes through and adds some welcome levity. The book could be more in depth, and there is some fluff that could have been cut out. All in all this is a book well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pardon me?","review":"I thought this was an enjoyable book for the most part, but I am bewildered by the blurb on the back comparing the author's scholarly contribution to the work of Copernicus. Wouldn't that suggest that she would at least have an original and clear thesis in there? Instead, we get a mish-mash of gossip, innuendo, and lame puns for over 500 pages. The closest I came to finding a thesis was the idea that bisexuality is extremely common yet has been denied for centuries... which wasn't even original when Freud said it. The book reads like the sort of thing Entertainment Weekly would have published; the thinking is fuzzy and superficial, and the writing is glib and confused. Entertaining for what it is, but, as scholarship, it shows mostly how far the Ivy Leagues have fallen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less substance then portrayed","review":"I bought this book in hopes of understanding my own bisexuality better. I was greatly disappointed. The author spends most of the writing on the lives of famous/infamous bi's.

His arguments are \\"I'm tired of rehashing the old drama\\", \\" and \\"I'm sick of it\\".So I guess the same could be said for his dredging up of decades and centuries old ugly moments in history as this angry man presents America as an oppressive intolerant society.

Each of the sister's lives, not to mention all the other characters, really kept me in suspense. The fued between the Taggerts and the Hollands was interesting. The only reason I can't rate this book higher is because the sex gets to be too much. Everyone is constantly having sex and the graphic nature of it gets to be tedious and boring. Each encounter is the same and I found myself skimming the sex parts to get to the meat of the story. I mean, who cares? I enjoy a good mystery and this story has murder, suspense, romance, the works, but the sex is way overdone. This is the second Lisa Jackson book I have read and it seems as though she tries too hard to throw that in when in reality it is not necessary for a good story.

I doubt it) is that the Trashees rework songs often radically between early incarnations and later ones. The instrumental \\"Outside,\\" for example, which opened the band's 1996 release \\"A Happy Pocket,\\" appears on Zebra of the Family as a song with lyrics, and with a duet by Frank Reader and his sister, Eddi. The album is also endearing for its glimpses inside the band's creative process, banging out song fragments in their (now dearly departed) Shabby Road studios, which served as both studio and home for many of the members at various times. Listening to Frank plink away on the piano over the sound of his doorbell ringing, or to the charmingly trippy original version of \\"I've Seen Everything\\" is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes German fun!","review":"German is a tough language to learn and I'm pleased to say that Alice Muller and Stephan Muller have made a daunting experience fun.

Sure, it's a white cable that resembles the Apple one, but it does feel, \\"cheaper.\\"* On the 8-pin side, the plastic is thicker and wider, leading it to have some fit problems with some cases.* The 8-pin connector isn't a unibody like the Apple one (is it waterproof per the Apple requirements of this connector?). It also is slightly larger, leading it to take slightly more force to insert and remove the connector.Does anyone know if the Boxwave cable is officially allowed to make the Lightning cable?

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes my iPad 4th Gen says the accessory is not compatible and won't charge.This is a faulty/unreliable design. You can tell because the Apple lightning cable is completely snug when inserted, and there is no wiggle room. However, with this Boxwave cable, the lightning connector doesn't not fit completely snug, and there is a little wiggle room.If you examine the connectors closely you can see very subtle differences between the Apple and the Boxwave as far as the contact strips are concerned, as well as the dimensions. Apple designed this with extremely tight tolerances (compared to typical consumer electronics connectors), obviously to make it difficult to knock off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Came apart on the first use.

The first one, I plugged into a USB power adapter for the car, and after having to plug it in and out a few times after getting \\"charging not supported with this accessory\\", it would finally charge my iphone 5. That wasn't the main problem. What bothers me most, is that the cord broke already. The USB broke loose from the fitting. It seemed a bit loose when I got it, but now it is off. I honestly do not remember it happening, or having anything apply pressure to it, just normal use in a car console. I have had other cables that have lasted for years in the same car. The second one, I have the same problem, but this one is only bending in half at the USB connection rather than totally broken off. It's probably only a matter of time before that breaks too.

They work for a while (sometimes and hour or more) then I get a message on the IPhone that the unit is incompatible with the phone. And, the cables seem to DRAW power from the IPhone instead of charging it. If I plug the cable into a USB power adapter WITHOUT plugging the power adapter into a power source, the power adapter's light indicates power is flowing thru it. This seems strange to me. My original apple cable does not do this, and, the 2 other BoxWave cables I received don't do this either nor do they create any errors on my IPhone. So, 2 out of 5 I don't consider good odds.

Teen witches please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one. Do not touch it with a ten foot pole. This is not what The Craft is about, not by a long shot. I was a \\"teen witch\\" not too long ago myself, so don't think this is a review coming from some angry 40 year old who has forgotten how to relate or the problems a young witch faces.

Through study and practicing, one learns to create their own traditions, rites and spellcraft.Their is nothing wrong with Silver Raven Wolf making a living. We all must do that.However, this type of \\"product\\" cheapens the reality and true beauty of Wicca.

If (and hopefully when) they find a seasoned practitioner/believer, they will not use this \\"kit\\" to try to impress the elders.

As I wrote in my review of Silver Broomstick, she writes not to entertain or inform, but for the $ilver she is named after.She already sanitizes Wicca to remove anything that might offend anybody with the slightest sentisitivities. That leaves fluff and light without substance, sugary, and much cuteness without anything beyond it, like a Fluffy Bunny.Then she abandons even the ethics her \\"blockbuster\\" trilogy managed to keep, when she wrote Teen Witch, which is nothing more than a spell book. No theology or ethics, even the sugary and watered down version she gave before. There really is nothing in the book.Now, get it while it's hot, get it here, an actual kit that will make you a witch.

What I found in Silver's kit was extremely disappointing, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who already has Silver's Teen Witch book and understands it fine.

When I have children I MIGHT lead them to this book, but I DOUBT IT, since there are other books related to young kids that will suit better.

Now, why, pray tell, would I buy a c.d. that may or may not play in my vehicle? The last c.d. (Joss Stone) played fine in the Toyota Tundra but it sounded like a scratchy 45 in the Colorado. It popped, skipped, and basically sounded terrible. While I understand (I guess) the rational behind copyright protection I do not understand why anyone would think that the average person would spend money on a c.d. and hope against hope that it would play.

In my bookLeadership Matters...The CEO Survival Manual: WHAT IT TAKES TO REACH THE C-SUITE AND STAY THEREI also address this topic in great detail. That being said, all the charisma in the world won't make you a great leader.

Have a sense of humor. Speak slowly and listen carefully. Author D.A. Benton's presumably deep, probing interviews with 500 executives convinced her that charisma isn't inborn. She believes that everyone can learn to be charismatic. Just follow the six steps that can turn even the most repulsive excuse for a manager into a charming, charismatic executive. So, read this and practice. There's no harm in it, and it might do some good.

And, those points were already covered in the previous books.Benton wrote a couple good books in the past.

Ludicrous speeds, diminished chords, insane vocals, etc. The high point of this album is probably the bunus live tracks. \\"Sugar Coated Sour\\" sounds even more raw and agressive then the studio cut, and the priceless, extended version of \\"Abe the Cop\\" contains an ambient breakdown (the same from \\"Weekend Sex-Change\\") boasting Chris Pennie's mad drum skills.Easily worth the price.

Here are our heroes, survivors against all the odds, in this remote land, true to themselves acting with an unconscious humility. These often bittersweet stories are set in historic contexts that make them utterly convincing. There are many literary allusions, and even characters such as Vainamoinen and Hemingway play a part. The clean rhythm of the language mimics the Finnish language and underlines the basic humanity and individuality of these Copper Country Finns.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent book written by a troubled woman","review":"This is an extremely violent book written by a woman who clearly has issues with spanking from her own childhood. Hitting isn't from God, and if anyone looks deep into their heart, they will understand that intrinsically and without question. Just look at the cover on this book with an angry mother towering over her child. Who wants to create a home environment that looks like that? What an unloving dictatorship of a home, one ruled by the weaponry of angry hands and objects. Parents who raise children with this much violence are always the ones left wondering why their children don't call them later in life. This is why, people.If your spouse hits you all the time, you will either hate them secretly or divorce them. If you hit your kids all the time, they will either hate you secretly or, when they're old enough, divorce you from their lives. Hitting doesn't have different effects on children and adults. Hitting has the same effect on everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"If it were possible to give a 0-star review, I would have. Plowman's suggestions on discipline border on child abuse. Her interpretation of the Bible is theologically flawed, and many scientific studies have proven that the methods she suggests do not work. I believe that parents who want the best for their children will not use her methods. I highly recommend Dr Sears and Crystal Lutton for better suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad to be true","review":"If you approve of facist, and all of the other polytical ideology based on total submission from the government, then this book is for you. If you feel that people aren't allowed to have freedom then this book is for you too. Finally if you are doing some kind of research about how is it possible to exist so many cruelty in the world, then this book is also for you, since it teaches you how to create a feelingless cruel human. Otherwise don't waste your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using Fear to incite good behavior is cowardess","review":"Never spank or hit a child. That will only make them hate you as a parent and totally disrespect you. That's all it did for me. Anytime I was hit I just wanted to piss my parents off even more. Today I see other kids who now hit kids at school because there parents are teaching them to get what you want from a person you have to hit them. Totally inappropriate and barbaric if you ask me. Try a good parenting book, something by Elizabeth Pantley for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interested","review":"Heard lots of great reviews for this book, through the TV & friends but had no idea it was so religious! Too out there to keep me interested in reading at all. I'm sure there are some good points & a lot of what i did read i was doing but without all the religious babble. I will not push religious views onto my child, if they chose to follow that path it will be of their own accord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young hearts, Good Decisions","review":"This book is very insightful and encouraging for all mothers, especially new moms. If your child/children are young, under five, it is the perfect start. Plowman leads you through her own experiences which aid in ideas of reaching your own child's heart. If you can help your child decide what choices demonstate love he/she will be in the right direction in making good choices. And if you start when they're young, hopefully they will choice to do the right things more and more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Will Not Make You A Good Parent","review":"Why does it seem to be impossible for a large segment of the American population to raise their children without mental or physical abuse? Trying to raise you children following words that have been translated and rewritten over and over is absolute nonsense. Beating and belittling your children will not make them love God, or you. You may get an acquiescent child who will do or say anything to spare themselves a beating, but you will not get a normal, happy person. The example of the author making a big issue of her daughter putting lipstick on the dog is an example of making a mountain out of a molehill. To begin with, why wasn't she watching her child? Too busy watching tv or blabbing on the phone? A much simpler solution than keeping the kid awake and making her admit her 'sin' would simply be to pay more attention to her and put the damned lipstick out of reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Realistic, Biblical Approach to Discipline","review":"I highly recommend \\"Don't Make Me Count to Three!\\" Ginger Plowman offers practical, godly advice to parents who are concerned about shaping not just the behavior of their children, but their hearts as well.

(I.e. Max Lucado: sentimental, anecdote-heavy, glad-to-know-ya, Scripture taken out of context, cheap, sloppy). If you do not share my distaste or opinion, you might find this book helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book written on discipline.","review":"After raising two children, I have to admit that discipline has never really been my hallmark. It was never really clear as to when you should spank, when you should talk,and I could only guess on when to reprieve much less understand what it means. Now, after all of these years G Plowman has been granted a gentleman in this knowledge. She is funny, lighthearted, and factual concerning her Biblical stance, and brings a very clear view in terms of knowing what to do concerning correct Biblical discipline. I am so glad that I have read this book. I have already referred it to my children who now have kids and will use it as a reliable reference for college."},{"rating":"2","title":"happens everytime","review":"Usually when you have a book written from a true biblical perspective and it gets an average 3.5 stars, you will find that they are all \\"fives\\" and \\"ones\\". Many of the comments in the one star category are from those who did not read the book, but hate Christianity in general and there comments are clearly their commentary on their anti-christian bias vs their review.I found the book to be very valuable, the teaching was biblical, well founded, loving, and effective. It is very important that both parents are on board and read the book. The rapidity with which it works when consistent, loving discipline is used is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best parenting books I've read","review":"While no one book (aside from the Bible) can be \\"THE manual\\" for raising children, this one definitely should be on the list of must reads. The reason for this is that it's loaded with scripture and practical application of that scripture. Ginger Plowman has done what I've wished I had the knowledge and time to do -- she's given me a practical way to use scripture in the day to day discipline of my kids without it being dry and \\"preachy\\". This book is easy to read and filled with real-life examples from the author to illustrate her points and I look forward to referring back to it as necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!! Not another bad parenting book!","review":"All I can say is \\"Don't waste your money on this book!\\" It is filled with examples of how to \\"whip\\" your child and why you should. Clearly Mrs. Plowman thinks \\"whipping\\" is the answer to all your parenting problems, and she even believes some adults should get a \\"good old-fashioned whippin\\". The tone of this book is very adversarial. It doesn't even sound like she likes children, but sees them as an intrusion in her life. Very sad! Do yourself and your precious children a favor and skip this book. Read something that encourages your to love your children and be a better mother, not a prison warden!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"I was disappointed to find that this book was nothing more than yet another \\"Christian\\" book filled with instructions on how to spank your children, including physical punishment of babies and toddlers. This is truly the very lowest form of parenting, and it's a shame that there aren't more Jesus-centric books being written in this genre about thoughtful, grace-filled, patient teaching and actual parenting.We will certainly not be implementing this book in our own family.Show me a book that involves acquiring actual parenting skills (rather than how to train your child like a bear), and I will be overjoyed to purchase it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided, Misinformed, Non-Christian","review":"As a newish mom (my child is 28 months old), I receive lots of books from well-intentioned friends & family members who wish to add their two cents. I was horrified by the suggestions in this book. Any true Christian knows that the new convenant (ie: Christ) -erases- the violent suggestions from the Old Testament, and suggests more enlightened ones. Hitting a tiny child- as young as 10 months! that's still a baby!- is not something Christ would have done. It would seem a no-brainer.I have thrown this in the recycle bin where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandparents say: Don't buy or sell this awful book!","review":"As grandparents and animal defenders, we are appalled that Amazon would sell a book that advocates hitting infants, and puppies.

Don't make me count to 3 before I spank you. She could call the police and get me out of her house so why do we think that we have the right to treat a small child that is just beginning to understand the word in that way?I strongly recommend that the author looks at her past to see the abuse that was committed to her.I am not going to buy any books from amazon until they understand that they should not sell these books and created adults that are depress and in jail.

Decades of research shows that spanking children is detrimental to their mental, emotional, and physical health. It is also damaging to the parent-child relationship. Children need and deserve parents who respect them and guide them, not parents who hurt them. Children are not born evil nor do they need to be \\"trained\\" to be \\"good\\". Jesus himself proclaimed that children should be treated with kindness. How can hitting an innocent child be kind?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"Ginger Plowman admits that she is no parenting expert. That is an understatement. She might begin by taking a basic child development course. She recommends hitting even infants for behavior that is developmentally appropriate. It is a parent's job to keep their children and their children's environment safe. Instead of encouraging parents to re-direct and provide alternatives to children she recommends hitting them the way she recommends hitting dogs. She uses her religion to rationalize the abuse she doles out to her children. She also comes across as a woman who is very unhappy being a parent and does not even like children. She seems to find little joy in parenting.

I have used it and it has given me guidance in how to teach my children how to obey God's word. There are actually websites that misquote this book and give this link to write a review. That is just not right. I have spanked less and instructed more upon the explanation of God's instruction to us as parents from this book.

The book gives instructions for parents on how to spank their children with an instrument and encourages parents to inflict pain on their children as young as little babies. The author believes that every child is born sinful and that sin is bound in the heart of every child. The book tries to convince parents that spanking is an act of love and that spanking hurts the parent more than the child. Spanking teaches that force is an appropriate behavior and it creates fear in the child. Inflicting pain on children is a heartless act and this is a heartless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ginger Plowman doesnt even like children, why else would she promote beating them?","review":"Ginger Plowman at her \\"best\\" - beating children.

Good information with biblical text references and spaces to write down your thoughts. The author talks about giving God thanks in your everday life for all things, to be prepared by meditation, praying, studying the word, and journaling. She place an emphasis on physical exercises for meditation and breathing techniques. There are key words to assist the reader in journaling and blank spaces how to start your own journal.

Once again Michelle Whitedove delivers, as only she can another riveting fascinating page turner. With a style uniquely her own she is able to make the reader feel as if they had actually accompanied her to the various locations and experienced the different encounters and adventures. She unabashedly and respectfully delves into and educates her readers on ghosts, werewolves, vampires and witches. Her observations and witty critique of European highways, foods and outlandish or ridiculous haunted tours only accent and add a comical and enjoyable element to a normally frightening and at times mundane subject. A one sitting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Stalker Two","review":"I give it four starts because there were no pictures in the book.

The zippers would stick and the velco dividers on the interior did not hold very well. My 23 year old Lowepro bag is better made. However, the hip belt is well designed and hugs your body very well. In concept the bag is good but the assembly and sub-standard materials fail to make this product useful. I would stick with M-Rock, Lowepro or Tamrac, those bags are designed and used by the professionals. I believe Tamrac is still made in the USA. It would be a shame to miss a shot because your camera bag zipper got stuck. I can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice camera bag","review":"I chose this camera bag based on its measurements and shape, planning to use it with the shoulder strap rather than the hip belt. However, I discovered that folding the hip belt into the space provided made it too cumbersome, and I had to just cut it off. Other than that I like it very much. The zippered compartments work well for extra memory cards, batteries, lens cloth, etc. It is well padded, and the movable dividers allowed me to create a space to fit my Canon PowerShot SX20IS exactly. I also like the fact that it has a handle to use in place of the removable shoulder strap, if I wish to do so. I had to go to the Mountainsmith site to find the internal measurements to insure this bag would fulfill my needs. (Earlier, I had ordered another smaller model and incorrectly estimated the internal measurement based on the external measurements.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and engaging; great scholarship","review":"I used this book while writing my undergraduate art history thesis. It proved to be invaluable--it's factual but very engaging, and I was quite inspired by some of Golding's arguments. There were many details mentioned in this book that I didn't find in other, more \\"definitive\\" books on these artists (such as the catalogues of major retrospectives). Though I used it for research, this collection of lectures-cum-essays would also make for good recreational reading for someone at least somewhat familiar with the history of abstraction in art, or interested in a close study. This is not, however, the best \\"picture book\\" or light introduction for a person more interested in enjoying the paintings than reading academic criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fine Lectures","review":"The main reason I wanted to take a trip to Russia was to see the great examples of abstract art there. The very beautiful pieces at the Tretyakov made much more sense to me because of these wonderful lectures which I actually heard live at the National Gallery years ago. If only most writing on art were like this, and that pertains particularly to art of recent times. Great criticism raises the bar for everything in your mind and with your senses.John Golding's book has made great art as one sees at the Tretyakov even finer in my eyes. But even the more quirky pieces, such as those in the fabulous show Painting Revolution which we saw at the Phoenix museum had a deeper resonance for me than they would have had if I did not have the insights in this book in my memory. Dr. Golding is also a painter whose works are at the Yale Center for British Art."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must -have if you enjoy the artist","review":"I love this artist, Marjolein Bastin.

This dvd consists of about 45 minutes of fluid, mobility exercises which are done standing. Then you move to the floor for another 45 minutes (approx.) of yoga-type stretches. None of the moves are particularly difficult, but Coach Sonnon explains modifications so that you can vary the intensity. His instruction is very clear and his manner is super encouraging and motivating.I have many yoga dvd's and usually start getting antsy after an hour. But this nearly 90 minute program flew right by. The first time I completed the program I felt an immediate improvement and release of some of the built up tension in my muscles. A few hours later I felt even better!

Although claimed to be a textbook, it is best as a source of references and a compendium of advances in physical chemistry of surfaces. Certain chapters (e.g., surface tension) are good enough for use in classroom, but others are very superficial and very disappointing. It is clear that neither the senior author nor the new one is an expert in most of the topics covered in the book. It appears that they have simply collected references from the literature (quite indiscriminately in many cases) and have attempted to summarize the results. It is still a good book to have, especially since no one else has bothered to write a fairly comprehensive book on the topic.

I certainly agree that women have a special, unique role that God wishes for them to fulfill, but I'm afraid that Silvoso's use of Scripture is quite irresponsible and relies on superficial research. The problem here is that he has good things to say, so people like the book, but he does so at the expense of proper treatment of the Bible that most will not pick up on, which is evident in the other reviews it has received. I don't think his positive points are worth the very poor use of the Bible that is consistently and completely out of context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item description","review":"Scotch-Brite Sponge RefillThe Scotch-Brite Sponge Refill listed on this page does NOT appear to be the \\"SPONGE\\" refill (3M#481-7-RSC)sold for this product, but rather the \\"SCRUBBER\\" refill (3M#482-7-RSC).

The voice talent -- Paul Giamatti, David Hyde Pierce, Molly Shannon, and Patton Oswalt -- is a dream team, sufficiantly spooky, grandiose and stupid all at the same time. The DVD really captures the goofy horror-movie humor, the Mike Mignola look, and especially the \\"horrible old women and a monkey\\" of the original.

I held off on buying this CD for years because I thought that Universal was going to issue either a Kaempfert DEFINITIVE COLLECTION CD or a 2-disc GOLD set. They didn't, so this Taragon collection will do just fine - it has most of his big hits, and the sound quality is great. The fact that Bert was The Beatles' first producer (on the Tony Sheridan sessions in Hamburg) is a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bert Kaempfert","review":"This is the best of his hits and I love the album.

The golden color tones all over, the man sitting,hunched over, deep in thought, cigarette burning,wearing shirt, tie and slacks, somewhere in some recording studio. The name too finding equally as striking-Bert Kaempfert-love that name.Finally, one day, I say to myself, I am going to own this. But I compromised and rather than owning the glorious full LP version, I bought the cassette tape of this. Very inexpensive-a couple bucks, but sealed and new.The music is classified 'easy listening' with emphasis on lovely background singing, some Bond-ian twang guitar but overall, pretty melodies played by Bert's favorite solo intrument, the trumpet. Reminiscent on some songs to Herb Alpert and the Tijuanna Brass material to give you a comparison. Very relaxing music, soothing and with a number of upbeat and whimsical numbers"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's bert at his best","review":"now i have this cd and i enjoy it but they could have put some more songs on here but still a good cd. if you want more hits of bert with some good other stuff thrown in get his singles+ cd set you will not go wrong and as always enjoy the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sounds","review":"If you like soft sounds from the 60's and 70's, this is THE album for you.

The five pads are hard to read after dipping: individual pad colors often are uneven, that is, will show two colors at once, not uniform enough to identify a specific color/result. Results are not consistent, such if doing a second test after the first. Also, pads don't seem to be very absorbent - colored water bleeds from one pad into adjacent pads, I'm sure affecting results."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless gimmick","review":"Colors bleed and to judge the quality of water by shade of a color is ridiculous. For some reason I thought there would be better logic to this test kit like black if something is wrong and white if it's good. In this test, you go by shades of the same color. There is no way this would ever be possible due to color bleeding. How in the world can it be accurate to compare light orange as bad to light medium orange as good? This is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but unreliable","review":"I've used pool test strips from the local pool store before, and they're never as accurate as a proper test kit, but are more convenient for quick spot-checks of pool chemistry. So, I feel like my expectations were reasonable.These strips shipped quickly, for a good price, but are TERRIBLE. The color is very inconsistent between strips, the dye runs off the strip before the color stabilizes, and it takes 2-3 strips to get a fair idea of where the pool chemistry lies. Even the pool-store strips were 10x better than these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the HTH brand","review":"I usually purchase the HTH brand at Walmart for about the same price, but I got a hold of a bad batch or something. The Chlorine was way off; I was dumping a ton in the pool and it wouldn't register the next day. My pool store was out of test strips (never thought that could happen), so I needed something fast and I got this with free shipping (PRIME). I couldn't be happier. I definitely buy this brand again - very vibrant colors and easy to read. Good size test strip, easy to hold. Very happy with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"These weren't very good now, were they?","review":"Yes, these are not very good. While the Alkalinity, pH and Calcium Hardness seemed to work ok, the colors are too difficult to match and a given color can include a large range of readings, and give you no way to figure out what amount of chemical(s) would correctly balance your pool water.The Free and Total Chlorine squares are way off - told me I had absolutely none of either, whereas my regular pool test kit (as well as the local pool store) showed my chlorine levels to be in the correct range.Better to go with a standard liquid drops test kit, with demand reagents, so you know how much of whatever chemical to put in.I cannot recommend these for pool maintenance."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"These test strips do the job.

Add to that, excellent support from Robert (Father Knows Best) Young, Adolphe Menjou, Reginald Gardiner, and Virginia Grey. But the real/reel reason to watch is that sweet, lovely, glamorous, beautiful star with the million dollar legs---Betty Grable! Much more talented than the critics gave her credit for, Grable can charm the pants off the Police Gazette (where Young and Menjou hang their hats). And when she cuddles up in a bubble bath and sings that scrumptious song, your heart is going to melt. (By the way, the photo is from Wabash Avenue (1950), another Grable musical that needs to be released on DVD!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Lifelong Fan","review":"I can't wait for this to come out on DVD.

The timeless characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are completely unrecognizeable and have been twisted to fit the modern idea of a mystery novel. The book also makes a vain attempt to fit these fictional characters into the real-world events of pre-WWI in a manner that leaves much to be desired. Do not waste your time with this book. I only gave this book one star because it won't allow you to assign zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Well, what can I say that hasn't already been written here. This is truly the bottom of the pastiche barrel.However, to say that Vanneman's effort ranks second only to Mitch Cullin's Slight Trick of the Mind as the WORST pastiche is an utterly laughable suggestion. Most Sherlockians, myself included, place Cullin's book rather high up on the list of excellent non-Doyle Sherlock novels (on par with A Study in Terror and Nick Meyer's Seven Percent Solution), especially in terms of the fine writing and Cullin's obvious knowledge and appreciation of the Canon.Vanneman, on the other hand, has displayed neither the writing skill nor scholarly detail required to make his second Holmes effort viable. Less informed readers, however, might find something to enjoy here, although I couldn't say what that would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed many of the Sherlock Holmes spinoff novels, but I did not like this one. Quite frankly, I did not recognize the Dr. Watson whom I enjoyed in the Doyle stories. Here he is a rake who indulges in sexual romps with a countess. If that were in character for him, that would be fine, but he isn't really that way in Doyle. Sherlock Holmes is clever, but doesn't quite seem the cool reasoner whom we know in other incarnations, even by other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book you can avoid reading","review":"This was one of the poorest pastiches it has been my misfortune to read. The story is disjointed and spread chronologically over too great a time span.

Holmes makes no brilliant deductions, he mostly complains and breaks just as many laws as those he complains about. Watson is written as a combination atheist, sex maniac, socialist and overall boor. Mrs. Asquith can't seem to decide whether to call her husband Henry or Herbert. The book manages to insult Winston Churchill, Cecil Rhodes, Protestants, Catholics, and anyone else that the \\"author\\" dislikes.

Thank god I checked it out of the library, and didn't actually spend any money on this. For a while, I could deal with excessively long descriptions of Watson's philandering, excruciatingly detailed accounts of the food, long and hard-to-follow descriptions of all the politics surrounding the mystery, and the Mary Sue-esque exploits of Watson's adopted actress daughter Jenny. For a while, I assumed there would have to be a big payoff for all this build-up. But when I got about halfway through, I realized that the story was just too boring for me to care. So I'm sorry, Vanemann! I tried my best, but your book tried my patience too much.

Final note: noticeably missing on this CD (in my opinion) is \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\", a great pop rock song from this same time frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD despite missing some key tracks","review":"I know that this CD is missing \\"Portrait of My Love\\" and few other good tracks but to rate this a 1 or 2 seems over the top. It's a good cd that has some of his early hits like Footsteps and Pretty Blue Eyes.

The stinkeroos on this CD are \\"Pretty Brown Eyes\\" \\"Loving Is A Way Of Living\\" and others in the just plain bad supersquare Andy Williams/Johnny Mathis muzak style. If you compare those tacky hits with the standards like \\"I Hear A Rhapsody\\" \\"There'll be Some Changes Made\\" \\"Somebody Else Is Taking My Place\\" you will hear a hip singer more influenced by Frank Sinatra. This CD has it's good and bad moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"So insightful","review":"I was introduced to dr Wayne dyer through a video of his called \\"The Shift\\". He is so insightful. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for more direction and purpose to their life.

I do the meditations every day, and they make such a tangible difference in my life. I had lesions on my legs that wouldn't heal for months. I'd meditate every morning on healing them, and at night they would be noticably improved until they were healed. I have used the meditation to heal myself emotionally of extreme sadness and other strong emotions, I have used it to bring more financial opportunities into my life. After meditating, everything seems right, my problems seem to resolve themselves. This book is pleasing to read, as is all Dr. Dyer's material. I think of him as the father I never had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"The Power of Intention is possibly Dr. Wayne Dyer's best work to date, in my opinion. I saw his pres,entation on PBS, and ended up purchasing his \\"whole enchilada\\" package of the power of intention. It is my most dog-earred and well-loved book, and the CD set is played during my commute repeatedly. Dr. Dyer speaks from the heart, and just may be the most authentic living human being.

What the rest of us want to know is what we can DO to live our lives more powerfully and authentically. \\"The Power of Intention\\" does just this, focussing on a concept that has had little attention so far from other authors. I am not into Castenada, or the Kaballah, but would suggest that the source is Universal. Nice to have it put in my kind of language.For the previous reviewer, it is well to remember what a sage once said: that what we see as fault in others is actually a reflection of ourselves.

From just reading some of the reviews you can already get a good idea how the book portrayed itself. You get the feeling Dyer just wanted to add a few more digits to his bank account. Based on his popularity, why not?If your going to read about these laws, then read of Emerson and his comrades on Transcendentalism. THose fellas put it in clear concise form without gummi bears to give the book flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out with God and in with the force.","review":"\\"Caveat-Emptor\\" or Buyer Beware!! There is both good and bad in Dr. Dyer's book. First, if you have a solid faith in Judeo-Christianity then you'll find this book a wealth of information that explains the laws God gave us to be healthy and prosperous. By knowing God is a supreme being and not a force, like electricity, then one can benefit immensely by applying these timeless concepts back into the framework that God is supreme and we are His children. Be cautious and know that Dr. Dyer stripped these concepts from their source. One must understand the context that these universal principles were meant for. Jesus said it best when he explained that we are the branches, Jesus is the vine, and God is the vine dresser. In this context we can become one with God, but not be god. When we are connected to God he will feed us. In this framework we are to do God's will and not ours. Otherwise, this book is just another positive thinking book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pentecostalism run amuck","review":"If you are really into the church scene and believe you'll be blessed once you become 'good enough' then this is the book for you. If you feel and have been taught that you are not blessed because you just didn't 'do it right' then this is the book for you.The book is beautiful as far as the cover and pictures and layout. But, it's so churchy it really turned me off. After reading many books on \\"your imagination creates reality\\" I have to say this is, by far, the worst one I have ever read. To me it was not inspiring at all, it was just constant drivel about doing the right thing and you'll have all your dreams come true. It took me several days to get half way through the book and I doubt I can force myself to read the rest of it.This book is just old church crap formed into new words. It's also very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother to glance at this piece of crap!","review":"When I read the title of this book, \\"The Power of Intention\\", I assumed a psychological self-help book with some anecdotes and tips.After reading a few sentences, I was confused because I thought I was reading a book about Christianity.The author has this vague intention to preach how mighty the god is and he is the one who can make us happy and peaceful.Author's writing is so contrived, artificially shallow and wannabe-abstract; I couldn't even summarize what the author wrote about.Give me a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes there is a source","review":"I've seen Dr Dyer's PBS Special. He is a very eloquent speaker. I do believe he is right on the money with most of what he says.

I also bought a book for which he had written a snippet review for ('end of the universe...'? by Renard) where he predicted it would be one of most spiritually revolutionary books...blah blah blah. But it's not true - in the least - and I would be surprised if Dyer even read the book. I feel instead he participates in that ugly Hay House nepotistic-marketing where they force their authors to promote all Hay House authors regardless of quality. There's so much good work out there that is engaging and not so lecturing - get those!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I found it metaphysical.","review":"Based on the good reviews I read about this book, I thought that it worth to be read, however I has a difficult time to understand what he means, it has nothing to do with other self-improvement books like the seven habits by Stephen Covey, Life Strategies by Phillip C.

Like this book, his criticism is hard to pin down. Perhaps overcoming obstacles is something Dr. Dyer doesn't like to discuss in concrete terms.In the Sonoma press, Dr. Dyer talked about his addictions, including cocaine which affected his current marriage (his first ended in divorce. His challenges with alchohol and drugs and specifically how he coped would have given this book some grounding.This book has abstract Emersonion philosophy. Frankly, Dr. Phil is more practical and fun to read.Overall, Dyer's message is a positive one. If he could only write directly to the point, this book would have merited more stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important if True","review":"For me, the book does not read nearly as well as the associated promotional literature.

Words are either not defined or they are use differently than ordinary English usage. Even the word \\"intention\\" is used somewhat strangely. What exactly is this \\"source\\"? The second flaw has to do with knowing. Mr. Dyer makes many bold assertions but that's all they are - assertions. What is the basis? How does he know what he knows? Quoting from a few spiritual thinkers is not a basis for knowing. Therefore, these ideas are without a epistemological base. It appears that Mr. Dyer has sensed the presence of God and that there is eternity written in his heart. But his knowledge of God is vague and incomplete and thus appears in strange ways. It reminds me of Paul on Mars Hill commenting on the statue of the unknown God. For those who wish to read more along this line thinking I would recommend the book \\"Eternity in Their Hearts\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"positive thinking","review":"I found this book very up lifting.

So do be alert to possible unnecessary constraints. Wayne Dyer is certainly a pinnacle of knowledge, that he convincinly passes on to the needy, and in a way that will help the needful of progressive living.

The second book, LUCKY YOU, takes that idea and applies it to streaks of good and bad luck, showing how our intuition, our dreams, and paying attention to synchronicities can lead us to good fortune.

I bought the \\"whole enchalada\\" via PBS fund raiser. Thank God for tax deductitions. What turned me off the most was his treatment of the poor. It is as if because they haven't \\"connected to\\" the \\"source\\" they were responsible for their own situation. I wish he would go to the Sudan, or maybe the 150,000 lives lost in Asia is because they couldn't manifest themselves from disaster. This book is so bad.It has no scientific or spiritual basis to it. It is Dyer's way of manifesting his own wealth. Do not waste your time or $."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Intention","review":"This book sucks. It is written by a man that has the ego of a monster. This in no way reflects on Amazon, because they have done everythin perfect. The book just sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-Off Artist","review":"Wayne Dyer can't seem to stop himself from ripping off other authors. He has stolen all the information in this book from Jerry and Esther Hicks, who have been writing eloquently about this very subject for 20 years. If you'd like to skip a very egocentric middleman, I suggest you read \\"Ask And It Is Given.\\" That one book alone will give you more useful insight than all of Mr. Dyer's books combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power of Intention","review":"This book has made a huge impact on my life. I view my life and its purpose from a completely new perspective. Amazingly his basic premise was echoed at a retreat that my wife attended recently. We are Catholic and it just all fits- the retreat focused on teaching of Fr Thomas Merton. Enjoy the book- I could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"No New Age","review":"I purchased the book because of a recommendation from a friend. I had never read any books by Dyer and was only remotely familiar with him through channel surfing. So I did feel that I was fairly unbiased before reading the book. Came away with the sense that the author is very, very, new age which puts many of his beliefs at odds with my own. I do not believe that I have to agree with everything an author writes, but from my perspective the book offered little help other than reinforcing my own beliefs. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connecting with Dyer","review":"Wayne Dyer's ability to connect with his audience-whether they are at one of his seminars or sitting at home reading his books-is fascinating.

It can be anything from money, relationships, to Life. The thing is that for many that focus is automatic and it happens without you consciously knowing it. Everything you feel and see in front of you came from you even if you didn't consciously know that was your focus. What to do?What this book guides you to do; to consciously and deliberately intend, so that you will create / attract what you desire and require in your Life.Al Diaz / Authorwww.theonlyoption.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy","review":"The author spends a lot of time talking about himself. The philosophy in it has deep flaws that can border on victim blaming. Positive thoughts go a long way, but much of the philosophy in the book is not well thought out, and omits important qualifiers. For example, tell a child in an abusive home that her destiny is mainly determined by her spiritual thoughts? She brought this on herself? I think not.The book has not really thought through many sides of the issues it presents. Victims, those with disabilities, those who are dependent on others -and how all of that would be related to karma and intention, is all omitted. In terms of being a term paper in philosophy it is very poor. Other thinkers and texts are mentioned rarely and fleetingly. Most of it is invented, de novo, from a comfortable position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Someone with a Mental Illness","review":"Anyone struggling with mental illness should pass this one up. Throughout the book Dr. Dryer blames the depressive and subtly hints that it is their own fault they were born with bad brain chemistry. He also subtly eschews medication; pretty surprising for someone who was supposedly a therapist. Anyone struggling with any kind of mental illness should stay well clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"More reality would improve this.","review":"I enjoy Dyer's books, and this book is a good read. I only gave it one star, because while Dyer could use his own real life example, he doesn't.Rather than go on about how if you use these principles you life will be wonderful, he could have pointed out that even his own life has had challenges, but instead he misleads. He could have talked about his multi-year struggle with his cocaine addiction, but instead gives the impression that his life has been a steadily improving course. In that way it is a disservice to this book and to its readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"This is an excellent way to reach the lost. Jesus said he came to seek those that are lost. If you are in good health, then you don't need a physician. But if you are sick, then you do. Jesus came to heal the sick (especially the sin sick soul). Using profanity, sexual language is the way of the lost. You have to be wise to win them over. Beating them with scriptures will not conquer. There's a huge difference between writing profanity and speaking it. I believe the author of Beyond Jordan owes Ms. Pierce an apology. A Saint understands how to reach the lost and how to comfort other Saints, but a Christian has yet to learn and never coming into the knowledge of the truth.

The Abraham Lincoln we were taught to revere is actually the percursor of Slobodon Milosovic and other like-minded dictators who usurped their authority. Loren shows with unerring proof how Lincoln rode roughshod over the Constitution and the sovereignty of the states and the people. He, acting on behalf of the Federal government, became the sovereign and the people and the states reverted to the status of subjects as in the era of King George before the American Revolution. As Rome under Julius Caesar became ever after a dictatorship so did the United States but in a more subtle way. When the Civil War ended the sovereignty of the states as agreed upon in Philadelpia, the Federal government became the American Sovereign thus ending the short span of true democracy in America.

I read the 1-star reviews of the Snugride online, and other people had run into the same issue! I spoke with Graco Customer Service, and they said that this was \\"normal\\" and provides \\"some absorption in the event of a crash.\\" Sure -- the back seat of the car might absorb the infant's face when he/she gets flipped into it.

However, I discovered one gotcha: in placing the infant carrier in the base- as opposed to just securing the carrier in the car without the base, the carrier sits higher and further forward when it's in the base. This was problematic for us cause those few extra inches now force the driveer (or, now passenger) move their seat forward. This obviously only applies to smaller cars. Without the base the carrier just fit in and no moving was necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not secure without latch system","review":"We have an older Lexus without the latch system.

Scary!This is our second child and we have put in car seats many a time, and even had our first one checked my a specialist. How in the world do you people get this base in securely (up to regulation) without using the latch system? I'm not convinced it's possible.I don't think there is another base you can use with the Snugride 22 other than this one: http://www.amazon.com/Graco-SnugRide-Infant-Metallic-Silver/dp/B004B7KJR2 anyone know otherwise?"},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd one bought","review":"A little pricey but works great.

I did research and found that this product is the exact model for my current car seat. The base came in the original Graco packaging. This made me alittle more comfortable using it. This makes life so much easier being able to just move the carrier and not having to install and reinstall the base.

This book looked interesting because of how it breaks down specific situations (talking to people at work, talking to people on the street, etc.). The information in each of those subsections are largely pretty repetitive and not as specific as I thought they would be. The entire tone of the book is not encouraging either, which is tough for someone who is shy. The advice in the section on when to tell a joke is basically \\"don't tell jokes unless you are already funny because it will get awkward or you will offend someone.\\" This may even be solid advice, but it should be phrased more positively for someone who purports to be a communications expert. I'd go with another book on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be a boring individual","review":"The first 1 or 2 chapters of this book do indeed give you some good pointers on how to build rapport and to look for common threads, all very important parts of a conversation. However the latter chapters really get dull and tend to advice the reader to shy away from responding openly to real life situations such as when a friend approaches you with a problem, the author advices that you shy away from really putting yourself in their shoes and offering help, rather it gives you advice on how to decline offering help to someone in need. It also advices the reader not to tell jokes in any situation or to shy away from tellign detailed stories. Whilst for a social lepper this maybe sound advice most of us want to live in a world full of excitement and have conversations that are fullfilling for everyone, not just being a bore and trying to \\"fit in\\".

Men don't say, \\"You sure could have done a better job on that eyeliner.\\" The say, \\"Hay, racoon, if you screwed that up any worse someone might be tempted to call animal control on you!\\" Another good example would start with, \\"Are you an idiot?\\" Ofcourse you can't talk to women this way as it would be rude and hurt their delicate feelings.

The book might have been more worthwhile if the author had at least been successful in demonstrating more clearly his point, which was to show the relationship between alchemy and painting, but the connection here between the two is not very convincing.

Too general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really rotten advice","review":"This book contains a lot of bad advice for any mother intending to breastfeed. Their suggested schedule for weaning would almost guarantee engorgement and possibly mastitis, completely unnecessarily. They assume weaning will occur quite early, and the baby will be weaned to a bottle with formula. They mislead parents into expecting their four month old baby to sleep 10 or 12 hours in a row without feeding at night (unlikely regardless of feeding, really unlikely if breastfeeding). They urge unnecessary supplementation with solid foods or iron for breastfed babies at four months. While there is some merit in this book (it's nice to know what a pediatrician would tell you without having to make the phone call or office visit), it's quite limited. Hopefully further revisions will address these and many other problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing. I would have expected better","review":"It's unfortunate that the American Academy of Pediatrics would use this book to push their political agendas about gun control.

Until handguns are banned, we recommend that handgun ammunition be regulateed, that restrictions be placed on handgun ownership, and the the number of privately owned handguns be reduced.\\"People who are buying this book are looking for baby advice, not political garbage.

From a friend, I received the book \\"What to expect the first year\\". Both of these books have been useful. At this point, the latter book has been more useful because there is more focus on each month during the first year. Nonetheless, I read both of them (over and over) and I am happy that I have them both. The reason I give this book just 4 stars is because, to some extent, I occasionally find the language to be a little too \\"knowing\\" and directive. The other book (What to expect...) seems to be a little more broad in scope in terms of considering different kinds of parents and parenting styles. Being that I live in Japan, I'm finding many things to challenge some assumptions in the books...so I especially notice America-centric thought in this book (Caring for your baby and child). On the whole, however, it has been a helpful interesting book and I am happy I have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caring for your baby and young child revised edition","review":"The Book mentioned above is one of the most informative book for parents.

For me, the 8th and 9th symphonies soundbetter with full orchestras, such as Bohm/Vienna Philharmonic and plenty of others.I wasn't there obviously, but suspect that the Immerseel recordings probably capture the composer's original thoughts best.

It gives a step-by-step process for doing this. Instructional design requires discipline and this book hands it to you on a silver platter.

As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money.At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands, but the response of the keys isn't instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn't recognise that she's making it work.

I will be selling mine and getting the one where you just plug it into the headset jack, since the sound quality is the same. I advise you, don't get it, it's not worth it. iPods have good battery life and if you are afraid your battery will run out get a $20 car charger which you will probably use for 30 minutes max to charge your battry full again.

I expected her to die, of course. That was obvious from the title. I did not expect to find that she was an atheist, as was many of her friends and spouse. Death is difficult, but as a Christian, I know that when our objectives on Earth are fullfilled then our time here is done. I would be totally devastated if I didn't have the hope, the peace of knowing I have a heavenly Father who loves me, hears my prayers, and never allows me to walk thru this journey alone. How sad to find she most likely left Earth without knowing this peace. For me, this book had many positives but sadly, dieing an atheist was not what I had anticipated.

Burke's sense of right and wrong remains unerring and Vachss ability to make the reader turn that page is unscathed. Unfortunately, the book loses steam at the end - an all too often problem with Vachss' work. Even so, worth it if you enjoy his other Burke works"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal look at an ugly world","review":"It's been years since I read any of Vachss' Burke series and picked up STREGA with a memory of a brutal and unblinking look at a rather nasty side of the criminal world, child pornography. There is a definite sense of pure unadulterated evil when Vachss brings Burke into battle against this most heinous of criminal. Burke, a tarnished white knight, becomes an avenger when confronted with the vile corruption of a young boy and takes at first reluctant, then enraged aim at those who prey on the innocent. Having in place the conceits of many crime series, some eclectic partners and a hard-boiled persona camouflaging a soft heart, Vachss separates Burke from the others with a real feel for the rage of the character and the violence of his world. Burke's world is very dark and I think some distance has added to my appreciation for what Vachss accomplishes here, but I wonder how many times you'll want to follow Burke down this particularly dark alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vachss takes us into a world that Hammett, Chandler, and Spillane never dreamed of.","review":"This is the 2nd time I've read STREGA, first time being several years ago.I don't believe I would want to live in his world, but I do have a morbid fascination with it. I don't think I would want to have characters like Mama, Michelle, Mole, Prof, and Burke himself in my world. Heck, I wouldn't even want a dog like Pansy. Yet, I love visiting them in these novels.Nor do I believe I would honestly want to know Flood or Strega, much less have intimate encounters with them, and yet I find myself dreaming of them.The plot has Burke again on the track of a child pornographer and even on the 2nd living, I lived and breathed for the final encounter. This is a world of sleaze, but it also is a deep insight into the world we are a part of.Read this, do read this, but only if you are prepared to stomach a few hours in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense Thriller","review":"I have just learned of this author and love his books.

I bought this CD to use as music to sleep by as indicated by the title. The CDs live up to their title. The music is soft and mellow. A couple of the selections have a couple parts that are somewhat upbeat for going to sleep by, but on the whole you can use this as late night sleep music. It is also a very easy listening set for just laying back & absorbing the music., or \\"mellowing out\\" as we used to say back in the sixties. If you like smooth jazz, you'll like this CD set. Mostly trumpet & sax solos. Check out the \\"listen to samples\\" on the product page before you buy to be sure.

Her essay on Palestine's children is one such example. The title of her book refers to the attacks on September 11th, and she ranges over subjects such as poverty, racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, rape and far too many of the horrors of the world. Articulate and passionate, Jordan brings a keen creative mind to her subjects and strangely enough, considering her subjects, a feeling of optimism.Reading Jordan does give one some hope for the future and the fervent wish for more of her ilk.

While the song selection is useful, the recordings are pretty bad.

The music is the best of the best - this stuff really influenced the jazz of today - Ray Eberle's smooth vocals, the vocal jazz quartet - and lets not forget Tex Benneke (he's that hip cat playing the tenor sax and doing those cool vocals - God, my kingdom for a zoot suit!). The humor is priceless, and Glenn Miller actually could act. The final number, \\"Kalamazoo\\", makes ya wanna get out of your chair and find someone to jitterbug with. Get this movie and get out your saddle shoes :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FORTIES FUNFEST.","review":"A small town girl marries the trumpet player of a travelling swing band. A very popular film in its day, this movie is infinitely more enjoyable than the title - which sounds like a statistical classification - would suggest. The cast is fun if eclectic: George Montgomery, Carole Landis, Cesar Romero, Ann Rutherford, Lynn Bari, Jackie Gleason & the Nicholas Brothers! Numbers include the zany I'VE GOT A GAL IN KALAMAZOO. ORCHESTRA WIVES was the second and final film made by the famed band leader Glenn Miller who disbanded his civilian band in September of 1942 and entered the military. Miller's Army Air Force band was astonishingly modern for its day with a much more sophisticated sound with lush arrangements accompanied by strings and superlative solos from the best sidemen in the pop music business. Miller disappeared during his flight over the English Channel on December 15, 1944: the world mourned this most popular of all Big Band leaders of the fabled Swing Era."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5, maybe...","review":"Swing king Glenn Miller plays himself (sort of) as a bandleader with woman problems... problems with women married to his musicians!! A mildly interesting attempt to introduce some melodramatic social commentary about the strains that life on the road can impose on even the best marriages... A few campy catfights don't keep the wives' club scenes from dragging down the script, but the music is great. Highlights include the opening number, \\"People Like Us,\\" which gives us a good look at the whole band, and a typically dazzling tap routine by the Nicholas Brothers, during the \\"I Got A Gal From Kalamazoo\\" medley finale. Miller plays his role with a surprisingly hardbitten edge; Cesar Romero, Jackie Gleason beef up the cast, and it's always a hoot to see Harry Morgan in one of his early roles as a teenage geek. Some funny references to the wartime swing scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This was a great find for my wife she fell in love with the music from this movie years ago - thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glenn Miller music","review":"What's to say about a film featuring the great Glenn Miller Orchestra? This movie is somewhat darker than the other Miller film, \\"Sun Valley Serenade\\", but the music is great. Interestingly enough, all the Miller songs are in stereo, while the rest of the film is mono.

A. CONFIDENTIAL. I ordered this CD and was disappointed at how everything just seems to blend together into the same orchestral schmaltz, with little variation of dynamics or tone color. It was nice to hear again Joni's voice, but she doesn't do much with it. Peggy Lee, Jo Stafford, and June Christy released classic albums during the '50s, but this CD doesn't belong in the classic category.

I checked it ten times in a row and got a different measurement every time.Also, do not try to use spices that are in anything but powder form. Minced onions, doesn't work. Thyme leaves, doesn't work. Rosemary, dill weed, basil, oregano, none of them work.If you are just looking for something to organize spices and really don't care how your food tastes you might consider buying this.And if you just need organization, regular spice racks have been doing a fine job for years and are cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Thanks a lot, Gilligan !\\"","review":"A well written, straightforward account of Bob Denver's experience as the characters Maynard G.

I've used a Ricoh and a Nikon in the type and price range before and this is the best out of the three. The movie setting is unimportant to me, but the quality of the videos is very poor. If you want to take movies, buy a movie camera. This unit is very easy to use, simple on screen settings, easy fast download via the included USB cable. I do suggest getting rechargeable batteries, but I suggest that for all of these types of cameras. All in all, the camera is small and light, easy to carry, easy to use and takes great photos for the format of camera that it is. If you want to do fine photography you must buy top of the line equipment as none of these little cameras will take those kinds of pictures. There is more to it than just mega-pixels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from Olympus","review":"I was very happy with the Olympus D-380 I had for two years. When I bought a 395, I thought I would get all of the 380's great features plus better resolution, but instead found that they had stripped out much of what I liked in the 380 in order to make it 3 megapixels.Another review has a good catalog of the 395's faults: slow start and recharge, etc., but what I really miss is the spot metering and the ability to have the display off as a default. I suppose they wanted to simplify it, but they really dumbed it down.And to make matters worse, it takes lousy pictures. The exposure never seems to be right. The 380 got it right nearly every time.The whole family hates this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new digital!","review":"I got this digital camera about a week and a half ago, and I love it :) It takes great quality pictures, and good video, plus it's really easy to connect and download pictures to my PC. All I have to do is plug it in to the USB cable and it pops up a window giving me the downloading options.The only problems I've had with it are that it eats up batteries pretty fast, and if you take pictures without the flash or from really far away in low light conditions, the pictures can be a little fuzzy. However, they still show up.Overall, I'd reccomend this camera :) It's great, and I can take it anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it on","review":"This camera was a big disappointment for me. The pics are really grainy and low budget looking. The camera does not respond well at all to low lighting and the flash discolors everything. The body is really cheap and the lense is hard to clean.

That is about all it is good for as long as you are in the bright sunlight.If you need to use the flash or there is an overcast sky you pics will come out fuzzy; same if you need a flash. The only time I got a sharp picture was in full sunlight.The shudder speed is EXTREMELY SLOW!!! If you are taking a moving picture...forget it! You had better be taking a picture of a sleeping turtle to be able to catch the picture. Also, saving the picture to memory card takes a good 5-7 seconds. Be sure to get your picture the first time because everyones smile will be a frown by the time you get to the second picture!Overall, I am extremelt dissapointed at the performance of the D-395!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats up batteries","review":"I've had this camera for 2 years now and rarely use it.

Stores about 30 pics at the highest level. Not recommended if you don't have somewhere to download your pics. Although my friends are glad they don't have to look at hundreds of pics from my travels ;)This is the only digital camera I've had and I think the pictures are acceptable for a 3mp camera. I don't have the problems that others describe. I've taken this camera on two once in a life time trips and caught breath taking photos.

When I received it, I was excited to take pictures. Well I did, it was horrible. The pictures on playback were terrible. You couldn't make out what they were. Loading it to my PC, they were even worse. Not clear at all. The only good point to this camera, hooking it up to the usb cable, it automatically downloaded pictures for you. Well, I returned the camera, and bought another FujiFilm (A340)at our local store. Well guess what, the program is just as easy, downloads by itself and takes great pictures. Even on the playback on the camera, it's crystal clear and look even better on the PC. This was my first Olympus ever and I would never get another one after this.

We ended up returning the camera, however, because it had some serious flaws:- changing camera settings (picture quality, etc.) resets to the standard setting after turning the camera off. This means if you want pictures at a lower quality, you have to set this every time you start up the camera.- the battery life is poor. Standard AA's don't last long at all (we did not try NiMH or other rechargeables).- the response time from depressing the shutter to taking a picture is longer than any other digital camera I've tried.- the on-screen menuing is very confusing and not intuitive. We always had to consult the manual to figure out how to do simple things like erase all pictures on the camera.So even though the price is right, the camera is not, and I suggest you look at something a little more expensive and more capable."},{"rating":"1","title":"a paperweight","review":"I bought this camera about 2 years ago and never used much as I am technology challenged - did a few things with it, and was OK.

One reason, as touched upon by other reviewers, is that this is a collection of 52 short songs, most of which are less than a minute long. The result, from a listener's position, is that one does not have time to get in to a song, to enjoy what it has to offer, before it is over and the mood shifts again. The second problem, at least on my recording, is the presence of distracting noise artifacts in the background. To me they sound like the rustling of Mr. Galbraith's clothing, or maybe his breathing. It's hard to say, but it is definitley there in the quiet moments between notes - of which there are many on this unaccompanied guitar album. To reduce the distraction from this noise, I need to play the CD at low volume, like background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Collection","review":"This is an incredible collection of folk songs that stirs the soul!!

They can all be made with other yarns than the ones called for if they are hard to find. Some of the novelty yarns are in the sale bins now, and they can be used in combination with any yarn that you have. The only thing you have to do is get the gauge specified in the pattern. Do a gauge swatch, doesn't every knitting book tell you that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to work toward","review":"I found this book in my local library on my quest to learn how to knit. This book is not for the teach yourself first timer. Although there are knitting instructions in the beginning, they are not sufficient to teach.I look forward to coming back to this, after having finished five projects and understanding the basics. It has wonderful patterns that incorporate the ever-alluring novelty yarn. Most books I find do not even touch on such yarns. The patterns are creative and different, real eye catchers. A great buy, just not your first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novelty for Beginners","review":"Thus book is not well-done. The pictures seem over-colored and blurry with hand shadows. The instruction section gave me a headache. All white yarn on a blue background. White is not a good yarn to demonstrate things in. It tends to bleach out in photos.This book does have a good description of novelty yarns (eyelash, fur, fuzz, flat, chunky, multi-strand, metallic and jelly) in case you didn't know what to call each of them.And the patterns? Just would you would think. Garter, garter and wait for it....a little stockinette! Lots of fuzzy cuffs, a denim jacket ruined with some kind of novelty knitted sleeve and some simple top patterns. The only thing that was interesting to me was a jelly bag mainly because I was not aware of jelly yarn.This is just another book capitalizing on the knitting craze and marketing itself to new knitters who love novelty yarn and need simple patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing innovative here","review":"I just received this book and now know why it was so cheap. Almost half the book is \\"how to knit\\" (yeah, I know, should have read the whole title and not just the large print) and NOBODY should learn to knit with novelty yarns. It's just too difficult to see the stitches.Also, there are no projects that haven't been published elsewhere dozens of times. Pretty much just take any pattern and use a novelty yarn. For myself, I use 1 strand regular yarn and one strand novelty. The regular yarn gives it strength and shape; the novelty gives it texture. I was hoping there were new ideas here but there aren't.Only thing I hadn't see before is the jelly yarn, although I can't imagine using it for anything as it would look cheap.Oh well, got what I paid for, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"This was the first regency romance I've ever read and it was delightful.

If you've seen the movie, you'll know how a lot of this goes - one of the turtles is ambushed (though here it is Leo, where in the movie it was Raph) and April's apartment gets trashed, and the Turtles head off into the country to at an old, dilapidated home (this time, April's instead of Casey's) in Northampton, Massachusetts (the birthplace of TMNT).The story moves quickly, and is continued elsewhere, so you won't get the end here, nor the beginning. But the dialogue is crisp, and the artwork is excellent (if a bit simple). It's an enjoyable read, in the end, which is really all that matters. It takes itself more seriously than the movie did, and is a bit more adult overall, especially with such scenes as April having post-traumatic nightmares about the Shredder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!","review":"This works fairly well.... it does make it easier then mixing in a wheelbarrel. I've mixed 9 bags of cement... the method that works best... add 1/2 the water then 1/2 the cement, roll it 2 or 3 times and then add the rest.

With all of the interest in spiritual healing properties and use of gems in new age practices, it's difficult to find a book dedicated solely to the gemstones and minerals mentioned in the Christian Old and New Testaments (and Apocrypha). Although some of the authors' opinions are up for debate in light of recent archeaological discoveries, the book succinctly covers basic information on the gems and minerals (asphalt?) used in Bible verses. The verse references are useful to go back and determine the context used, and for additional research. A 2000+ update of this book would be a welcome volume as well (this version published in 1970).

Before tossing it in the wastebasket, I want to alert others: Save your time and money for \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing.\\" You'll be glad you did.

Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French fun around with Dusty and she plays along like a real trooper ! This video was done around the time she was recording ' A Very Fine Love ' , her final album, and from what I can judge by her biographies, she probably already knew she had cancer , which makes it all the more poignant. Her 'House is not a Home' singing with Burt Bacharach on piano is worth the price of the video by itself ! If you are really a true Dusty fan , and you don't have this , then buy it now. It's not some gushing tribute to Dusty , it's Dusty herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated","review":"This was the first career overview I ever got of Dusty Springfield, and the first time I (a fan since '99) saw the woman herself on-screen. A lot of people don't take it as seriously because it has spoof elements (with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders present, which Dusty asked for herself). But it's a good overview of Dusty's career to that point (up to 1994-95, when A Very Fine Love was being recorded) and hey, you get Dusty herself talking all about it. Which is appreciated after so many of the subsequent biographical accounts of her life tend to be downers that lean more towards the controversies rather than balancing that with the music and \\"good\\" times.

He actually dares to challenge the received wisdom of environmental activists. I would have thought that a book that critically examines the claims of environmental dangers and uses scientific knowledge to do that would contribute to our understanding of threats to the environment. Clearly, there are extreme and varied claims for environmental dangers. \\"But Is It True\\" helps sort out the exaggerations from the real problems. It also does it in reasoned and unemotional language. I strongly reommend the book for anyone who is concerned about environmental issues rather than the rhetoric of activism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by this book","review":"This book is a travesty in many respects. While some of the conclusions were warranted, most (including the overall points) were based on faulty analyses by an academic who had no training in the area upon which he expounds.

The songs are well, amazing, both in harmony and their lyrics. If you happen to live on the east coast be sure to check out your local club to see if they're coming by as they are an act that HAS to be seen live to really enjoy them. Their albums are good, but seeing them life is amazing.

The graphics and sound is great, controls are easy to learn, the story is cool, and better yet, the bosses aren't reruns! (MegaMan V features the Stardroids, mysterious robots from space). Now MegaMan's Mega-Buster is replaced by the powerful new Mega-Arm, an arm that fires and punches the enemy.

The eight Masters are named after the planets outside of Earth, and their leader Terra is named after the Latin word for earth.

The first one is really good. Good songs with funky beats. If you love older more jumpy house music this really isn't for you. Richard Humpty Vision has relaxed \\"just a little bit\\" more in this cd. The songs are just a little more chill, but still hold that funky house feeling. I wasn't to crazy for the 2nd cd. If you are a big true RHV fan who is not STUCK in the past of how house use to be then you should like this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please retire Him","review":"I have been a loyal house head for over 15 years and for the first time since Richard has pumped out intense mixes, this is the first time I am dissapointed. It sounds more like electro-pop-rock-digital boring crap. I didnt bob my head or feel like dancing. Is he even trying anymore. If his next album is this bad he will be cutt of from being in my vinyl and cd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmph...","review":"I have enjoyed Richard's mixes for a long time now. I didn't really enjoy this one.The track selection is pretty lame. Gone are the days of thumping, pounding, make you wanna get off of the couch or dance in the car tracks. This is pretty run of the mill house with some funky beats. The selection is weak, and at times, the mix doesn't seem to flow seamlessly. Trancy-type tracks are thrown in the middle of the set and throw off whatever vibe he was trying to create.I put down the DJ Dan double cd for this one. I'm regretting this decision.If you want a cd that is remiscent of Richard's style, buy his old albums and stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer dude","review":"I have been buying Richard since I first heard of him post \\"Jump\\" days...

Very hard to put down once you start. The author weaves fiction around facts and little known details of era.

You need to market a more reliable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before the glamour","review":"Johnny Marr once commented that The Smiths were more of a singles band than an album band. A listen to their \\"Single\\" cd set confirms that the band had a real knack for filling 3-minutes with the best dense jangly pop.As a collection of solo Morrissey singles, \\"Bona Drag\\" shows that the singer hadn't lost his touch, but was ultimately released too soon. The sidemen and co-songwriters here do their parts well, but a few tracks pull down the average (\\"Ouija Board, Ouija Board\\" and the Smiths-sound-alike \\"Disappointed\\").Otherwise (and there is a good deal of otherwise), I couldn't have picked a better collection myself. From the opening notes of the gay anthem \\"Piccadilly Palare\\" to the obsessive, diary-esque \\"Suedehead\\", the album boasts infectious melodies, clever lyrics, and the best pop-rock arrangements you'll find from its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hairdresser on Fire rocks!","review":"This is is such a great album, a classic.

But at least this is a great one. This record serves as an example of everything Morissey was and what he should be today. Clean production, witty, insightful lyrics, savvy musicianship. The man is talented, no doubt. It just seems when he concentrates on full even albums, his work shines the brightest. But nothing takes away though from this collection. (If you want a dose of crummy studio outtakes, just pick up My Early Burglary Years.) It's interesting that, with the exception of Hairdresser on Fire, these were all b-sides. Most bands would kill for this selection to make their best record. Unfortunately, Morrissey has hit the skids from a creative point of view the past few years. This record demonstrates just how far he is going to have to come back to show the talent he obviously has. Maybe he will. But let's face it. He never promised he was going to get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this album","review":"I had to purchase this album again because my original copy was scratched.

I bought this holder and a bluetooth headset from Amazon. The phone was working fine for past few months and also worked ok after I used the holder for some time. But lately since past few weeks, the phone was going out of service mode or \\"Insert SIM\\" mode all of a sudden. This happened every single day since a week or so.I stopped using this leather holder (after visiting Cingular and finding that they can't help resolve my issue with the phone) and now since couple of days the phone fine. I am thinking that the magnets in the leather pouch is causing some interference with the phone.Also, I didn't like the holder that much anyway, as it's belt holder is too stiff and doesn't slide smoothly on to the belt.My 2 cents.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for me","review":"This phone holster is horizontal, so it doesn't dig into my side getting in and out of the car. It is a perfect fit for my RAZR phone, and the magnetic flap is secure, yet easy to open. The design allows for the holster to stay on my belt, while I have easy physical access to the phone. Also, unlike the belt clips that allow the phone to rotate, it fits snugly at my waistline. It is definitely the most functional and most comfortable phone holster I've ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Total Junk! I purchased two of these for my Razr in June. One for work and one for good. Sept 5th and both pouches are now broke. The belt clips have torn loose from the pouchs. Luckly I was able to find my phone both times."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"As soon as I got my Razr v3, I went to AT&T to pick up the new goodies to go with it - case, auto charger cord, wired ear piece. I received a good bundle price, and was happy with the factory carry case. But we had a uniform change at my job, going from allowing blue jeans to requiring docker-style trousers. The Motorola carry case just didn't work as well. So I went searching my favorite shop(Amazon)and found this horizontal case. I'll admit, the price got my attention, first, then the description sounded exactly like what I was looking for. Thanks to the supplier's extremely quick shipping, I had my case in no time at all! And it was exactly as described, and worked even better than I had hoped for. I now use it exclusively. I've retired the Motorola case to the top drawer of my chest of drawers, in case of emergency need. The leather seems high quality, well made, and the lining is soft enough not to cause any friction points. I can highly recommend the item and the supplier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I ordered the case for the Razr phone.

It was a very bad experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premium Leather Pouch for the Razr","review":"I did not like it at all. This pouch is not suited for the Razr because of the location of the buttons on the phone. Putting the phone in and out of the pouch has become an agrivating struggle. It is to the point where I won't use it. They make a simlar pouch for the model prior to the Razr and it works much better. I would not buy that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish the Clip Attachment Was Better","review":"I bought my case about 2 months ago, and I loved it. However, recently, the clip came detached from the case. Until this happened, I never noticed how poorly the clip is attached to the case. Amazon replaced the case for me, but the new one looks to be made worse than my 1st one, and I don't think it will last as long as the 1st one. The daily attaching to a belt or waistband really stresses the glue keeping the clip attached.I dread going back to the plastic holster, or paying for the case from Cingular. I will check it out though, to see if it is constructed better.It's too bad, because this case really fits my Razr well, and I love the magnetic flap.Edit: Just got back from lunch and the clip came apart. I'm now 0 for 2. I bought the Cingular case, as well as one from Mobile Glove. The latter one has the magnetic closure, so I'll see how it is for a day or so. I'm fairly certain I'll return the Cingular case, as it's more expensive ($27 vs. $20)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well built cell phone case!!!","review":"This cell phone case is exactly what it said it would be and more.

It is wrongly advertised over here. I also request amazon not to advertise this pouch for D807.I bought this pouch few days back for my Samsung D807 cingular. When I received it, I tried my D807. First of all, it was difficult to put the phone inside it. And secondly, it was more difficult to remove the phone out of pouch. Think of situation when your phone is ringing and you are not able to take it out from the pouch :-(Additionally, this pouch is difficult to fit in men's belt, as it's clip is too tight. I expected to have slot for belt instead of a clip.Finally, I had to return the pouch to amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for Samsung T809","review":"I ordered this case after reading the good reviews. But I am very disappointed because my T809 does not fit in it. I have to put lot of efforts to push the phone in and out. What's the use if it is going to take more than a minute to take out the phone when you need to answer the call. obviusly the call will be missed. It may be good for RAZR V3 (as the box says) but certailnly not for T809. They should not advertize it for Samsung T809."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made! Looks good too.","review":"I was not sure what to think about this but it was such a bargain that I took a shot and bought 2 of them. It is VERY sturdy and well made. The clip holds on to my belt so tight that there is no chance of it falling off. The magnetic lid keeps the phone in place better than my last holder which cost 3 times as much.I am not one for flash and that is what I got. Basic black and very sturdy. My wife uses the other one and she loves it just as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good case for Samsung D807","review":"I ordered this case to go with the Samsung D807 phone I recently purchased, but was disappointed. It fits very snugly - as in you have to exert some effort to get the phone in the case. In the process of putting the phone in, the phone often gets turned back on because that's how tight of a fit it is. Maybe this case is good for Razr V3 but they should not advertise it for D807 as it is a very poor case for this phone. Although the D807 maybe should have a better key locking mechanism, it's ridiculous that, by pushing the phone into the case (and pushing kind of hard), the phone should get turned back on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied!","review":"This case was cheap in price. Unfortunately it also looks cheap and feels cheap. I can not recommend that you purchase this item unless you want your sharp looking RAZR to have a real flea market look about it. Poor leather. Poor workmanship. Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look. Mine went straight in the closet. MONACO makes a much better looking case that is much more functional, and they are available on eBay for about the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item Does Not Match Picture","review":"I am returning mine for the second time now. The item that Amazon is shipping is not the one pictured. The item I received (twice) is vertically oriented with a swivel clip.

Granted the ones you buy from your carriers store (AT&T;, Verizon, Sprint) are also made in China, they are far better... and cost much more. But the case that I got was not the one pictured or fit the description given. So beware!I was looking for a case with a wide belt clip (narrow clips don't hold when I bump something or get in and out of the car) and a good fit for the RAZR V3. The case I got has a narrow clip and too large for the RAZR so the phone flopped around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Fit RAZR - To Tight","review":"I found that this is too small for the RAZR V3, whenever you place your phone in the holder, it pushes the side buttons, and if you did not program your phone otherwise, it will call the last person you talked to and they will get to here all of your conversations. I am sure there is a better holder out there, I have just not found it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal Clip Not Strong Enough","review":"When I got this case, Initially the phone was difficult to remove. Shortly, however, the material softened and it worked just fine. The problems with this began three weeks ago when sitting down in an airline seat, apparently the arm of the seat pushed it off my belt. Luckily the flight attendent found it and returned it to me. Two days later, a similar event happened in a taxi. Again, I was lucky and the next rider was able to contact me and return the phone to me. After this last event, I inspected the case and found that the belt clip had bent out, making it useless. Threw it away. I urge caution for anyone considering this case. Other than the clip, other materials are of good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"Bought this for my wife's Motorola Razor phone. The belt clip separated from the pouch after two uses. The clip is attached to the pouch only with glue - the supidest construction idea. Returned to Amazon and got my refund.

The fit was nice for the phone and seemed sturdy enough. But the belt clip in the back was very tight and I had trouble fitting the case over my belt.

He listed a bunch of organizations that you could join to help build public speaking skills, but a phone directory could have told me that. I found no useful hints.

Instead of practical skills it suggested many unrealistic long-term sometimes gender exclusive excersises that felt more like the author wanted to SOUND like someone in a possition to help you but realised that he wasn't qualified to do so and instead offered excuses and diversions. The chapters are short, juvenile, and loaded with uncomfortable ugly illustrations and bogus trite little bits of pseudo-wisdom that you forget in an instant, because that is their true function as space filling gibberish and insultingly dumb statements of the obvious.

It only talks about why its hard to become assertive and give a few reasons why the world is the way it is.

The diagrams are excellent, showing good detail as well as showing common errors.

Altman's theme is about commercialism vs. artistic genius, and how tormented these two brothers are. It's beautifully photographed, but the movie feels long at 138 minutes and for some reason the conversations are whispered throughout the movie and are often inaudible.Altman doesn't focus his story strongly enough: Theo is as tormented as much as Vincent is, but everytime the movie points up that fact, Altman switches to something else. There are some stunning scenes, however: the whole sunflower painting scene, for example, with Van Gogh going through the agony of trying to paint them to his exacting standards, and then the shot with the failed attempts in his dingy room - one's eyes bulge to take it all in. Worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of inaccuracies.","review":"This movie is full of inaccuracies. For anyone who would like to know more about the real Vincent, read his letters.The portrayal of Theo's wife, Joanna Van Gogh, makes her out to be a cold woman who has no feeling for art or Theo's brother and his work. History proves her to be quite the opposite. In fact, without her the world might be saying, \\"Van Gogh who?\\"Vincent was a mentally ill man with an incredible talent who wanted nothing more than to teach people through his art and letters, recommending books he read and found helpful to those who he loved. The only thing that he really desired was to be loved, it was the elusiveness of this and his depression over his complete reliance upon his younger brother that may have lead to his suicide. He wasn't merely a crazed painter.

Stephen King has likely shredded better material and Mieville's characters, situations, and descriptions are far more vivid, engaging, and rich. Bishop has written a really good first novel, but it's not in the league of the authors listed above. I read several user reviews and allowed myself the benefit of the doubt, which cost me $15 or so. You pays your money and takes your chances.If this genre feeds part of your appetite, then my advice - go with other authors. Bishop offers nice appetizers, but the mains disappoint.

Yes the author writes well and uses an expansive vocabulary, but the story suffers. It is 400 pages long and it could have been only 50 pages. The character development could best be described as meandering and the author has each character speak withthe authors vocabulary. Every individual in this book uses very eloquent words to express themselves, that includes...ummm, everybody!!! Even drunken gangsters. If the author had not specified on each line who was speaking then one would never know the difference between the characters. The action is few and far between and I wish half as many words were used on describing the action as on the relationships and the characters philosophical whimsies.

After a while, I didn't care what happened. I was bored. I've tried several times to finish the book, as I hate not finishing one after I begin it, but it's just plain hard!

I was extremely disappointed. A lot of the writing is very good, but a lot of it is just terribly over-written. The opening was strong, with the two main characters fleeing across a desert, but once they reach the city of Ashamoil, things deteriorate. There is only really one sympathetic character, and I expected her to be the main character; she isn't. Instead, it's the other of the two from the opening. He is gradually revealed to be a vile person, and frankly, just not very interesting. There are echoes of China Mieville and Jeff Vandermeer and M. John Harrison...maybe even a little Fritz Leiber. But while I would love to visit cities like New Crobuzon or Ambergris or Viriconium or Lankhmar, I have no desire to visit (or revisit) Ashamoil, despite its vivid depiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"MADE SOMEONE HAPPYI ORDERED","review":"I ORDERED THIS FOR AN OLDER PERSON WHO DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GET IT.

The TV screen is so hot that watching it in my bedroom during the summertime was not an option, so it really has been lightly used (I have two other bigger TVs.) The response to the remote control is so slow that you often wonder if you hit the right button.

I think this is a better CD than \\"Wavelength\\" from 1978. But, only a year later in 1980 with \\"Common One\\", His music had progressed even further. This is the bridge that linked those changes and it is a wonderful and fulfilling experience to listen to. The bridge from 1970's Into the Mystic from Moondance. To 1979's Into The Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Muse","review":"This is not for the new Van Morrison fan - see Moondance if you are a novice.

This is why I gave it a poor rating.While it was working, my wife and I loved it and it performed as expected, even with that little knock. We bought the higher amp one so it would last longer but the motor was not the problem, something mechanical failed.We will shop around for another brand that will hopefully last for a very long time.

I was misled by the name, believing this was the real thing, and only discovered my mistake via web research after the back pain. The real Chi Machine is in fact NOT sold on Amazon (dont know why) and indeed costs more.

We both work in a very stressful work environment, my husband suffers from neuropathy in his feet, and we both stand for over 8 hrs. a day. This has made all the difference for our tired legs and feet at the end of a long day.

I plan my rejuvenation after traffic jams or early mornings. The machine is simple to use and with a nice color.

I have now tried thick padded socks as well as bubble wrap to try to protect my ankles, but it is not enough. My next attempt will be to try to tape sponges to my ankles to cushion them.

We could never get it up in a variety of conditions, and if you pull at all on the line to try to help lift it up, the effect is the opposite, it looses altitude and down it goes.

Dena's feelings and motivations were constructed in a such a way that the reader could feel for and with her. However, as a romance novel this was very much lacking. There was some longing, but very very little passion. With all of the books out there I admit that I read historical romance novels for the steamy passion and emotion. I want the scenes of gazing into her beautiful green eyes, and the descriptions of the hero aching to touch the heroine. I am not saying that I am looking for erotica, but I enjoy a well constructed romance which includes passionate scenes, not just a quick romp in the barn. Literally gals, one scene. The rest is the descriptions of longing and the dismay at the separation of our hero and heroine.

Slippers is wonderfully informative and visually exciting. As a narrative, you follow the life of one young girl through her preparations for marriage and her adult life.

I believe there are some errors in the book. First of all, foot binding are only practiced by well to do (and upper classes) Han Chinese families.

Women with bind feet are a minority in ancient Chinese female population despite the notoriety. Hakka people are considered as Han.

We were expecting some changes to the score, but to our surprise, the only song that was missing was the Prologue, which we had been choreographing to the CD. Some of the harmony and character breakups had been changed, but apart from that, the score was essentially the same.

I was disappointed and returned my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the one you think!","review":"No, this score does not include every song. For those of us that were entralled with the recordings featuring Jason Donovan, Michael Damian, or Donny Osmond, this score is a disappointment. It does not open with the narrator introduction and the prologue that excerpts Any Dream Will Do. Rather it opens cold with Jacob and Sons. Perhaps that is the way Webber and Rice expanded it in the early 1970's, but if you have only recently fallen in love with this show, this is not the score you think it is! Granted, it is a complete vocal score including solos and chorus parts, which makes it lightyears above the Piano/Vocal/Guitar ( ) that one usually finds for these shows, but please don't buy this thinking that you are getting everything on the CD or video."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MAGIC OF \\"JOSEPH\\"","review":"JOSEPH IS A GREAT MUSICAL FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES.

The characters, despite their quirks or perhaps because of them, I found appealing.The scene with the \\"Spelling Hornet,\\" where the teachers compete in a spelling-bee type contest to spell the students' street-slang is a riotous hoot and by itself makes the movie worth watching.A real good soundtrack as well.

Yes in the first half of the movie it tries to convey \\"teachers are people too\\", but once you get that picture the movie is coasting down hill without gaining momentum. You can only laugh at a dim-wit teacher who is as un-comfortable being a teacher as he is being a man so often. The the a-typical female gym teacher who is NOT gay but has issues too is also thrown in. But for me if the movie took each teachers personality and gave it more depth as the movie went forward there would be reason to finish watching it. Overall once you get the first couple laughs it just vomits the same thing up over and over again leaving that kind of acid taste in your mouth - like one more time is one more time too many.

I expected a fun narrative about how the author spun out, going deeper and deeper into his TV hell. Instead, the author gives a play-by-play, often at 10-minute intervals, of what he watched and what he thought of the show of the moment, which takes us inside his world but does not comment on it. The book could have been titled \\"Reports from the TV Front: An Examination of What's on TV at This Very Moment.\\" This book would have been far better if Brownstein had sat back after compiling his diary and had written a more general description of what happened to him on his journey, rather than what was on the tube (because who really cares?). The diary entries would have worked best as add-on elements rather than as the core of the narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting usefulness","review":"I had to buy a bundled video game to get a good price on this amazing knob from Laurey.

Finally, it takes months for Amazon to ship it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good shovel.","review":"The metal strip on this shovel catches on the brushed sidewalk concrete, and the shovel itself is too flimsy. So every time the metal blade catches, the shovel flexes and all progress halts. The angle of attack seems all wrong. I'm not tall, but I find myself lowering the handle to try to get the blade to work.Don't be lured in by price point. Choose a different shovel and you won't dread the snow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shovel for the price","review":"I was a little hesitant when purchasing this shovel since the only other review was negative. However, given that it only cost $9 plus free shipping I had to give it a try (besides there have not been any snow shovels in our area for a while). I was pleasantly surprised and it definitely gets the job done! It seems to be high quality. I have smooth asphalt so the edge of the blade getting stuck on the pavement is not an issues. It is definitely better than some of the shovels I have been borrowing from neighbors and the next most inexpensive shovel on Amazon was about $24 when you included shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Picked up the identical model from a local store, and not only is the metal edge flimsy, the bed of the shovel is weak. After a couple of big snowfalls the body of the bed has cracked, and I doubt it can move much more snow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ames True Temper Arctic Blast Snow Shovel","review":"This has to be the worst snow shovel I have ever seen. It has this new fangled bend in the handle for some bright reason which actually contributes to its poor performance. The bend prevents you from using force, the shovel itself bends and the whole thing wobbles even under a few inches of fresh snow. In my opinion, what ever engineer was hired to design this should be fired immediately. And clearly, there was no testing done on this shovel. There is no way there was because it would have been quickly realized it's a piece of garbage. All I am happy about is I didn't buy it myself for home use but instead it was bought by my work for the office area."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST SNOW SHOVEL I'VE EVER HAD","review":"I'll be short and to the point. This is the worst shovel I've ever purchased. After using it a handful of times, the metal edge on the end of the shovel began to peel off. Without this strip, the shovel will not work as it gets stuck to the surface, sidewalk, driveway, etc. You actually have to lift the shovel up in order to remove any snow or ice and it won't pick up what's left. Its like jabbing the shovel directly into the concrete and not going anywhere. Without this metal strip, the shovel is worthless. In addition, I purchased it at PEP Boys and I just noticed on my receipt it cannot be returned. At $13.99 plus tax its not expensive but it isn't worth the money or aggravation either. Its a nice looking shovel but the looks are deceiving. If you can find one, get a more reliable shovel even if you have to pay a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"A family curse, ghosts, a castle, a marriage of convenience should all add up to a good story. This is not one. The writing style was uneven. The person editing the book apparently lost interest or was a novice because there were too many distracting errors.

The liner notes are completely wrong from the albums the songs came from to the personell on each album. I wonder if the band even knows about this release. The cover isn't even new. It's the \\"Young Men Gone west\\" artwork.

If you have, you've been fortunate enough to hear some of the most inventive, wonderfully crafted, inspired music on the market. If not, this is a good place to start.This multi-talented group began in the early 70's and eventually broke up in the early 80's but they left a legacy of music that stands the test of time and will be enjoyed by fans of all ages.I have to admit I'd have included several alternative songs - but when you're faced with putting together a comprehensive collection, everyone has their own opinions. I just think it's great a compilation is out on the market.If you like this album, make it a point to try the albums that make up the Anthology. They're economically priced as 2-on-1 CDs and are well worth the money.

I did not care for them and teh UFO crowd did not give them a warm welcome.5-7-0-5 did get a decent amount of airplay (at least where I grew up in Chicago) in the 1970's. The song was okay.I bought this purely for the nostalgic aspect of being able to hear a song from my youth. I do not care for the other songs.If City Boy was a favorite of yours then you were definelty in the minority.

That explanation is much like the preceding material. A meandering outpouring of facts without much regard for consistency or clarity and an unnecessary tendency to over complicate. Caters to the research community at the expense of clarity to the student.The authors need to explain the algorithm first in clear and simple terms - then they can talk about optimizations!!! There is no point telling me how to optimize something you haven't fully explained.The consequence of the approach in this book is that finding out useful practical information becomes ordeal by treasure hunt. For example. Try finding an explanation for the derivation of the parameter for pheromome update. There's a nice greek symbol for it and it's between 0 and 1 but er..... thats it.If these guys are professors I pity their students."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,I WOULD RECOMEND EVERYBODY TO BUY IT.RICHARD DID A FANTASTIC JOB IN WRITING THIS MASTERPIECE.CONRAD SHOULD BE VERY PROUD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick, gross and thoroughly entertaining!!!","review":"Both of these movies are so demented, you'll make a mess in your pants...either from laughter or revulsion. The arrogant critics in LA who balked at this film and the acting are simply components of the Hollywood machine which breed thought void of perspective and scope. Both \\"Pink\\" and \\"Female\\" are poorly filmed. There are no special f/x, and they cost next to nothing to make. That's what makes them good. Learn the lesson, Hollywood. Pretentious films with pretentious actors and directors don't impress me, visionaries do, and John Waters embodies vision. Buy these films and enjoy them for what they are...fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Own This Movie","review":"A truly bizarre romp through the surreal. This movie is really 'out there'. Whatever your pre-conceptions are, if you haven't seen this movie, then you will be pleasantly surprised. It's difficult to imagine a time in this country when we were so free to express unconventional and shocking ideas without the need for being politically correct, expressing a message of morality, or providing a well thought out plot line. If you're looking for any of these attributes in a movie, go buy Fried Green Tomatoes. This movie is for The Fringe. A real tribute to the glorious 70's, when nothing was off limits, it maintains a true balance of being absolutely hysterical without lowering itself to being simple toilet humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS","review":"The first John Water's film that I saw was \\"Pink Flamingos.\\" I was shocked and disgusted, I could not believe what I was watching! I have never seen anything like it in my life. I couldn't help laughing out loud at the site of these extreme people who would rant and rave and do vile acts just to get noteriety! I absoluteley loved it. When I showed my friends the film they were shocked, but found it hilarious also. The lines in the movie get me every time, as with all of John Waters' movies. The lines that come out of the actor's mouth crack me up every time.---------------------------------------------------\\"Say it! Say it! Say, liquid eyeliner!\\"I saw \\"Female Trouble\\" for the first time about two weeks ago when I purchased the DVD combo. Loved it!

Pink Flamingo's is as \\"good\\" as it gets. Pink Flamingo's is the type of film that is more fun to watch with an audience not familiar with the film or any of John Waters earlier works. The birthday party scene with the singing A-hole (to the tune of Paw-Paw-Oo-Mow-Mow) and the last minute of the movie (the dog doo-doo snack) are worth the price of the DVD. If you want to be shocked or you want to shock those hard to shock friends, then this is the film for you. Read the other reviews, they tell it all like it is. Thanks John Waters."},{"rating":"1","title":"you MUST have an open mind....and I mean really open...","review":"I have yet to understand why Pink Flamingos is probably one of the most popular films of Mr. Waters.

It's much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult it is NOT!!","review":"So, in a nutshell...don't bother wasting your time like I did.

This is the book that made me politically active, because it's an attention-grabbing depiction of the threats to our freedom. The \\"War on Choice\\" isn't just about preventing abortion, or even outlawing it; it's about denying women their freedom as citizens.Everyone should read this book. I have always sympathized with the anti-abortion movement, but now I'm emphatically convinced that \\"against abortion\\" doesn't need to mean \\"against choice,\\" and that it's necessary to fight attempts to equate those two sentiments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ BOOK!!!","review":"This is a great book dealing with the abortion debate. It is written by Gloria Feldt, who is the president of Planned Parenthood so of course this book is going to be biased. Of course this is going to be heavily prochoice. This is a great book for people who are undecided or consider themselves pro-choice. It details the attack on a woman's right to choose, their tactics, and what it means to be prochoice. It also focuses on how to fight back, which is very very important for this generation of women. We have become apathetic to the issue. So many pro-choice women out there think their right to choose is sealed in stone. But it is far from that and this book opens up your eyes to it. I like this book because not only does it detail the threat to Roe v Wade but it also gives you ideas/options of how to fight back. A must read for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give this 0 stars","review":"I'm pro-choice, and thought this book would be interesting, but this woman comes across as an idiot.

As I thumb back through this hypertension-inducing rag, I don't even know what to reference in my review. I have written on almost every page where either she distorted the truth, out-right fabricated, or contradicted herself within her 270 page attack on sanity. She heinously defends \\"partial-birth abortion\\", oh excuse me, according to her that procedure doesn't exist, \\"Dilation and Extraction\\" (ironically, the \\"made-up\\" procedure and the D&X are performed the same way). Stating that D&X is a woman's health issue. Oddly, enough there are no accounts in history of a woman dying simply because the child that was expelled from her was allowed to live?

When confronted with such a person, one is shocked at how disconnected they are from reality - the mind reels as if they had denied the existence of gravity. Well, Gloria Feldt is just such a person. Perhaps it's that she's in way over her head when it comes to law. Perhaps it's that she's too close to her subject. Perhaps it's that she's not terribly bright. Whatever the reason, her book is utter claptrap and nonsense. Look, I actually support strong abortion rights and would oppose any effort to weaken Roe v. Wade.

Having just seen this woman on O'Reilly, my picture of this despicable person was confirmed. She had her own agenda and totally disregarded the topic of conversation and failed to answer any questions she was asked. She forced herself and her attitudes upon the television audience much like she attempted to force her opinions upon the readers. She would not shut up and allow others to share their opinions. In her personal life, the subject of abortion or anti-abortion should not be an issue at all since I believe she is one person practicing abstinence that is certainly not by choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I read this book hoping to hear some sane arguments from what I assumed would be a sensible person, the president of Planned Parenthood, but was ultimately disappointed. Like most pro-choice people in positions of influence, Gloria Feldt chooses to demonize her opposition as a bunch of nutballs who want to roll back women's rights as part of their dangerous political agenda. Apparently it doesn't even occur to her, or she just doesn't want to acknowledge, that most of these people are just doing what they think is right.

Restaurants all over the area created the mouth-watering cajun and creole dishes which everyone associates with Louisiana. A crawfish boil was a common weekend activity when the shellfish were in season, and the rest of the week was spent using the leftovers to create other incredible dinners.My mother swore by the River Road Recipes series of cookbooks. I had countless meals of delicious Louisiana foods, from etoufee to jambalaya. Now, in my own kitchen a thousand miles away, I cook from this cookbook. The recipes are easy to prepare and delicious to eat. The only problem I have encountered is difficulty finding specific ingredients. But these are easy to replace, and the recipe does not suffer much.If you want to spice up your cooking and recreate some of the south's greatest cuisine in your kitchen, this cookbook will get you well on your way.Let the good times roll!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book","review":"I read this book when it first came out.

People ask different questions. One being religion. I remember certain topics about the book, but because it has been so long ago; I have lost a lot of its content. Now that I have read it again; it seems too have a different meaning. Not quite as I remember in high school. I am sure that is because I am much more skeptical. It still makes you challenge your faith and gives you different insight into religion. Be prepared to have a dictionary next to you. There are many words that require some interpretation and meaning.

The emotions that ran through me the first time that I read it were incredible. I feel in love with some characters, gagged when Lauren first found Carl, I felt her horror when she found out just exactly what she had fed her best friend.

It is the best novel that I have ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story with mediocre writing","review":"I used to love Christopher Pike when I was in junior high, and read Chain Letter and Remeber Me and all his classics. So when someone told me he wrote adult fiction, I was quite excited.I really enjoyed the story; it was definitely a page turner. But otherwise the book was a disappointing, mostly from a writing standpoint. The dialogue was completely unbelieveable and the characters were underdeveloped and mostly two-dimensional. After a while, I had to suspend my writing critique and just read for the story, to find out what happened.One bonus is that despite its length, the book is a quick read. All told, it's not bad if you want a quick poolside- or beach- read, or if you just want to get absorbed in a novel for a few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly bad","review":"i can't stand this book. the characters were cold and empty, and unbelieveable. the saintliness of jennifer wagner made me want to vomit. this book is just like Pike's other teen horror novels, which normally would be fine, but since it's stretched out to adult novel proportions, it is incredibly long and unbearable. i feel cheated of the hours i wasted reading this book, which is just a rehashing of Pike's usual themes. if you are a young reader and love Christopher Pike, you will probably enjoy this book and think i am crazy for not liking it. but if you are like me, an old Christopher Pike fan from back in the day who, now older & wiser, recognizes the same-ness of all of his writing (in that it's pretty bland because he applies a similar formula to every story) then steer clear!!! take my warning for what it is. I SO wish someone else had told me not to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is seriously ill.","review":"Everyone gets hurt or dies violently in Christopher Pikes books. I'm in high school, but if I had teens, I wouldn't encourage them to read this stuff. Books that make sense to me are HOLES by Louis Sachar, or The CHOCOLATE WARS, or SIGHTS by Susanna Vance. They have excitement without gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read...Recommended!","review":"This is my all-time favourite Christopher Pike book, and quite possible my favourite book in general. This superb blend of horror, science-fiction, and fantasy captivates the reader the whole way through and the story-within-a-story concept encourages the reader to keep on reading to find out what happens to Chaneen's kingdom and Lauren's expedition to Mars. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind (don't you just hate those stubborn people who refuse to enjoy something different). I remember when I first read this book two summers ago, I was enchanted and unable to put it down (I even ignored my girlfriend), and since, I have lent it to all my friends. Please, read this.

I was curious to see how he handled an adult novel -- although I also read \\"Sati\\" years ago and remembered being impressed.I was initially disappointed that the writing seemed a little \\"obvious\\" from what I expected from an adult novel. But that changed as the story developed, got interesting, and the characters started to hash themselves out more fully. I thought the \\"story within a story\\" was almost more skillfully written than the main story itself!The horror/sci-fi/fantasy mix will go down well with most readers, I think.

In the future I will just make 1/2 of my favorite recipes from other vegetarian cookbooks I own.This book may be good for a new vegetarian or someone trying to become vegetarian since the smaller recipes let you try different things with fewer leftovers (in case you don't like it!), or for someone who entertains and sometimes has a mixture of veg & non-veg guests.

The narrative style is somehow superficial, lacking a real insight in the matter, almost exclusively concentrating on the character of \\"deep throat\\" as if we were looking at a Hollywood star biography, rather than a simple piece of a more complicated and important plot. In the end the documentary focuses on an important yet secondary character of the story. Putting \\"deep throat\\" in the center of your \\"solar system\\" instead of President Nixon, alters the whole balance of the narration, loosing the proper perspective and therefore the necessary historical depth, making this account of Watergate a sideshow of a sideshow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Throat speaks, we listen","review":"This is a pretty-good video. We get to visit the garage where Woodward met Deep Throat, and see the secret-holders each share some thoughts about that time in history.

The music is cheesy 80's music at its worst and the special effects look cheap even for the time when the movie was made. I feel like I wasted time that I will not get back.

And the third, \\"The Hitchhiker\\" is the scarriest, about a philandering wife, who decides to take some one for a \\"ride\\". All the tales are pretty scary, with some light humor in all the stories. I personally enjoyed the 2nd Creepshow more than the first. I have watched this movie over 100 times and never tire of it!

It meets all the criteria of a real horror short story. I loved the ending, just brilliant. Moreover, the cartoon supplied as an extra, the same idea as Tales From the Crypt would do to open and close the show, is great as well, and I enjoyed that one.

The reviewer says that Hawk Nelson cannot make up their minds about which side they are on, because they want to support public schools and they denounce gay marriage. Those issues have nothing to do with each other. First of all, not all Christians are for giving tons of money to private, religious schools (I'm not!). I'm all for supporting public schools because I believe everyone deserves a good education. Secondly, what happened to being able to make your own opinion?

I said, \\"wait, this is a simple 10 year-old cartoon!\\" but it was one of the most dramatic sequences in any television show ever. After wacthing the only thing that will be bobbing around in your head will be why Vegeta didn't realize that he wasn't a super saiyan.

When I was watching this video, I kind of really felt for Vegeta (and this is a cartoon). One thing I like is to see some sad parts on shows that usually have a lot of action in them. I also like when some parts from the past are shown because it's easier to get into the overall story. \\"Xena:Warrior Princess\\", \\"X-Men\\", and \\"Gargoyles\\" are other examples ofthose type of shows. This \\"DBZ\\"video is a must have. The only question I have is, 'Where exactly was Radditz when Frieza destroyed the saiya-jins in the past?'One more thing: When I first started to watch \\"DBZ\\", I used to get pretty frustrated with the show (even though I still liked it) because it seemed like they wasted too much time and it took too long to get things over with but, I've gotten used to it.

The front roller has fallen off after about 10 hours of moderately hard use. Now I am searching for parts to rebuild, or contemplating just trashing. While working, the unit tracked decently and the profile was good for getting close to the edges. However, it did break belts about every 15-30 minutes, so was actually expensive to operate. My old time heavy belt sander has been working for 20 years under the same conditions, and I don't think it ever broke a belt, but rather, I could use it until the abrasives were worn off. It takes more muscle and effort to use this unit than a heavier one, plus it is much more screechy to listen too... all-in-all, a big disappointment.

And finally, after about 15 minutes of trying to remove paint from plywood, the rear tire tore off! If you need something to do light work, you don't need a belt sander, but you certainly don't need this sander anytime. It won't handle balsa wood. Spend the money. If you don't have the money, buy a good random orbit sander which is less than this junk. I ended up buying the Ridgid belt sander and it was expensive but worked great (nice machine).

The sander has a very low profile that allows the user to get close the edge of a floor or another area where there is a right angle. However, during my first use I was disapointed to find that the lever that compresses the tension spring for the belt failed. I had to return the sander to a service center for repair the first day it was in use. It seems to me that the lever is made of poor quality material. Hopefully, the replacement will be made better.

Now I have to get a real one","review":"Looks good and feels good, but the belt walks so much you end up with more shavings from the belt than the wood.

Needed something quick to get a job done and purchased this sander. I really like the design of this sander it is pretty versatile. At a fraction of the weight of my last DeWalt it was easier to maneuver and sits upside down nicely. I don't use belt sanders frequently and this sander did the job when I needed it. It lasted 15 or so hours and went through 10 high quality belts before biting the dust. My last two belt sanders were DeWalt sanders and only lasted a bit longer than this much cheaper Black & Decker sander. After the failure of the second DeWalt I picked up one of these cheap Black & Decker sanders because it used the same belts. With the limitations of the DeWalt and their short lifetimes I can easily buy 3 of these sanders and not feel too bad about tossing these after a few hours of use.

He changes his genre here and does a great job of it. Ok it's not Frank Sinatra but it's a combination of him and Robbie and that makes for an amazing album. Im finding it difficult to do a long review here so I sum it up in short and all you need to know is its brilliant and a combination of the best bits of Frank and Robbie. Just buy it.Bare in mind if your a true swing fan and a true fan of big bands or Frank Sinatra you probably wont like this (or at least as much I did).

Robert Arbor is a restaurateur who knows his stuff when it comes to what constitutes an enjoyable meal and good times spent with family and friends. There are no frills or expensive equipment used here; he shows you his own kitchen with it's low tech range and rustic charm. His recipes for good, wholesome and satisfying meals are simple for just about anyone to make and add to their own repertoire. Roast chicken, croque monsieur, perfect hot chocolate and good coffee. Make them, savor them and be transported to a little French village somewhere warm and fragrant with lavender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Book","review":"My husband purchased this book for me when I was feeling depressed due to having to come home after our wonderful European vacation. Joie de Vivre helped to keep me immersed in the beautiful French culture a little longer. The author brings the reader intimately into his life, sharing details concerning the French culture that I would not otherwise have known, even having spent weeks in France. The author, Arbor, is very gentle, the famous French snobbery (which we never encountered on our vacation), is completely absent. The recipes are just icing on the cake. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this charming book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought there would be more receipes in this book; it is mostly a glowing tribute to appreciating life in the countryside.

So if you are looking for simple, easy, French country cooking, this is NOT the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"I was a little surprised that being this was a hardcover that more of a budget wasn't put into this book for simple things. A copy editor, and a real photographer would have been nice. Espresso is referred to as \\"expresso\\" throughout the book save for once, and it takes him 2 pages to say what could be conveyed in a paragraph. The photos are horrible; these are all snapshots, where nothing is lit properly, and I would have thought a book like this would have some gorgeous photography. The recipes are all fine and dandy, and the author does the usual pontification about Americans needing to slow down and have a nice coffee. It's escapist, but being that's the nature of the book itself, I wish the publisher could have tried harder. The book \\"Stealing Magnolias\\", which is about New Orleans, does a much better job with better images, writing, and is more succinct. I assumed this book would be similar. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S A FANTASY!","review":"A pleasant read, but not hardly the French way of life.The urban French have no more time to linger over morning coffee, take daily shopping strolls, dally in their gardens, than we here do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"I can't believe only one other person gave this a poor rating. Maybe the others didn't even bother. I picked up this book at the library, thankfully, so I can return it.This book provides nothing more than a look at the insipid life of a man with a hyphenated identity, but claims to be only French. Most of the images in this book are of his home, friends and kids. It's like a family newsletter made thick and glossy. I honestly don't care to know so much about him.Sure, it's charming to have a home in the French countryside. If you want to read some escapist travelogue, which can be fun, there are lots of those around. If you're looking for a cookbook, find one of those.

I REALLY recomend that you get this case before your ipod, so when you get your ipod it can go straight into the case and you can have a scratchless ipod. I ordered them at the same time and my ipod came first, so now I have a big scratch on the screen and I really regret it, especially since I saved up my whole life to pay for it.

The very first 1st week I had it, it already developed more scratches than I imagined! If you think I'm too careless, I'm actually too self-conscious about my stuff! I didn't want more scratches from developing, so I bought this Contour Design Case. The case is made from an impact resistant plastic and has a dock protector to protect it from getting dust and other unwanted substances in there! I'm pretty pleased with how much protection it brings to my iPod.

I take out the protective shield and after carefully trying to get it on the IPod, it ripped at the seam. I then tried to put the IPod in the case with the plastic shield wrapped around it the best I could. I did not get the IPod in the case as it was too tight and just not the right fit. End result? This little task caused a vertical scratch on my only one week old Ipod screen! My advice? Stay away from this lousy case.

It's great. Looks good, protects good, and compared to the prices of other cases, it's a bargain.My few complaints are small. For one, the belt clip allows the iPod to be held horizontally only. I'd have prefer a vertical clip. Second, the case comes with a clear cellophane wrap that you must use, otherwise the case will scratch your iPod when you insert it. I'd have preferred more than one of these clear wraps. Third, the bottom attachment that you have to snap back on to enclose the case doesn't seem to click back in perfectly. The fit is still tight but there's a fraction of a millimeter space left open. Fourth, the opening for the USB/FireWire port is somewhat difficult to open unless you have super strong fingernails. Using an instrument to pry it open will leave small dents in the plastic.Overall, though, it's a great case. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exercise caution when ordering","review":"The designation of iPods is confusing at best; there are model numbers, but which constitutes third generation, fourth generation, photo model, etc. is vague. I purchased this case for a 20 GB color display model (not designated as a \\"photo,\\" but does display photos) and it did not fit. Half way into the case, the \\"required\\" plastic (cellophane-like) sleeve bunched up and the iPod was impossibly stuck. The retailer I purchased both from had no idea of the incompatibility (Contourdesigns fault), and I was forced to use a hacksaw to break the case open and retrieve the Pod.Be sure to check the thickness of your iPod model before ordering. If it is over 0.57\\", it will not fit. The case is made of a VERY strong polycarbonate material and I'm fairly sure I would have liked it except for the unfortunate situation resulting from the company's poor specifications of which model would fit properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"DO NOT BELIEVE THE POSITIVE REVIEWS!!!!!!!Like most of the other reviews- THIS CASE SCRATCHED MY IPOD---BAD!!!Too bad I didn't read all of these reviews before I purchased the case.

The book also discusses how to evaluate different types of property, how to arrange financing, how to negotiate with a seller, how to market your product, tax considerations, and more.

Having not read to book I found myself having to listen and re-listen to certain portions to prevent losing the plot in all the ruckus and jabbering voices. Additionally, many of the main charactor voices sounded so similar that it was hard to know who was speaking.

I had to force myself to read it to the end hoping that there was some grain of use in the book - I didn't find one. There are no remarkable insights at all and everything in the author's documented experiences were so completely obvious to anyone in the same situation that it made me wonder why anyone would bother publishing this nonsense.

In other words, I really dig this album. Neil was the original grunge guy, outdoing them on this album and making bands like Pearl Jam look like amateurs (Neil later did an album with Pearl Jam called Mirror Ball, and its PJ's best album, along with Ten). I love the extended jams here, especially Over and Over, and Love and Only Love (running a wonderful noisy 10:18). You get the feeling that Young is enjoying the hell out of himself, and his attitude [...]. I never grow tired of this album. Even though I've heard it many times, the solos still sound fresh every time. Neil is one of the few rock artists (like Dylan and Morrison) that has managed to make great music for decades. There were times that all 3 of them made some crap (mostly in the 80's), but they all recovered wonderfully. A great, great, great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in an incredible career...","review":"Just the best album Neil ever put out, and maybe the best Crazy Horse ever sounded.

That a bunch of forty-ish hippies who should have followed Young's advice and burned out long ago could produce a guitar dominated album of such intensity is simply astonishing.

The cymbals are awful (listen before you write some knee jerk comment).Start listening for the cymbals in songs and you will soon agree with me that any drummer who bangs on the cymbals with every beat is annoying, uncreative and stinks out loud.

Neil Young is best when he is angry and channeling that anger into something strange and joyful with sparse lyrics and crunchy guitar. And that's what's happening on this album. The best Neil Young album since the late 1960s, and much more raucous and fun than Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. There is just an emotional strength to this album that gives it staying power. Add Crazy Horse to the mix, and you definitely have something where the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts. This CD is a primer on how to make smart, emotional rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rag, Ragger, Raggest, Ragged Glory!","review":"This album was my introduction to Neil Young. Its roughness, its emotion, his anger, everything comes out in one masterpiece! Country home is an excellent opening where Young shows his roots in a fresh and open way.

I seen him performing live about a year ago and on stage he shows what music can do. I hope he is going to make more albums like this one (I don't like his older stuff)!

The problem with American DBZ, is a lot of stuff is dubbed. That is why I only rate uncut versions, with the exception of this one. Yeah, cut versions stink. No doubt about that, but the people who watch them, that's their choice.

Told through the eyes of a \\"Watcher\\" - a former member of a feudalistic guild whose members were in charge of Earth's defense - the entire book works as a memorable tale of almost insurmountable loss, followed by redemption. Silverberg takes us on a magical journey through the streets of Roum (Rome), Paris and Jorslem (Jerusalem). Not surprisingly, the first novella, \\"Nightwings\\" - which chronicles the Roum adventures of the Watcher as the city is conquered by aliens - earned a Hugo Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"George knew how to swing","review":"a total pleasure. masterful guitar work from a much underappreciated musician's musician. if you listen close enough you will enjoy this more and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to do with liviing abroad","review":"I couldn't have been more disappointed by this book. It was 95% basic finance topics and 5% dealing with finances for living abroad. And the 5% was so basic that it was barely worthwhile. Not only was the book mistitled for it's content, but the style was condescending and repetitive. It's the first time that I'll be returning a book to Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Covers the Basics Better than the Overseas Part","review":"I found this book heavy on the basics of financial investing, planning, and taxation and very light on specific financial information relevant to overseas living and American expats.

The only good (not fun) thing to do after you finish it is collecting items, which isn't that fun. I have no idea why this game got five star reviews as it is VERY boring, and waywayway too short.

I will confess that I'm usually really bad about beating games: I think I've actually beat four or five in my lifetime--and I spent months (Zelda LTTP and OoT). I finished this game in about a day and a half and felt totally unsatisfied. It was really, very boring.Fortunately, I sold mine in the marketplace and have since purchased the Zelda game--which has been very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I thought this game would be something like Ubrz in the City or Bustin Out with missions to complete and fun things like that. But this game is no fun at all! You are stranded on a desert island and you have to try to get off. The conversations with people are no fun and the objectives are unclear and no fun to complete.

I needed to make some party decorations, so I enlarged Mario, Luigi, and a piranha plant on poster board. The light wasn't super bright, but they still came out well. The plastic is cheap, and it gets a little warm, but I think this was the cheapest one I found. There was a little issue with the company that I ordered it from (TCP Global Corp). I was worried after I read some of the comments about them, but it was too late by then. I still hadn't received shipping information about the projector by the time the first day in the estimated shipping date range came. I called and they had never received the order, but they did bill me. It turned out that there was a \\"glitch,\\" and I wasn't the only one it happened to. They were very nice and sent it right out.

But Schneider's pipes are unique; she can be reflective and lulling one moment, and furiously urgent the next. Accompanied by a tight, imaginative band (which Schneider wishes, it seems, to remain in her shadow), the singer has the stuff to be a breakout success. She's been playing out in NYC, and one hopes that she'll eventually appear farther afield. The first Alice Texas CD, 1999's Gold, was a starting point only. Schneider has evolved tremendously in the interim, and the real gold is here, on Sad Days."},{"rating":"1","title":"What audacity!

Apparently Lenovo Bios does not allow this card and may be more tolerant of the Atheros based card. So, I don't know how this card functions until after I have hacked my Bios. To make a long story short, this card is now working happily on my Lenovo. I had to \\"fix\\" the bios in order for the card to work along with a \\"taping over\\" of contact # 20 in order to disable the disable signal that is sent via the hardware switch (believe it or not, this last sentence actually makes sense).

They were wonderful -- outstanding musicians, if somewhat -- shall I say -- different. (I remember Pee Wee Russell reading a chemistry book between sets.) This Japan album brings back many fond memories. My favorite in this collection is one I had not heard before -- \\"Am I Blue\\" with a magnificent vocal by Jimmy Rushing. The record provides as good a sample of Condon's Chicago style as I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing God as My Refuge","review":"This is a great book. Joan Esherick has used the imagery of a medieval fortress to draw me step-by-step into the heart of God--a heart that wants to be a refuge for me.I especially appreciate Joan's vulnerability in sharing her personal examples--times that show how she has realized her need for God and how He has been a refuge for her. These examples draw me in. I also love the many Bible references that show me how much God cares.At the end of each chapter are questions that helped me focus on the contents and summarize them in my mind. I can also see them being great for using this book as a small-group study. The \\"framework\\" of a medieval fortress helps pull the whole book together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Comparison","review":"Not real sure what this was going to be, but loved it. When you look into this idea, how great it is that God almighty is our fortress, it shows that we are in a fight, a war and the only place of refuge is with our Lord.

How Joni's stupendous musical vocal accomplishments in the field of pop music have gone relatively unnoticed down through the years is one of the top 5 \\"shames\\" of the 20th century. This album's 5-star rating is an understatement. Her entire musical career was a 5-star rating, and it is more the pity that that career was vastly neglected by publicists who gave far lesser vocalists media spotlighting that she, on the other hand, truely warranted."},{"rating":"2","title":"great show with references to entrapment and bloodsport","review":"...among others. i think you can especially appreciate this show if you grew up in the 90s, but no matter your age, if you like silly humor, this show is for you. super funny guys. the cast is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I received the DVD in a timely manner and I loved it!

A rare chance to appreciate Tony's famous 1935 Martin D-28 (formerly owned by Clarence White) before its unfortunate damage later that year (1992) in hurricane Andrew.The sound of this guitar in Tony's capable hands comes through loud and clear. On several songs Tony's brother Wyatt plays a newer Santa Cruz Tony Rice model, and the contrast between the vintage Martin and one of its best modern interpretations is enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rice & Friends deliver awesome bluegrass musicianship","review":"Tony Rice and a varied lie up of top bluegrass exponents go all out on this 62 minute concert video.

The littlest noises can drive me crazy, and this TV made a low hum from the day we bought it. Actually tried to bring it back, but through many problems with Conn's (don't shop there!), we ended up keeping it. Did some looking around on the internet and apparently this hum is common with Mitsubishi TVs. It has something to do with the color wheel technology they use. Anyways, I can zone the hum out when watching shows, so I can live with it. Some people don't even notice the noise until it's pointed out. Besides, the picture quality is great, and it was very inexpensive for such a large size.

The story concerns a destroyer in the North Atlantic whose mission is to seek out Russian submarines, and force them to surface. Once the submarines surface, they are photographed, and the game starts again. The problem occures when one Russian submarine proves to be too ellusive, and the Captain of the American destroyer takes it personally, as his own white whale.

It can be read as interesting diversion, but should not be understood as an accomplished work of scholarship. In fact, there are some quite implausible claims made throughout. For example, Mannix claims that the end of judicial torture in the 18th-century could be attributed primarily to Beccaria's humanistic tracts! This is simplistic to say the least. After the work of Langbein, however (see Torture and the Law of Proof), this claim is simply undefensible. Moreover, Mannix fails to adequately distinguish the different theaters of torture, leading to far too many general claims (on punitive torture, one cannot do better than Foucault's Discipline and Punish, his hyperbole not withstanding).An accurate portrayel of the complex judicial and punitive changes that led to the previous abolition of legalized torture requires much more nuance--let alone attention to detail and source documents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little book","review":"Our third grade CCD class spent half the year referring to the Gifts of the Holy Spirit, so I purchased this set to hand out as an end-of-year present.

The problem wasn't me, it was the book. Almost nothing happens in the novel. It's slow moving and, quite frankly, boring. Much of the narrative is repetitive, focusing on the inner turmoil a narrator we don't know enough about to care. Characters are poorly developed, the action isn't well plotted and the entire book moves in fits and starts. And as our narrator describes his \\"descent into hell\\" things only get more confused and more boring.Desmond's attempt to write a more literary horror novel fails in almost every respect.

Jirel, with her red hair and two-handed longsword, is the literary ancestor of such present day swordwomen as Red Sonja. The stories are vibrant and bold, depicting their settings very realisticly. In alot of ways, the stories are every bit as good as Howard's Conan stories. My only reservation is that the stories have a very 30's pulp feel to them (probably because that was when they were written). All in all an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story needs characters . . .","review":"I picked this book up at a Salvation Army store for about 50 cents, and I'm glad that's all I paid. I have no problem with strong female warrior types, but Jirel does not do them justice. As the editorial review notes, Jirel is a little stupid, and it is often her uncontrolled emotions rather than her courage or her bravery that get her out of sticky situations. As a heroin, I just couldn't bring myself to root for her to win. My biggest complaint, however, is the lack of other characters in most of the stories, especially the Black God stories. Moore undoubtedly spent a great deal of time writing 30 pages of description of strange alien worlds, but after the first 10 pages they get a little boring. A good story needs more than one character to keep up the reader's interest. In this respect, the final story in this collection, Hellsgarde, was a pretty good story, and much easier to read because there were several interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Manley = Dave Barry of the Library World","review":"This book is tounge-in-cheek funny.

Sounded like an interesting premise--three female friends with a 20 year history and the disappearance of one of them to add a bit of mystery. I love books about relationships but there was no substance or real connection among these women. How pathetic must Kayla be that she needs the so called friendship of Val and Antoinette? Val is totally selfish. Antoinette is completely withholding and incapable of any kind of warmth. And yet Kayla speaks of \\"the strength of their friendship\\" and calls them her \\"best friends.\\" The book is an insult to women who know the depth, intimacy and support of real friends. A totally unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loathesome cast of characters in this book","review":"This book has the set-up of a great suspense novel: Three friends go swimming one evening and one of them mysteriously disappears. The intriguing premise, however, quickly devolves into not so much a mystery as a soap opera. Even that would be fine, except that all of these characters are so deeply flawed as to be thoroughly loathesome. I found myself rooting for the worst to happen to all of these people. And, when the big \\"mystery\\" is unveiled, the protagonist -- Kayla's -- actions are completely unbelievable and moronic. This is the second Elin Hilderbrand novel I've read and it will certainly be my last. Even Nantucket's charms couldn't save this mess. On a nitpicking note, the author shows a decided lack of imagination. For example, the three friends who go swimming one night each year nicknamed themselves -- wait for it -- the Night Swimmers. YAWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad.","review":"I picked this up because I've really enjoyed several other novels by this author. But this book was just painful to work through. The characters were just insufferable, each one more so than the last. Kayla is needy and pathetic, Val is selfish and a total stereotype and Antoinette is so incredibly off putting and selfish that the \\"friendship\\" between the three is just painful to read about. The plot is convoluted. Honestly, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because I did finish it.

This book told more than the beauty and wonders of Nantucket Island.

The three women would sneak onto the beach the Friday of Labor Day weekend to eat, drink and be merry...as well as swimming in the nude and telling their most personal secrets.

Far-fetched character behavior was used to then make it a juicy novel. It came across as a bad soap opera, unbelievable, with filler thrown in to weave the tale together.

Although the Bobby character possesses a great deal of imagination, it is expressed as direct opposition to parental authority. When his mother calls \\"Bobby!\\" he refuses to acknowledge the call and pretends to be many things other than the referenced child known as Bobby. The calls from his mother grow more intense and shrill, yet he continues to ignore them. At the end, Bobby grows hungry so he imagines that he is a lion as he walks back into the house. His last statements are \\"And they better let me watch TV. Or I'll eat them.\\"While imagination and inventiveness are always to be encouraged in children, the expression of defiance is an inappropriate one, both in running away and then making threats to the parents. For these reasons, I was not impressed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate preschoolers","review":"I bought this book because I loved Bark, George! I was very disappointed. \\"I'm not Bobby!\\" is an angry and sometimes violent book. The illustrations exude frustration and the character has malicious thoughts.

This would be my second cast iron pan, and it is great for searing meats, or cooking eggs. No sticking as others have noted, but cast iron does have its limitations. You cannot deglaze after searing something, since wine is usually acidic. You also cannot braise, since tomato sauces, and vinegars are acidic. The sloped edges allow for easy cleaning, and I use a wok brush, as opposed to a nylon brush. Nylon melts when it meets the hot iron surface. It is also too heavy for flipping foods, although the sloped sides suggest you can. No, I'm no measly featherweight cook, but this is still mega heavy, especially with the small handle. Of course, the small handle is good for cabinet storage.In summary, I would suggest the straight edge model instead of this one, and don't let this be your only pan. Great for diner style foods I would say."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it. But you need to sand the cooking surface.","review":"I have many Lodge products.

It is the best cookware I have ever owned. I am retired chef of 40 years so I have some experience with saute' pans! It is heavy so it takes a little more strength to flip stuff but it is not too difficult. I recommend what an earlier reviewer suggested: sanding the pan smooth before use. I did that with this pan and the smaller one and it really made a difference. It only took a few minutes with a sanding mouse to do it. Also, I went and bought a metal spatula to use with it as some stuff sticks a little but it peels right off with the metal spat. You don't have to worry about scratching it, it doesn't matter! After cooking just rinse it out, use a tuffy or green pad while it is still warm (no soap or detergent) then dry it and spray with non-stick spray and store in the oven. I use much less oil with this pan.

The songs just seem to flow into each other, and the whole album has a coherence that makes listening to it a fine experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss It","review":"Morrison's work in the last decade hasn't always been that well received outside his hard core fan base. 'Magic Time' is not just a 'return to form' to use the old cliche but evidence of Morrison's still solid artistry. The songwriting is much more consistent here than it has been in recent years. It's also a much more engaging work as Morrison seems to have taken up the 'search' for meaning, not heard in a long time. Pride of place probably goes to 'The Lion This Time' which recalls the great 'Listen To The Lion'. Interesting that after this, Morrison returned to the Astral Weeks project - somehow that seems a natural progression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Van Morrison Make a Bad Album?","review":"I believe not I love this disc I play it when I'm sitting in my pool and I just hear the sweet melody of \\"Celtic New Year\\" or \\"Stranded\\" this CD is great believe me I love every single track and it is a powerful CD! I just can't believe he doesn't sell alot of records expcept Moondance which sold 10 million world wide. But I'm angered in the fact that people don't find his music good! Or maybe they just never really heard of him well in my eyes this is just as good as any other Van Morrison CD ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Magic","review":"An excellent CD , in fact I'm listening to it now. His just like Greta is worth the price but most of the songs are great. An excellent purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranky is as Cranky does!","review":"Van has always had one of the best R&B and Soulful voices around,all the more unique since he is Irish!Celtic New Year is worth the price alone,but his takes on Sinatra and Como make Rod Stewart sound like a hack. My only complaint is that I really do not think Van has had such a hard time with the music business.He is certainly rewarded well and I think he just wants people to say \\" poor Mr. Morrison,the record companies sure treat him badly!! Greg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting For The Man","review":"I keep hoping very hard that the real Van Morrison will someday stand up again. I have been hoping for this for about the last 6 or 7 Van albums. As for Magic Time....well, where is the magic? I don't hear it or feel it coming from this recording either. I won't give up waiting though and even if Van never delivers the shivers again, I still have a vast treasure of older masterpeices to plug into. So for now, I will just keep my ears on the horizon searching and hoping for a possible full force gale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van not the \\"comeback man\\" and this ain't magic...","review":"I used to be the world's BIGGEST Van Morrision fan. That was in 1970s...and '80s...and even the early to mid '90s. But Van has lost \\"the magic\\", and this CD, bought in great anticipation after reading a number of good reviews elsewhere, is just another disappointment. The songs (with one or two exceptions) are all clunkers. The same tired, simplistic structure; weaknesses amplified by Van's late-life tendency to mostly shout his lyrics instead of sing them. Poor to simplistic arrangements (he hasn't had decent horns on a CD since the song \\"Russian Roulette\\" off \\"Days Like This\\") and lackluster musicianship make matters worse. I can't find a redeeming reason to purchase this CD and it pains me to say so, but Van has lost it and unlike peers Steve Winwood & Santana (amongst others), it doesn't appear any future redemption is in sight. In a word: AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't keep mediocrity at bay","review":"I'm one of those die hard Van fans and own 25+ of his cd's. I saw the good reviews on this one and bought it and was very disappointed. See the review by Michael A. Padilla to get the gist of my complaints. I just wanted to add another negative review to hopefully save other fans from making the mistake I did. Van is still one of the greatest and I expect more great music from him but except for Celtic New Year this cd wasn't it. My all time favorite Van cd is \\"A Night in San Francisco\\" which is a phenomenal live album.I'm changing my review after listening to the album for a while (actually there's only a few songs I listen to on it). I think this cd is one of those enigmas that Van comes out with: Celtic New Year is one his most listenable songs ever and Stranded, Gypsy in My Soul and Just Like Greta are enjoyable but some of the others are just horrible. Amazon let's you edit your review but it doesn't let you change the # of stars otherwise I'd make this a 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"I heard all the tracks from this CD only partially, at a music store listening booth. What was apparent to me is that Van, like so many other legends from his time, seems to have lost his edge. Instead of buying this CD, I decided to spend the money on some of his old classics that I needed to round out my collection.Maybe other die-hard VM fans will find this effort worthwhile. I found it disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great","review":"Celtic New Year is as good a song as Van has written or recorded in a long time - he's been playing it Live in an extended form for the last few years. The whole album works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Scenes","review":"Gregory Peck is solid as usual as a British Naval captain who mixes it up with the Spanish and French, wins the love of a beautiful lady, and earns the respect of his crew through both his leadership at sea and his strength of character. Virginia Mayo is the beautiful lady he falls in love with. The action sequences as ships battle it out are exciting and very well filmed, which is to be expected in a film directed by Raoul Walsh. The sight of the great boats attacking and manoeuvering around is a highlight of the film. The rest of the film moves along well, although for me, it's the fighting and action that make this picture memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Hornblower motion picture","review":"This motion picture is based on material from the first three novels written about Captain Horatio Hornblower, but mostly from the first novel, \\"Beat to Quarters,\\" with some material extracted from the second and third novels with some changes for purposes of the motion picture, e.g., Bush does not lose his leg in the motion picture, and the French squadron is attacked while it is at anchor. The author later added novels to cover Hornblower's early career and later exploits, and C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a \\"biography\\" of the fictional character.The motion picture itself is of blazing guns in the days of sailing navies, with a love interest taken from the novels. It tends to stick true to the original character.I never really liked the more recent Hornblower films, made for TV, which made significant changes to the character and story lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great film!","review":"This is a great adventurous and romantic film. The lovely Virginia Mayo is in it, and also Gregory Peck. They make a nice couple. It has action, romance, adventure.

For Mr. H fans, it is a wonderful additions to the A & E series. This is a story about a mature Horatio, with a lovely romantic twist - with lots of action. It is a fun movie, full of wit and humor. Buy it!."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Sea Tale","review":"A good adaptation of a Forester novel. Not surprising considering he wrote the screenplay. Peck & Mayo's non-British perfomance is a little jarring, but if you can get past it (not hard for a yank like me), the movie works very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent me the wrong DVD!","review":"This company sent me the 1950's Three Musketeers movie in the Hornblower sleeve. Tried to contact them twice and never heard back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie.....terrible order fulfillment !","review":"Just how hard is it to put the right movie into the DVD case? My husband and I caught 1/2 of this movie on cable TV, and decided to order it from Amazon. It came quickly and the price was reasonable, but when we opened the DVD case to watch the movie, the disk was clearly labeled The Three Musketeers! Needless to say, we were very disappointed. Now let's see how difficult it is to get an exchange. Amazon is generally excellent in their order fulfillment....they failed us in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent, thrilling, and very durable adventure film.","review":"In the wake of A&E's recent excellent early Hornblower adaptations, it's gratifying to see how well this movie holds up. Besides the surprisingly accurate treatment of the period, the characters are as vivid as the events of the story. The centerpiece of the film, however, is Peck. You forget his lack of British accent in the face of a flawless and powerful performance that perfectly brings to life Forester's hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"Gregory Peck is an excellent Horatio Hornblower. The sets are excellent, the sea-battles are very exciting, and the acting, despite the sparcity of British accents and nuance, is also excellent. The only discord is the 'Hispanic' dictator and his (very badly made-up Anglo) followers. The dictator comes off as an absurd cross between an original series Star Trek Klingon and Jon Lovitz in \\"Mom And Dad Save the World\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower","review":"I first saw this film with my grand parents when I was only some 8 years old. I didn't really understand it then (50+ years ago) but the memories came flooding back.It has a great story to tell and is brilliantly acted and directed. I recommend it to anyone that likes a little excitement, a good plot, good acting and none of the now required \\"sex\\". Excellent family viewing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Horatio Hornblower RN","review":"Typical Hollywood swashbuckling stuff and sticks to the spirit of the three books by C S Forester. Some changes are made especially within \\"The Happy Return\\" element where in the book Hornblower resides in France for several months with Bush and Brown (Quist in the film) but this is changed in the film for a much quicker escape.Some (again typical) Hollywood errors. In the film they refers to both the Larboard and Port side of the ship but \\"Port\\" was substituted for \\"Larboard\\" in 1844 to avoid confusion. Also Hornblower refers to Lady Barbara's brother as the Duke of Wellington. At the time this title had not been confered on him.These small things apart, the film is good old-fashioned entertainment. The special effects are good for the time, but pale when compared to modern day SFX as in \\"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half of a Great Film","review":"The movie's screenplay consists of two separate stories. The problem is that the first story is so entertaining, in the cat-and-mouse theme, that the second story is bland by comparison. Otherwise, the acting and production values throughout make this very enjoyable light fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure and Romance on the High Seas","review":"This is my favorite movie. Romance, sward fights, smart compassionate captain leading his crew, canon fire, jealousy, faithfulness, tall ships, loss, gain, all on the high seas and dry land, and the fortress on the hill. Gregory Peck and, oh yes, a beautiful leading lady. This has been my number one awaited DVD since DVDs were invented. Finally it's almost here. They don't make movies this good any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best seagoning action drama","review":"I have loved this movie as one of my favorite seafaring action dramas ever. The sea battle action sequences are great because it is all before CGI so it had to be fully built and done. It is not like many of today's films that are so phony it gets boring. The acting is great and I just hope this one also gets a Blu-Ray conversion to really clean it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"If you follow the books, this follows the story of \\"Beat to Quarters\\" and is played perfectly by Gregory Peck.

Gregory Peck was stalwart as the Captain, he managed to deliver a very believable (and likable) performance. The only thing that slowed this movie was the intrusion of a careless \\"romance\\" that really wasn't more than begrudging admiration (it took 2 deaths before they could act on it in any regard). Loved the battle sequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Battle scenes","review":"A bit sappy plot so as to highlight Virginia Mayo, but I found the battle scenes very realistic. Peck is quite believeable in his role.

However, this is real important, if you don't live alone or expect to have other members play Castaway on the Wii, do not get this version. There is only 1 saved game allowed to be running at a time. Why EA was unable to program it where other save positions were allowed is beyond me. But I could not find away around this.

Sims 2 Castaway is a good game until you acctually start playing it a lot. You have to keep all of your Sim's stats up AND make friends.

In one version, I took only one charcter and in the other I took the 6 character max.Unfortunately, after those two games, the second of which I totally maxed about everything a built top-line everything, I have little interest in playing a third time.Even so, I spent a good 10-15 hours on this game, quite good for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Book on Injury Prevention and Public Health","review":"This is the definitive book on the public health approach to injury prevention.

Christoffel and Gallagher provide a detailed, practical approach to the identification and prioritization of problems; implementation of interventions; and assessment of success.

There is nothing \\"unofficial\\" about the information it contains. The hotel descriptions are very standard guidebook material - lots of facts, but not enough of a description to give you a feel of the properties. I have stayed at several of the properties listed in this book and they could have easily included some information that IMHO would have been crucial to your enjoyment. Also, very little information is provided on things to do on each island outside of the usual tourist attractions. Maybe I am being too harsh. After all, Frommers and Fodors aren't any better, but since this book is touting itself as the \\"unofficial guide\\", I feel that it's a bit of false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"Last year I went to Disney and bought the Unoffical Guide to Disney and it was the best thing I could have ever done. After reading it I said hands down this will be the guidebook I will always buy. The Hawaii book was just terrible. I feel I was still as stumped as I was before I started the book. I would one million percent recommend the Disney book but I would stay away from this book. Buy a book that is dedicated to one island, even if you have to buy 2 or 3 it will be worth it because if you buy this book you will have to buy more books afterward anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read Unofficial Guides series before (e.g. Disney) and loved them...so I was disappointed when I got this one and it was not good at all. It is poorly organized for one thing. Instead of separating the sections by island, it has everything together. For example, if you want to find a good restaurant in Kauai, you have to look at the entire restaurant section and try to find ones that are in Kauai. The other books I'v read have a Kauai section and then you just turn to the restaurant portion of that section. Unless you are going to visit all the islands of Hawaii on your trip, then you are going to waste a lot of time reading stuff that doesn't apply to your trip.

My first went out, apparently due to a power surge in an electrical storm. The gift had a longer life but has also ceased to function corectly after about 30 months. This new model is cheaper, and adds the weather icon to the projected information. Both versions are tricky to set, and unless you live in the Pacific time zone, must be re-set if the power is interrupted-which isn't too easy.Apart from the relatively short product lives of my previous version and the same model given as a gift, and some muttering with setting and resetting.

It really works well on pans and stuck on food on plates."},{"rating":"1","title":"soap leaks out","review":"I bought one of these and the soap leaked out of the push button within a day or two. Bought another and the same thing happened. Serious design flaws in this model. Do not waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS Constantly","review":"From the moment I got it, this item has leaked large amounts of dish soap, sometimes up to half its contents all over my sink. I have tried storing it in every possible position and this still occurs. This is the second one I've tried with this problem. I've thrown it away and will never buy another. Awful mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue button is fine- but the handle broke","review":"We've had this since we moved 3 months ago. The handle broke where the cap screws on a few weeks in. I super glued it. It broke again. We've been adding dish soap bit by bit because it leaks from the handle. The sponges are great quality and I love the concept, but this design is flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS TERRIBLE","review":"My husband brought one of these home and said that he liked it better since it had a scrub brush and not just a sponge. The first one we had within the top knob designed for controlling the amount of soap you use came off. I had to dig it out of my garbage disposal.....enough said. I was convince that it had to be a defect in that dishwand, WRONG, I bought another one and within one day it fell off. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS TERRIBLE!!! I hope this review saves someone the aggrevation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scotch Brite Dishwand not worth it","review":"I used one for almost a year with no problems, but when I moved and bought a new one, the stupid blue button got pushed in immediately and I couldn't get it out, so I bought another one. First time using it I noticed a slit right in the blue button that opened when I pushed on it.They always leaked, but I dealt with it. The blue botton is the worst idea yet. I give up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design; Leaks Soap","review":"I bought this item and it worked well for a few days; however, it started to leak excessive amounts of soap out from where the blue pump button is. I thought maybe I had a defective item so I bought another one. After a week, same thing. I don't even understand why the button is necessary. Enough soap enters the sponge without ever pressing it! I think the company probably added this as an afterthought to compete with the OXO brand version which has a button pump (I've never tried that one).This item would be 5 stars if it did not have the button. With it, it is a flawed design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design and Poorly Made","review":"I bought one of these from a store (not Amazon) and like others have reported, the button pump leaked from the beginning and wastes soap. It's more of a marketing gimmick than a good idea. When you use the pump too much soap goes into the sponge and wastes more soap; enough soap goes into the sponge without using the pump. Soap also leaks from the cap. Shortly after realizing these leak issues, I would only fill the wand with enough soap to cover the valve above the sponge, way below the cap and pump button, and stand it up on the sponge with the handle pointing up. This worked well, but less than a year later the handle cracked open at the cap and water leaked in when washing dishes. I had a cheaper wand made by a company not as big as 3M that worked for years before it cracked. 3M usually makes excellent products. It's hard to believe they'd release a product like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money - New Design 3/6/10","review":"This product has been redesigned with a button to pump, to release soap...MISTAKE. It leaks and wastes your soap. We tried to super-glue it, and it didn't work, bought another one, AND IT STUNK. The previous reviews were all written, prior to the new design. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I went to the store to see if they were still selling them, and they have been removed. I wonder if scotch-brite is recalling them. I can't imagine they tested these first. I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"get model 650-12 with white button","review":"I got the model 550-12 with the blue button and it leaked right away. after numerous back and forths with 3M, I now have the 650-12 model with a white button that doesn't leak at all.

I thought Scotch-Brite was a good name and they had the green scrubber on the sponge. Within 2 weeks, the \\"button\\" that lets you squirt more soap on started falling out. Plus, the screw cap leaked dishwasher soap in my holder, so there was always soap running down the handle. The button finally gave up the ghost, wouldn't stay in the hole, so the wand would no longer even poorly hold soap. Threw it in the garbage and took back the extra sponges. Pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product has changed","review":"I used to love the dishwand by scotch brite but what is pictured and what you may have gotten in the past is not what you will get now. The overall shape of the product has changed...now it's shorter and stubbier and holds less detergent. The plastic cap and button is now white. Most importantly, the button seems to be made of a harder and less flexible plastic. I'm not confident that it has the same quality of construction that the dishwant that I had grown to love had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money it sucks","review":"Just to reiterate the other reviews, the button leaks and won't stay in. Worthless. I found a buttonless one, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky rubbish","review":"Button does not seal properly and leaks soap all over the counter. Stay away from this model.

I'm enjoying this so much that I'm going to buy the first two volumes in the series. David Byrne is oft neglected in mainstream music, yet he is regularly producing excellent works either from his solo albums or by gathering the works of others like this and bringing it to the people of the rest of the world.

The book is constantly overgeneralizing and making blanket statements about cultural groups. The focus is not on assessment appropriate for the individual, but assessment based on over generalized cultural assumptions. The book holds the basic idea that if you are white you are racist and have no cultural understanding. It also lumps varying ethnic groups together as if they are all the same. (For example, in the book, all Asian cultures are the same and summed up in one small chapter. There is also a Hispanic chapter that is meant to include all South American countries, Mexico, Spain, Puerto Rico, etc. as if all these countries have the same culture.) I found that all this book did was focus on differences and worked to divide cultural groups more than they are already divided. If you buy this book you are wasting your money.

Yes, the blade is firm but I believe it is made for flat surfaces, i.e. glass or marble (as we have) -- if you have pebbled glass it might not do as well. But we love it because it clears the glass beautifully and, because shower squeegees stay wet awhile, the Ettore is made of all plastic. The others (metal parts) that we tried rust quickly. So, if you have flat surfaces as we do, you may just love the Ettore 14100 Shower Squeegee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality product","review":"I bought this to replace a pentair 300 because the pentair was getting very difficult to open, even with proper lubrication. It took years for the pentair to get that way, but it looks like the design of the Hayward may be better in that area.One word of caution, I thought I could just use the existing plastic tubes from the pentair, but they were a different size.

When we moved to our new home, the pool didn't have one. I knew I wanted one. This keeps the chlorine levels nice and steady. I check the balance of the water maybe twice a week, and put more chlorinating tablets in the feeder once a week or two weeks. Once you get the correct setting for your pool, it's very easy to keep the balance of your water. However, if your free chlorine drops, don't just open this up and let more chlorine in - it uses stablized chlorine. Your results will be better if you add liquid shock right to the pool and keep your chlorinator set the same. This is a great device - wouldn't do without it.I rated it four stars instead of five because the check valve leaked upon assembly, then it snapped. A quick trip to the pool supply store and an addition $20 fixed it. Unfortunately, you have to buy all the pieces in a kit - you can't just buy the one check valve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Top is super hard to remove after about a year, and you have to crank it down mega hard to stop it from leaking.

What I also liked was how it didn't get to discriptive, it let u accually think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Gives Me Fever","review":"Though recorded for an indy label in the damp north of England, Anna Domino's self-titled full length feels like the soundtrack to a summer holiday on the Mediterranean coast of France. It's really a fusion, combining the snap-your-fingers coolness of cocktail jazz with relaxing, after-party synthetics and electronic beats. As a vocalist, Domino shows a lot of finesse. She lacks the range and richness of a singer like Tracey Thorn, but this gives her voice a chic, listless appeal. Had she been born thirty years earlier, Domino would undoubtedly have been an infamous lounge chanteuse.A few of the overproduced tracks on this album do skirt dangerously close to the adult contemporary genre, but most of the music feels just right. And as you would expect, LTM does their usual first-class job with the liner notes and bonus tracks.

Kind of like a taco! The mobile toys are too low as my baby is always trying to reach up to them where as w/ another swing I have he just looks and enjoys. It's very difficult to adjust the seat positioning and my mom (who has this swing) has to turn the entire swing upside down to do it.

It looked okay after we set it up. However we noticed some immediate drawbacks. First, the Fisher-Price labels are upside down on the seatbelt-not a dealkiller but not what you would expect for a product in this price range. Also the legs were mislabelled in the instructions. The left leg has the plug but in the instructions it says the right leg has it.The most important drawback is the 7 minute limit on movement, music and the light globe. After 7 minutes they all turn off automatically-even if you have it plugged in. What a boneheaded move! Usually as our child falls asleep the music stops and he wakes up immediately. Not sure what \\"clever\\" engineer placed a seven minute limit on entertainment for a child when the itme is plugged in.

And it seems like the more weight he gains the more creeks there are. Also! It sucks batteries like there's no tomorrow. I have to admit there is a lot going on for batteries. There's a fish mobile that spins, a light that changes colors (very cool) and your choice of noises that range from music to waves and it swings on top of that! One very cool feature is that all that extra stuff turns off by itself in about 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy swing operation","review":"I had to rate this swing as a 2, because the motorized swing mechanism made a clicking noise that was so loud. Before purchasing the unit in October 2005, I tried to operate the display model at Target, but the batteries were dead. The swing had a nice fit and finish once assembled at home, but after putting batteries into the swing and turning it on, my wife and I couldn't believe the racket that the swing made. Before purchasing this unit, make sure that you actually listen to one operate at the store before purchasing it. After returning the unit to Target, we tried a display model Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing at BABYSRUS and it made the same noise as the one we returned.We ended up purchasing a Graco swing at BABYSRUS and are happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"near perfect","review":"We just bought this swing today and already know it's was a great investment. Our 8 week old son is totally relaxed almost instantly in the comfortable seat. He focuses in on the mobile right away because of the motion and colors. He suffers from bouts of colic and the different rocking motions calm his tummy. The only reasons we can come up with as to why this swing is not perfect are the speed and the music. Our son was 4 weeks premature. We would have not been able to use it until now because the swing motion is a little too fast for a newborn yet alone a preemie. The music is a little too \\"high pitched\\" for our tastes. All in all, we recommend this swing to everyone as it has given our child peace and comfort in just one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute isn't everything","review":"I bought this swing because I loved the cradle and swing settings, not to mention the cutness factor was top notch. However, I was shortly disapointed. I used it once before my baby was born just for fun and it worked GREAT. Then when the baby came, we tried it again to have the motor start making LOUD noises. A month or so later it started not turning off. I would \\"turn it off\\" only for it to keep going. I would then have to pry off the battery compartment to pull out a battery for it to stop. Then it started ONLY playing the song no matter what I chose (water, rain, etc). Now it doesn't play any sounds and won't swing my son who is only 18lbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swings to fast for a smaller baby","review":"Well I must say ordering this swing online before testing was a mistake. I have a 6 pounder and it swings way to fast, even on the slowest setting. My son has even gotten sick on it when it swings. Overall, the swing is nice. The changing motion, the songs, and the swing itself is nice, its cozy which helps with the swaddle effect. I would recommend that if anybody is wanting to buy this swing, to go to a store and have them put batteries in the swing so you can see the quickness for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems from the begining","review":"I was so excited to buy this swing. It is beautiful and I thought relaxing for the baby. What I discovered is that it's not made very well. On two seperate occasions, I happened to catch a bolt that fell on the babies head and one out of the chair makeing it loose and tipping it over. It was put together well and redone several times so we know it wasn't our lack of skills. I also always had problems with it tipping over, the legs always came off the ground and it just would not stay steady even on the lowest number, it still rocked fast and came off the floor. The fish are pretty the music is nice, but I never felt safe leaving the baby in it even while standing near him. It was a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The only thing that I didn't like about this is having to change the batteries because I used it a lot. Why do swings not come with a plug in option. But the cradle action and two sitting positions have been a life saver for me. I have b/g twins and one of them seem to be always in it. They are now 7 mos old and I still use it when they are tired and they just need a little settling down b4 nap time. The lights and fish mobile is great also. I didn't use the regular swing option much since it faced the wall in my playroom when I did that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maddie's Mom","review":"This swing was a real life savior!! My daughter had colic and NOTHING and I mean NOTHING would calm her down other than this swing. She is two months old now and still loves her swing.She does not like her bouncy chair at all just her swing. I would highly recommend this swing because of the mobile, music, and lights it really keeps her interest.I have to say Fisher Price really knows what they are doing! My only regret is that I wish that I had bought two, one for the upstairs and one for the downstairs. She does not like the portable swing at all!It is rather fast for newborns. My husband actually ended up tying 8 lbs of weights to the bottom to slow it down a bit which worked very well. It did not harm the motor at all. We have since taken the weights off since she is 12 lbs now and the swing works like new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"My daughter is 2 months old. every time we go over to my in-laws i out her in the swing. She loves it. We will put her in it and she goes right to sleep. If I put her in it when she is fussy then it calms her down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This deserves 10 stars!","review":"There aren't too many items from Addy's newborn days that I would label as \\"must haves\\", but this is defintiely one of them! This is the best swing out there, we've tried a ton! Addison loved to watch the fish, listen to the music and when she got bored looking one way, we switched direction and she was happy again. She slept so well in this, and the best part for us was that the swinging motion never turned off like some of the others do. We also liked that there were a few different music options"},{"rating":"2","title":"If it were not for this swing I wouldn't get anything done","review":"I love this swing. My son only likes to nap when I hold him and if I put him in his crib he wakes up in 15 minutes. I have found that the way this seat cradles him keeps him asleep for hours!! Gives me time to shower and do chores while he sleeps. He also likes it when he is awake. He loves the light up globe at night. This swing gives hubby and I time to both eat dinner while it's hot.The motor does click a little bit when it's going but we don't even notice it and the baby doesn't seem to mind. I have noticed the click on other friends swings of different brands too so I don't think it's just a fisher price thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE FINALLY SLEEPS!","review":"The one thing I did not register for was a swing. After dealing with colic for weeks and trying everything from walking with her, sleeping on the floor with her, feeding and re-feeding, changing and the like every one I spoke to recommended a swing. I opted for the Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing because of the reviews from my girlfriends and all of the interactive do-dads. IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT PUTS HER TO SLEEP! There is a God and he works for Fisher-Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better swings out there..","review":"I really don't like this swing! Even after putting brand new batteries in the swing, it still takes forever for it to start swinging. We have to prime it by pushing it!! I hate that the mobile and music stop after a certain time because it has a tendency to wake my daughter up when it stops since she is lulled to sleep with the noise. Other then that I like that it has 2 swinging directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Motor on two seperate swings.","review":"This is a great swing. My daughter bought it for her first baby. The baby loved the music. Close to a month after getting, the music started dragging. She changed the batteries a couple of times, but this didn't help. Finally returned to the store and got another one. Got home, and the music and mobile did not work right from the beginning. Ended up getting a different swing. Evidently this was just a bad batch, but not good for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO FAST","review":"I bought this because a swing was essential when my little sister was a baby...however I was disappointed that the lowest speed setting is extremely fast for my son. He loves the bright colors and lights of the aquarium mobile, but the swing simply goes too fast to calm him down. Moreover, I don't feel that he's safe when the swing is turned on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great swing that breaks!","review":"We received this swing as a gift for our daughter a year and a half ago and she used it with great pleasure. I like the features of the swing although it is HUGE and takes up a great deal of space in the room. However, when we got it out again for our second child after being stored well for a year, it has broken within a month. The mobile (which both kids loved) broke and the Fisher Price people won't replace it since it has been over a year. We either have to spend $30 to replace it or buy a new one. Seems like a company as large as Fisher Price would stand up for their product for over a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!!!!!","review":"Used this swing for my first 2 boys. LOVED IT! They loved the fish, the lights and the music. Heck they both slept in it for the first 5-6 months! I'm now on my 3rd child and bought the Rainforest swing, it's ok not bad. Just miss the lights the Ocean one had."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic Swing - you must have this","review":"We call this the magic swing, because it is amazing. Our son loves it. We started using it when he was a few months old and he is 8 months now and still loves it. The batteries last amazingly long, I think I've only replaced them 3 times in 7 months of use. The aquarium is entertaining and it comes with a tray to attach toys to. When our son was really little, the swing would stop any fussing, allowing us to eat dinner or just have a rest, and it would help us put him to sleep when he was occasionally too fussy to sleep any other way. Now he just likes to play in it, using the tray it comes with. I recommend this to all of my friends. It is a must for any parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good swing, music broke after two weeks","review":"This is a good swing, I like the two different swinging modes, front to back and side to side. The only problem I had was that the music quit working after 2 weeks. I did not want to disassemble the whole thing and lug it back to the store and I did not want to ship it back to FP and wait for 3-6 weeks for a replacement. We didn't need the music anyway, so we just used the other features, my son is now 8 months old and is still under the weight limit and he enjoys the swing once in awhile, though now that he is mobile, he wants to be on the floor, crawling around. My son was quite fussy and the swing often helped to soothe him, a few nights he actually slept in it for 5 hours straight, if he took him out he woke up and cried and cried!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall swing","review":"We bought this swing 5 years ago when our daughter was an infant. She loved it and now we use it with our 3 month old son. It held up great in storage all those years. My only drawback is that it doesn't plug in like many of them do these days, but the batteries are cheaper than buying a new swing. Both kids absolutely adored watching the mobile overhead. We've been very pleased with this swing over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good swing with speed problems","review":"This is a very nice product, however, the speed levels are not working properly. Speed 1 starts slowly but then the speed increases. We have to constantly have to turn off/turn on the swing to make sure it slows down to a comfortable level. Also, it's a bit difficult to sit the baby in and take the baby out of the swing without hitting the aquarium water globe - it's too low."},{"rating":"1","title":"3-Point Harness Inadequate for a Swing!","review":"We used this swing until my daughter was about 6 months, because she couldn't pull herself up at all. But really, a swing should have a 5-point harness. It's crazy to me they would make one, like this one, with a 3-point harness that in any event is impossible to adequately tighten due to design. As soon as my daughter showed signs of enough strength to lift herself up, we were done with it. She did like it, though. But it needs a better restraint!The notion that you could use this until the child is 2, or even 25 pounds, is ludicrous. Without a 5-point harness, the child will try to climb out and may seriously injure him/herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service as well as Great Product-","review":"I actually purchased this item for my stepdaughter. She was having difficulty finding this locally. She has a daycare and needed it for her little one. I suggested to her to let me check your website. I ordered it and in only a few days she received it. She was very pleased with the swing - its quality and colors, not to mention the discounted price.Thanks so much. Sharon Minnich"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this swing, but...","review":"I received this swing as a gift on my baby registry. I love the swing and it's features, but am overall, very disappointed in it. We have had to have this swing replaced, and I am going today for the 3rd time. The first time, we used the swing for about 6 weeks and the mobile stopped working. A week later, the musical feature stopped working. Thankfully Babies R Us replaced it with the same swing. This second swing stopped working last week for the same reasons, after only about 2 months of use. For a product with such a great reputation and reviews, I find this very frustrating and disappointing. A big thanks to Babies R Us for once again agreeing to take this swing back. I am told that they return a lot of this swing for the same reason. Sadly, I think I'll stear clear of this item a third time. My daughter loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Ava Loves This!","review":"We are lucky that our daughter loves her swing. I've heard from many people that their children didn't care for their swings. Ava loves to swing in her Aquarium swing. She takes naps in it too if she isn't interested in laying stationary in her crib. This particular swing has to ways to swing, you have options! There are different speeds and sounds and your child will love it if being in a swing is for them. Great product, we own three other ocean wonders products and she loves all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a new mommy","review":"My older sister gave me a swing that she had used for her kids, it played music and had different speeds and such and I thought it would be really great. My kid hated it! The second he sat in this swing he fell right to sleep. He loves the cradle motion and the soft tunes. He can sit in it for up to two hours with out crying, in fact he gets really upset when we take him out before he lets us know hes ready to get up! You'll be saving your-self a lot of time if you just buy this swing in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing, not so reliable (and noisy) motor system","review":"We love this swing. I bought it for my son and was so glad, he was mesmerized the moment we put him in it. However, several weeks after we bought it, the motor started making loud noises and eventually didn't work at all to spin the mobile. We took it back thinking it was one in a thousand problem, and brought home a second swing and put it together. Within a month the second one had developed the same problem. Our son loved it anyway, so we kept the second one and he seems happy. But it was a bit disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life saver!!!","review":"we registered for the ocean wonders line mostly because i liked the way it looked. it was definately a great choice my daughter loves it we put her in it while we eat diner or while i take a shower and it is the only way she will keep quiet. she loves to watch the fish and lights while she swings. my only complaint is that the fish and lights are on a timer and when they go off she cries but it is definately worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alittle inconvenient, but we love it!","review":"It's all true... This swing IS a life saver and my daughter absolutely loves it! The only draw back is that it is hard to adjust the seat and the lap tray is not attached. You have to use both hands to open/close it and what do you do with it when you take the baby out-we lay it on the floor until next time. In spite of that, it is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This was a first baby gift for us and we used in frequently even now with our second baby. Its very adaptable with three different speeds (for different ages/stages), upright and laid back seating positions as well as three way turning. Yes, its battery operated but seems to get its money worth and in between my two children we loaned it to four different friends and its still in great condition (removable/washable cover). SO its a KEEPER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree a MUST have!","review":"If you want to spend money on something it is this swing! Baby just loves it and you will get every dime worth! They love the motion and the comfort of this swing! It is also a life savor when you need to get some stuff around the house done just move it into the room with you! Get it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than others","review":"Mobile is brighly colored-more appreciated by infants than some of the neutral toned swings.Long life when good batteries are used.Different settings to be used as weight increases. (Someone said that there was not a difference between settings. Not true! You increase the settings to keep up the speed as your baby gets heavier. If you use the highest setting with a 7 lb. baby, she'll turn into a milkshake!)Can light up- great to soothe at night.The mobile & seat are at correct angles so that the mobile can be enjoyed, unlike some other swings.I thought the $100 pricetag was totally nuts- but the entertainment for months & months has been worth every penny. One of my friends has a cheap swing with a stationary mobile- you will appreciate the difference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama's Favorite Toy","review":"I love the colors and all the options. Baby prefers the side-to-side rocking and it helps that the seat can tilt up when she wants to check out what's going on, or lean back when she's sleeping. I'm especially thankful for it now as she is going through her first cold and being able to sit at an angle has helped her still get a good night's sleep despite her congestion. The only drawback is that our's goes through a pack of batteries every month, but again, that figures when the swing, mobile, lights and music are all going. It's also light and easy to move. I often switch it from bedroom to livingroom. We love it, baby loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"sanity saver","review":"Got this swing after a disappointing trial with the \\"Rainforest\\" swing. Swings fast enough and is entertaining enough for our fussy boy. Music on it is decent (for a baby swing)and has volume control, cute design with gentle lights that catches his interest, can swing front to back or side to side. Only four stars because it doesn't plug in, the top doesn't swing up out of the way for putting baby in & out, and the seat is only one position (only reclined, can't sit-up). Small grievances for the ability to make a sandwich or go to the bathroom without a screaming baby in the background. Will recommend to my new mommy pals."},{"rating":"1","title":"too fast, and too short","review":"This swing is nice for babies aged 4 months, perhaps. My daughter at 7 months could grab the mobile, and she couldn't \\"fit\\" into it until maybe 2-3 months. It swings insanely fast (unless the batteries are weak), and the corners will actually will lift up off the ground at times. Now, at 8 months and 15.5 pounds, if I put my daughter in it, it moans and creaks like she is too heavy. The first swing I bought was LOUD, and I brought it back to the store, this one is better, but I think there are better ones, and worse ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful time saver","review":"I am an in home daycare provider. This is the 5th Fisher Price swing I have either purchased or it was given to me by a parent. They are wonderful. I use them for a bed for the newborns and they love the motion and sound. You can also move them where ever you are because they are so light. I have worn out three and am presently using two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great customer service!","review":"My daughter loves the swing, but what impressed me most was the excellent customer service...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome while you can!","review":"Well, we bought this swing and the crying stopped! WOW! The only problem is that it was short lived joy we experienced. Within a short period of time (a few months) our little girl no longer wanted to be in it. :( Maybe we bought it when she was too old already? (3 months) I am really not too sure. But when #2 comes along, I know what to use ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this swing!!!","review":"When our daughter was first born we put her in the swing and we felt that it went too fast for her since she weighed 7 lbs. When she was 2 months old we started using the swing since her weight slowed the swing down and now it is not as fast. Our daughter loves to watch the fish on the mobile and how the lights change color on the top as well. We gave it 4 stars because for a newborn we feel it goes to fast but other than that we love the swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"I absolutely LOVE this swing! And so does my son. The lights and mobile are mesmerizing to him. The design is just wonderful. It would be nice if the animals in the water globe moved around though. We have used it so much. He has taken so many naps in this swing. It's the best on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"Problems weren't with product itself, but with seller. Amazon and it's sub-sellers are so interwoven, I have no idea who I actually bought it from. Judging from the tape job on the box, product was more than likely another client's return, and nobody had taken time to ensure that all parts were included... which they were not. I'm way too busy to deal with the hassle of a return, and, forturnately, the missing parts were decorative (the dangling stuffed fish for the mobile), so we just made do by adding in some after-market ornamentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"We've used this with our daughter since she was born. She falls asleep in it all the time. It's a little fast for small babies so I just draped a bath towel over her lap and let it drag the ground until she was 6 wks old (>12 lbs). I changed the batteries for the first time when she turned 2 months old. It's not a space-saver but it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Another Swing !!!!","review":"I received this swing from a gift from my mother. She got this swing because all of the great reviews on this swing. In two weeks the motor stopped working. I returned it to the store (thank god I got the insurance). One week later the music stopped and then the motor again. I going to return the swing again to the store and find something else. The motor is loud (It's bad when you are trying to sleep). A lot of people said the swing is too fast however my baby enjoys it.If you decide to buy any swing buy the insurance with it. You might have a similar problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't give enough stars...","review":"everyone seems to have covered it all. this was the BEST BEST BEST gift given to us. I can't imagine where i would be today if i didn't have it. he spent so much time just relaxing in there it was amazing !!!!I can't give this item enough stars and a MUST for anyone with a new infant !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing","review":"Great product. Totally satisfied, the second one I have purchased. Great gift!! Love the bright colors and the two way swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy!","review":"My daughter loves this swing and we were able to use it from day one! At first, I did put her head support cushion in it from her car seat for a week or so to better support her little head. If you've read The Happiest Baby on the Block, you'll know that loud (in regards to the motor being too loud-which I don't really think it is) and that vigourous swinging (with good neck support) a happy baby makes! I wanted to buy the Futterby Swing because it's so cute, but bought this Aquarium Swing because of it's cradle and 2 way swinging options. Our daughter loves to look at the moving fish and really enjoys the ocean sounds and music on this swing. I would say that the ony drawbacks are (1) Having to replace the batteries about once a month and (2) You have to press the reset button about every 7 minutes to get the music and fish back on. So about every 7 minutes our daughter cries and mommy comes and presses the button again. Overall a great swing for a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"very engaging, even for a 7-week old","review":"My husband and I bought this for our nephew when he was 7 weeks old and he loves it! It was amazing to see him zero in and focus on the fish swirling about in the mobile and the bright happy colors of the fabric side panel. He was completely entranced!My brother and hubby said it was fairly easy to assemble, though none of these things is really easy. I think they got it done in about 20 minutes.It has a relatively large footprint. When using the swing in the back-to-front swing direction, the right leg tends to lift slightly off the floor (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but I don't think there's any way it could tip or be unstable. I haven't seen it used in the side-to-side cradle mode yet. I do think the large footprint adds to the stability.After seeing how much my nephew (and his parents) enjoy this swing, my husband and I changed our registry from the Papasan swing to this one. Less money and more features? Yeah, that's the way to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Colicky Baby","review":"My baby has severe gas and digestion problems. The Cradle Swing moves fast enough and with a long enough arc to assist her with her tummy issues. I also like it because of its removable tray. Our old baby swing didn't have the option of removing the tray and my daughter would constantly kick her legs and hit the tray. She loves the Cradle Swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs through batteries!","review":"The swing is cute with its design etc,...Takes up alot of floor room. This swing goes through D batteries every 2 weeks, gets expensive. I suggest getting a swing that will plug directly into a outlet. I found that the mobile on the swing to be a real pain, when you are getting the baby in and out. Bop the babies head on the mobile. Sold ours on craigslist and purchased a plug in swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Swing out there!","review":"Love this swing. My son is now 3.5 months and he loves his swing. We had it on the side by side setting when he came home from the NICU, but now when I put him in there like when I have to wash dishes or make lunch for my 2 pre-school aged children, he likes to swing front to back and he looks at the cartoon on the tv :) He's alos just started to notice the bright lil sea creatures up above and now we can turn them on and watch him move his head and eyes to follow them... So cute!Have not used the music setting or the lights yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver!!","review":"I have a collicky baby and this swing is a lifesaver. When my son is inconsolable I just put him in this and it usually calms him down and puts him to sleep. If I didn't have this swing there is no way I'd ever get my son out of my bed! This is the only place he'll sleep other than with me.There are however a couple of problems:1. It goes through batteries like no other. We use about 4 D batteries every 2 weeks. And batteries aren't cheap.2. The mobile and music turn off after only a few minutes and sometimes my son just wants to lie back and watch the fish go around. When it stops he starts crying.3. It is large and bulky so it takes up a lot of room and is hard to move around the house. There's no way we can take it with us when we go places and sometimes my son wants his swing when we are at grandpa's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing is a charm... motor not so charming!","review":"I have twin boys who just love their swings! I'm not sure who loves it more... Mom or boys?! The swing works in cradle motion (side to side) and front to back. Cradle is a preference here. The fish that rotate around the babies heads made no impact until they turned about 2 1/2 months old. They don't take their eyes off them!!! That's when we first began to notice the boys tracking and following objects. Soon after, the fish slowed down and eventually stopped rotating. After several crying fits of \\"why won't the fish move\\", I decided to call Fisher Price. They sent out two brand new motors two days later. They were easily replaceable and now I have two happy babies again!Fisher Price was very helpful and I will always consider that when purchasing their items. No questions asked... just model numbers and that was all. The ONLY reason I rated this swing 4 stars instead of 5 was because I had to make the call. Highly recommended item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing-from mom of twins","review":"This swing was one of the best gifts I got for my shower. I received 2 of them. My son loves the swing. My daughter didn't like to move at first and still isn't crazy about the motion but loves the mobile. It keeps the twins quiet for at least an hour to allow me to nap or get a load of laundry done. Now that they are getting bigger I will be sad when they outgrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn D Batteries!!!","review":"Like many others, I think that the swing is terrific. The biggest downfall is that it takes 4 Alkaline D Batteries & there is no AC/DC Adapter for the thing. Then there is the timer issue about the lights, mobile and noises. They time out about every 5-7 min. Fisher Price, you should have made an AC ADAPTER!!! I even went to far as to see if my husband could fiddle with the swing to make our own AC Adaptor, however he was afraid that it would blow the mechanics. Now I am on the search for a battery charger that will charge 4 D batteries all at once...wish me luck!Overall...I would have to say I like the swing, and hate Fisher Prices' dicision making abilities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing!!","review":"This is a great swing, and I do not regret getting it at all. My son loves it!! He loves looking up at the lights and the fish above him and reaching for the toy fish hanging over his head. It keeps him very entertained, and it gives him a little bit of change from going in one motion being that you can turn it to the side. It's very comfortable for him and has great padding and he goes right to sleep in this swing. The only drawback is the batteries. I have gone through more batteries then I thought I would. But its worth it for my sons comfort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Fisher-Price","review":"We love this swing. The side to side swinging is great for younger babies. My son and the baby I nanny for both nap in this swing every day. We did have a problem when the motor started acting funny after a couple months but we called Fisher-Price and they sent us a new top piece right away. I don't know what we'd do without this swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's Personal Disney Ride!","review":"This swing is the best! There is so much fun going on, it's like our baby has her own personal Disney ride at home! The music is great & she loves to stare at the fish & lights in the water filled globe. The seat is plush & comfortable with a colorful fish pattern. Seat cover washes nicely. She even falls asleep in it sometimes. It was pretty easy to put together-just follow the directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swing only lasted 9 months!","review":"This swing only lasted 9 months. The music would still play but the swing would not swing and my daughter is small for her age. She is 18 months old now and only weighs 20 lbs. You would do better to buy the Aquarium travel swing. We used it more than the big swing because our daughter preferred it. It has held up very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Costly","review":"My six month old loved this swing. We thought it was great but then we realized that the swing was going through 4 d batteries a week. We have only had the swing for 5 1/2 months and to top it all off the motor went out. My review is based on our swing. I was just disappointed about the motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it Zero if it was allowed.","review":"This swing is very cute, and the cradle motion is great. However, The mobile seriously stopped working after only a day. The swing tilted and the speeds were never very fast. My son only used it for about two months. He loved it, However, I never felt safe leaving him in it without watching him. However, if Fisher Price would recall it temporarily to fix the problems it has the potential to be an excellent swing. Although currently its not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I've been using this swing for 2 months now. At first I liked it. But as my child gets older [almost 3mos] I am liking it less and less. The bar behind the head makes it more likely that you will bang their head puting them in and out of the swing. Also, I have never seen the difference between all the speeds and after changing batteries twice in the last month, the swing barely moves no mater what speed it is set to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aqua swing saved my life","review":"My mother-in-law bought this for my daughter and she absolutly loves it! My daughter is 2 months old and has colic. The only way to soothe her was to rock her in either mine or my husbands arms. As you can imagine you can't get much done around the house with a baby in your arms. But now, i swaddle her in a blanket and put her in the swing and she will sit in it for hours!! The mobile is very entertaiing and the light inside changes colors. At night i'll put her in it when she is fussy and all the action really distracts her. Watching her swing back and forth and listening to the waves even lulls me to sleep!!! It's pretty good on batteries too! I use it about 6 hours a day at least! I go through about a 4 pack of D batteries every 2-3 weeks. This swing is perfect for anybody who has a colicy baby"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SWING STINKS!!!!","review":"I bought this swing for my first son and this swing was loud and rocked too hard. Well, 1 yr. later the motor burnt out and fisher price sent me a new one-very nice of them too. :-), but this swing requrires so many batteries. When will they learn to make a plug in swing? That would be smart. I give it one star, cuz both of my boys liked to sleep in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappionted!!","review":"This swing is not worth the money. It is quiet and I like what it does but.... my baby is only 7 weeks old and we got it 1 month ago when she was 3 weeks and we are on the 3rd set of batteries already. The music quit working after 1 week. And the mobile works only when it wants to. We had a fisher price cradle swing bought at toys-r-us for our boys. With our first child I only had to change the battries 2 times in a year. Yes I used it for him when he was 14 months old it worked great. But this swing I was not happy with at all. But the swing does still swing. But it eats battries like there is no tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty from the beginning","review":"This swing didn't work properly from day one, the mobile broke first. It made a horrible grinding noise. We should've taken it back. We just kept the mobile off, then a few months later the music and lights started messing up. The switch on top has a short circuit or something. Now, it won't swing and play music at the same time. For $100 I thought it would be the best. Iwas very wrong. Maybe, the newer model has improved but I'd be weary."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT WHILE IT LASTED","review":"MY SON LOVED THIS SWING AND SO DID I, I COULD LET HIM SWING EVERY MORNING WHILE I CLEANED THE HOUSE WELL THATS OVER MY SON WILL BE 4 MONTHES SOON AND THE SWING MOTOR JUST STOPPED WORKING IT LASTED ONLY ALMOST 4 MONTHS GOOD THING I BOUGHT THE OCEAN WONDERS TAKE ALONG SWING ALSO HE NEVER LIKED IT AS MUCH AS HIS BIG SWING BUT IT IS SAVING THE DAY FOR ME,SO THE BIG ONE IS IN THE GARBAGE AND MY SON IS USING THE SMALLER VERTION I LOVED THIS SWING MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS IT WAS A BATTERY EATER AND IT DIED AFTER 4 MONTHS ONLY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to all reviews","review":"We purchased this item fully knowing all of the problems we could encounter. Our baby at three months old was 16lbs, he has just turned 4 months and is almost 19 lbs, yet this product's swing on the lowest setting is so fast we can not turn it above the first setting and we have to slow it down by adding heavy blankets to it. When our son came home from the hospital at 7lbs 10 oz, it almost catapulted him across the room. I am so glad it has a waist harness. After 3 months of use the fish no longer rotate. We have changed out the batteries per the instructions and they still do not work. I am going to contact fisher price and see what they can do for us. So we have a reckless swing that does not function correctly. Otherwise the concept is nice and we use it as a great place for our son to nap on a still setting while we are doing housework in the room with him. Hmmm, should have just stuck with my bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Piece of junk. Very noisy. Leg lifts off the ground when rocking. All six speeds are exactly the same speed. Poor quality. It's going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do they make this swing for adults!?!","review":"I love, love, love this swing! We registered for the regular kind of swing and wish we had gotten this one from the get go. It's great! Cushy, quiet, nice music, dancing fish....it even has water and rain noise if music is too stimulating. I love that we can opt to swing him sideways instead of the usual forward/backward. I'm going to hate giving the swing up whe my son out grows it. It's been a life saver. If he 's crying or fussy he stops the minute we put him in it.Well worth the money. One draw back: the width of the legs. Going thru doorways is a problem but we deal with it. I guess to be stable for swinging like a cradle it needs a wide stance."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I have recently purchased this item. I have not yet had the baby, but my brother and sister-in-law just had a little girl. We have put her in it and to our surprise she loved it. She slept in it for at least 3 to 4 hours with no whines or cries. I think this purchase is going to be a very good thing for me when I have my baby. I highly recommend it to all of you. One little problem the music does shut off after one tune is played this has to be my biggest down fall about it. If your a patient parent it won't be a problem to push reset.

I am very happy with this item and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FYI","review":"This item is $12.75 cheaper if you buy it online from wal-mart. The shipping and handling is cheaper too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good swing...","review":"I put my baby in this from the start. It does go rather fast though, so I would sit and slow it down by hand. She looked lost in it at first (she was 5 lbs. at birth) but she grew into it. For some reason, my baby is really attracted to fish (will lay and look at Finding Nemo), so the theme is great. She is four months now and seems to be frustrated at times that she cannot reach up and get the fish. And she seems to want to sit upright, so end up taking her out. I will say that it will eat up batteries. I am on my 3rd set. I also find that it is a bit larger than the older type swings. I love it though, and even though she seems to want to get up and go, it does put her to sleep when all else fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing","review":"My husband and I got this swing for my son and right away he loved it! It was very easy to put together. Our son will sit in it and watch the fish go round and round and also watch as the globe lights up. The music is also cute. The option to choices the way it swings is also a great. I would buy this for my friends. The only set back to this is it can go thought battiers. BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They'll love it","review":"We have two girls (18 months and 7 months) and both girls loved this swing. My 18 month old spent a few nights in here when she was first born and after that enjoyed it all throughout the day. my 7 month old was Colicky, and this was the ONLY place she slept for the first two months. I would definitely recommend this swing. Wait until you notice that they have found the fishies going around in circles. It's amazing and very rewarding as a parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ocean wonders aquarium cradle swing","review":"Originally my husband and I were not going to purchase a swing because our place is really small. However, when our little one came, she was a real fuss and could not be put down and wanted to be carried all the time. So we gave in to the swing. Purchased this one and our baby loves it! She even fell asleep in it! We absolutely love the music and the globe. Our baby is quite entertained by the globe. Not to mention all those other sound settings that came with it. We love the fact that the swing can move side to side and front to back. We don't regret buying this swing because it has helped us quite a bit. I put her in it when I need my hands free to cook dinner or even wash the dishes. I recommend this swing to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing, but they need to fix the motor defect!","review":"We started using this swing immediately after my daughter was born. It was a little too fast for her at first but she just loved looking at the fish and it always seemed to soothe her. If it had continued to work as great as it did when we first bought it, I would have given it 5 stars. However, after just a couple months we had to start replacing the batteries every couple weeks. The music sounded like it was dying and you would have to physically push the swing to get it going. I finally called Fisher Price and they were great about it. I guess mine has a defective motor. I will say that my mom and sister both bought the same one for their houses and have never had problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful soother","review":"I also purchased the Ocean Wonders Bouncer. The bouncer got more use because my baby outgrew the cradle swing (weight) but the cradle swing was a great soother. Only thing I would make a negative comment upon were the controls for how fast the thing swings. Seems the slowest, I found to be rather fast. My baby loved watching the lights and little sea animals spin around over head. It is rather heavy and would not be easily moved from room to room. I would probably advise to choose the bouncer over the swing if you were looking for the most use and function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver!","review":"I am not sure my son would sleep without this swing. He loves it. The movement was too fast when he was smaller, but I just pushed it manually then. As he gains weight I can now increase the setting to move faster. My only complaint is that with the mobile and overhead aquarium it is difficult to get him in and out without bumping his head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing!!","review":"This swing is great!! It does great on batteries with us using it every day. My daughter is now 2 1/2 months and still falls asleep in it. I don't use the other sounds a lot, I just use the music and my daughter loves it! Especially the light and the colorful fish circling around her. For the lady that said that it squeaks, its just because you have to pull out the legs of the swing as far as possible first, then it won't squeak anymore. As for those who say you can't take it anywhere. Of course you can't!! It's not supposed to be travel friendly, thats why they made a travel swing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the investment","review":"We bought this swing just after our son was born. He didn't like it in the begining, and was crying every time we tried to put him in.He started liking it when he was 2.5 months old. Only now, that he is 3 months old he actually looks at the fish that are at an awkward angle for a newborn.All in all we are now happy we bought this swing, but for us it worked only after 2.5 months. the batteries last a long time,we use it almost everyday for about 20 minutes and have not had to change them yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing!","review":"Nothing wrong with it, good design, kid loves it. I just wish it had an optional power cord so we don't buy so many batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten stars plus more...","review":"I read about a hundred reviews for this swing months ago when I was 2 months pregnant and it was the first toy I bought for my baby who is now 8 weeks old. This swing is like pure magic. Period. Our batteries are still hanging in there, too but I know I'd better run out and get some as the music is starting to sound warbly. Fisher Price has hit the ball out of the park... they truly know what babies love and parents and other caregivers need. The swing is a Godsend. If it is the only toy you buy for your little one, you will be doing a smart thing. Very portable, cleanable and cute, too! Maybe I'll upload a photo of a happy happy girl in her wonderful Wonders swing! Buy it. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old model was golden, new model....not so much","review":"I purchased this swing 5 years ago for my first son. It has lasted (with 3 head replacments) through three children. Now on my third child I needed a new head again. So I called the company (who is always so gracious and usually sends them free) to get a new one, but they said the reconfigured the motor head and would send me out the new one for $25. A small price to pay for a happy baby. However, the new head (has aqua colors instead of blue) was VERY poorly made. There seems to be no insulation from the noise of the motor. And it makes a terrible squeaking sound where it fits on the polls. The old motor head had great insulation and you barely ever heard the motor, unless it got back swing and slowed down from a blanket or something. I have had to put up with the sound, as has my baby, because they don't make the old head anymore and I sorely miss it. All in all, not a bad swing, but beware when buying one that they sound very loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifesaver!","review":"This swing is fabulous! It was a lifesaver for us! My baby had reflux and had to be upright most of the time. he hated swinging front and back...My mom bought this swing for my sister and I used it on our visit to her house. When we got home my son cried and cried. We went out and bought this swing and when he heard the clicking of the motor as we put it together he was quiet. He knew what was in store for him! After that, he seemed to live in that swing! He slept in the swing until he was 6 months old b/c he couldn't sleep lying down in his crib. I love this swing! My son loved this swing! I know you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver!","review":"This swing was the best investment! It was a little pricey, but my son absolutely loves it. He will stay awake in it and let me get things done for hours. Also great for naptime. He loves the mobile and lights. The music is a little annoying, but I enjoy the water sounds. It does take up some space, but it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not live without it but...","review":"This is a great swing- and a swing is a must-have item for any mother. I promise you won't be sorry. This swing in particular kept my son happy for 7 months. He started in it at birth, (remember to lower the seat to protect their neck) and he used it until this week- almost 7 months. He stopped using it because he was so tall, he could grab the fish on the mobile and grab the legs on the swing- yeah, not safe. The main drawbacks for this item were listed very clearly in the review before mine, however I will mention my points anyway. 1st, it was noisy, it needed WD40 after only a couple months, and it eats up a lot of battery. It is a tad unstable and you have to kick the legs out every so often to make it perform better. However, there are so many more pros, I won't name them all. It is just a safe, fun, must-have item for any baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish we had bought this swing sooner!","review":"I absolutely love this swing! We bought this when my son was about 6 weeks old. He always needed to be held, or be in constant motion, so we purchased this swing to help us out when we need to put him down for a little while. It was so helpful in the middle of the night, when I was the only one up with my baby, dead tired, my baby was awake, and I needed to use the bathroom! It was the only thing other than my arms, that he was happy in! This swing offers so much more than other swings, for the same price! I love the music, and the other soothing sounds. The ONLY negative thing that I can say about this swing, is that after about 6 months the motor on the mobile quit working. But he does love the little toys attached to the tray. I still give this swing 5 stars, and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The BEST Swing Out there!","review":"This swing is worth every penny, and it's so much more than a swing. It's a safe place to put baby whenever your arms get too tired, and my baby just loves sitting in it without even swinging. I've used it since he was 1 week old, and he was already captivated by the fishies hanging from above. The chair reclines way back and has tons of padding so you never have to worry about baby's precious head flopping around. It's great for naptime, playtime, fussy time, and so mommy can eat at dinner time! None of the Graco Swings could offer half of what this swing does! I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby loved it while it worked","review":"The two swinging motions are great. My baby loved the side to side. She didn't seem to interested with the lights and water globe though. This swing broke after about 1 month of light to moderate use. It just stopped swinging. New batteries did not fix the problem. I returned it, under Babies r Us great return policy, and purchased the Nature's Touch Baby Papasan Cradle Swing. So far so good with the new swing. It has much better sounds, a mirror instead of a water globe, and the seat has at least 2 times as much padding, probably more. Check out both before purchasing. The Nature's Touch is about $30 more. If it lasts it will definately be worth it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aquarium Cradle Swing Review","review":"Absolutely love this cradle swing!! It helped us have more than a few sane nights. Two things that I wanted to point out; first: the swing never turned to the left just to the center and right. Second, just last week the spinning fish stopped working. We just purchased this swing in August. Even with these two things, I would highly suggest this swing. Our daughter loves this swing and loves to play in it!! The convenience of folding up is great for travel to relatives homes also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great swing until baby gets too heavy...","review":"This swing is great because different babies prefer different swinging directions -- and some like both! The music is very soothing and peaceful, as are the nature sounds, and the volume control is great. Unlike many other Fisher Price products that only have two settings (too quiet and too loud), this product has a dial so you can set it at exactly the volume you like.When my daughter was very small, she would sleep in this swing, and now at 5 months, she likes to play with the toys on the tray and watch the fish mobile above. (No chance of her sleeping in it now when there is so much to look at!) The only downside I've found so far is that the heavier she gets, the slower the swing goes, and even on the highest speed it's extremely slow now (even with brand new batteries). She's only 15 pounds and the swing is supposed to go up to 25 pounds (I think) so by then, it probably won't even budge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Swing!!!","review":"I looked at a number of different swings before my son was born and thought that some others had some cute novelties but this one is by far the best out there. My son loved the colors and the bright and engaging fish. We honestly had to pry him out of it on numerous occasions. The only thing I had an issue with is that some swings on the market have the ability to move the mobile out of the way so you can remove your child safely. This swing doesn't have that and my husband did bump the baby once or twice when getting him in and out. So if you don't mind being careful(which you should be anyways) this swing is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Swing! Trick to swinging too fast.","review":"We loved this swing and so did our daughter. It is nice to have the rotating swing. Our daughter loved the side-to-side motion. When she weighed less we had a problem with it swinging too fast but there is a TRICK... (it mentions it in the manual) you put a light weight blanket under baby and let it barely drag the floor. It works!!! I wouldn't use a heavy blanket or let it bunch up on the floor because it could be hard on the motor.It's easy to fold up and set aside when not in use.The motor is a little loud but baby will get use to it. Our daughter, like some babies, like continous noise when she sleeps anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"swinging options","review":"The only thing that I do not like about this product is that it only turns one way from cradle to swing. I previoulsy owned the original fisher price cradle swing and it was able to turn both to the left and right side to swing and I had expected to be able to do so with this one. Other than this I must say that both my infant and myself are pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing!","review":"My daughter has used this swing since birth and she loves it! She is 12 weeks old now and loves to watch the fish mobile spinning above. She uses her eyes to track them well!My only complaint is that the additional features (mobile, light, music) only play for 7 minutes before they turn off automatically! This can be very frustrating when you are trying to wash dishes or fix dinner and you have to wash/dry hands to go over and restart these features! I don't know why Fisher Price didn't put an adjustable timer for these features! But, now that the batteries are starting to wear out (it has taken 3 months for this to happen!!), the mobile seems to be \\"malfunctioning\\" and it spins non-stop! Woo-hoo! I love it! Hate the thought of having to replace the batteries now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"I love this swing, but more importantly, my almost 3 mo. old son loves it. It was very easy to put together, the seat cushions are bright, soft and comfortable. It's very easy to get him in and out of this swing as well, which is very handy if he's already asleep. While the motor does make a little noise when the swing is getting started, once it's at the right speed, it's very quiet and the sound it does make is rythmic. Being able to switch the swinging motion from cradle to swing is also nice, sometimes he's tired of going one way and enjoys the change.It's absolutely worth paying the little extra to get this swing over something cheaper, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great to not so good any more...3 months and it breaks down","review":"The swing was exactly what we wanted. We have had it for about 3 1/2 months. About a month ago the music started sounding like a skipping CD so I thought I must need to change the batteries. That didn't help at all. Now the sounds do not even work on a regular basis. If you thump the top of the machine it will start up for a second and then turn right back off. Also, my son loved the fish that would swim around over his head and now they have stopped working as well. He has been in this swing since he was about a month old so when ever he gets in it he always looks up to see the fish swimming but now they don't move. It makes me feel awful that something he liked so much from a very early stage has aready become a disappointment. This swing is supposed to last until age two?????? I don't think that is accurate. Now we are stuck with this broken thing because it has been too long of a time frame to return. Thanks Fisher Price."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SWING EVER!","review":"This swing is a total life-saver. My son (2 months old) absolutely loves it and will fall asleep in it for hours. It is the best gift I received and would HIGHLY recommend this to any mother who wants to have some time to say eat, brush your teeth, shower...PURCHASE it with out hesitation. You won't know what you did without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifesaver!","review":"This swing is in the top 3 MUST HAVE baby items in my opinion. The fact that it can swing back and forth or side to side is a major plus, but my son didn't like the traditional front to back motion, so this worked out great. He also loved watching the globe light up, the mobile animals and the music (it's takes a while to get used to, and the motor is rather loud, but I figure if it calms him down, then who am I to complain?)--it was all very soothing to him. We never went past the 2nd setting, because it seemed like it would swing my son into the next room! But those two settings were just fine. And it does take up a lot of space on the floor, but I guess you have to realize that it's partly your baby's house and he deserves some of the space too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money...you won't be sorry!","review":"We had this from the day our son was born and it was a LIFESAVER! He slept in it for the first month of his life...it was the only way he would sleep! It saved my sanity. It always worked to put him to sleep. Later on, when he became more alert, he loved watching, and later reaching for the mobile. The price seems steep, but it is definately worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good swing, quality of question","review":"I have read multiple excellent reviews on this swing, but the motor on our swing broke within 3 months. Maybe we were just one of the unlucky ones but my sister in law bought the same swing and their swing has to be returned too. Otherwise my twins loved the fish mobile and the music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"This swing is a great buy! My son loves to watch the mobile overhead that lights up different colors and moves in circles. The chair itself is specifically designed to accomodate a young baby's wobbly head (there is an extra piece of fabric built in to hold up baby's head). It is bright and colorful and I couldn't be happier with my pick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST PERFECT","review":"I LOVE THIS SWING. MY MOTHER GOT IT FOR ME AT A GARAGE SALE ALMOST COMPLETELY NEW. MY DAUGHTER LOVES BEING IN IT. THERE IS ONLY ONE \\"CON\\" IN MY OPINION. IT GOES THROUGH BATTERIES WAY TOO QUICK. THE SWING TAKES 4 D BATTERIES AND I HAVE TO REPLACE THEM EVERY MONTH. OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS A GREAT SWING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter-in-law loves it","review":"I only used it for a short period while visiting, but my daughter-in-law says it is wonderful and it is exactly what she wanted. The baby loves the cradle motion for now and the ocean sounds are so soothing for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE SAVER!","review":"This swing is absolutley awesome. I don't think we could get by without it. It takes no longer than 10 minutes to put my son right to sleep even when he is already fussy. I recomend buying a battery charger and rechargable batteries though because you will save a lot of money that way. Also if you have hard wood floors beware...this thing likes to move about the room. But other than that its GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HALLELUJAH!!","review":"This swing is the best thing to ever happen to us. My daughter has reflux AND colic. She will not sleep in her bed. This swing is the only place she will sleep for extended periods. She sleeps anywhere from 6 to 9 hours at night (she's 11 weeks old). Thank GOD for this swing. The mobile quit working after a couple of weeks but we talked to Babies R Us and told them what happened and they gave us a new motor on the spot, no questions asked. They said FP sent out a bad batch, but sent out new motors to the stores to replace them. So if you have had this problem, just go to the store you got it from. We didn't even have to have our receipt or take them the old motor. We are COMPLETELY satisfied with this swing. My daughter is in awe of the lights and the fish. I recommend this to anyone who has a colicy baby and needs a good nights sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SWING","review":"WE GOT THIS SWING FOR OUR SON AND ALL OF US LOVE IT! I LIKE HOW IT CAN SWING IN TWO DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND THE FEATURES ARE ENOUGH TO KEEP MY SON STIMULATED. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY MOTHER. MY SON LOVES THE MUSIC AND WATCHING ALL THE FISH. HE CONKS OUT IN THE SWING ALL THE TIME. THIS IS A GODSEND FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO CALM THEIR FUSSY BABY DOWN BUT ALSO GET WORK DONE. MY ONLY QUALM IS I WISH THE MUSIC WOULD LAST LONGER, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS GREAT! MY BABY GIVES THIS SWING HIS :-P OF APPROVAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last! motor was replaced and broke again!!!","review":"I loved this swing with my daughter. She slept in it for naps and overnight. Batteries didn't last long, but I didn't expect them too because we were using it so much.When my son was born, we used it with him and he got used to sleeping in it too. Then one day, the motor just quit! Even with new batteries in it, it wouldn't swing. I called the company and even though I was \\"past the waranty period\\", they made a \\"one-time exception\\" and sent me out a new motor. It only worked for about a week. My friend has had the same problem. It doesn't seem to be able to handle the weight it is advertised to. I think it says up to 25 lbs but my son was only ~15 lbs when it quit working! I would not buy it again if I had the choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver, Battery Eater","review":"First, this swing has saved my sanity with two children now. It is the best way to get a baby to go to sleep for naps or bedtime. It konked them out, then I just moved them to their cribs for the night (they slept in the swing for naps).Plus, if you need some time for yourself, the mobile, the lights and floating fish and the rocking all keep them wonderfully entertained. I don't remember if the tray and toys worked well for my first child as it's been gone for a while, I don't know what happened to it.I've seen the reviews saying it rocks too quickly for a small infant, but I haven't had that experience or maybe my children are just daredevils. I do have an older model, so maybe that problem (along with the reported noise) are issues with the newer model.Still going strong after 4 years and two kids, but it does eat up the batteries!!! Overall, I wouldn't trade it for any other swing although I haven't tested them out. I've been very happy, as have my kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If there is one thing that you buy... GET THIS.","review":"This swing constantly amazes us!From day one our daughter has loved going into her swing. She likes going front to back and side to side. Most recently we've taken it out of the reclining position and put it more into a sitting position. So now she strains her head to see the fish and lights above.The music is soothing and also offers bubbles.If there is one thing that I would suggest to soothe your baby it would be this swing. It's been a life saver!I thought it would go through batteries a lot faster than it has..we use it constantly and just changed the batteries after 3 1/2 months of useage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality & horrible customer service","review":"Tonight, my son fell out of his swing this afternoon when the seat tipped over. The bolts were not loose, nor were they stripped. The CSR that I spoke to at Mattel basically told me that it was my fault (in a nutshell) and told me to buy a new one. She said that they no longer make the repair parts for this particular swing. PLEASE check your Fisher Price swings and make sure the seat is not loose. Also, double check the seat belts. Because those came loose as well.This was a secondhand gift, however, I would expect expensive baby items like this SHOULD last more than a few years and through more than one child.In terms of this swing, the motor makes a very loud noise and is sucks batteries like no tomorrow. The seat is wobbly and not safe. My son fell out of this swing face first onto the floor tonight and has a huge bruise on his head from it. FP refused to do anything about it, they didn't even apologize.I give this ZERO stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"great swing","review":"I started using this swing when my baby was 3 wks old. Before I put her in it, I thought even the slowest speed was too fast for a newborn..but she loves it! It's great to have the option to swing both ways in case your baby prefers one to the other. She takes naps in there for hours. I chose this over the papasan because the seat is deeper, and I was worried she'd slip. The mobile on this is better too, more colorful and lights up. Once the batteries start to die, just turn it to the higher speed. She loves it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Saver!","review":"We bought this when we evacuated to Grammy's for a hurricane, and baby loved it right away! Her first time away from home under far from perfect conditions, she was a little cranky and sleepless. This worked great! I'm not sure she would have slept the entire week if she hadn't had this swing. The multiple songs and \\"wave\\" sound were wonderful for her, and the options in motion were useful, too. She absolutely LOVED the light display - and it kept her attention in a house with 10 people, 6 pets, 4 TVs, 10 phones, and lots of other noise.Although it does move more quickly than some, baby only weighed about 10lbs when she was in it first, and it worked fine - she used about the second of six speed settings. The laws of physics just make it impossible to make one swing the perfect speed for all sizes of baby. It did come with instructions for slowing it down even more than the slowest speed setting if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's become an old friend","review":"I bought this album when it first was released.

The explanation of electric potential energy, potential difference and voltage was tortured, convoluated and nearly unintelligible. Our instructor mercifully supplied his own summary of the topic. Also miserable, was the book's presentation of the magnetic torque on a current loop. The diagrams were so confusing, I had to throw up my hands. Lastly, but definitely not the least infuriating, was Serway's use of a term in the middle of the text without a previous definition or explanation. He does this with \\"focal length\\" in his section on geometric optics. I had to buy alternative physics texts, at some expense, just to get through the semesters. Thank goodness the courses, otherwise, interesting and useful, are over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Introductory Physics Book EVER","review":"To be honest, I didn't even need to buy this book, but I did it anyway. Having worked with Serway's Texts before, I new this was going to be an exellent book. This text contains hundreds of illustrations to help a student of physics grasp the underlying concepts. The book also has many diversified problems to help the student obtain the tools needed to be successful in physics.

Some of the utilities are underexplained (although the basics are fairly clear).I never regreted the money I spent on this book, and I recommend it even today to people I meet who want to learn JCL (or even just more about the basic MVS environment)."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to its source: Haunting and strange","review":"Twin Peaks, an example of television at its most provacative, is amply served by this intriguing soundtrack. The haunting, jazz inflections of Angelo Baldamenti's melodies, are quite a match for the offbeat nature of this series and they stand alone well as examples of a type of music that is reminiscent of things past, but at the same moment, timeless. Julie Cruise's voice blends into this slow tranquil mix as well as any vocalist could; and the cryptic lyrics also reflect the nature of the show. Very few TV shows have soundtracks worth having; this one is probably the best of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audrey's Dreamy Music","review":"Angelo Badalamenti / Julee Cruise / Soundtrack from Twin Peaks: This first CD of the great mood music of the series Twin Peaks is excellent but short at only 11 tracks.

Having both, I like to play them in reverse order, ending with Julee Cruise singing \\"Falling\\". This first Twin Peaks soundtrack gets Five Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones Are A Must","review":"This is less of a review, and more of a suggestion. If you buy this CD, and I highly recommend that you do - especially Twin Peaks fans - listen to it at least once on a good, high-quality set of headphones.There is a great deal of subtlety to this soundtrack that goes unrevealed when listening on a stereo or boom box.Listening with a headset actually seems to create a greater intimacy with the soundtrack - you suddenly hear a variety of previously hidden nuances, such as sounds and recording effects.It seems this music was made to be appreciated from \\"the center of it,\\" if that makes sense, and not from across the room. Only headsets, or perhaps a really good surround-sound system, can physically put you where you need to be to appreciate the full quality of this work.Don't get me wrong. It's a good soundtrack however you listen to it, but listening to it on a stereo from across the room keeps you at a distance from some of the surprising quality of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for anyone lost in the world of Twin Peaks","review":"This music really brings the Twin Peaks experience to another level, making it consume your daily reality. Even if you never watched the show, this is great music for mood and atmosphere. From the mellon-collie theme, to the classicly morbid Laura Palmer theme, and the great dark jazz pieces, this is a great listen the whole way through. Julee Cruise provides melodic vocals on several songs, including the disturbingly haunting \\"Into the Night\\". Angelo Badalamenti always suprises you with his parts and instrumentation, and Lynch's lyrics are great. If you're a fan of the Twin Peaks reality and want it to seep yet further into your own, or if you're just looking for some surreal atmospheres, this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW THIS IS A SOUNDTRACK!","review":"PERFECTLY SEQUENCED, PERFECTLY SINISTER AND PERFECTLY HYPNOTIC!

They don't last and fail quickly all around the removable diamond and are more expensive. 1 sheets work just fine.-The detail sanding pieces are a good idea, but these fail pretty quickly as the plastic velcro melts off rendering them useless (the sandpaper stays stationary because the pieces won't grip) This is after about 10 min of use.Gel pads don't really add anything but price.Have to get another sander to finish.

Try Tony Robbins 'Awaken the Giant' for a clearer statement of 'personal leveraging', the classic Alan Lakein's 'How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life', or the more recent 'Getting Things Done' by David Allen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samll booklet with key points would be much better.","review":"This book is much too long for the amount of actual information shared.

Felt like I was reading an infomercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic mumbo jumbo!","review":"This book which is based on incredibly suspicious evolutionary theory is simplistic and outlandish. The authors make a big deal out of saying that we have two forces warring against each other with one side wanting short-term pleasure and the other wanting long-term benefits. Well, duh! We all already know that. This warring is supposed to occur because we have not completely evolved out of our \\"primitve guidance systems\\" (PGS for short)! Their solution to this evolutionary flaw is even worse -- create enrironments of critical situations that force you to act. Haven't we all been trying to bully ourselves into doing what we need to do for long enough? These authors now want us to invite others to do it for us!I would highly recommend a book called The Now Habit by Neal Fiore if you really want to know why you procrastinate. Read that book first and I'm sure you'll agree it's the only one you'll need."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never finished the book","review":"I got about halfway through this book. What I read was fairly mundane and prosaic. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ideas in an easy-to-read package","review":"I'm a clinical psychologist and professional coach who specializes in helping people overcome procrastination. This is one of the first books I recommend (after titles by Burka & Yuen and a few other authors).Levinson and Greider do a wonderful job of helping us eliminate the guilt we feel about our \\"lazy\\" habits. They explain why procrastination is a natural and understandable phenonmenon. The reframing of procrastination has been useful for many of my clients and students. Procrastinators are often overextended perfectionists who continually beat themselves up for not being more self-disciplined. This book helps them stop the negative self-downing and provides ways for them to improve their habits.Over and over, Levinson and Greider provide accessible examples of how to make it easier to to the right thing. The answer is not willpower but brainpower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely new and different ideas about self-improvement .","review":"This is the most practical,realistic and and fun to read self-improvement book that I've ever read. Their theory about human behavior especially related to the usual failure around good intentions makes so much sense.It explains inherent mechanisms that when we know how to use them -make following through on good intentions emrarassingly easy.Years of reading self improvement books had stilted me to the genre. They all seemed to be based on wishful thinking and frankly I never got much results from them.I read the book a week ago and have already seen my productivity go way up. For the first time in my life I have a clean desk and I know it is going to stay that way.My only suggestion would be summary pages at chapter ends but I strongly encourage everybody to read this book if you want to finally make some lasting changes. Personally I think its the best thing since Covey's Seven Habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guinea Pigs!","review":"This set is adorable it has everything that was mentioned by others. I had to buy this for my daughter because she was unable to keep her real guinea pigs due to a severe allergy that was unexpected. This has been a healthier alternative for her. This is a great set to add to a dollhouse, farm or petting zoo. She loves this set it has so many details. It is also made to last many years. Important note! Do not buy this for a child who still puts toys in their mouth because nearly every piece is small enough to swallow! Excellent Toy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guinea Pigs by Playmobile","review":"I was unhappy that the item was so teeny. Small parts that could be swallowed. But I was satisfied when the company (Growing Tree) returned my money because I was not happy with it. So in the end I give the company 5 stars but the product 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"vailtrail.com/ weekly shuffle/ CD Review by Samantha Donen","review":"On first listen, Glasper's second album Canvas sounds like decidedly mainstream piano jazz. The second time around, the true hip hop nature of the music reveals itself. Humming along to the music he is playing, Canvas owns a melodic sense that can mesmerize you. Glasper has influences of Tyner, Hancock, Coreau, and Jarret and holds his own to new piano trios led by Jason Moran, Bill Charlap, and Brad Mehldau."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Future Is Bright","review":"This album got me thinking about Bill Evans and how pivotal he was to the direction jazz piano has taken. As another reviewer said, Glasper is the real deal. His amazingly intricate playing at times sounds like a refreshing shower of notes pouring down on you. He's always melodic, rhythmic, and rewarding to the ear. And his playing stands up to repeated listening. I saw Glasper's trio live at the Vanguard recently and the house was packed. It's clear Glasper is at the beginning of what I hope becomes a long, successful career. Although there are many competing players out there, Glasper has a real feel for a tune, which permits the listener access to work with him on it. He did a beautiful rendition of Autumn Leaves (not on this album) that I hope he records on his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first political protest album!","review":"The original TRB TWO came out when I was 18 years old and very impressionable.

Mortal Midnight is not so much about Danny's brush with death as it is about God's Sovereign will. That night nobody knew would be the last night for that young brave soldier that took Danny's place on the hill. Nobody that is except for God. Why God's will was so expressed you need to read the book to find out. However to know that God has such a minuet plan for each of us is a wonder to contemplate. Read this book it might just change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheesethunder","review":"This album has some raucus mod stompers with the most obvious being their hit \\"Take a heart\\". While the rest of this album is not as strong as the title track it is definitely worth a listen. If the classic mod years of 65-67 are your thing I would advise purchasing The Birds ahead of this. However, no mod afficienado could have a complete collection without Take A Heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book in the series","review":"I waited 5 years for this?

The Tiffen filter was too big and did not come close to fitting in the Hoya case (hence the rubber band I suppose). After taking some terrific pictures of this atrocity with my DSLR using an unfiltered lens, I returned it to Amazon for a refund. I told the guy at Amazon that it would be cheaper for me to toss it in the trash for him but if he wanted it back, he could have it! My only praise is that Amazon did refund my money without a problem but this was beyond ridiculous. You are better off buying a cheap filter at your local Best Buy than to even consider purchasing something from \\"eDirectPhoto Inc.\\" I generally have a great experience at Amazon but this was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filmy but cleanable, dealer in Brooklyn, NY.","review":"Inside of filter container was damaged as though item took a very hard fall (no outside damage stangly), but filter itself appears to be in good condition. Had to really clean it because it does have a film, unlike the HMC circular polarizer I just got (from Adorama) which was smooth and clear. Didn't know seller (APD) was in Brooklyn or I probably wouldn't have made the purchase...that's where all the Ebay crap is too. There was no HAZE written anywhere on the package or the filter, maybe this is a generic term? It only says HMC UV (0).Very high quality feel, heavy with a great milled edge and fits very snug sandwhiched between my 50mm 1.8d lens and the HMC Circular Polarizer that I got at the same time - in fact they are a little hard to unscrew once together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage - You get what you pay for!","review":"I am amazed by all the positive reviews for this filter.

I was sorely disappointed! They felt pretty smooth out of the package, but after the first wash the fabric's true quality was revealed -- they were SCRATCHY and rough. (And not rough like nubby old cozy flannel - I mean like bristly.) This is because cheaper fabric is made from shorter fibers, and so the tiny ends poke out. You can actually feel them. Even the cheapest sheets from Ikea feel better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you order full sheets, MEASURE THEM WHEN THEY ARRIVE","review":"I have had the same weird problem with two sets of this and and one of another model of Pinzon sheets. The package and both sheets are all labeled \\"full\\" but are really \\"queen\\" size--much too big for a double bed.Measure yours when they arrive and return them as defective. (Amazon is pretty good about that.)I think what may be happening is that, like many manufacturers, Pinzon is just not making full sheets any more. Unlike others, they are sticking \\"full\\" labels on queen size sheets and passing them off.Otherwise, these seem to be of acceptable quality. The fabric is thinner than I would like, but would appear to be sturdy enough. If only I could use them.

Much better even than Ghiardelli, but if you can find Ghana chocolate, go for it! Ghana 60% wins all the ribbons for premium chocolate, but it's very hard to find on the Internet.

I am very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eww! Save Your Money","review":"Bought these from K-Mart because I wanted them for my new office. After replacing my Zenith 5\\" two-way speakers, these were not any better; I was disappointed. Having worked in electronics retail in the past, KLH used to be pretty good. Not so anymore. The construction quality of these is poor. I listened to classic rock, easy listening, & guitar.....all of which sounded 'hollow' from these speakers; like the singer was singing into a tube. Save your money & get JBL or Sony for the same price range. If you must have these, get them on the internet somewhere else for cheaper. For me, I'm going back to JBL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the look and feel","review":"Got this to use for the NYT no knead bread, and it works perfect. Exactly the right size.

Very bad quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Innacurate","review":"I approached this book with high hopes for pointers and insight. What I found became a waste of time and effort. Much of the information is dated, biased, and so full of politically correct fluff as to be unusable. In addition, there are mistakes in its recount of historical events. This alone leads me to wonder about the research of all of the material. Simple checks would have shown that statements utilized as key facts to derive deeply imbedded hypothesis were in error.The only redeeming characteristics arise in the sections dealing with individual cultures. As long as one realizes that the material presented is exceptionally broad based, this section becomes and interesting read. However, it stands as too broad for anything but the most basic beginnings and simplest of approaches. Those with prior awareness of a specific culture will likely find the chapter on it quite dull and uninformative.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Line Dancing","review":"This video is not what I thought it would be.

Also you can easily put scratches on the underside of the filter (i.e. while cleaning). The glass is cheap and opaque enough that it causes my macro lens to autofocus on the glass. It is not a thin filter and not recommended for use on UWA lenses. At this time I cannot tell whether an aluminum ring is better than a brass ring though I do like the heft of brass.

I had an older chef's knife and when slicing through tough meat and cracking the backbone on a slab of ribs I had to use quite a bit of force.

VERY SHARP!! and if you keep it honed with one of the sharpeners it will stay that way!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome knife, worth the price","review":"This Wusthof is truly an amazing tool. Despite the hefty price tag (from the perspective of a casual cook), this knife seems to be worth it! Of course I've only had the knife for a week now, and only the test of time will show its faults if there are any.The knife feels solid in hand, and is heavier than the stamped knives I've owned - but in a very good way.The sharpness of this knife is unlike anything I've used before, and I'm a fan of sharp knives. I've successfully cut thin slices out of a baguette (!!) with this knife, and even sliced grapes cleanly apart by simply holding the sharp edge face up and tossing a grape onto it. Very impressive.Being so pleased with this chef's knife, I am now considering getting a smaller version for other tasks."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Wusthof Knife is simply the best!","review":"Having used this knife for well over 20 years already, I was so impressed that I decided to purchase another one as a gift for my parents....and give them the gift of excellence!

Much better than the \\"container/crusher\\" style crushers. It was an effortless joy to crush pills. After a few months, the crank broke off one day without warning. I drilled a hole through the spool and inserted a steel rod to crank with. That worked for awhile but then the grinding lugs eventually wore smooth. So it was totally worthless in less than a year.

The original vocalist supposedly sings background vocals, but they make no impact.The classic Leatherwolf guitar sound is intact through most of the songs. The songwriting as a whole, however, is not up to par. Gone are the memorable harmonies and power background vocals that made this band so special with \\"Leatherwolf\\" and \\"Street Ready\\". The new vocalist sounds a little like Mark Slaughter, but with bad songs to sing.To be fair, I'm not sure this band even wants to embrace their past, but over-zelous record executives are quick to slap stickers on CDs such as this that get consumers to wax nostalgic about \\"The Return of the Los Angeles Power-Metal Band\\". Such a statement promises nothing, but hints at a lot.Without knowing the band's past, this is very passable power metal, but nothing special or different from the many bands out there right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Version to Choose From of the Same Bad CD!","review":"This European version must be special, because it costs more than the other Euopean version for sale (but less than the Japanese version). It doesn't matter which one you buy, you'll be getting the same generic power metal that doesn't do the band justice. If you liked the original singer, you won't like this one. If you liked the bands power-background vocals, you'll find little to like here, as they have all but disappeared.

Second, the writing is uninspired, with the narrator intoning generic phrases like, \\"It is one of the most spectacular views in the world\\" for virtually every location - you get the sense they could have put some of the narration behind any of the locations and it would have made no difference.

In her book of the same title, she does and admirable job of explaining from where her thoughts and inspirations of this deck stem. I would call this book a must own companion to her deck for many reasons, all rather obvious.My only dissapointment, and a small one at that, is the authors assumption that the reader has also read her title \\"The Goddess and the Tree\\", explaining her interpretation of the connection of modern Wicca and the Qabalistic tree. However, after reading through a short way, the basic ideas of the Qabal do come through to enough of a degree for the reader to begin understanding.Over all, I have to say I was impressed wyth the information provided, the explainations given, and the over all way the book was focused at the meanings Mrs. Connon-Reed intended for her deck. A very well concieved and written view of her creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understandable but Tacky...","review":"This Witches Tarot is easy to understand but the pictures (with the exception of a few of the cards) are tacky.

I have been contemplating ordering this for some time; however, I was not too keen on the borderless cards. When I saw the new reprint available on Amazon, I placed an order because I liked the new black borders on the cards. However, what I actually received was the older, borderless cards and book set. Needless to say, I sent mine back.I contacted Llewellyn publishers and a representative told me that they were indeed reprinting the Witches Tarot (with the new borders around the cards) but it would not be available until September of this year. So, for those of you wanting the new printing, just be a little patient.My one star review was ONLY because I did not get the product that was represented online. It does not reflect the quality & useability of the deck and book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Funny In An Unintentional Way","review":"I understand from the jacket that the author is a very well educated and intelligent guy. However, the basic structure of the book is that he's an Anglo who gets on a bus in Mexico and rides it down through Central America to Nicaragua. All the while, and you get the feeling he's never been to Central America before, he gives the reader all sorts of political, geo-political and editorial opinions about how screwed up the Mexicans, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans are. The guy could have stayed in Washington or New York or wherever he was, and made the same pronouncements at the bar with his well-educated and intelligent co-workers, with the same level of emotional involvement. If somehow getting on a bus and riding a few thousand miles suddenly makes your opinion about a region credible and worthwhile, the author succeeded. I'm a little skeptical myself. The author comes across like a post-liberal Colonel Blimp more than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best $28.50 I've ever spent","review":"I found the Thera Cane strictly by accident, and at first, couldn't figure out what I was looking at. Then I noticed 266 reviews, with the average being 5 stars. So I started reading them.I constantly have tight, painful muscles in my neck, shoulders, and back, so each new glowing review suggested that this might actually be the solution. Within a few minutes, and reading about 25 or 30 reviews, I ordered one.It arrived today. I read the accompanying booklet and tried a number of the suggestions on how to loosen up tight muscles. Within about 30 minutes (and I still don't know the best ways to use it), I was virtually pain-free. All of the knotted muscles had relaxed.Wow! This truly is the best $28.50 I've ever spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changer","review":"This cane (with instruction from my physical therapist)helped me be in control of my pain management.

I've had muscle-related back problems for over 10 yrs. However, the last 2 yrs have been really bad. I've done chiropractor, massage, acupuncture and nothing stuck - plus I got tired of spending all that money on them. The first time I used the thera cane I almost cried!! Within about 20 minutes I was completely pain free. It's been such a long time since I could move around w/o pain. Although the pain came back, with each session it gets less and the pain-free time gets longer. I believe I've broken the cycle. I just used it in the morning before work, then after work and then before bed. If your pain is muscle-related, the thera cane is well worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great at breaking up those knots","review":"If you suffer from tight shoulders and upper back then this cane is a must for you! You can choose how much pressure to apply and the cane itself is indestructable. My Chiropractor actually tried to break it and ended up pulling a muscle and then had to use the cane to relieve the tightness in the muscle. The instruction booklet is great and there are many different areas of the body you can use it on but I typically use it for my upper back and shoulders and sometimes my neck. Co-workers ususally point and laugh and ask me how much I paid for my \\"car club\\" until they try it. As a result four of my friends have bought one too. Well worth the price and it will last you a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thera Cane is Fantastic!","review":"I bought this item for my boyfriend as he has constant back aches. The moment he opened it he was overjoyed and it was very quick and easy to use. With the Thera Cane he can now apply as much pressure where and when without having to try to tell me \\"the pain is lower\\" or \\"to the left\\" or \\"further inside\\". I've used it too and I didn't realize I had so many unresolved knots in my back until I used the Thera Cane too. What makes it even better is that we showed some of my family over Christmas the Thera Cane and they were hooked on it instantly as well (my uncle suffers from back problems, had to have surgery for some ruptured discs, etc.)--again, very quick and easy to use.The shape of the Thera Cane itself and the placement of the grips makes the product very instinctual to hold and therefore use with ease. Great product and I recommend one for anyone who has back pain and can't quite get the knots out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy looking thing works!","review":"I go to a Chiropractor regularly. I know about how pressure points can cause a lot of trouble within your muscles. If you can break the hold of that pressure point you do get relief. I thought I'd try this Cane out and it really can get to those points around your body that you cannot reach effectively with your fingers. The price is very low considering how much relief you can get. If you understand pressure points, I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the high priced massager I bought","review":"The headline I wrote nearly says it all. This thing is amazing. It is well-designed so that the part you are trying to get to is relaxed and easily reached. The position allows for whatever amount of pressure you need, and does not leave you over taxed from the effort. I have tried a lot of products, including a high-priced massager, which I gave myself tennis elbow using, and this is a HUGE bargain. At this price, what have you got to lose!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help for tight muscles","review":"Great tool to help reach those tight muscles you just can't massage yourself.

When he raved about it, I decided to try it for myself. WOW. This thing is amazing! I have MS, and I frequently have muscle spasm and stiffness that require some pretty heavy duty meds to unlock, but this thing can really take the edge off in no time. I spent the entire weekend before this arrived unable to turn my head and in extreme pain. When it showed up I put it to use, and literally after 3 minutes the Thera Cane helped more than all the muscle relaxants and back rubs from my husband did for 2 days. I am seriously sold on this!

It works amazingly well and it allows me to apply just the right amount of pressure myself instead of trying to negotiate with a masseuse on where to press and how much. It's great for trigger points in the upper and mid-back, and even the ones underneath the shoulder blades, which are usually impossible to get. It feels very sturdy and I'm not at all concerned about it breaking (ever). It also doesn't require much strength to apply a lot of pressure so if you're worried about that, don't. It is a little pricey but it's completely worth it. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We all love it!","review":"You know that one hotspot between your shoulder blades that you can't quite reach?

Yes, that's the place!My wife, daughter, and I have all been using it and we all love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple design, amazing benefit!","review":"I can't explain how much better the TheraCane makes my back feel. This is actually my second one; I gave away my first. Anyone who tries it loves it.I dislocated a rib a couple of years ago, and my back muscles have never been the same. This thing works wonders on the knots. I actually sleep better, because this helps relax the muscles and reduce tension.Bonus: my wife no longer needs to work on my back-- I can do this myself, as often as I need to.As a side note, I think this is the highest-rated product I've ever seen on Amazon. As of now, with more than 100 reviews, 91% of the reviewers gave it 5 stars. I fully understand those stats, and you would too, if you bought one.

The one the tennis ball in the sock can't quite take care of either? Well, here's your answer. You can find the spot and apply as much or as little pressure as you need to!

But that was my fault, not Theracane's. It gets those hard-to-reach spots with little effort and, after a few minutes, the pain you had subsides. Theracane relaxes the muscle that has been stressed and knotted up. When shown to friends I smile as their eyes roll back in long-awaited relief.

It is so nice for reaching those little knots and places you could never get to on your own. I use it when I just need to get a little knot out or a massaging action on tight muscles. It is well worth the price. An awesome deal. I have had mine for many, many years. It has taken a lot of \\"abuse\\". When I got mine you could only get it from a PT or such. How great it can be found here now for all. In using it sometimes, I had often wished I could get \\"even deeper\\" for really tough knots. Then I found this item ...FENIX Deluxe Self-Care Kit.

Though the album is a little bit of a bore compared to other Ida albums there are some top notch Ida tunes here, including \\"Lets Go Walking\\" and \\"So Long\\".

The main charaters at first are good but they develop into wining and annoying people always complaining. the book has absolutley no action done by the main charaters, no sword fights or any action at all, all the main charaters do is run away and complain about having to run. I give this book 1 star because the plot had could have become a good book but the charaters are nothing like what you would expect after reading Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, Le Guin, Rowling, R.R. Martin, Nix, Herbert, Tolkein, and all the other fantasy authors i've read. I hate to tell authors that their book was bad because i know they worked on them extremely hard but i will never read anything else written by this author Ian Irvine.-read something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story; Poor Teller","review":"I gave one star for the story, as there is a good one in there. Unfortunately, the author does a poor job of telling it. His protagonists are pathetic, not sympathetic. Other characters are angry, greedy, power-mad, and/or full of lust, and are not compelling. To train a person as a type of bard, a profession likely to involve a lot of travel, during an era with a breakdown of the rule of law, and not train him in martial arts for self-protection, makes the school inept and the story untenable. The other main protagonist, with no skill, takes on many highly skilled warriors and magicians from numerous camps and continues to foil them on luck only, making the story untenable. The author's writing style gets in the way of the story. Dialogue is stilted. The word flow is rough and trite, and gets in the way of seeing the setting. Characterizations are flat. Perhaps if the author worked with a qualified fantasy writer and re-released the book, it would be worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"This is a GREAT book it will hold your attention to the end!

It would be an understatement to say that it exceeded my expectations. Ian Irvine creates a world and characters of depth and complexity.

I have read many fantasy novels by numerous authors and none of them not even the worst of them was as bad as this one was. For example, Ian goes on and on describing the surroundings in so, so much detail that made me feel dizzy and sleepy! Then there is this problem of stretching the story of one character for so long! He talks about Karan and her confrontation with the Whelms chapter after chapter after chapter! I thought it'll never end! Excitement level = Zero. I threw the book away just before reaching half way because i got so bored. It just didn't have the \\"It grabbed me from the start\\" element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Flawed Kindle Version","review":"I read this book years ago and loved it. I still do. I have one problem with the kindle version though. I wanted to reread it but left my paper copy in another state so I decided to purchase the kindle version. Almost immediately I noticed some strange typos. Whatever software they are using to scan the text and convert it for kindle has a problem. There are frequent typos throughout the book. They are very distracting. I have noticed many cases where 'that' appears as 'mat', 'the' as 'die' etc.It isn't just with small words like those. Punctuation is missing, random letters are missing from words. Someone really should have read through this before they put it up on Amazon.Other than that it's a good book that I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it might have been...","review":"I found it to be quite a bit disappointing. Perhaps Irvine should attempt to emulate the worldbuilding of Feist. I am halfway through the second book it it appears to be going downhill and is not as suspenseful as many other books I've read. Even Jordan's first few books were better before he devolved into go nowhere, do nothing books selling on his name. I think Dune will be much better, so I may start that instead of finishing this series - it just doesnt seem good value at (price)(aus) a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How on Earth did this get published?","review":"I could only get through half the book before putting it down for good. I should have quit a quarter of the way through but kept hanging on to see if lightning would strike. It didn't.The characters are wooden and don't act realistically. They don't even act stereotypically and that would have been better because they're all stereotypes anyway. The writing and plot drag on and on. The place names are ridiculous. This is the most stunning display of bad writing I've seen in quite a while. Thankfully the author seems to have a decent first career to continue.And there's three more books in this series. That can only be explained by a very good agent who got the four book contract before delivery of the first manuscript. Either that or the publisher stayed home sick one day and the interns went on a buying spree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth the effort","review":"Forget the hyped reviews this is a very average fantasy book with poorly drawn characters and bad dialogueIt should have worked. The world seems to be well thought out, the action is reasonable and nothing (except the writing) is too corny... The book is completely undermined by the boring prose and the prosaic bores.Now I do not enjoy an author who does not trust the reader enough to allow him to read between the lines. There are no lines to read between in this book. Every sentence is written in a very stilted fashion, and Irvine constantly interrupts his flow with an aside that would, given time, have become perfectly obvious.It seems Irvine was too attached to his work, too anxiously trying to control what the reader thinks and imagines whilst reading, leaving the book contrived and overwritten.So although I will probably wonder what happens, (it does SOUND interesting, it just doesn't READ interesting) I couldn't bear to read and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book","review":"I thought that this book was one of the greater finds for me. I read cover to cover (672 +- pages) in 3 days. The book pulls you in quickly and has a great cliffhanger ending leading to book 2 (A Tower on the Rift, January 2002). Overall, a great read and well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite in the genre","review":"This series caught me when I was 14 and I've re-read it many times since.

Summertime In England, whence the album title is drawn, is a magnificent devotional piece with complex but oh so beautiful instrumentation and soulful vocals. Van's brand of funky soul emerges in Satisfied with its jazzy saxophones over a brooding rhythm track, whilst Wild Honey is an evocative pastoral ballad. The uplifting song Spirit is very positive and inspirational and reminds me of an exquisite song with the same title by The Waterboys. I suspect that the awesome but gentle tour de force When Heart Is Open refers esoterically to the opening of the heart chakra. It certainly has that effect on me! There's less of Van's trademark R&B on this album and in general, these pieces are not as overtly religious as say, Be Thou My Vision on Hymns To The Silence, but they're equally moving. Common One offers exquisite music for the soul - listening to it is pure gnosis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Reacquainted","review":"Having gone on to other things I had forgotten Morrison's haunting refrains of English and Irish bards in this wonderful album.

The film, concerning a young man coming to grips with life in a small Mississippi town while caring for his mentally unstable aunt and eventual coming out, is slow to develop and the weak script fails to ignite any credibility. The revelation that there is a romantic attraction between the two male actors is as unconvincing as the kiss between them in the final scene.Basically, the actors are fine except that they try to speak in a ridiculous Southern aristocratic accent which, news flash!, no longer exists in the contemporary South. Karen Black, always an interesting and talented actress, seems to have watched too many Tennessee Williams plays for her character.And, on another ludicrous note, gardeners in the South begin to harvest their tomatoes in June, not begin to plant them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just...

The cinematography is gorgeous (as everyone agrees); I'm okay with the acting; the script, however, slowly, ponderously, goes nowhere--which is the point of this film, I suppose. I recommend renting this film if you're hankering to experience vicariously the life of a young, bored, gay man (but not out to himself or anyone) trapped by circumstances and a dysfunctional, immediate family to continue in an empty, unfulfilled existence in the deep South, rather than take some chances, make some changes and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible disappointment!","review":"Poor acting and directing.

I'm baffled that this film actually got financing and I simply cannot comprehend how Karen Black's agent allowed her to do this. Yes, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, but that can't make up for a plot that goes nowhere and doesn't really investigate any of its seemingly multifaceted characters. While there is a great deal of homoerotic tension between Griffith and Lee, it is never fully explored or explained. Don't bother renting/buying this film. There are much better films out there about the South (Gone with the Wind), family secrets (Secrets & Lies), people realizing they might be gay (Defying Gravity), etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for it....","review":"Red dirt features some wonderful scenery and great camera-work, but...the plot is dire! I kept waiting for lightning to strike, some sort of revelation. When it finally came, it was more of a: \\"And now, the weather\\" kind of thing. No real pain here, no heartbreak. Just people shambling about, doing their business.It's a real pity, because the male actors are sooo attractive. Dan Montgomery and Walter Goggins. Good looking guys. But we don't get to see very many scenes of their evolving friendship. Contrary to the picture on the cover, the main story concerns a family secret. And what about that ending?My DVD doesn't give any clues, as the extras are spare. The trailer, a short by Tag Purvis, scene access and filmographies. No deleted scenes, no interviews, nothing. Shame. I would like to see more of Tag Purvis, though.

Well that might help to describe the feeling I was left with after watching this movie. As a person who lives in the South, I've come to realize that there is nothing worse than actors who portray Southerners who can't pull off a believable southern accent. Couple this with a story line that goes no where and leaves you simply annoyed by the end of the movie and you might start to get a feel for this movie. True, some of the actors in the movie are beautiful to look at(Dan Montgomery is drop dead beautiful), but sheer beauty cannot overcome the first few spoken words out of his mouth.This could have been a great \\"coming of age\\" movie set in the deep south, but it just doesn't succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is bad","review":"I've never reviewed a movie here before, but I felt an obligation to the community.

As a collector of gay and gay-themed films, I figured if I didn't like the movie, at least it would be an addition to my collection. After viewing this film, I can honestly say that I will never watch this painful, slow, unbearable movie again.We are asked to believe that a young attractive man, who lives with his crazed mother and becomes intimate with his cousin, is searching his life enough to become involved with a stranger to whom he rents out a cottage. The plot was simply unbelievable, and the ending is so utterly non-existant that the only thing you feel at the time is relief that your time will no longer be wasted.I doubt this will even stay in my collection, lest someone discover that I bought this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Despite some lovely cinematography and serious eye-candy (Dan Montgomery, the star of the movie), \\"Red Dirt\\" is tragically flawed. With stilted, unnatural dialogue, ham-handed and mostly hysterical theatrics, and entirely too much melodrama for its own good, the movie begins with very little as a premise, and ends with very little as a conclusion. The writing is sloppy and meanders pointlessly back and forth, with storylines that have no place within the primary plot, and viewers are left, after an hour and forty-five minutes of bad Southern drawls and D-grade \\"subplots\\", with one badly-acted kiss, and very little resolution.While I tend to give the world of gay film much leeway, in this case, I'm afraid, nothing but condemnation will do. Not worth purchasing, and only marginally worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more reason Karen Black's career is dead","review":"This thing should have come with a laugh track or maybe pop-up dialog balloons that could have breathed some life into this ponderously pretentious piece of poop.

My only complaint, since I was expecting this to be a gay film, is that the gay undertone and eventual \\"coming out\\" is kind of tacked on to the end of the movie, like an afterthought.

His aunt is really his mother, his cousin is his lover, and he is in love with a man. So that's how they do things down south, huh? 'Red Dirt' tells an interesting story of how a young man deals with his life going nowhere, his feelings for his aunt/mother and his love life. The only real problem I have with his movie is it doesn't really show the attraction the two men have for each other. You don't really find out their feelings until the end and then it's not believable when they do come out. There's one little kiss at the end but other than that they seem to be just friends.

Sitting down rendered the whole back of the shirt as wrinkled as a raisin. And this was within minutes of putting it on.

How is it possible he even exists? Tony invented Bruce Macniall for the performance...yet every partical of his being is eerily familiar.Soon the group is drawn into a real life murder mystery; young women are being killed, their bodies dumped nearby. And Tony is having sinister life-like dreams in which she sees through the eyes of the killer--dreams that suggest a connection to Laird Macniall. Bruce claims he wants to help catch the murdrer.

Even luckier is his entrance on a Friday, when they have to wait until Monday to straighten things out.

It was the first time I had come across a Heather Graham novel and it will the last time I read one of her books. The dialogue between characters was awful and seemed like a child had written the conversations. The plot was weak, to say the least, and any long-time reader will be able to pick out the \\"killer\\" right in the first few chapters. Ms. Graham practically sends up a red flag saying, \\"look! here's the bad guy!\\" I think the worst part of this book had to be the \\"mysterious\\" comments made by two of Toni's friends. Ms. Graham tries to create a red herring with their relationship, but unfortunately, she never goes back and explains certain odd remarks. So at the end of the novel, you are left wondering....\\"what did that mean again?\\" My advice would be to skip this book and read another mystery writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful, VERY high quality bowl","review":"This bowl is really stunning.

The experience was always akin to attending a concert performance, only in a more relaxed setting. This collection of Cole Porter and Hoagy Carmichael songs demonstrates Eaton's artistry as a jazz pianist and his loving and serious dedication to his work. The last cut is a compelling, brilliant lecture by Eaton that evaluates Porter and Carmichael's contributions to American jazz and popular music. Anyone who would dismiss Eaton as a mere cocktail lounge performer lacks an appreciation of his subtle genius and his musical elegance. Musical snobbery is politically incorrect these days with musicians like Yo-Yo Ma introducing a classically trained audience to the sound of Asian folk instruments in his Silk Road as well as to Argentine and Brazilian popular artists and their native instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"looks good","review":"My dad likes magnet bracelets.

Where I live (in the desert), dust, sand, haze and glare are constant issues. This filter both protects my lens from sand and dust, it cuts through the haze to deliver crisp, sharp images.Not the least expensive filter, however it is a quality product that will leave you satisfied and confident of your purchase.

However, I'm one of those wimpy people who can't swallow pills, so when I need to take something I have to crush it. For pill crushing, this pestle/mortar pair doesn't seem to work particularly well. The material of the bowl and the end of the pestle are very grainy. Great if you're not wanting to turn something into powder-- such as a spice or herb. But when you ARE wanting to crush something to a fine powder, the substance seems to get stuck around the edges of the pestle. (This happens regardless of the pill type.)For herbs and spices, this pair is no doubt excellent so I'd definitely recommend it for those purposes. For pharmacological use (I'm sure there's more of you non-pill-swallowers out there than just me), it's not a good bowl and I've gone back to the use of my other bulkier less attractive pestle/mortar for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I bought this for my mom and she uses it all the time in the kitchen!

Maybe out there there's a really great book that's capriciously decided to do without a random punctuation mark, but I'm going to have to give this one a pass -- it's just too distracting (and, frankly, it seems pretentious). I'm not sure what to think of an author who calls so much attention to the mechanics of the writing in a book that's not supposed to be avant-garde or experimental. It seems a bit perverse to put deliberate roadblocks in front of your readers. You might not consciously notice punctuation when it is there, but you sure miss it when it's gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kent Haruf is an incredible author.","review":"You know from his other books that he has lived in Holt, Colorado. You can tell by the way he uses the harshness of the weather and the reality of what it takes to make a living to offset the kindness and goodness of most of the characters. Like real life, not everyone in this book is good and kind, but it has a redeeming quality you can't get past. I live in Fort Collins myself and the mere mention of the various places visited in this book are enough to make me want to read all of Haruf's titles. I will also wish they do not end. I want the very best for Raymond McPheron and Victoria Roubideaux and Rose Tyler. These have become real people to me. A book like this makes me see my life and where I live it from a new perspective and with a new appreciation. I've known a few men and women like these and their simple kindnesses among each other are what life in most of small-town America is really made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graceful Beauty","review":"Eventide, the follow-up to the beautiful National Book Award Finalist, Plainsong is a gorgeous tribute to the hard and troublesome life on the high plains of Colorado. Like its predecessor, the understated emotionality of Eventide builds until the grip on your heart is unmistakable. For someone who never has to raise his voice, Kent Haruf is still able to grab the attention of the reader and take them along for a glorious trip to Holt. What a pleasure to read such a well written, simple, yet powerful sequel to Plainsong. Kent Haruf proves he understands the human heart better than just about anybody. You fall in love with Harold, Raymond and Victoria all over again. Look for another National Book Award Nomination for this very fine chapter in the life of normal people in extraordinary circumstances. \\"There are some things in life you don't get over. This book will be one of them.\\"(Have your Kleenex ready). A must read for 2004!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite","review":"I loved this book so much that I went to the library and read every other title by Kent Haruf. His character development is so interesting, and dialogue is natural. Recommend to read Plainsong first, for better continuity to the story, but this is an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as plainsong","review":"I read this book but was not impressed with it as much as I was with Plainsong of which this is the sequel. It is about a small town, but some of the characters are dark, and you kind of knew where the book was headed bu it got pretty dark at times and was sad. I liked he Mcpherson brothers, but even that has an element of sadness. I didn't really enjoy this follow up as much as I liked Plainsong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commment on Publishers Weekly review","review":"Why is it that Publishers Weekly chooses to write a plot summary (an elementary student could write) instead of a book review, and in so doing ruins much of that plot for us, and then Amazon compounds the problem by publishing it? The star rating is for the review, not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this...but I'm glad I borrowed rather than bought it! I wonder if Haruf felt that he needed to publish something to keep his name out there. Although it was worth reading, it wasn't worth taking the time to read slowly and savor. Very predictable in most cases, and I think that the characters were more stereotypes than people I wanted to know, help or fell sorry for. A visit to a small town, it certainly was: how fast can I pass through and go home. I have read all his books and this is the first that I felt I wouldn't recommend to anyone.Plainsong made me want to move there, to invest time in the character...not so this one.I give it some credit, because it was written literately, with good use of language. It was well edited...no glaring typos to trip over. But, sorry amazon, get it from the library or borrow your friend's copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spring calving","review":"I appreciated \\"Plainsong\\" so very much that I eagerly anticipated \\"Eventide\\". Sadly, it's as awkward as a newborn calf.What was the point of the Mary Wells vignettes? Will we meet her again in a later novel? And what is the queen of the \\"Motown sound\\" doing in Holt? The thead of story started, then broke, as did other story threads.Perhaps I need to be whacked with the object, the plot of the thing, but if I have too look too closely for theme the writer didn't do his job.Too many story lines, and unfinished stories made this feel \\"soap opera-ish\\" by the end. The purpose of plot isn't in this novel. While I remain grateful for Haruf's ability to tell a story with brevity and power, and will read his future novels, this is his weakest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely pointless!","review":"What made Kent write this? Plainsong was an absolute gem -- stunning and self-contained. There was no need to write a sequal -- and this book seriously damages the wonderful feeling I had about this author.What was muted and understated in Plainsong feels merely shallow and undeveloped here. There's no addition to the perfectly formed characters of Plainsong that cried out for this nonsense. Granted, it's pleasant enough to read -- but in comparison to the shimmering brilliance of Plainsong this book feels like a cheap way to cash in on a good thing.Do yourself a favor if you really loved Plainsong -- SKIP THIS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Haruf?","review":"With gift certificate in hand, I boldly purchased a hard copy of the book, eager to take up and continue the experience of reading \\"Plainsong.\\" I read, I waited, I wondered, I grew frustrated, I abandoned hope. To say I was disappointed in this new book by Kent Haruf would be an overwhelming understatement. If \\"Plainsong\\" spoke to me in bold and archetypal terms of grace--unmerited kindness and love, \\"Eventide\\" dispenses cheap grace with its two-dimensional, stock and stereotypical characters and predictable events. Who cares about any of these Holt folks? Who can even tell them apart? Maybe it's just not feasible creating Plainsong II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, mislabeled tracks","review":"This is a fantastic album.

That's an understatement - this book barely holds together as a book, and there's no narrative through-line to the book. It's a collection of uneven essays and certain parts are quite a bit more detailed than others. The author pretty much acknowledges this in the introduction. There's simply not enough meat here - it's a loose collection of fun facts and information that seems assembled from other secondary sources. Put in comparison to other recent books on American food -- anything by Michael Pollan, The United States of Arugula, etc. this is pretty weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game wasn't tested before being brought to market","review":"In what should have been a fun challenge, the result is very frustrating. The makers of this game rushed it to market before the bugs were worked out. There are several errors and nonfunctioning elements, like many \\"visual clues\\" that are nothing but white boxes, where the image is completely missing. The experience is a big disappointment. In the Final Jeopardy segment, a mere 5 seconds are given in which to enter the question. That is a huge error in programming. At other times the game goes to the theme song without finishing the game being played.

Like it cause you can create notes and history files about each client, schedules, has a calender built in, syncs great with Quickbooks Pro. The merge contact features is also helpful. Managing client data couldn't be easier. Only draw back is we would like it to start up faster or have a smaller footprint on the system. So we could quickly add something without the whole program starting up. Maybe its wishful thinking. Overall a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really working?","review":"This can be a good product for a small company - when and if you can start it!The major problem is that it is very often very difficult to start. The program takes forever to start and usually freezes.Checking on the QB Forum, it seems that I am not alone.

I will be looking now for a new database system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickbooks tech help","review":"After installing my QB for Mac, it began asking for me to register. To do this you must call Intuit's customer service line to obtain your registration#. When I called, the service reps spoke very bad English and were barely understandable. They gave me a registration# that didn't work, then tried to sell me tech support for a mere $39.00 a month. When I asked to speak to a manager I was left on hold twice for nearly an hour. They then told me to call a tech support # which was a recording and totally useless. The software does not come w/instructions so this forces you to buy a manual or purchase their tech support. What a fleecing of the customer this is. Absolutely non-existent customer service or help of any kind. I would highly recommend purchasing another small business software as Intuit is misleading for customers at $200+for the disc.

Even when it works, it is painfully slow and crashes frequently. I tried the new version since I now have Vista. It is no better. Although it promises to work with Outlook, it apparently doesn't work with Microsoft Outlook Exchange. Every time I try to sync it just crashes.

Intuit is aware of this bug, but has no fix for it.In my 20-odd years of doing software technical support, we had a name for this type of bug, and it was \\"showstopper\\". Reputable companies fixed these bugs before releasing product to customers.It's interesting to note that Quickbooks itself doesn't suffer from this problem, indicating that Intuit knows how to support multiple resolutions, but, for some reason refuses to do it in Customer Manager.Update----------Intuit has refunded the purchase price of this product. If and when they fix this bug,we'll consider applying the refund toward the updated version."},{"rating":"1","title":"No network support","review":"We received this and even reading the box it was not clear if it really supported networking. We called Intuit, finally, before installing (Intuit won't accept a return once their products are installed - you can't 'give back' the license as you can with adobe software, so no one else can ever license it either, but that's a separate annoyance). To our shock there is no way to share data files on a network. This makes the product useless in our case, or by anyone with more than one user. We returned it unopened for a refund. Intuit did make some vague statement that they were working on a better version. We hope so... as is, it's not ready for us to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly implemented software / Badly needed software","review":"Perhaps for a single user environment this may be good enough software. However, as soon as you add more users the synchronization process is awful. First you need to synchronize with Quickbooks, and then synchronize with the \\"depot\\" (i.e. other Customer Manager users). Many times data is garbled or duplicated during the synchronization process. We spend sometimes hours cleaning up the garbled/duplicated data. Why wouldn't Intuit integrate the Customer Manager program completely into Quickbooks and make it a truly multi-user program?Another annoying problem: Users can only view e-mails that they saved into a Customer or Project folder if those were saved by themselves. That is, the program does not save the data into the database but rather save a link to the Outlook program of the user. One user cannot view e-mails saved by another users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Don't get this.","review":"I bought 2 copies of Customer Manager for my office. It worked pretty well at first until you sync it. It messes up Quickbooks. Contacts had their own Quickbooks customer accounts. In so many words, double entry. Made tracking very difficult. It also screwed up Outlook when it was syncing with that too. I can't even uninstall it now. Save your money and just use the notes feature in Quickbooks to work on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought 2.0 was bad","review":"I have used this upgrade for about four months now. The biggest piece of junk ever. I had 2.0 and had problems. The customer service person talked me into upgrading to 2.5. Now my databases in both Quickbooks and customer manager are all messed up. They combine random people together or totally change a group of customers to list them by first name. How great when you have 25 Johns, etc. I use the calender for contacting customers when they are due for service. It has messed this up so bad that I am constantly missing names on my list and it tells me a customer is due for service when it isn't. At least with 2.0 it kept things more organized. I wish I would have stuck with that, and it was bad enough. It just gets worse with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mount - for ceiling mounted displays","review":"I bought this stand in Dec 2006, and it's been supporting my 42\\" plasma ever since. I wanted my TV to be mounted above my fireplace, but didn't want to drill holes into the tilework, so the only solution was to hang the TV from the ceiling. Additionally, my fireplace is recessed from the main wall, so the area in which a mount can be attached is only about 4\\" wide. I did a lot of searching, looking at pictures, reading reviews, scrutinizing installation instructions. This seemed like the best solution. And it was.

It's a quick, easy read about a true Saint that will make you want to be a better person. If you want to see an example of true piety read this book. I can't recommend it highly enough, both for the clear writing as well as the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Function over Form","review":"Kingma's book is a breath of fresh air in that she asserts that traditional monogamous marriage isn't the ultimate form of intimate relationship; that it isn't a \\"one size fits all\\" relationship that everyone must aspire to. She outlines several different nontraditional forms that intimate relationships may take, each equally valid and suitable depending upon each person's individual needs and desires.I would have given the book five stars, but I had to wade through quite a bit of superfluous psychobabble in order to get to the core message of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expanding our horizons on love","review":"This book has amazing insight into love & relationships.

This is an adventurous, yet melodic and playful recording. Andrew Hill was one of the best composers to emerge in 60s and he's accompanied by a sympatico crew. Bobby Hutcherson was a frequent bandmate and he makes his usual splash on vibes. Richard Davis was a go-to guy on bass and you'll here why on this recording. He provides excellent support and gorgeous solos. Joe Chambers on drums is another of this group's strong composers. Although less renowned than some of the other stellar drummers on Hill recordings- Jones, Haynes, Williams- he is more attuned to the music. And the bonus is the documentation of John Gilmore's ext-RA excursions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cable...","review":"Great Cable... Replaced the Belkin PureAV cable which was about $50 more.

I've purchase monster cable at their outrageously high prices and wanted to try something else. Guess I learned my lesson. Now 3 months later, I seriously doubt that the seller is going to exchange the cable for me. Monster has a lifetime, not that you would use it as I've had their cable for over 15 years.

Is this some kind of a marketing ploy or what?Anyway, I am still waiting for one really good Eddie Rabbitt compilation and hopefully Rhino Music will oblige soon. The good songs in this album are the remarkable \\"Suspicions\\" and \\"I can't help myself\\".

I was planning on switching to all or mostly organic, but my budget just woulnd't have allowed that, so I picked up this book at the library to help me decide what to buy. For example, I'm going to keep buying regular skim milk because there were nearly no presticide residues found in it, but because pesticides hold in fats, there were a lot found in whole milk, cheese, and butter, because of the fat, so I plan to buy those organic. It also made me realize hormones in milk and meat were probably not as much of a problem as organic advocates would have you believe. I plan to buy organic fruits and veggies, and I'm still deciding on meats. These authors don't recommend all organic, but they don't seem to be in the pocket of the big farms OR the organic growers. They form their own conclusions and opinions. Great and helpful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More confused than before","review":"In the attempts of the authors to provide an unbiased opinion of Organic foods, they created a book that seems to contradict itself. The beginning starts good as it describes the Organic movement and helps to decipher Organic labels. As you get further into the book, especially the chapter on dairy and milk you begin to get confused. The book atempts to explain the different pesticides, hormones and residues in milk but leaves you more confused about what is acceptable and what is unpreventable. The book completely lost me when it compared food items and tried to convince me that boxed Mac and Cheese with Yellow #5, Yellow #6 and tripolyphosphate was just as healthy as the organic version that did not contain anything artifically engineered. You can decide for yourself but personally I felt this book was written by authors who felt the need to buy Organic foods was foolish and not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very biased","review":"I believe that these authors received a big kickback from large factory farms and big business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive look for a low price","review":"This little digital gem of a clock exactly matches the wood on our family room entertainment center, where it clearly displays the correct time for us day and night.

In matters of rhythm, meter, rhyme, shape and form, he is a sculptor, a magician.Check out these tercets from \\"First Snow in Alsace,\\" remembering that Wilbur saw pretty much three years of straight combat in World War Two:The snow came down last night like mothsBurned on the moon; it fell till dawn,Covered the town with simple cloths.Absolute snow lies rumpled onWhat shellbursts scattered and deranged,Entangled railings, crevassed lawn.You think: beyond the town a mileOr two, this snowfall fills the eyesOf soldiers dead a little while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Library Star","review":"This collection of the poems of Richard Wilbur is in several ways a gem. Not only does it contain the bulk of the works of Wilbur, who is one of the very few major poets of our era, it is also that rarity in today's publishing industry; that is, a beautiful book, well printed on good quality paper in a most readable typeface, and elegantly bound. Wilbur's work is notable for his affinity with the poetry of Europe and elsewhere. His translations from the French, in particular, are all of a high standard. Wilbur is not afraid to write verse which has rhyme, rhythm, and elegance. This is a book to be treasured."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"I originally bought this movie to see Eric Lloyd, it turned out to be a complete bomb. There is no plot, it is incredibly weird, lacking any sense of anything. All that happens is him and his mom go from town to town stealing what they can from unsuspecting strangers to survive. It will leave you thinking \\"what was that\\" and have you looking for some normality for an hour or two later. There is nothing to grasp. If you were thinking about buying it to see Eric, it's not worth it, go see him in something else worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, unpleasant film","review":"LUMINOUS MOTION is the kind of mess that just can't escape certain people who praise it because it's so \\"offbeat\\" and \\"different\\" and \\"low key\\". Yes, it is all three of those and I myself certainly like something offbeat, different and low key in my movies too. However, those qualities don't necessisarly translante into \\"Good\\".And LUMINOUS MOTION is definitely NOT a good or even OK film. In fact, it's pretty bad. It's not that it's badly acted...Eric Lloyd is very good. The film goes way overboard with the \\"motion\\" theme, pummeling it to death. People also apparently don't mind that this boy ends up doing some pretty nasty things in this movie. It left me feeling empty and depressed with hardly anyone likable or redeeming in it. The movie rambles on and on with occasional fringes into the surreal. Surreal stuff like this is tricky to handle, and LUMINOUS MOTION can't get a handle on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in many respects","review":"The designers of these speakers tried to skimp on cabling, putting form over function. The maddeningly short USB cable and interconnect cable between left and right speaker make it very difficult to stand the speakers up and align them without pulling them off their feet and knocking them over. Overall sound quality is passable for the size but the glaring deficiency in design overrides any other factors.

The box was beaten and gouged. Needless to say the contents were affected by the poor packaging and delivery. I tried twice to get replacements for the broken parts but both times the rep at Black and Decker sent me the wrong parts. My only option now is to travel 50 miles to a service center to get the parts which won't be available for another week.

Because I felt like I didn't pay for a used product. So they sent another one and this one is even worst! So I got my refund. Too bad...I really wanted it. I guess the people here keep sending people the same packages others shipped back because I noticed a lot of people is complaining about this same issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparable to other Workmates","review":"Bought one at close-out for $50 at Home Depot. It's basically like all the other Workmate products with the addition of being a medium-duty hand-truck as well.It's resonably easy to collapse into the hand-truck from a work table and reasonably sturdy. I think it's easier to assemble to being a workstand or truck than the 425 model I also own. A little lower than I'd prefer as a work surface, but compactness has its price.One reviewer complained about the stamped steel construction. The price does not allow for anything else. Besides, the stand is surprisingly sturdy. I think it is supposed to hold ~400 lb. Not bad for stamped steel.I deduct one star because the conversion between forms is a little awkward and as a truck it does not stand up with much stability (tilts forward).- nopcbs"},{"rating":"1","title":"useable but very limited and surprisingly fragile","review":"You'll be able to do some LIGHT handymanjobs with this apparatus.

Drawing on Jewish sources, Rabbi Toperoff presents a line-by-line commentary on the entire text of Avot (which is presented both in Hebrew and in English translation). At the end of each section is a brief selection of relevant remarks from Hasidic lore.The resulting 440-page volume will be a helpful addition to the library of anyone who wants a thorough, accessible, and Tradition-based commentary on Jewish ethics.

My tender-hearted girl who doesn't watch much TV (we do watch some Veggie Tales together) just couldn't get past that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but with surprises","review":"My expectation was to receive a Curious George DVD.

I actually own a Harley-Davidson Softail and I thought that it would be fun to have a game for the cold snowy days when I couldn't ride. I thought wrong. I would personally rather attempt to ride my 650lb bike on ice rather than have to play this game one more time.

Do not waste your time or money with this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Their Hits In One Spot","review":"A great collection of all the Devo songs the average listener would want.

(Whhua-ttcchh) Whip It Good!\\" Devo (standing for de-evolution of the species in general) has, I think, always been Revo (revolutionary) music-wise since they debuted way back in the early '70's. These five \\"spud-boys\\" from Akron, Ohio performed some mighty cool-sounding rock-pop tunes, not actually officially fitting into anny music catagory. My favorites on this CD would have to be \\"Here To Go\\" (Go Mix version, the longest track they've ever done, it seems), \\"Through Being Cool\\" (from the \\"Heavy Metal\\" soundtrack), \\"Big Mess\\", \\"That's Good\\", \\"Jerking Back And Forth\\", their remake of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", \\"Girl U Want\\", \\"Smart Patrol/Mr. DNA\\", and \\"Working In The Coal Mine\\" (also from \\"Heavy Metal\\", and also, used as the short-lived NBC sitcom \\"Working\\" theme song). Even their misses are cool, sort of like experimental B-sides. Until next time, spuds, Duty Now For The Future! Booji Boy out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good but for one omission...","review":"I can argue against 5 stars because of the omission of \\"Love Without Anger\\", a well-known song that isn't even included on \\"Greatest Misses\\".

He's a father of two (6 and 10) and even the kids loved this CD. We ended up listening to it on Christmas day in my nephew's new CD player. It has all of their hits!

GET IT GET IT GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Devo Collections","review":"Sixteen great songs at a budget price. Can't go wrong here. This collection represents DEVO at their most enthusiastic, pop smart best. It also shows how slickly they pioneered the synth heavy dance sound that so many imitated through the eighties. The classics are all here (\\"Whip It,\\" \\"Jocko Homo,\\" \\"Satisfaction,\\") as well as a bunch of should have beens, like \\"That's Good\\" and \\"Here To Go.\\" These were the songs that powered a lot of college new wave dance nights, pogo ready with sing-a-long chorus/slogans like \\"Through Being Cool\\" and \\"Jerking Back and Forth.\\"The only way to get more is to move up to \\"Pioneers That Got Scalped\\" for the post \\"Shout\\" material, but then you have to wade through that double CD's overkill of irrelevant extras. It's a safe bet to have this and the \\"Greatest Misses,\\" which shows off more of DEVO's wild musical side. As for subversive pop in the MTV age, this was the best there was.HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once is enough, thank you","review":"Ironically, the songs are easier to appreciate when you can listen to one song occasionally rather than many collectively. I did enjoy hearing these songs again, but I couldn't do it in one sitting. The one joke theme of Devo is their dehumanized song styling, very stilted and deficient. Unfortunately, the punch line becomes very tedious quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the thing","review":"This acoustic jazz guitar/bass album continues to amaze me. Alden's talent and technique are dazzling, and Lesberg really gets things swinging. A must-have if you have love jazz guitar, especially if you appreciate the acoustic archtop guitar sound. Black Beauty is the standout track, but it's misleading to single one song out, they're all incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last! Someone who listens to kids!","review":"So many people who criticize media violence mean well, but don't appear to know any children personally. The author of this book does.You can see it in his writing. He describes his own childhood reaction to media violence, and then he describes his son's, and those of children he's taught. No two kids react in the same way. It's these individuals -- and the author's respect for them as individuals -- that makes this book so useful.As a life-long pacifist who grew up loving action movies, I appreciate the book's validation of my own experience. And as a mother trying to raise a responsible, stable son, it gave me insight into what he was going through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk science","review":"I must admit that I do not understand the glowing reviews given to this book. The author, a man in the entertainment industry, is defending his job by turning the tables on his critics. Where study after study show links between entertainment violence and real-world violence, the author uses anecdotal evidence to suggest that the link is actually inverted, that is that entertainment violence *decreases* real-world violence.I read the book from cover to cover, and found his arguments unconvincing. What I wish the author had addressed is the success of advertising. Companies, the world over, spend vast fortunes on advertising, because what is seen influences what one does, and not in an inverted relationship.If you feel compelled to read this book, then I most heartily recommend that you read it with an open mind to what the author is both saying, and what he is not saying. This book is more junk-science served up by a corporate insider to support corporate profits."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Premise , False Conclusion","review":"Of course children need great methods of dispersing anger (drive discharge psychological model), however as our household saying goes \\"you can't shoot people or pets\\". With TODAY'S estimated 10,000 media witnessingings of killing or maiming for kids during their youth only, we are in a different world than the author grew up in, period. When this author grew up, fantasy was clearly out of the bounds of real life; cowboys, indians and aliens. Our little imprinting offspring, hardwired to do so, live in and are buoyant in oppressing instances of REAL violence and now know all too well that violence is not FANTASY or a rare, crazy bank robber. It is everywhere, seeping in as more and more NORMAL. Being aggressive is not wrong, its how they do it, hmmmm, oh yeah, just like us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right place for politics","review":"This book is another attempt to politicize issues related to kids. Any evidence suggested in here is based on the authors' views; that, or he has found a very few \\"educators\\" and \\"experts\\" who regurgitate his words. It is abundantly apparent that the book was NOT written with the best interests of children in mind...rather, it was intended to further the authors' political viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enlightened and compassionate view","review":"The book, however, as one reviewer below noted, is \\"bloated.\\" It's a bit too long. It's also a bit erratic--some parts are quite entertaining and thought-provoking; others, not so much. Besides those criticisms, I enjoyed this work thoroughly. The author makes a simple point that many people fail to understand--there is a difference between fantasy and reality. Kids playing violent games, which they have done since the beginning of the human race, are playing. To assume there is a direct cause-and-effect between kids playing and becoming violent when they grow up is not only bad science, but utterly lacking in common sense. Some below have engaged in ad hominen attacks against the author; they're assuming they can read his mind. Critics should instead read the book, and understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the positives, negatives, and possibles clear!","review":"As a drama teacher who works with a lot of urban and low-income young people, this book really helped me understand why they're drawn tothe kinds of stories they are, where it works well and where it can go wrong, and how to get positively involved in their imaginations. Recommended to anyone who works with kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at kids, violence and fantasy","review":"As a forensic psychologist who specializes in youth violence, I found \\"Killing Monsters\\" a must for anyone in the mental health field. It gives a different perspective on how kids use violence to ward off feelings of powerlessness--one of the main causes of kids becoming violent in the first place. In a society that expells kids for drawing pictures of guns or writing violent essays, Mr. Jones is a lone voice in the quest for rational thought on the topic of media violence and its impact on youth. The book is fabulous and well worth the purchase price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only half right","review":"This book makes a valid point that children do need to connect somehow with those angry, violent, hateful feelings that we all have inside of us. However, the authors acknowledge (near the end of the book) that when children get stuck in fantasies of violence they really do not have a way of growing beyond them. When media violence does not offer children (and adults as well) a way to move past the violent feelings and fantasies that grip them, they do no one a service. That is why the glut of violence in children's media is a problem. Instead of using this book to justify past creative endeavors in the comic book world, the authors would have done better to explore ways of storytelling that would actually help children grow beyond those violent feelings. This book is only half right, and the authors left out the rest of the story... what a child needs after connecting with the painful, disturbing, angry feelings and fantasies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Antidote for \\"Conventional Wisdom\\"","review":"Given how deeply the \\"media violence is bad\\" meme has sunk into our national consciousness at this point, it's great to see a concise and coherent refutation available.

Just pick up Bill Capodagli and Lynn Jackson's book describing the ten key success secrets of the Disney Company. The secrets derive from four basic tenets: dream, believe, dare and do. The authors show how these principles led to Walt Disney's success, and how other companies can use them. They include a Disney history to illustrate how the company has applied its principles from films to video to theme parks - including how Disney has learned from its problems and failures. They provide examples of how other companies have applied the Disney Way. We [...] recommend this excellent book to anyone with an interest in business strategy or marketing. While the principles it outlines may be familiar, Capodagli and Jackson demonstrate in an original way just how these principles can contribute to success beyond the Magic Kingdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"THOUGHTFUL CASE HISTORY OF SOME EFFECTIVE DISNEY PRACTICES","review":"If you have not already read and heard enough about the Disney management approach, you should definitely read this book. I think it is the best case history on Disney that bridges both the original management and the current team. However, do not be mislead into thinking that you now have a golden key to the kingdom (even if you are studying the Magic Kingdom). No one company does very many things well.Actually, the Disney case history is primarily one of how to overcome Communications Stalls (the most common and pernicious form of behavior that delays human progress).By the way, Disney still has room to improve [but] Disney at its best is wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Although interesting in many ways, I find it to be a major snooze fest.

Some of these cartoons do have colour, but most seem stuck in the fairly plain wackiness of early American animation. Of course, anything Betty Boop is craaaaazy and trailblazing in that style, but too many are a series of bland rip-offs or racial stereotypes. There's one Robert Clampett cartoon and it's not even any good.What I liked best was the puppet animation (an obvious kind of gimmickry) the characters are at least more interesting.You'd be better off with 'Masters of Russian Animation', 'Animation Show' (which is fairly current), or the feature-film, 'Fantastic Planet' which is incredible!

Maintenance is simple. I clean mine immediately after we finish our meal with a bristle brush. No soap. I dry it very well. Then I rub vegetable oil over the entire pot and lid inside and out. I have had no problems with rust like some have. It did come preseasoned but I still rubbed vegetable oil heavily all over it then put it in the oven at 400 for an hour to season it some more(go to their website and follow their instructions).

Cast issues are obvious. Production values are surprisingly high, and take an otherwise bizarre, absurd concept into watchable territory. Frankly, the movie concept is not at all interesting, and will largely appeal to fans of D&D. Further, the gradual unfolding of the story leaves far too much to be wanted; it simply makes little sense and cannot rely on a David Lynch or Tarrantino level of artful telling to save it. There are a few scenes featuring battles with monstrous figures; the figure are, putting it mildly, laughably bad. Perhaps that was the intent (in an Army of Darkness kind of way, there are obvious parallels), but the whole thing just fails.

I have found some of the free titles to be disappointing, but until this book I have always plodded through to the end. This book was just not worth my time. I found it extremely unrealistic how the male hero announced to the female lead that he was a werewolf.

What happened to the wedding? Who was the old man? a lot of questions cropped up and there was nothing indicating a book two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had a hard time believing this was Ellora's Cave. They should have hired a better editor! I can usually accept some editing problems if the book has other redeeming qualities, but I found the characters kind of annoying, both the way they acted and the way they spoke to each other. And a number of the interactions between the hero and heroine were unbelievable to me. The sex scenes didn't even do it for me. I found myself flipping through the book to get to them, and then not really caring about them when I found them. I love romance and erotica, but found this book disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for free but don't pay for it","review":"i am kind of offended that the price of this book is now $6.00. it was one thing to get it for free and be disappointed but to charge that much for something this medocre is terrible. the story was rushed with the beginnings of two other storylines plugged in to hint at future books when the actual story we were on needed more substance to hold its own. i liked the male characters but sophie left a lot to be desired. there were so many things wrong here i can't even list them but another review hit on the majority. buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall poorly written, with a few good elements","review":"Plot moves pretty quickly, and the main character Sophie has a decent amount of back story. The author tried to weave in another storyline about a half werewolf that is just finding out who he is and what happened to his mom, however I don't think this was done particularly well. In fact, it seems like it was added to make the story seem like it had more depth.The four brothers were fun to read about; protective, manly, good looking, loving...all around good package.I don't think this story was thought out very well, and it shows. Easy read with romance and a good amount of detailed sex (though it seemed to get kind of repetitive). Did not have a clear myth as to how/why there are werewolves, which was a bit disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I expected but still five star worthy","review":"Despite what i read on the first couple reviews of this book i really enjoyed it. It was a sweet story and though it didnt have any big drama, besides the baby and him being a werewolf, not all stories have to be action packed or in this case packed with sex either. It was a good read and will probably read it again in the future when i need a simple good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the first one free, but bought the rest!","review":"I liked the product description, read all the reviews, and still decided to take the leap. I'm glad I did! If you've read the Magnus Pack series by Shelly Laurenston and liked it, then I think you'll also like this series.I liked the close-knit family aspect and the do-anything-for-my-mate heroes. No, the series doesn't require a lot of deep thought to read, but it is enjoyable. I finished each book in an afternoon.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the language. However, I read Laurenston's series and it is covered in language too, so it didn't totally put me off. It just made me cringe a little.This series is a keeper, and I can see myself rereading the books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"OK I got this thinking it would be more like the series by Patricia Briggs or Susan Krinard. IT IS NOT! This is more like the stuff you would see on Cinemax late at night.

Never did I guess the true genius of Johnny Costa on the piano until I hear this album! For those Tatum lovers out there, Johnny Costa is as close as you'll come. While Peterson has the tremendous left hand and overall technique, his style is more chordal than Costa's. Costa has captured the essence of Tatum's stride piano style with the walking left hand and the rambling right hand solo counterpoint. Listening to this album made my hair stand on end.

I found the filter to be very clear and superior in quality. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the knurled portion for making adjustments is on the front of the filter as opposed to the side, as I have seen in other brands or thicker filters. It is somewhat difficult to turn the filter while setting up the shot and looking through the viewfinder at the same time, which causes fingers to come in contact with the glass portion of the lense, thus fingerprints. Other than that, I highly reccomend this product for its quality and lightness.

They are absolutely covered with marks from the flatware. - Ours are the made in China variety if that is a factor in their quality.We have not ever had this kind of problem with the previous Pfaltzgraff sets we have owned. I would not buy again, in fact we are planning to take the remaining good pieces and give them to Goodwill and start over, probably with a set made by someone else.

If you don't get them off, the plates look gross and believe me, it's a chore to get the marks off, only to have them come back after the next meal. I've found that a can of Zud and a load of elbow grease will eventually get the marks off but it's just not worth the effort anymore. I can't recommend this set unless Pfaltzgraff stops ignoring the problem and deals with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"These dishes make me sad...","review":"I searched and searched for new everyday dishes and looked at french quarter a long time before I decided to purchase. I LOVE the design. As soon as I used them, I started getting the silverware markings. I tried the pfaltzgraff recommended cleaner but it doesn't work well enough to remove the marks, only lighten them a little. The cereal bowls, dinner plates and serving bowl and platter are all marked. Now the platter is cracked and broken, and it was NEVER dropped or banged. Every time I look at these dishes it makes me sad. I loved the pattern so but they look just awful. I am tired of making apologies to my guests. Pfaltzgraff says that the marking is NOT a defect. WHAT? Everytime I use them I have to apply a special acidic cleaner and let them sit in a vain attempt to remove marks? Sorry pfaltzgraff, you blew it and won't admit it.

But after receiving the dishes, I see what he's talking about.

It's nice to hear lyrics and music that assume you have an intelligence level well above a primitive Neanderthal! The only sad thing about this CD is it doesn't have a wider distribution. Kerry Livgren gave us a wonder taste of intelligent music as a member of Kansas. Now, with his spiritual growth over the years, you have a CD that speaks to the basic questions of life in songs like \\"Sentinel\\" and \\"Hindsight\\", while you soar up to heaven with \\"Navigator\\".

What took 2,000 years to accomplish has been destroyed by one idiodic book. The subject matter is fascinating, but the legacy of the Jew has always been hard work.

These three men continue to create and shape popular culture by giving us some of the most creative, powerful, and entertaining works of the past decade. Mr. Oseary's lastest offering combines his vast knowledge of the music business with his close ties to his faith. The result is a great annual of rockers, (some of who you knew were Jewish, many others will surprise you). The book offers vital stats, interesting info, and links together a multitude of rockers who share both music and roots in Judaism. I loved it. It will make a great gift for anyone. Easy to read, and perfect to have around for easy reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful book riddled with errors","review":"a fun topic for a gift book, sure to bring a few chuckles... but poorly researched and very thin on biographical information. As one reviewer has already noted, the book is a total toss-off, no great effort went into its compilation. no informaion is provided abut parentage (i.e. Phil Och's father was Jewish, his mother's family was Scottish), there is absolutely no attempt to speculate how a Jewish background has impacted the artist's work, and there are quite a few 'heroes' missing, i.e. Peter Perrett of The Only Ones.

For example, when giving the title of the legendary Al Kooper's book, they got it wrong. Also had Bob Dylan graduating from the University of Minnesota at 18 (he left after one year to begin his career). In addition, when giving credits to songs written by Robbie Robertson on The Band's debut album, of the two songs listed, one, \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\", had no involvement in writing by Robertson (it was written by Rick Danko and Bob Dylan). And these are only examples which I know about from my own knowledge.....I'm sure they aren't the only ones. Whoever was hired as the fact-checker on this book, should be sued for taking their pay under false pretenses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Topic, Lazy Book","review":"For those interested in all things Judaic and rock n' roll, \\"Jews who Rock\\" seemed like a most welcome book, but the actual product is purely tossed-off. Most of the inclusions are obvious, and despite a few surprises, highly dubious (Robbie Robertson, who has acknowledged his Native American roots through his music and in many interviews, is Jewish? And John Phillips? How?) Or simply untrue -- Lenny Kravitz may have a Jewish father, but he is an avowed Christian, and hence not a Jew who Rocks. Moreover, the \\"did you know\\" factoids are bland,oft-reported,and generally reveal nothing about the artist's relationship to Judaism. Why didn't Oseary bother to ask any of the artists about how they personally relate to Judaism, or how Judaism informs their music? Only Perry Farrell's typically cosmic, but reverant, essay suggests the book that might have been with greater research and insight. Hardly the definitive book on an otherwise fascinating subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iggy isn't Jewish.","review":"I have not read the book. I leafed through it in a book store. What can I add that others haven't already said. The one page bios are superficial and there are many mistakes and omissions.I response to the reviewer who said that Iggy is Jewish. Well he isn't. I read his autobiography about 12 years ago. I think he said his father was an orphan who had been adopted by a non-practicing Jewish family. But he wasn't brought up Jewish.

Typical Sociology-oriented stuff about discrimination and whatnot. Not worth reading unless you need it for class. A decent textbook, though, if you need one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Propaganda","review":"The only reason why I ever had this book in my possession is because it was required for a college class that I was taking. I can't believe that colleges actually require this information to be taught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"I never received this book. Apparently it had been sold to someone else the same time I bought it - that's fine, however, I had to write numerous emails inquiring on the status of the book.

Avoid college classes which require this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a college student, required to read this garbage","review":"I have an extremely left, liberal Sociology teacher, so of course I am forced to buy this book. I attend the California State system and ALL students are required to take a race and ethnicity class in order to complete their degree. The teacher comes across as, and in my opinion, very anti-American. The teacher WANTS us to think that way, so therefore, this book is his number 1 choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft Rock at its Best","review":"\\"Cerulean\\" is one of the best soft rock albums ever recorded. Tuneful without ever being sugary or schmaltzy, it contains excellent songwriting, good singing and just enough rock tempo to keep it from feeling wimpy. The single \\"Ballerina Out of Control,\\" is the best song. But there are a number of other great tracks, including \\"Questions of Travel,\\" \\"Cerulean,\\" and \\"Marigold.\\" In fact, this is one of those rare albums that contains no weak tracks and maintains a strong consistency throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy, flowing, lush sonic perfection! Like BUTTAH!","review":"TOB is one of America's severely underrated bands, period. The synergy and talent these guys achieve on this, and several other TOB releases, is pure magic. Their soothing music flows through you and lifts your spirits with it's beauty and wonderful layered aural textures. How utterly fitting is the fact that they are from Hershey, PA (and surrounding environs), given their pure milk-chocolatey, creamy, sweet sound that melts into you! To me, this is up there with releases like The Church's \\"After Everything Now This\\", or The Cocteau Twins \\"Blue Bell Knoll\\". TOB forever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part 2 of a 4 part Masterful discography!","review":"I wont say more than this CD is REQUIRED! All 4 of T.O.B. releases are works of pure talent. Cerulean is all the great things people say about it and more. I have heard no other band that can be compared to The Ocean Blue and doubt i ever will. Strictly in a class all their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is TOB's most earnest and best work...buy it now!","review":"If you can only buy one Ocean Blue CD, get this one. By far, this is their best effort. You less of Lau's jazzy sax as on their debut, but they seem to be writting better songs, and in general it's a more polished act as a whole. If you want to relax, but \\"Cerulean\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"weakest of all OB's LPs","review":"I'm boggled by the amount of 5-star reviews of this, the weakest of all Ocean Blue albums. There's really only one standout track on here--\\"Ballerina Out of Control.\\"How can anyone not see that either Beneath The Rhythm And Sound or See have way more listenable tunes on them?This album just sounds like a whole lot of filler to these ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - what happend?","review":"I can't go along with the crowd on this one. I got a copy of the demo tape for the debut album and have enjoed it for years. Recently picked up the first album w/all tracks and it was good (unreleased demo version of \\"drifting falling\\" better though). Purchased Cerulan and was surprised by the lack of \\"edge\\". Songs seem deliberately soft without the new wave CHINKA-CHINKA that marked the first effort. You could play most on a easy listening station and not raise an eyebrow. I read the reviews that the 3rd and final album cuts a bit harder - I'll give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this one!","review":"This is one of the better Ocean Blue albums (though I like them all.) Good for listening while at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is The Ocean Blue's Masterpiece","review":"Although I am big music fan I am never one to gush. But these guys stole my heart over 10 years ago and Cerulean by far is their masterpiece. The album was produced as an album not an attempt at the top 40 charts. Every song flows into the next with the opener \\"Breezing Up\\" a real knockout. I've listened to other bands from the late 80's and their work sounds dated but TOB still sound amazingly fresh. I never tire of their sound after all this time which says something about the testament of David Schelzel's song writing. Even the photography is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Playfull....","review":"If you want to get into the music of the Ocean Blue, I guess this would be the one to start of first of you haven't heard them yet. Playful melodies and lyrics are what best describes the songs on this magnificent album.This ranks among one of my fave CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful","review":"I guess it's already been said, but I'd like to add my two cents anyway. Beauty and simplicity and beauty again is the theme and signature of this superb album. Completely removed from all cynicism and darkness, the songs all have a guileless charm that always gives a warm feeling inside; clear and fresh as sea breezes, appreciating and looking forward to all the simple pleasures of life and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, depressing, not very insightful.","review":"You wonder if she is holding back, or just plain out of the loop in regards to her father's business.

As commented in a previous review, it is a rather wide backpack. Much less flex in the outer shell than a 'normal' backpack. Although I like the built-in CORE protection, I'm may get a Brenthaven expandable Trek backpack for everyday use. It does not have the CORE system, but does have more pockets and a more standard backpack form factor.

The first one was fine, but the second is starting to unravel. There is a screw to attach the strap to the wrap around the cane. The fabric is starting to unravel from the screw, with the chance that the strap's attachment to the cane can be lost. I've used the second strap in the very same manner as used on the first cane.

Daniel still has problems relating to his wife Sha'uri and visa versa. I liked when Skaara made her realize what her attitude had done in relation to hurting their people. In some respects it is like a soap opera: are they going to get together or not. The cliffhanger at the end of the book makes you wonder will Daniel and Sha'uri work things out before it is to late. They seem to prove the adage that falling in love is easy, staying in love is hard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one","review":"The last book did leave room open for one more but it did seem like it would be the end.

Not since House of Spirits have I enjoyed such a descriptive narration. The book is funny and insightful. I loved every page. I look forward to more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensuous treat","review":"If you love language and revel in its subtle crafting, this is the book for you. A short, dreamlike read that recounts a simple, sweet story of a middle-class family that finds it may have a young guru in its midst. How each family member reacts to this matter is the meat of the book. (A bit thin in story, yes, but I can't shake the feeling that there is a great political satire here that I am not quite smart enough to figure out.) Either way--enjoy this treat and watch for more from this wonderful author."},{"rating":"2","title":"For any human with a sense of humor","review":"I'd like to add my two cents' worth to the question of whether this book was written \\"for a western audience\\" - nonsense! It's for anyone, Western or Eastern, Southern or Northern, as long as they enjoy a funny story and an unerring, sharp-eyed take on humanity. And, not to get technical, but this book follows a traditional Indian form of literature, the story of the reluctant guru (of which probably RK Narayan's classic \\"The Guide\\" is the best-known example in the West). And the humor (speaking as someone who has lived there) is very typically Indian. It's really a wonderful book - to be enjoyed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This is a book that anyone looking for humour with a large portion of wisdom will enjoy.Sampat's initial retreat from the town and ultimate retreat into himself is very well conceptualized.

What for?","review":"Kiran Desai's debut novel came with praise from all quarters - reputable ones, I might add - and therefore the sense of disappointment was perhaps all the more acute. Everything is there - great style, wonderful wit, wonderfully drawn characters that remind you of Catch-22: well, everything except a plot. Had it been a short story, I would have loved it. As a 176-page full-length novel, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiran Desai is India's Charles Dickens","review":"I couldn't help but compare Kiran Desai with Mr. Dickens, the renowned master of characterization. She evokes the same gift of painting a character and breathing life into it. The situations wherein she puts these characters make for a very entertaining, hilarious reading. I have never been to India but after reading her book I can picture the old post office where Sampath worked and the marketplace where people can buy ready-made dentures! Her writing style can best be described as lyrical. I initially borrowed this book from the library but decided to have my very own copy - from Amazon.com of course. It is hard to believe that this is her first novel! I hope she's working on a sequel because not only do I miss the characters but a talent like Desai deserves to be read by more people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really funny...","review":"This novel was selected for our book club this month. While its cover claims this is supposed to be funny, most of us didn't find it to be such. Several of us agreed that perhaps certain scenes might have been entertaining to WATCH in a Ballywood-style film, but reading about them was more odd and strange than humorous. Perhaps it was the delivery; like a joke in the hands of a \\"joke-killer,\\" the author seems to butcher the scene before it has a chance. Desai should stick to serious literature because she clearly has some talent in that area. Save the funny stuff for someone else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like stupid people.","review":"I realize this book is supposed to be a comedy. And if you like Homer Simpson, or Phoebe and Joey from Friends, you may love this book. But stories about people who are completely stupid irritate me. I hate Homer Simpson, and I didn't like Phoebe and Joey from Friends, either. If you hate stupid people, you will hate this book.This book is filled with people who are so stupid, it certainly would explain why India is a third world country.However, I've read other books by Indian authors and I know India is NOT peopled entirely with idiots.I don't need to reiterate the plot, as plenty of other reviewers have done that for me. I will only tell you this book is not funny. Quite frankly, I'm baffled why this author is so celebrated, as The Inheritance of Loss sucked also, although for different reasons.Skip this. If you want a good novel by/about India, read The Hero's Walk by Anita Rau Badami, or anything by Thrity Umrigar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, colorful, a delight to read...","review":"I came across this book by chance with no preconceptions or set expectations (apart from what may have existed from my prior exposure to Indian authors). I found the whole book to be a delight -- colorful, fast-paced, descriptive. It combined good humor with political consciousness and seemed like an affectionate twitting of family roles and traditions of the neighborhood, town and society as a whole. Some of the events, taken by themselves, may certainly seem over the top (like something out of an Indian \\"Life of Brian\\"! -- if you're familiar with the Monty Python film of that name), but the author skillfully layers events so that she creates an internal logic that supports and propels the action, no matter how far out she goes. (And she does go pretty far out!) All in all, a captivating, rollicking, marvelous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls Gone Wild on Campus 3","review":"Not worth it!

I rank the first two volumes of this series as some of the best girls gone wilds ever made. Volume three make rank as the worst.

Updated coverage of the fossil record focuses on broad general groups of early hominids; principles of miroevolution show shown as they apply to the modern human species; the concept of race is thoroughly discussed from a biological and evolutionary perspective; and new interpretations of the number of species of early Homo and Neanderthal DNA are explored.

Races formed or \\"evolved\\" in adaptation to their environments and created different cultures to express themselves and survive in their environments to the best of their ability. Humans were created by God and this book only shows how difficult the fossil record is to interpret.
