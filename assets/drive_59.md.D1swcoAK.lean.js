The last really comprehensive \\"Best\\" in this series was Richard Howard's year, but then, Howard is really an editor, a writer and reader with broad tastes, and secure enough in his own achievements that he doesn't submit to the kind of cronyism that afflicts this year's anthology. Creeley's choices are so very dull that I fear these must be buddies. I'm going to have to find another anthology for my students. This one has been disappointing too many years in a row."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's my problem....","review":"I've read this series since 1989 or so and have thought it consistently excellent. This volume, however, is almost entirely made of exceptionally eccentric poetry that will alienate almost all readers. As I read it, I kept thinking about this: Somewhere a thoughtful, educated and well-read person decides he or she will finally take time to explore what is going on in today's poetry. Our hypothetical friend goes to his or her local bookseller and finds \\"The Best American Poetry 2002\\" and understandably concludes this is an ideal book with which to start. It would likely be his or her last purchase of contemporary poetry. It's very much unbalanced and is simply not at all representative of poetry in 2002. The editor indulges his own taste for the inaccessible and quirky with no consideration for the task of presenting, well, \\"The Best American Poetry.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Besides the very fine introduction by David Lehman, this has to be the most abstruse collection of poetry I have ever read. I am a college teacher and have traditionally used the Best American series in my classes. Year after year, it has been my favorite poetry anthology. I had my students purchase this edition before I had a chance to look through it this year and I am worried that a collection like this will just fortify all their worse preconceptions about poetry: elitist, inside, arch, academic, and bloodless. It seems to be an elaborate joke played by Creeley on the whole idea of a \\"Best American Poetry\\". Could his taste possibly be so narrow? Perhaps this issue should be called \\"The Best American Language Poetry\\" or \\"The Best American Poetry out of The University of Buffalo.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Gad, what a dreadful bore! The problem is not that the poetry in this volume is experimental--it's that it's incredibly dull, hiding its lack of content, or even anti-content--its lack of new ideas--in its inscrutability. Experimental poetry is not necessarily a dead end, but from this pleasureless, drearily mannered volume you'd think it was. There's hardly a narrative poem by anyone under 50--and there's plenty of excellent young narrative poetry being written. Creeley's got his head in the sand. This is a monument to what's already over and done with. Please, David Lehman, pick somebody a little younger, a little hipper, to edit this next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately","review":"Few of the poems in this collection struck fire in me, a smaller percentage than earlier volumes in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unsurprising Disappointment","review":"Reader take note: if you are curious about contemporary poetry and are looking for an interesting place to start, this anthology is not for you. Try 2001 or 2003. Skip 2002. One of the interesting things about this series is discovering the guest editor, always a notable contemporary poet, as reader of contemporary poetry. What exactly was Robert Creeley thinking? Most of the poems in this volume are emminently forgettable; others unreadable.

The ballads are nice--Johnny Gill's ballad gives Keith Sweat's some stiff competition! 2 Live Crew's somber, message-driven In The Dust is a smart alternative to their sex-driven songs. And the surprise here was the Troop/Levert/Queen Latifah song For the Love Of Money, a strong mix of soulful R&B and the Queen's no-nonsense hip-hop style. This really was a hot song using the rap/R&B collaboration style that Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, Ja Rule, Ashanti and a number of artists use today!

It has a thumping beat, infectious samples and lyrics that are both angst-ridden and prescient.The rest of the album is extremely solid and does not bear the burdens of being dated. The medley, \\"For the Love of Money/Living for the City\\" is a true diamond in the rough on this album. The song features incredible harmony by Troop as well as an inspired rap by Queen Latifah.The song 'Lyrics 2 the Rhythm\\" is a bit mediocre and 2 Live Crew's effort, \\"In the Dust\\" is not very good as it detracts from the rest of the album.Though the movie did not endure (as it was not all that good), the soundtrack is quite outstanding and can be enjoyed by a wide range of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pancake griddle ever","review":"This Presto griddle is awesome.

It worked very well for many years, but finally the finish became worn, so it needed to be replaced. We purchased this one. The first negative thing was that the little grease tray fell out (it does not have stops to keep this from happening) and broke the corner off. Then whenever we went to use it, the balance was off a bit and it was wobbly. It did, however, warm up evenly and the food was cooked evenly as well.

The one caveat is that it is, of course, easier to see the unit when you are riding if it is mounted on the bike versus strapped to your wrist.My recommendation is that if you are going to use the 201 for both running and biking, don't buy this bracket because you can simply wear the 201, plus then you don't have to deal with trying to remove the wristband or making a tight squeeze fit into the bike bracket.

That's when I came across this mount. Since I already owned a product I loved (Garmin 301) I saw no need to spend more money on a dedicated bike computer. The mount installs easily and the 301 mounts to it with equal ease. The wrist strap stays on the 301 and serves as an extra layer of security in preventing the 301 from coming dislodged from the mount. This is beneficial in that I still use it for running. It is easy to switch back and forth between the two modes. So I got 2 dedicated GPS/fitness computers for the price of one by purchasing this mount.

But now I'm quickly losing interest in them again. The first single off this album, \\"Pop\\", is a really bad song with a bad video. Their problem is they don't know what they want. They don't know if they want to be original and do something different from everyone else or to be the same old teenybopper group that they started out as. I will defend them and say that people can't say they don't play instruments. Their instruments are their voices and they do have fine voices. I just feel they aren't putting them to good use on this album. Sadly, I didn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is so over-produced, where is the talent?","review":"This album could make me sound good and I can't carry a tune in a bucket. Of course, this is the big one for N*SYNC, can they top their previous record in sales with \\"Celebrity\\"? Or, is this the beginning of the end of the boy-band bravada. This album sounds good...that is just it, it sounds too good. With such obvious studio \\"sweentening\\" and blatant over-production, you have to wonder if this aging group is trying to prove they know how to hire someone who can run a sound board, or is this the talentless package we have always feared so out of tricks that they release an album that is so contrived as to mock the vary aspects of the business they feed on? Another disc full of nondescript pop drivel. Hey, anyone remember New Kids third album? Exactly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless music","review":"This cd has not artistic value, lacking decency and melody. This kind of music literally gives me headache, and then if plays a little longer, I will fall to sleep"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nsync's Best CD!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Nsync keeps getting better and better. They changed they're music style a little bit, but it's still the same chart-topping nsync. Pop is my favorite song, which everyone has heard, and Tell Me, Tell Me.....baby is really cool too! There are some slow ballads and fast-upbeat songs. Lots of pictures in the little cover booklet (good ones too). It's definently worth buying. I bought my cd at 12:00 am on the day that it came out and that was fun, but it's still cool to get it [online]. Anyway, it's the best cd and you should definently buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nsync's Celebrity","review":"First off, this was an amazing way to follow No String's Attached(the bands previous album). They have gracefully grown and changed with their music. With both ballads and dance tracks on this album they, as always, have something for everyone. The ballads are prettier than ever, with some having a blues feeling to them. While the dance tracks definatly follow the 'dirty pop' sound as they provide amazing songs to hit the dance floor with. Another plus to this album is that they have written and/or co-produced all the tracks, seperating them from the 'boy band' category. They have gone through a dramatic and excellent change since their debut album which only leaves us with one thing to beleive they're no longer 'cookie-cutter pop'. Its 'dirty pop' and its here to stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed a Bit.....","review":"As an NSYNC fan, I was gravely disappointed. It's just a cd of club music. With the exception of \\"Pop\\" and \\"Gone\\", there's nothing impressive or outstanding here. As usual, Justin and JC sing all the lead vocals and put the rest of the guys on the backburner. Justin and JC wrote 95% of the songs on the cd, maybe that's why it (stinks) so much. Chris Kirkpatrick's song he wrote and sang himself called \\"Fallen\\" was cut off the album at the last minute because it wasn't written or sung by the \\"cute ones\\". Chris, Joey, and Lance: I feel so bad for you guys taking this (....) NSYNC, I still love you guys but you could've done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"This new album had me very excited, waiting for it's release. A die-hard *NSYNC fan, I had high expectations from the Celebrity album, but when I bought it, I was pretty disappointed. It wasn't even close to my expectations. The lyrics were good, and the guys did a good job writing the songs, but most of the songs sounded the same to me. I think I liked maybe four of the songs. So I would suggest listening to someone else's before you buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK!!!","review":"Each CD they release has been of less quality than the last and it is nice to see that they didn't stop that trend. Top to bottom the first CD was the best. The second CD had three excellent songs and the rest were mediocre. On this effort they have replaced mediocrity for just plain bad. Again they fire off with real winner in \\"Pop\\" but there is no depth to the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened To NSYNC?","review":"Okay, I have been a fan of NSYNC from day one and I have always loved their changes. When No Strings Attached came out, I was into the techno sounds like in \\"Digital Getdown\\" and \\"No Strings Attached\\" but I was also extremely pleased with the Poppy songs like \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" and of course the slow songs like \\"This I Promise You\\". But this new CD is too R&B'ish for my taste. I mean, all of the songs sound the same and most of the time, their voices are using that wierd enhancing thing that makes the song sound like techno. I love \\"POP\\" and being an NSYNC fan, I had to buy this CD. Afterall, I have all of them. I can honesty say that I am not at all pleased with it. I respect their change, but I think they can do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmless Pop","review":"\\"Celebrity\\" is lyrically-juvenile and features highly stylized backup vocals and an array of synthesized instruments.That isn't to say that NSync's newest album is bad pop; it's actually decent, sort of sugary, a little less melodic than their past albums. While other bands have attempted to produce \\"mature\\" pop, they have also lost an essential quality that made them popular in the first place. NSync is an exception; think of \\"Celebrity\\" as not a step forward or back, but to the side at some angle.\\"Gone\\" and \\"Pop\\" are both indications of how their musical influences have changed. Other offerings include \\"Up Against the Wall\\", which is a slightly whimsical, two-step reminiscent fairy-tale interluded dance track, probably the best song on the CD.Overall, the tracks found on \\"Celebrity\\" are good songs, but they aren't commercially viable on the radio. Still, it's a good CD and a safe bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're growing up, folks.......","review":"'N Sync, a boy band that is indeed growing up, deserve credit for writing and producing most of the songs on this CD, but it's all a sign of growing up. These kids aren't babies anymore, they're growing up, yet their music sounds the same as it has always been. I guess this CD has sold more than their #!)@(&$% No Strings Attached ever did in its first week. I give them credit for that but this type of music isn't enough for me. I'm not the type who buys a CD just because they're so \\"hot\\" or \\"cute\\". I don't even listen to this type of music at all. My sister has gotten so sick of them that she calls them .... I've recently noticed she's jumping on the alternative/rock train, just like certain teens in America have been doing lately. I'm sure you'll know that there's plenty more out there than this. Later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate Pop rears its ugly head once again","review":"Nsyncs new album \\"Celebrity\\" is an over done, un original, utterly horrible corporate boy band cd. The formula it follows is the same as every other boy band out there and you should not waste any money or time on it. My little sister ran home yesterday all excited about her new album and she listened to it all day. Every thing on this album sounds the same, high pitched voices, synthesized pianos and basses, and incredibly simple drum parts, there is no variety or originality in any of this. It is obvious they don't write their own songs or even sing really well for that matter. Their claims of \\"spoofing their celbrity and pop lifestyle\\" are all thought out by people much smarter then they could ever be. My suggestion, buy Tool's \\"Lateralus\\" or Staind's \\"Break the Cycle\\", these albums have more meaning, and more real music, than this poser album could ever have."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not good","review":"Actually I haven't listened to it but come on. How good can it be? When is this madness going to stop?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good effort.","review":"This album is really bad. OK, Pop was not bad but only due to the production of BT. Its edgy and its got a kick to it (I prefer the remixed version). This version drags somewhat. The rest of the CD is just bad. Sorry folks, but that's just my opinion. The sales of this album is in decline so most people tend to agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!!!!!","review":"Ok when I first heard this cd...I seriously thought it was a joke or something...I'm so not kidding I thought someone decided to pull a prank and like tell me it was nsync...I mean this time nsync has really givin up...It sounds like they put this cd togather in a day...no good vocals...no good songs....and the list goes on! Come on for anyone out there who is thinking about buying this cd..I suggest you save you're money and go buy the Black and Blue cd instead! Although they won't say it I believe the only reason why nsync realeased this cd was to try to beat out the BSB....well I have news for them I don't think you'll be shattering records anymore. Just listen to the song Gone...Who's singin... Brittney or Justin????? Well that's all I have to say I'm not wastin any more of my money on this so called \\"singing group\\" BSB, please realease something worth listining to!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best...but i like it.","review":"I mean what can you say about Nsync? They've got great vocals and dance moves. But this CD well, they took a different direction. I mean the vocals are still awesome, but every song just sounds the same to me. I really do like NSync, but I like their first two albums a whole lot better. I gave it 4 stars because they did help write a lot of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Sound","review":"Yo, people, this cd is definitely worth buying, but what am I saying, everybody and their momma's went and bought this album right when the stores opened. Since pretty much the entire country bought it(funny huh!), I know, I am a dork! I always thought they were a pretty good group, but I really like their new sound, which is more R&B, I am a huge R&B fan and it was sweet to hear it from these guys. POP of course is a sweet song, but I also thought GONE had a great R%B feel, which I liked. UP AGAINST THE WALL also had a cool beat.

I loved their self titled album and No Strings Attached was great, but Celebrity shows no signs of development. With lyrics like \\"Tell me girl what's his name What'd he do to take you? Does he freak you the way that I do? Cause you know that I know how to and you'll just be a memory I think I've had enough\\" and \\"She took my hand We never said a word at all She starting grinding Shorty had me up against the wall\\" isn't proving Justin and JC as serious writers. If I had kids, its nothing I would them listening to. None of the tracks scream \\"Listen to Me!\\" like previous ones on No Strings, although \\"Gone\\" is pretty catchy. I see this as the downfall of NSYNC.(Yes NENETTE, this is ASHLEY!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm, it was kinda disappointing","review":"i was a bit disappointed that tho they changed their sound, n'sync is still mostly justin and a bit of jc. onli justin and jc sing, u can hardly hear any of the other voices and i find that very unfair. otherwise, the songs are ok, but it sounds like they're tryin to be somethin they aren't. this cd sounds like they're just tryin to follow wut's in rite now"},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic my fin, even Fearless Freddy is better than this!","review":"N'Sync are no Xtynct.

It's ironic when you guys start saying that \\"Their sound has matured\\" when in reality they didn't even have a hand in it musically. Another Interesting Point: The lyrics in their new single \\"Pop\\" are quite funny, since they are obviously defending themselves fom the Anti-Nsync crowd. And, as we all know, our human nature is to defend ourselves when threatened. I mean, if a huge dog is going to rip you to shreds, you are going to try your best to defend yourself, correct? But if it's a whiny chihuahua barking at you, you wouldn't really mind. Well, the same goes with Nsync. They wouldn't have done such a defensive song if they didn't feel so threatened. They know their reign is over. This will probably be their last big album. After this, it's all downhill; they've already reached their peak. Oh and one more thing: Justin Timberlake is sooo hot! Giggle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is a must have","review":"Wow, how can i start? Ok, I know, this cd was so good, i bought two. Sure, I could have burned it, but there is nothing like having a real cd, with the booklet and everything. All the songs are great, when i put the cd on, I can't decide what song to hear first, because i love them all. On this cd there is a collection of different types of songs, you got pop (dirty pop), R&B, electronica, two step, etc. If you thought No strings attached was different from their first album, you will really be blown away by celebrity. I mean, wouldn't it be boring if each album sounded the same? (i.e. BSB) I just love *NSYNC, they can really sing, if you don't believe me, go see them in concert.

Reading the reviews, I found that most people gave the album low ratings because they have a personal thing against the actual band... and that dislike was obvious in the review. I mean, if they hate nsync as much as they say then why are they listening to their albums? Why are they even bothering to write a review??If your into pop, then you'll like the album. If your not, then you'll probably still like it. They're a talented group (despite what some people say) and give them some credit... they wrote half the songs by themselves! Meaning their not exactly what you'd call a manufactored band! Sure they were in the beginning, but the fact that they've been around since '98 should tell you something.Look, Id advise you to download the album, buy it, whatever.

N'scync has never released a decent song, and i doubt that any human likes them for musical talent, but for their ugly brutish appearence. Sorry girls, but Justin appears to be trying to grow pubic hairs on his hear. And do you ever wonder why/ his voice is so high? They also try to show that they are talented by getting writing credits in every song. In truth, they may have only written one line, and considering that they are ALL THE SAME SONG this is no accomplishment.

I cannot believe these people giving it five star reviews, they obviously do not know what music is. N Sync will be gone soon enough and so will this album. I usually love their slow songs, these songs sound the same as the old ones with worse lyrics and music. The song \\"Pop\\" is a joke. They say \\"Ice around my neck\\". As hard as they try, they will never be \\"hard\\" or anything near that. They become more of a joke with every album.

The sound Nsync puts forth on this album is different and refreshing, definitely not a refabrication of previous hits. One clearly hears an early 80s Michael Jackson influenced sound, as well as popular brit dance sounds.

They don't even sing pop music anymore! They sing latin-y, rap-y, techno-y, i-don't-even-know-what-it-is-but-it-sure-ain't-music-y stuff. The reason *NSync will fade out SOON: cuz they're original sound, true boyband pop, has died for them. That's why I listen to a real POP BAND: Dream Street."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate teenie bopper pop, BUT Nsync did a good job on this","review":"I have never been a fan of Nsync. I can't stand teenie bopper pop, but after I heard \\"gone\\" and saw the beautiful video. I was like, \\"hey they are not that bad anymore, they really came up!\\" It really is a good cd. And if someone like me says it, it must be good. One love, Tee Marie"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"I have to admit I was really looking forward to the new Nsync album celebrity. Once I got it and listened it to the first time I could barely hear any singing because of the blaring instruments and the lyrics are just the same from the previous album just a little edgier (not really interesting). This definitely is different from other Nsync cd's; it is much more louder, obnoxious, and does not live up to the hype that everyone was saying. It was a very disappointing cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really a fan but some songs were alright","review":"Pop,Celebrity are the only songs on here that I like but their music is anything but original. Hip hop artists and legends like michael jackson have been there, done that and done it much better before and people like n sync are just trying to take what's been done successfully already by black artists to market it to teenagers who were once into country music and don't know a thing about r&b/hip hop"},{"rating":"1","title":"Owl attacks keep me from recieving my nsync album!","review":"I am extremely saddened by the fact that the crazed owl attacks kept me from recieving what could very well be the worst album ever. I was just going to use it as a frisbee. It's worth about the same to me. Nsync is the worst band ever. If you want some real music, get some metal.By the way, I think these owls just ripped my bathroom roof off. Gotta go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest cd ever","review":"I normally don't buy Nsync Cd but I decied to by this one. I have no strings atacked. This was sooooooooo good I play it over and over again. The two best song were gone and pop. I can't wait for their next album"},{"rating":"2","title":"First time buyer","review":"This is my first NSync CD, bought on the strength of 'Pop' which is fantastic. The album is very strong and there are some stand out tracks, 'See Right Thru You' being the best. I will be seeking out their back catalogue. Note: I got the European version with 2 extra tracks which are both very good. Pop........."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful musically sound change","review":"When I heard a few songs off of *NSync's newest album, \\"Celebrity\\"; I was a bit surprised, and was concerned that *NSync had extended the vocality of their songs to a level which they could not vocally sustain while still sounding good---But, I was very pleasantly surprised when I listened closer... *NSync's latest album to say the least,(and surprisingly,)the best yet... The ballads are beautifully written, and have a great amount of heart in them; and the higher tempo songs are wonderful to dance to and have a great beat... If you would even consider listening to Pop Music, I would highly recommend that you purchase this album! Thanks for taking the time to read this review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking???","review":"I love N Sync but this is awful. They have totally changed their style and their sound.

Some new sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"Its been 3 years since this CD was released, and 2 years since nsync toured and left the spotlight and i still listen to this CD all the way through without having to skip songsthis cd is great whether you like nsync or not, becuase it sounds nothing like their old songsi love their old stuff and definetly their new stuffas well as celebrity i recommend:no strings attachedjustifiedstrippedleaving through the window - something corporateaudioboxer ep - something corporatesongs about jane - maroon 5the beautiful letdown - switchfootryan cabrera (his CD is not yet released)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVENA 1 STAR CD, MORE LIKE 0 STARS","review":"I was a fan of *NSYNC but after No Strings Attached came out(2nd album), my views changed. I thought I would give 'em one more chance with this album, and buy it. I was WRONG, I wasted [amt] on this cd. It literally sucks, and could be the end of *NSYNC. This is a 55 minute cd and of those 55 minutes probably about 43 of them is Justin singing solo. NSYNC should now be named Justin and friends. Anyone who gave this a 5 is wrong, you are probably some nsync obsessed fan who would have given them a 5 if they sang \\"la la la\\" for 50 minutes. All the songs sound the same, and are all 'pop' songs. They say they wanted it to be more R&B and stuff, well it isn't! Save your money on a good cd, like O-Town, were out of 295 reviews, 185 of them are 5 stars. O-Town is a different sounding group who is worth your money not *NSYNC. This doesn't even deserve a 1, it deserves a 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After buying all three N SYNC albums and their christmas album, I think that Celebrity is the worst one. For a vocal group that has so much talent, and can harmonize so well together- they have totally abandoned their strongest asset for a techno, hip hop technique. The songs quickly begin to wear on your nerves and make you want to return to their original self-titled album which was by far their best work as a group, although there are many good tracks on No Strings Attached as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is so big about these boy bands?","review":"Ok, here i was stuck at a friends house, having to listen to this ... all night!! what is so great about it?? yes they have talent but their mussic is terrible!! i cant here this \\"new\\" sound, its still the same old boy band ...!!!! Their music is the most terrible thing ever written, and as a musician and vocalist i would like to apploigise to the world. I would just like to un-brainwash these teenie boppers!! They make me sad to be a musician, and i wish they would just stop ruining the music industry, along with all the other boy bands who sound just like them, and all will be unknow in a few years. EVERYONE STOP WAISTING YOUR MONEY and buy some good jazz cd's or musicals like RENT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A BIG NSYNC FAN","review":"I am a HUGE Nsync Fan!! I thought that their last CD was better than Celebrity. It has a few good songs i like to listen to like Pop, The game is over, Girlfriend, Gone, Tell me, and a few others. Not that that isn't a lot though!All in all i liked it, but i liked No strings Atttched better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome CD","review":"Despite their \\"teenybopper\\" stereotype, Nysnc's Celebrity goes far beyond that. Although at first listening, it might sound similar to NSA, their latest CD is far from it. The radio track, Pop, doesn't display what their new CD sounds like. The blusey ballad, Gone, and the \\"percapella\\" Do Your Thing are quite unlike anything Nsync has ever done. The format is still the same (tracks 1-5 are fast, 6 is slow, 7-9 are fast, 10 is slow, 11 fast, 12 slow, and 13 middle ground) but that is where the resemblance to Nsync's self titled album and No Strings Attached end. The guys wrote all but 3 of the new tracks. This album is not just for pre-teens with blue eyeshadow. Nsync's style has matured, and Celebrity is a display of that. I will say, i liked No Strings Attached better at first, but after listening to this one for a while i really got into it. Give it a chance, it's not that bad at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this dirty pop made me sick!","review":"I give this CD the lowest possible # of stars...if I could get any lower than a single star, I would. As soon as I played the music for the first time in the car, I couldn't believe how bad it was. The first song is just some wanna-be singers going on and on about some stinking \\"pop\\". I do not recommend this CD to anyone. Not even Nsync fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growth for the group.","review":"This CD shows a lot of growth since \\"NSA\\", but it's still not perfect. Don't get me wrong, I love the album, and I highly reccommend it to everybody, but I am still bummed that they took Falling off of the track list. Chris wrote an amazing song, and It didn't make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Strings Attached Was Better...","review":"I was very excited about this album until I put the CD in the player for the first time. I somehow expected more out of the boys and instead got songs with good beats and pretty [bad] lyrics. \\"Tell me tell me...baby\\" sounds like a Backstreet Boy song...\\"Celebrity\\" is just an annoying song- the fact that they sing \\"if I didn't have cheese like every day\\" is a sign to me that they've spent a little too much time with those junior high fans of theirs. I was hoping this would be a CD I'd listen to over and over again, now I am thinking it is good for an occasional listen to and will probably best serve as a coaster. Sorry boys, you could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Disappointments With Celebrity","review":"I have to say, listening to Nsync's new album is incredibly enjoyable. Each track has its own identity and personalilty. My personal favorites are the title track \\"Celebrity,\\" the video game song \\"The Game Is Over,\\" and \\"Do Your Thing.\\" Swedish song writer Max Martin does contribute two solid songs \\"Tell Me, Tell Me... Baby\\" and \\"Just Ton't Tell Me That,\\" but they aren't the highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise","review":"I was surprised when i went out and got this today. I walked into a record store and heard songs 5-11 and had to get it. I wasn't really a huge fan of theirs... I liked most of their hits but, this is a good cd.The haunting chorus of \\"Gone\\" is a nice hard to say goodbye song. \\"Pop\\" which everyone knows, spent a few weeks on BET's 106 and Park. They also have a Neptune(makers of Kelis,JAY-Z etc. songs) produced a song called \\"Girlfriend\\" something for the r&b crowd. People, all races don't sell yourself short by not getting this for fear of teasing because you own a so-called \\"Boyband\\" cd. This cd has something for everyone black/ white, young/old.... Get this you'll be surprised...."},{"rating":"2","title":"nsync for mom.","review":"My daughter turned me on to Nsync! I love the groups' energetic sound and nice tight melodies. \\"Celebrity\\" is a CD borne of time, experience and maturity. The energy is high on this one and the guys are in good voice. Production on this CD is excellent. Well worth buying and dancing in your car to."},{"rating":"2","title":"NSYNC DOES IT AGAIN","review":"I knew I could count on Nsync to create an awesome album once again! The sound is a lot different than previous albums but still very enjoyable. The cd is a nice mixture of fast and slow songs, all having beats more funky than ever! Although I'm not sure if it can beat \\"No Strings Attached\\", \\"Celebrity\\" will continue to bring the boys the success they deserve. Like always, they have proved themselves to be beyond a \\"boy band\\". This cd is definetly worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Care what they all say \\"take it from me\\"!","review":"Look True Nsync fans will never hear what all these people talk about ...whatever they say about Nsync just ignore it cause in ur heart u know that NSYNC ROCKS! this CD is absolutly FabLOuS! So GEt It and Pop YoUR LiFe Up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total dissapointment","review":"Don't get me wrong, i love N Sync's music, \\"No Strings Attached\\" was a really good cd before all of the radio stations ran it into the ground. Maybe it was good because they spent some actual time on it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to my knowledge, they were on tour and made this album in less than 6 months. Some of the best songs were written in 10 minutes, but i really doubt it took 10 minutes to produce them. Overall, I'd say that the cd would be much better if they had spent some more time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've already sold mine -- marked down!!!","review":"This CD was so hyped up, but doesn't live up to our expectations. I can't believe I bought 2 (one for each daughter). They are both totally disappointed and had me sell the CDs online. I disappointed, too, and I'm a MOM! I've really liked some of N*SYNC's music in the past, but putting this CD out was a stupid move by them. How can they keep their fan base if no one wants to listen to their music? They need to back up a little on their extreme \\"creativity\\" and look at the formula that's made them \\"Celebrities\\". I hope they can read some of their fans reviews of the CD and do better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game is over face it!!!!","review":"The Game is over with Celebirty. With there new rap geto sound(didn't i tell you justin wants to be eminem??!!) I think this is not a good abulm you can't under stand it even m you can understand.

I really liked \\"Pop\\" and \\"The Game is Over\\". This album has some REALLY good songs on it, but also has some horrible tunes too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"What a great mix of pop, rap, hip hop and rock! It's great to see 'N Sync grow with this new album! Recommend to all!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*N Sync: All Grown Up?","review":"In the land of boy bands and pop music, *N Sync is red hot. And with their new cd, \\"Celebrity,\\" they show no signs of stopping. I have respect for all types of music, but I am not a paticular fan of pop. But I was shocked and amazed on hearing \\"Celebrity\\". This cd ranges from pop to R&B to hip-hop to borderline techno. These guys have a new found attitude - this cd is wonderfully lacking the lovesick whiny ballads, in exchange for rhythm and blues. And with Justin and JC writing 10 out of the 13 tracks on the CD, I have found an all new respect for these boys. I recommend this cd to those who love pop, and even to those who hate it. You may just change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Sizzles out of my speakers!","review":"*Nsync became realy big with their 2nd album and tour, but now with pop odyssey and Celebrity on full swing they are now floating on cloud 9 and soaring up their in the ranks with the big celeb's. I didn't find it hard to actually enjoy this cd as i didn't with any others. *Nsync will surpass all others groups and thrill us all with an explosive performance on MTV on day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Could Have Given It Zero Stars","review":"This album is terrible. I sort of liked them before they got full of themsleves and went and bashed everyone. The song \\"Celebrity\\" is bashing their fans. \\"Pop\\" bashes the people who don't like their music. \\"Gone\\" is so boring. \\"The Game Is Over\\", is like saying, \\"I lost a video game\\". They are copies of BSB! So what, they supposedly broke a record! Sales don't matter! Do yourself a favor and save yourself the [money] and buy a \\"Weird Al\\" or BSB or O-Town CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure ....","review":"Why are evil albums like this popular? It is the product of a runaway capatilist recording industry bent on getting out a controlable ware to the preteen market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Better","review":"'Celebrity' is a great cd. The music is diverse and shows their growth as artists. In my opinion, the songs JC has written are superior to Wade's and Justin's, but that is also what is unique about NSYNC. Lance has the business set up, Justin is vocally strong, JC shines in the studio, Chris and Joey keep things lively. Nsync is vocally better than any of the male pop bands, no one can sing accapella like they can, and also that is why all of their collaborations have been so highly acclaimed. My favorite song on the album is Gone. Justin puts his heart and soul into the bluesy-jazz tinged song every time he performs it. The only problem I have with the album is Max Martin's song Tell Me, Tell Me...Baby. The song borrows heavily from the Backstreet Boys The Call, which Martin also wrote. For that reason I think Nsync chose to write most of their own songs. Nsync did an exemplarary job creating this cd almost all on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"NSYNC has really backed themselves into a corner this time. Their fans are going to be dropping like the proverbial flies after the release of this album. I came up with a name for this supposed new sound of theirs---CRAP. I dont know why anybody would even buy the CD (I heard the CD through MP3s by the way). NSYNC really got off on the wrong foot with their least successful single ever \\"Pop\\"--or what I like to refer to as \\"Flop\\" due to the fact NOBODY likes this song..not even hardcore fans. In conclusion this CD is crap--but be happy...because fans can only buy crap albums from a band for so long until they give up. I think NSYNC is about to become EXTINCT after this Dirty Flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are in trouble when Neil Diamond can out sell them!","review":"This album stinks to high heaven. It's so obvious that they've copied everything the Backstreet Boys ever did. I was at an NSYNC concert recently and they even stole AJ Mclean's cell phone routine in \\"The Call.\\" The lyrics of the songs are almost laughable, and Justin sings almost everything on the record. I found perhaps two good songs on the album thanks to \\"Destiny's Child\\" and their beats. So are they going to copy girls now?This group is all style and no substance. I swear they were lip syncing at the Detroit concert. NSYNC is not a band they are a circus act."},{"rating":"2","title":"'NSYNC outdoes itself. New album is both smart and fun.","review":"I would claim that this is their best album yet. It's obvious to see our boys have matured. Their harmonies are just as clear as ever but there's an edgier more educated sound to their music. It was also pleasant to see Justin showcased with such a wonderful solo song \\"Gone\\". However for those who just love the poppy tone of modern music you also shant be dissapointed. The boys keep the upbeat tonality but there is more behind their music this time! All I can say is, it was certainly worth wating in line at midnight for. I'd do it again in a second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD From My Favorite \\"Boy Band\\"","review":"Normally I don't bother to write a review but after reading the two negative reviews I felt I had to give my two cents. This cd sounds nothing like No Strings Attached, in fact if I didn't know anything about *NSYNC I wouldn't even guess they were a boy band. I enjoyed all the songs greatly and have been listening to this cd non stop since I got on my birthday. And I'm sure you are wondering what age I passed on my birthday that I would be excited about an *NSYNC cd, well I turned 22, past my kiddie phase. I loved this cd so much I would like to give it 5 stars expect I sometimes skip the first 3 songs. \\"Pop\\" I hear all the time on the radio so I have no desire to listen to it when I don't have to. \\"Celebrity\\" is extremly silly and \\"The Game is Over\\" is also silly with the dumb pac-man music in the background. Yet, I like all the other songs on the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I listen to the same CD?","review":"N Sync's sophomore album shows a lack of quality throughout almost every track. The vocals sound strained during most of the songs, possibly due to digital enhancement. It was very hard to determine if there were also any actual live instruments used, most sounded like they had been produced by a computer. The new R&B/Rap approach taken to some tracks also seems to be taking a step away from their current teeny-bopper style. All in all, the songs, vocals, and engineering all fall flat and sound extremely hollow. Strong Recommendation to Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most consistant album I've heard in a long time.","review":"I can't remember the last CD that I purchased that I could play from begining to end without skipping a track. This is the group's most consistant effort so far, and guess what, it was the one in which they had the most creative freedom. Everyone wants to under-estimate and hate these guys, and what's really funny is that none of they're critics can say why. If you don't like pop music (music that is aimed at the general public) then who are you to have anything to say negative? Listen to what you like. If you like Pop music, this is the one you'll want to purchase. From powerful sultry ballads such as Selfish, Gone and Something Like You to high energy dance tracks with a European 2 step feel such as Pop, Girlfriend and Up Against the Wall, this album hands down is your next entertainment purchase! And believe me it is very entertaining. We won't even mention the effort that went into the concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT!...BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I rushed out the day *N SYNC: CELEBRITY came out because I am huge fan of *N SYNC. I felt that too many of the songs sounded alike. I feel that this cd doesn't have enough variety as 'NO STRINGS ATTACHED' had. I know how many people rushed to get this cd and too many of them decided how much of a disappointment it was. I'd borrow it from somebody before I bought it. Some people said its more mature, but I felt that they needed some variety and not the same song types over and over.SORRY *N SYNC....but you can do better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*NSYNC's Celebrity","review":"This CD is a MAJOR improvement over \\"No Strings Attached\\" which had a handful of good songs but some stinkers. The only reason this is not a 5 star is because I am not exclusive to pop only but it's a hell of a CD. \\"Celebrity\\" takes a step forward like the Backstreet Boys did with \\"Black & Blue\\" but only better. Not only is the title better than \\"Black & Blue\\" but the songs, in my opinion, are better. The best songs are,1. Pop (DUH) :) 2. Celebrity 3. The Game Is Over 4. Tell Me, Tell Me...Baby 5. Selfish 6. Just Don't Tell Me That 7. Something Like YouAnd with a great supporting cast of songs, you just can't go wrong with this package!"},{"rating":"1","title":"omg!","review":"no no no, i just don't like it, i recieved this for my birthday last month and i was frustrated with my in laws because for one, this cd is quite old. 2nd, this cd is hideous, besides the catchy \\"pop\\" the whole cd fails to strike a nerve with any of my senses.

I would've given them no stars, but thats not an option. I don't get why everyone likes them when all they do is sing with their whiny little talentless voices. If *NSYNC releases another album, I swear I am gonna freak. I hate them and I just wish they would go away! Maybe it's just because I don't like pop AT ALL, but *NSYNC or however those losers are spelling it now, seriously need a little talent. I own none of their CD's, and I'm proud of it. Lastley, look at Bye Bye Bye, that stupid song. That was way too overplayed, and on this stupid CD they have Pop. That lasted like a week, so you can already see these guys are going down hill. Anyone who's with me on this, say it was helpful, and if people disagree, please say it wasnt helpful. Kinda like a poll. RAP ROCKS!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hi justin its me your biggest fan chelsea :) WOOHOO","review":"i just want all my G's to hear this cd it r000cks. the album may be dark but i guess justin has had a dark life. this man is a hardened str33t thug kids hes been around the block and he deserves respect k? the lyrics are pretty d33p too. for example the song POP. this is obviously adressing the guns justin dealt with every day on the str33ts growing up. as i said earlier you can literaly hear pain in his voice in this song; not for the kids k?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stick to your usual!","review":"I am a true fanatic of *NSYNC, having their CD's and such. I was truly dissapointed with their new CD celebrity. I guess I'm just not a person that can easily adjust to change, since \\"Celebrity\\" was utterly different from their other two CD's. It sounds more like rap than pop, plus in the song \\"Pop\\" I don't exactly like Justin repeatedly saying \\"Dirty Pop\\"I think *NSYNC could have done better with this CD if they had just stayed with their regular kind of sounding music and lyrics, instead of trying to do something so different I'm not sure I'm listening to *NSYNC anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's So New About It?","review":"So I took a listen, everyone was going on about Nsync's \\"new\\" sound. What I found were over produced tracks and 5 white boys trying hard to be black. Justin, Michael Jackson you are not. His vocals are so whiny and I swear Justin's voice was the only voice I heard singing on this CD. Okay, one in awhile they let JC sing too but I'm sure only after Justin approved it. I thought there were 5 members in this group?If you want true R&B music with beautiful harmony pick up a Boyz 2 Men CD, that's real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"N Sync doesn't do it again.","review":"After being an N Sync fan for years now i am totally dissapointed. This album made me depressed when i listened to it. The other N Sync albums were very nice and upbeat which made them good to dance to. The new album is not what I expected, after listening to a few songs on the cd I had to turn it off. I did finish listening later and was still dissapointed. Just how many songs can you write about a girl leaving you. The beats sounded similar on a lot of the tracks. I would not reccommend this cd to any person that does not suffer from depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Was The Worst CD Ever!!!","review":"Now I WAS a die-hard nsync fan. Until I heard this CD. It has no creativity. None at all. I loved the song pop and that was the only good one. They have not matured at all they sound exactly alike their last CD. I would not recommed this CD to anyone. I was a total waste of time and money. They put out the CD just so they could break their old record you can really tell they spent no time at all on this CD. Thanx for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just trying to chip away at the 4 star rating","review":"Can someone honestly tell me that this clone boyband's music will be heard years from now? This is music created to capitalize off of the trend the Backstreet Boys created back in the mid 90's. None of this music will be remembered. These songs like \\"Pop\\" and \\"Gone\\" are middle of the road pop jibberish. I mean at least the Backstreet Boys have a timeless classic in \\"I Want It That Way\\". They also sing live and dont focus on cheesy dance routines all the time like Nsync. The ONLY reason these so called \\"Artists\\" sold so many records is because of their looks and marketing. MTV does wonders for people with little to no talent. Just ask Milli Vanilli, Vanillia Ice, Marky Mark, New Kids on the Block, Britney Spears, Eminem, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tsk, tsk","review":"This CD was a big disapiontment for me, I thought since Dirty Pop is such an awesome song that the rest of the album would be just as great, right? WRONG! Now if you're a rabid N'sync fan you won't give a damn if the album sucks.......... this is just a warning for all you people thinking Dirty Pop must not be the only good song on here.......... when it is. Don't be a victim! Say no to Celebrity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is trash!","review":"I used to be an *N Sync fan back in the day, not a fanatic but just a fan of their music. Once this CD came out I thought about possibly buying it til I heard most of it at a record store and I was ashamed to have liked their music. The song \\"Pop\\" isn't even that good, but needless to say that was their only good song on that CD. It is best to just save your money.

N'sync is not and I repeat NOT SPEED METAL, they're nothin but pathetic MTV/pop garbage along with Limp Crapface, Drunkstreet Dorks, and Puke Mouth. I'm f**kin glad they're history. If you want real speed metal, listen to Slayer, Anthrax, Sepultura, Metallica, Kreator, Megadeth, Testament, Overkill, Arch Enemy, Iced Earth, Exodus, and Possessed.One last word to Limp Bizkit Fan:GET A LIFE MOTHERF**KER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupendous","review":"If you like whiny, falsetto voices, then this album is for you.

I excpected a new sound for n'sync. Maybe some more R&B; less OOH BABY more good music. I only liked a few songs. Most of them were ballads (which I am not a huge fan of.) The other boys need to step up front and sing a little more. JC and Justin do most of the singing. I barely ever hear any of Lance, Joey or Chris. I understand JC and Justin are the lead singers, but this is just my opinion. All of the songs are the same as the last cd! Recommended favorites are. . . .Tell Me, Tell Me. . .BabyGirlfriendDo your thingInstead I recommend Justified by Justin Timberlake."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I am not a boy band junkie, but I have to give credit where credit is due.

Although its not mine i listen to it more than my friend does! My best song on the album is \\"The Game is Over\\" its great. The backing music on it is like on a video game and sounds very good! That is my favourite song on the CD but I also love Pop, which is already out! The song i didnt like was \\"Girlfriend\\" it sounds cheesy because he says \\"will u be my girlfriend\\" and he says it all the way through. I think it just wrecks the whole song! Anyone who is an Nsync fan or is just interested in it, must buy this album! I hope this review has been of some help to you and might give you a better analysis of the album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NStunk!","review":"I'm a 42-year-old Mom who loves NSync. I loved \\"No Strings Attached,\\" so of course I thought \\"Celebrity\\" would be a winner. WRONG! I listened to the CD last night and was soooo disappointed. The lyrics were awful and just about all the songs sounded the same. No ballads. No creativity. Zippo! A preschooler could rhyme better. My 13-year-old son did a quick review this morning and said most of the music had Michael Jackson electronic tricks plugged in. NSync will make a boat load of cash on the fans who purchased their previous CD's, but I don't plan on wasting any more of my money on new ones. Parents beware. Check Amazon.com before purchasing CD's for your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"'N Sync-Celebrity Dissapointing","review":"The music group, 'N Sync usually have an exceptionally great sound. This album does not showcase their chops, however and is somewhat dissapointing! Two songs (\\"Just Don't Tell Me That\\", \\"Tell Me, Tell Me...Baby\\")stay close to their roots but the rest is very different, which is not a bad thing, but two thirds of the new stuff gets old pretty quick. The only new-sounding song on the album worth your money is \\"Girlfriend.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisely good","review":"When my friend gave me this album to listen to I was expecting to hate it since I hate NSync but I have to admit it was good. Something Like You is a really beautiful song and Girlfriend and Up Against a Wall have very catchy lyrics. The only songs I didn't like was Pop and Celebrity, I found them very rude. I think NSync singing songs with real meanings instead of bubble gum fluff was orginial for Boy bands but they went a little to far. If they wanted to get their points across about the entertaiment business and the downfalls of it they should have done a song about them not being in competetion with the Backstreet Boys and that it is possible to like both bands music or respecting Celebs choices in who they want to date ...instead insulting NSync haters who have the right to their opinions (with the expection of personal insults against NSync fans) and suggesting their girlfriends might only be with them because of their fame and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they promised us.","review":"Even though I love *Nsync to death, this album did not come out the way I thought. I was hoping for more songs like Bye,Bye, Bye and This I Promise You. Instead we are stuck with 13 songs that all sound alike and not too many love songs. Pop, the first single, is a great song,but all the other songs follow in the same funky style beat. Pop made me believe they were stonger musically.

They definitely sound better musically in the singing and writing. No Strings Attached was the better album, but this album is heavy with strong numbers like Pop, The Game Is Over, Just Don't Tell Me That, Up Against the Wall (very fast song too!),Tell Me Tell ME, Selfish, and others. One of their best ballads is Gone, where Justin Timberlake sings so soulful on that song. Perhaps the buildup to his own hit album Justified. I like the one where Stevie Wonder plays harmonica. The songs with electronica hitmaker BT are dynamite here.

They have managed to raise above the boy band sterotype. They have released 3 hit CD's. They write their oen stuff. And they experiment. Some of their new stuff is great (Pop, Gone), some of it is good (Up Against a Wall) some [...] (Celebrity) but at least they are trying to make the transition from goopy teen love to adult stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pop bubble busrt","review":"Ok....Definitly not up to standards.

The songs are very well put together and catchy. I just cannot get enough of the song Pop! Not to mention Gone, Tell Me Baby and all the rest. This is certinly worth the effort, time, and money it takes to buy it. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"CELEBRITY","review":"nSyNc have been working really hard and pretty fast.14 months after releasing No Strings Attached, they release a freat dirty popish, electronic, hip-hop HIT album. Celebrity is really-well written and produced, well except for CELEBRITY;the lyrics are to simple and way to predictible , but its got a nice beat. pOp is dance-hit single of the album, really loud-uptempo electronic (3x winner at MTV Video Music Awards 2001) track. The Game is Over is another uptempo-electronic track--great track. Gone is really different sounding type of power-BALLAD. Someone Like You is nice(harmonica played by Stevie Wonder) song and like Do Your Thing. The Two of Us is adultish song, but great sweet beat. Tell Me;Tell Me...baby(probably my favorite track) is such a great,uptempo, SOLID track, it sounds AMAZING, irristeble track. But thing I don't understand, is why I usually only hear JC and Justin's vocals...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not again!","review":"I thought they said \\"celebrity\\" would be different from \\"No Strings Attached?\\"Nope.It still sounds the same.Justin and J.C. are still the only ones that sing{figures}.Plus,\\"Pop\\" is so annoying and dumb,I barely get what they are trying to make a point of.At least the Backstreet Boys can try different sounds and still sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puppets Indeed","review":"This latest effort by America's favorite plastic boys is nothing but another crushing blow for music itself. How long are we going to let coporate creations rule the airwaves?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart marketing","review":"There was some smart marketing done for this album. The first single \\"Dirty Pop\\" sounds similar to the songs off No Strings Attached showing that NSync has once again written catchy dance/pop songs. However, this single doesn't fit with the rest of the CD. All of the songs are completely different and don't have the same dance/pop feel as songs in their past. While that isn't always a bad thing since it means that the group is growing in the abilities, I just feel that consumers are being mislead into buying the album believing that it will be No Strings Attached Part 2.The rest of the CD is pretty boring with little other songs that are worth listening to. I found myself moving to the next song because I got bored with the current one. The group used too much digital equipment and vocoders that ruined the songs. They should have confidence in their ability to harmonize and stay away from electronica. It doesn't work for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound like something I've heard before.....","review":"I Didn't buy the album, but my sister who is an NSYNC junkie went out an bought it this morning and I had to listen to it in the car like 6 times. Anyways... I don't suggest buying it. It's got it's perks... like the catchy \\"PoP\\" and \\"Celebrity\\" but as a whole the album has the same sound as their previous \\"No Strings Attatched\\" For all the hype that was put on this album it was dissapointing in the end. I do not suggest purchasing \\"Celebrity\\" because you can just pop in \\"No Strings Attatched\\" and save your self $15, I mean they are practically the same... Same drippy love ballads, same Nothing but Tecno songs... same Justin and JC sing everything and leave the other three members in he dust.... This album really isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"way over hype-bought it.. totally disappointed...","review":"first off I was big fan of nsync.. but not any more... its like all they say on tv is how many albums they think hey are going to sell.. so is that is what its all about selling more albums to make money....and let the music suffer... well that is what this is... total awful... come on guys...this is all you have... to offer us.. I was excited.. to get the album... but listening to it realized it is not all that... I mean no strings attached.. was so good.. celebrity is just to make money... and its so obvious.. the music is awful... how disappointing so people save your money... nsync just wants to make money now.. thats it...

I have taken my daughter to see them 2x. The first after the release of their debut. Although I do not care for any of their music, each album seems to have gone downhill. Of course it will sell millions because they are N*SYNC(the teenage girls lust after them) and they did shameless promotion of the CD at their recent concert here in Oakland. It was like sitting through a 90 minute commercial for N*SYNC! Truly awful.This CD is overproduced with electronic noise and sound effects. Shallow lyrics, boring songs and 2 band members seem to be the key singers. Girls will still love this album, even though there is not an ounce of musical talent on it! I can't wait for the boy-band craze to die!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, weak, weak. EVEN by pop's standards.","review":"I guess \\"The Two Of Us\\" is passable, but skates dangerously close to filler as does \\"Pop\\". Thank goodness it's somewhat catchy...The absolute filler tracks though, are: \\"Celebrity\\", \\"Tell Me, Tell Me...Baby\\" (UGH. TERRIBLE. Almost as bad as the horrid, \\"Celebrity\\", \\"Up Against The Wall\\" (Yawn...), \\"See Right Through You\\" (Whatever...it just ain't believe-able), \\"Just Don't Tell Me That\\"; Hell, pretty much the whole album is plagued with filler after filler tracks.The only decent songs are \\"Gone\\" (a pop classic) and \\"Girlfriend\\". The songs that are tolerable are \\"The Two Of Us\\", the half-hearted ballad, \\"Selfish\\" and the sneakin'-around-sounding-production on \\"Something Like You\\". The rest is absolutely trashy filler material.Do yourself a favor today and don't look back to 2001. At least not for this CD!! Go back a year to 2000, and pick up Nelly Furtado's \\"Whoa, Nelly!\\".

The only reason I gave this CD 2 stars is for \\"Gone\\" which has nice vocals and is an all-around awesome song. The whole \\"dirty pop\\" thing is overdone. How about going back to good ballads and REAL danceable songs?? I applaud them for trying to mature their sound, but they are going in the wrong direction.

Either that, or partying. But with Celebrity, it seems they've finally moved on.The musical theme of this album is definetely techno. The fast-paced beats and awesome background tracks take it to a place no Boy Band has gone before. Instead of \\"My world revolved around her/my love light burned for her alone/but she didn't see the flame/Only myself to blame\\", you're hearing \\"Tell me girl what his name what'd he do to take you/does he freak you the way that I do?/'cause you know that I know how to.\\"The edgier lyrics and tight harmonies push N Sync over the top.

Those two albums were great. However Celebrity just falls short. If you're expecting a pop sound like their first album, you're gonna get a more R&B flavor... Now the guys from N'Sync actually write their own songs ( Justin and JC mostly )... They should go back to their old ways and just sing because they cant write songs. there are some good tracks, POP and Up AGAINST THE WALL are probalbly the best ones, the rest are just average to bad. This sounds kinda weird but i thought THE GAME IS OVER sounded like DIGITAL GET DOWN from NO STRINGS ATTATCHED.

A lot of the fast tempos have virtually the same beat and the same theme, in which they are basically angry at girls for cheating, lying, etc. They seem to have realized how popular \\"bye, bye, bye\\" was, and then expanded its lyrics on nearly every uptempo. And \\"Gone\\" basically spells out a soolo career for Justin, as he sings practically all the leads. And the lack of good songs on \\"Celebrity\\" also shows that their songwriting (JC/Justin co-wrote many songs)needs some major work. Of course, the best is when you write your own song AND its a good song, but between writing bad songs on your own vs. singing a good song written by someone else, I'd pick the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor nsync where have they gone?","review":"this album is well...lets put it in a good way-crap. sry sad but true. makin an album like this doesn't have to take talents. b/c the truth is, these guyz can't sing. the whole thing is very computerized, 'n the lyrics have no meanin watsoever. trust me, i use to be a huge nsync fan, but i grow out of 'em long time ago. don't buy this, it's NOT worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love This Album Not!","review":"If you have this CD do yourself a favor and return it.

Well, I have listened to it, and have found that they have come a long way. There are still some of those old 'N Sync sounding tunes. I could have done without the video game song (it gets annoying). But, no one can deny the vocal capability and the catchy beats. Music is about getting away from the trials and tribulations. A good beat and catchy hook is all you need. I have to say that the person who commented that early 90's music was original...HA HA HA! You make me laugh. Remember New Kids?! There have always been \\"fake\\" bands (i.e.: The Monkees...they were nothing but a Beatle rip-off). So, before you shoot down the cd, give it a listen.

NOT going to work.Sure they can sing and dance, I'll give 'em credit for that but they sing anything that is put in front of them.They tried to ditch the pop sound and add a little bit of hip-hop into the album with \\"Up Against the Wall\\" and \\"Dirty Pop\\", while still clinging onto their ballads like \\"Selfish.\\"NSYNC was ok in the beginning but they're just another boy band.

If your a Justin lover like me you will be happy to know 1 of the songs he sing all of the verses, plus many other parts besides. The cd manily features Justin and Jc beacause they wrote the majority of them also. It also surprized me when I heard Justin swear in \\"don't tell me that\\" this seems to be a new concept but not a bad one i think this means they are maturing in their music. I think everyone who likes nsync even a little should get this. You may not like it at first but it rapidly grows on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of different formula, still a boy band","review":"I hated NSYNC and being a guy, it is my right but then that ever so catchy tune called ''Pop'' and well, I had to buy it. What I found was the most heavily produced and voice altering CD I have heard! Between the sampling and digital crap, you can hardly make out the lyrics which is probably best. If they don't want to be a boy band, they can do two things: 1. Stop doing mushy and gooey ballads 2. Write about something else other than themselves(Pop is self-righteous) or girls and dive into more lyrically challenged stuff. The CD does serve up some good tunes. Mainly, POp and The Game is Over but NSYNC has yet to find their nitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nsync's CD was a disapointment....","review":"I have all the other Nsync CD's and I went to their Pop Oddessey Tour and I was really looking forward to this CD. Personally, I think that it is terrible. All the tracks sound the same, Justin's voice is really whiny, and it just doesn't sound good. Not to forget that it mostly sounds fake, because their voices are computerized in the begining of all the songs just about. Don't waste your money. I hope the Backstreet Boys will realize that the new Nsync CD isnt good and that they don't go down this path with their new cd out early 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showing Signs of the slump,","review":"This album is not good either coming off their biggest album of their career \\"No Strings Attached\\", they released \\"Celebrity\\" in July 2001 and it debuted with strong numbers.

For a home brewer this is even better since you can change the label out to match what you have made, or as in my case when you have 2 faucets and want to keep clear which has the IPA and which has the Stout (or whatever you have brewed up).

It is effective against most important waterborne protozoa (giardia and cryptosporidium), but will not filter any harmful bacteria. you should only use this filter in a clean mountain stream that has not been contaminated with fecal material. If you use this filter in a pond or standing water, you are asking for trouble. More expensive filters are rated to 0.2 microns and are effective at removing harmful bacteria. One previous review stated that this filter produced water at a faster rate and clogged less than a more expensive filter. That is likely a very true statement as the filtration pore size on the cheap filter is 10X bigger! If a more expensive filter is clogging, it is doing its job of removing particles that would otherwise end up in your drinking water. Do not assume that all filters are created equal, and just because you run water through some device does not make it safe to drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet","review":"I still can't believe how quiet this machine is.

The synths and drum machine are so loud it dominates everything on the tracks. The mix is very raw and sometimes distorted, the sound he was looking for.

Anyway, a newer version exists with everything, I now own it.D.M.S.R. is a very strong dance/funk track on the CD and I would recommend checking with used dealers before buying from them, since at least 2 have had only the incomplete version (several others have not responded, which suggests they too have only the incomplete version).Probably best to pony up the Amazon full price on this classic baby.(Later: I have now heard from a couple used dealers who have the complete version in stock.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Got Me \\"Delirious\\"...","review":"I first bought this work in 1982 on a cassette and I wore it out so I bought it in CD form a few years ago and wore it out so I bought it again a couple of months ago.Needless to say this is one of my favorite albums of all-time.Every song is a classic .

Bumping funk and creative and fun tracks like 1999, Little Red Corvette, and my personal favorite D.M.S.R. make this album probably one of the 80's top 5 albums and one of musics top 40 albums of all time.Prince unlike Michael Jackson has not struggled to reinvent himself, because Prince has been constantly experimenting with new sounds and new ways to create his masterpieces.It is hard to believe that 1999 preceded Purple Rain, but did an incredible job teasing the world's appetite for more of the \\"Purple One\\"This is a must have for any R&B; collection and any run of the mill Prince fan!Great Album, that should live in the history books of music for decades to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like most good double albums...","review":"... it would've made a killer \\"single\\" album. IMO it's the first four songs (1999, L.R. Corvette, Delirious, Let's Pretend) -- i.e., the hits -- that make this one of Prince's best. These four songs alone are 22 minutes, about a third of the total time. The remainder hangs together well -- albeit without a standout track.This is no _Purple Rain,_ but very few albums are. If you just want \\"1999\\" and \\"Little Red Corvette,\\" I'd suggest a greatest hits album.

I remember hearing the first single from this which was \\"Little Red Corvette\\" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was \\"Delirious\\". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical?

The lyrics are great. Tom Araya's voice is errie and wonderful, as always. The music itself is very verY veRY vERY VERY WELL DONE instrumentally, as always. This album has more variance in styles and tempo than Slayer's earlier stuff, but its not really \\"experimental\\". I think that this is a good starter album and, dont get me wrong - I LOVE Master Of Puppets, has more lasting appeal (in my opinion) than Metallica because the style is just less... mainstream eighties."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more Melodic Slayer.","review":"This may not Be Slayers Best CD,But it has the best drum work of any SLayer Record,Dave Lombardo is one of,if not the best heavy metal drummer of all time.Slayer has never been the same without him.You get something new with this Cd...Something we never heard on previous Slayer records.Melody.This Album is slower and more melodic than previous efforts.You get the feeling slayer was coming into their own as songwriters durring the makeing of this Record.It is also the last Slayer studio record to feture the famous pentagram Logo.Not slayers best albumn...but very very close."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a bad album","review":"Ok, for those of you who are big fans of Show No Mercy, Hell Awaits, and Reign In Blood, you will probably at first find this album to be a dissapointment. This a album is not as fast, and regardless of what others may say, it is not near as heavy as the previous albums. My main problem is the vocals- Araya actually attempts at singing, instead of the usual snarling and growling that helped make the previous albums so heavy and evil. Still, this is Slayer. The songs are very cool and the musicianship is outstanding. Key tracks are Mandatory Suidide, Behind the Crooked Cross, and Ghosts of War. If you like Slayer, you will like this album, they just toned it down a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"if some songs were a little fast i would give it a five","review":"now this slayer album is a follow up to their all time classic reign in blood.this album is slayers first work was to feature some slow tempos.but im a speed freak and slayers not that great when they play slow songs(they rule when they play fast songs) but some tracks in here are fast.the best songs in here are south of heaven,mandatory suicide,and spill the blood.this was a little boring,and my least fav slayer album of the 80's.but in my final opion buy it if you like a few slow tempos,i know i dont,but i think this is okay"},{"rating":"2","title":"slayers best album","review":"I remember when I bought this album back in'88. I had heard reign in blood and thought I'd give this a try, well to tell the truth I really didn't know what to think. It didn't really sound like the other albums. At first I was kind of dissappointed! I was wanting to hear speed and angry, fast as hell riffs, but here was this sort of droning singing and chugging guitar. So I put it away for a week and wouldn't you know it I was constantly singing this album. It was stuck in my head like a cancer imbedded deep in your brain. I couldn't get it out of my head, I needed a fix. After that the mighty SLAYER!!!! has been my all time favorite. What makes this album so damn good is the lyrics, the riffs, the drumming, hell everything! It may not be the heaviest out there but if you're a true fan this album will not disappoint, and if it does its your fault for listening to an old coot like me. long live SLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic.","review":"If you read any \\"official\\" review of south of heaven you'll hear how slayer slooooooooooooooowed it down. And yeah it's true anybody that knows anything about Slayer knows they couldn't top the unadulterated speedfest that was Reign in blood and they wanted some slower songs for their live show to give it a more up and down effect but South of heaven isn't really all that slow. You'd think from all of the offical reviews they decided to be like Sleep or Eyehategod and go all sludge metal on us but that's not case. The vocals are more eerie and melodic than shrieky and the riffs are more precise and less chaotic but in my opinion mainly because of songs like south of heaven and mandatory suicide it still works! I would highly reccomed this CD for any fan of real metal"},{"rating":"2","title":"not as heavy as the other albums","review":"south of heaven is a good cd.

The album does at a little slower pace than the previous Slayer albums, however it is still very obvious that the band is Slayer. They did nothing that would make them sound so different that their original sound would dissapear. Most of hte songs on this album have great slow intros and catcht choruses with actual hooks, something often overlooked in thrash metal. Overall this album transcends most other thrash metal albums without putting too much thought into it.

SOUTH OF HEAVEN is simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaviest Slayer Album","review":"This album is by far the heaviest album Slayer ever made. 'Blood' was the fastest, but Heaven is the heaviest. This album is one of the darker albums. Darker than 'Blood' or 'Hell Awaits'? Absolutly! Those albums where pure violence and evil respectivly. South of Heaven is a turn to haunting beauty and contridictions of our time. Sotuh of Heaven the song is an apt discription of our society. Tom said Sabbath was their primary influence and they wanted to be heavier. Well, this album they did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentless!","review":"Slayer's best album in my opinion, though most will say \\"Reign in Blood\\". Rick Rubin really has wrung the best out of the boys on this one. Dave's drumming is incredible and driving, the guitars are searing, and the lyrics are disturbing and compelling. This will leave your neck sore from the constant \\"banging\\"! The cover of Judas Priest's \\"Dissident Aggressor\\" is fantastic and \\"Spill the Blood\\" is a great closer. This is a must have for any metal fan and will quickly find its way to your most played stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Emergency Filter","review":"Advertized to filter to 2.0 micron.

It also looks used, has many \\"pock\\" marks, and will not work as a desk protector. My assumption had been that this was a real desk protector, and had some weight so that it could hold things down. It is just a clear piece of thin plastic that won't hold down anything.

At full power, it makes a nice, dark clean burn on a variety of wood surfaces and would be good for anyone who wants to move up a little from the burners at the hobby shop but is not quite ready to splurge on a professional wire-tip burner set. The only reservation I would have is that unlike the Walnut Hollow burners, it has no on/off switch of its own and if you want that, you will have to get the temperature regulator along with it, but if you're serious about woodburning, the regulator is worth the additional investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wall Lenk L101KB Woodburning tool","review":"This is a very nice woodburning tool at a very reasonable price.

I burn personalized wood signs and a lot of them have large letters that get filled in and it not only takes forever to do that with a smaller burner from a craft store but it also puts a lot of strain on you hand. Upon reading some of these reviews, a lot of the reviews said that the burner tends to burn for a while and then it stops. I specifically bought this one for a project that I was working on burning cup scouts arrow plaques. The project took a month to make all of the signs and the burned did excellent.

If you are not careful, many can slip and slide right out of the sides and land on the floor, breaking.Just open with great care, and there should not be any problem.Like 99 per cent of purchases from Amazon.com in the last 15 years, the item is excellent. I can say the same about Amazon.comUK as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of shipping on plastic cd/dvd cases.","review":"Fuji CD-R/DVD Slim Jewel Case, color ( 100 pack )As I do a lot of one off CDs, these cases have proven to be the best for mailing. Price has always been dropping on these, but this was a very good price at this time.Shipment from this supplier could be improved as I still lost a couple at each end. This time the breakage was less than typical making this provider better at shipping, but no one has worked out a way to do a clean shipment.Overall, I will use this supplier again as long as the price is competitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, colorful, useful, love them!","review":"I love these cases! I got them because I thought they price sold them for themselves, and I didn't want just regular black cases.They come in a nice array of colors (be aware, some products actually include just 5 color cases, and the rest are black... but these are ALL COLORED!). They are really pretty and they look wonderfully on display, because the edge is colored as well (the opening lid is the only thing clear).The space for the CD booklet is a tad thin, but since I just identify my CD's with markers, no problem there.The Amazon packaging (which was something that worried me about preview reviews) had NO PROBLEM whatsoever. It included air-bags that kept the cases box from bouncing inside the package. Not a single one was broken :)I'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job well done Amazon","review":"I bought 200 slimline jewel cases from Amazon they got here quick 3 of them where broken.

Slayer is a band you either love or hate. If you like this album then you will probably like all of their other albums except perhaps for 'Undisputed Attitude' because it's mostly punk cover songs. Slayer has always been consistant in style and quality: they just never sold out like other speed/thrash bands like Metallica, etc. Otherwise, every album by Slayer rocks and this one is just as great with songs like 'War Ensemble', 'Expendable Youth' and 'Dead Skin Mask.' The ultimate mosh band. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is SLAYER.. what more can I say","review":"Seasons in the Abyss was the first slayer song I ever heard (Yeah I cant belive that I missed reign in blood!!)Anyway, for some reason Seasons in the Abyss for me is the best thrash metal song ever.This album is not the fastest of all the slayer albums but definitly one of the heaviest. Blood red, Dead skin mask, Born of Fire and Seasons in the abyss have some of the greatest slayer riffs. This album stands out from the rest of slayer's albums in 2 aspects. The creepy solos prevelant all throught the album and the crazy screams of Tom Araya. The creepiness reaches its peek in Dead skin mask. The screaming at the end of Born of fire is breathtaking. The story teller kind of singing in Dead skin mask is simply superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer","review":"Great price, great quality on a very hard to find anywhere product anywhere in the U.S. I loved it.

The songwriting is awesome, and this showcases all of what Slayer is capable of, all on one convienient disc.

Slayer has always been known for it's aggresive style and just awesome music. This album took South of Heaven, which was a little bit heavier than previous albums without quite as much speed, and added the speed from Reign in Blood. Listen to War Ensemble...you will understand what I mean. Dead Skin Mask and Seasons in the Abyss are essential Slayer material, or heavy metal material in general. Not until God Hates Us All would Slayer make another album in this style (GHUA is awesome, but this is the one to get if you have never heard Slayer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer!!","review":"Slayer combined Reing in Blood and South of Heaven to create this!! Seasons in the Abyss is definatly a rocking album that leaves the listener wanting more Slayer. I mean they obviously can work a mid tempo song and still include all of the stuff that was on Reing in Blood, brilliant!The album has many good songs in fact all the songs are good but here are the stand outs: Dead Skin Mask god that is a scary song never listen to that in the dark by youself, War Ensemble and Seasons in the Abyss which has one of the best guitar solos ever!This album is killer so pick it up at your local music store as soon as you can you will not regret it! This isn't as good as Reing in Blood but it's sure close to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Vocals????","review":"I Love Slayer but for some reason I can't get into this album..The cd does have two of the best Slayer songs ever..War Ensemble and Seasons In The Abyss( which sound much more aggressive on the live album) ..but the rest of the album is just weak.Its like they tried to mix south of heaven with reign in blood but it just didn't work..I guess its Tom's new singing style..I wish he would go back to the old reign in blood , hell awaits style.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, ok","review":"I felt this album was a low point for Slayer. In a sense its like Metallicas Black album. I tend to forget about these minor setbacks in their careers. Seasons in the abyss was too mellow from a Slayer fan standpoint, I was hoping for something that kept in the lines of Slayers notorious, relentless song writing and brutal guitar riffs. This album was more of a whimper. It just doesn't do much for me at all. Its like just when you thought the lyrics were going to get good, someone was tapping them on the shoulder \\"saying tone it down guys we can't have another reign in blood album style lyric\\" . I like brutal Slayer music period and this isn't it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Slayer Release","review":"This is a pretty decent Slayer release, it sort of bridged the gap between the old school (Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Hell Awaits era) with what was to come, the more non-satanic Divine Interention, Diobolus in Musica, and God Hates Us All Albums.As a Satanist since 1981 when Venom's \\"Black Metal\\" was released, I found Seasons in the Abyss to be dissapointing in that Satan was only mentioned in \\"Born of Fire\\" and \\"Temptation\\", apprarently only at the insistence of Rick Rubin. I prefer the more satanic and evil earlier material Slayer has, such as Hell Awaits and Show no Mercy. From a heavy metal standpoint, however, this is a good introduction to what Slayer has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this album","review":"This is a must have for anybody that loves heavy metal or loves slayer. War ensemble,dead skin mask, and expendable youth are my favorites on the album even though i love the whole album. Listen to it all the way through to enjoy some killer riffs and some great solos i love the guitar playing on this album in particular. BUY IT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD IT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best is still good","review":"For fast, agressive, thrashy metal, you can't top Slayer. This album is outstanding for the genre. Great riffs, with the pauses, tempo changes, and perfect drum fills that give Slayer a distinct advantage over other metal acts.My strongest criticism of this album is that it isn't as good as South of Heaven. It feels a bit more plodding, and while some of the guitar parts are melodically more interesting that other slayer releases, this comes at the expense of the \\"edgey\\" feeling on SOH. Also the \\"hello mr. Gein\\" voice-over on \\"dead skin mask\\" seems a little forced and unneccessary. On the other hand, the voice over on \\"Skeletons of Society\\" sounds extremely cheesey, but in a \\"so bad it's awesome\\" sort of way.If you like Slayer you'll like this album. Personally I rank this above \\"Reign in Blood,\\" but below South of Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal with a mind...sometimes.","review":"Ok, now we all know most people listen to heavy metal for the lyrics, right? Well, if you've got enough of a brain left after thrashing it around headbanging to these intense riffs, check out the anti-war sentiments of \\"War Ensemble\\" or the tale of gang related violence \\"Expendable Youth\\". Another stand out track on this album is \\"Dead Skin Mask\\"- the way the music and the lyrics build, then when that kid starts screaming... Whew, what a rush!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayers best.","review":"Slayer has always had a sound that has kind of made other \\"metal\\" bands figurativley put their tails between their legs and go pout in the corner. This album is the high point of it all. from \\"war ensemble\\" to the title track at the end it just all gels together and creates one long musical journey. I believe this is the last album with the best line up: Kerry King, Thom Araya, Jeff Hanamen(sp?)and Dave Lombardo. If you never got to see these guys live when this album came out at the end of the speed metal craze of the late 80s/early 90's you missed something incredible. I once saw them with Megadeth, and as great as Dave Mustaine thinks he is, ther was no comparison. Buy it and like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this cd is no good, bye it, listen to it, all the songs sound the same, the artwork sucks too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Slayer albums","review":"Seasons in the abyss is my favorite album by Slayer.There are alot of classic songs on here, War ensamble,Seasons in the abyss,Dead skin mask,Skeletons ofsociety,Blood red,Spirit in black,Expendable youth,Born on fire,Temptation and Hallowed point.To this day Slayer is still playing speed metaland they are also known as the kings of speed metal.One of the only bands that will never sell out on us.They will continue to play speed metal until they dropdead.They are also one of the biggest most popular metalbands of this decade.Slayer is awesome,speed metal rules!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GEM, A MASTERPICE OF TRASH !!! SLAYER AT HIS BEST !!!","review":"The Rick Rubin / Slayer team produced their best album ever in SEASONS. The album is perfect, each note or riff, no matter how fast was slow it was played, was clearly carefully crafted and arranged, whitout loosing spontainety. The band is in top notch form, and all the ten songs are killers, not a single filler here. I'm out of words to descibe the quality of this album, and I'm not even a great trash / speed metal fan. Unfortunately, Lombardo left soon after this album. He is one of the best metal drummers ever, with an unique style and a beautiful sound to his kit, even when he played the most aggressive of tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"13 Years in the Abyss","review":"The year is 1991. They call the concert Clash of the Titans. They call the stadium The Cow Palace. Once upon a time 4 bands named Anthrax, Megadeth Testament and Slayer could come together and fill that sucker full of 50,000 people. Oh yeah, and did I mention Alice in Chains opened? Who would have known 13 years later four of these bands would become yesterdays news, and AIC would be played to death on the radio. In any case, Slayer came on in support of Seasons in the Abyss, undoubtabtly the favored act. Seasons in the Abyss, like many have said, combined many great attributes of their two earlier releases. What I like best about this album aside from the guitar work, is the remarkable drum work. In any case, this one marks a seriously great time in music, that is all but ignored nowadays, but in years to come, is bound to be reconsidered, regardless of how desperately the music industry tries to avoid it. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their second best by any stretch.","review":"Like I said about South of Heaven: a lame attempt to sound relevant, poetic, and evolved. But much of it sounds even more strained and out-of-character than SOH. Slightly more thrashy than SOH, but not in a good way.They got rid of the cheezy monster-movie riffs which plagued SOH. But they kept the dull, whiny vocals. I guess Tom needed a few years to rest his voice after Reign In Blood.On the plus side, \\"Hallowed Point\\" and \\"Born of Fire\\" are classic Slayer--more or less... \\"War Ensemble\\"--a fan favorite for some reason--is awkward, as if they tried too hard to sound edgy, aggressive, and political.If you're new to Slayer, I recommend their pre-SOH material, especially RIB. If you're a hard-core fan after hearing RIB, or just curious, go ahead and try this, as you might agree with other fans who say this is their second best album.Songwriting: 5/10Musicianship: 8/10Sound Quality: 7/10Originality: 5/10Listenability: 3/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst I've heard so far","review":"After Slayer produced Reign in Blood, arguably the best metal album of all time, I guess they could go no further in that direction, and produced South of Heaven, a mediocre album that has some good songs, and some bad songs. I suspect that they tried to be more like Metallica with South of Heaven, in order to get into the mainstream rock culture and sell more albums. Some reviews say South of Heaven was their worst album of that period, but it's significantly better then Seasons in the Abyss. There are only a few decent songs on this album, and the rest sounds very tired and poorly produced. Slayers live album, Decade of Aggression actually brings to life some of the songs on this album, and I recommend getting that CD first and see if you like those songs. The title track is not bad, but unless you have heard it before and really like it, this album isn't worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARK SEASON...","review":"This CD is so bad that I can't understand why a band like this survives so long, fed by fans who think they are \\"different\\" or \\"radical\\".

Before I got this one, Divine Intervention was my favorite. Things have changed! See, on every Slayer album there is at least ONE song I really don't like(but usually no more than 3), but on this one, EVERY song totally rules. I can listen to this from start to finish, and never be tempted to hit the NEXT TRACK button. That's how good it is. My personal favorite is probably \\"Temptation,\\" mostly because of the killer lyrics, but the musical part also rocks. But every song on this rocks my world. So if you don't have this, get it.

If you have a chance, or the cash to buy it from a collector, then do so. This disc is truly Trouble's most inspired and noteworthy effort to date. Eric Wanger has an absolutely incredible voice and the emotional thrust of the disc is powered so heavily by it. Production-wise it stands alone. Like other bands, who went to Def American, something clicked. There is something inexplicably real about this disc. It's the closest you will get to hearing what Trouble sounds like live. The first time I saw these gentelmen they were opening for Savatage at the Agora in Cleveland, Ohio, and touring for this album. INCREDIBLE!! This album makes the top ten greatest metal albums of all time easily. The \\"trouble\\" is that it's not in print right now.

The battery dies before you get the chance to put it back on the charger. Also, the handsets (I have 3) do not share the phonebook numbers. You have to enter each and every number again for all the handsets. In adition, the voicemail light is always on and the phone display says I have voicemail while I don't. You erase the message and it comes back after you get a missed call. The phone looks nice and sleek but is not worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone annoys me","review":"I wish I had returned this phone. The things that annoy me APART from the phone book are: no warning that the battery is about to die, a very annoying ringing tone when another call is coming in, the fact that when you program names into the phone book and that person calls in they are identified by number only, not name AND you cannot press last number like you can with panasonic as it doesn't put the '1' in front... that is really really annoying!

Problem #1 was I had phone in bedroom and with the answer on and set to lowest volume(off) phone ringer off there was still a click to be heard. Only a problem for those that work late and would like some peace while they sleep.Problem #2 and the biggest was that my phone would take 20-24 hours to charge and would only last 12 hours before it needed charging again! I did email support and they said it was in need of replacement.Problem #3 is after having for 3 weeks this small phone seemed fragile to me. How many of us have dropped a phone? This phone would not survive many drops, believe me.I replaced it with another brand.

What a disaster!-- I could not edit either the number or the name during entry! What an amazing oversight!-- After laboring to enter a dozen numbers into the phone, I looked for the button to transfer them into the other handsets. Nope!

Ok. One time I was one the phone with tech support of a large software company. When on speaker - the battery goes away much faster than if holding by the ear. I had to get the 2nd phone - that comes with it - and use that phone while phone #1 recharged. Big deal. I was on the phone - with speaker on - for over 90 minutes and it worked.

After that, the batteries in EVERY handset (we had 4) would last for about 1/2 a day if they weren't on the cradle. That's standby, not talk. You could have about one conversation before they'd start beeping at you.I noticed last week that they're using these phones on the TV show \\"24\\".

They would hold a charge for few days with moderate use.However, within the last few months we've found that the sound quality has gone to crap (or maybe always was). The phones cut in-and-out, but only the out-going sound. So we, the users, don't notice it. We often talk to others who are on their cell phones and I think they just assumed since they had called our home number that it was their cellular service. One of the handsets is worse than the other, and it occurs even with a full charge on the battery, so it's not due to that.I printed off and followed about a 20 item trouble-shooting list from Vtech's website, but all it did was prove these phones are crap.

For my purposes, it holds the charge all day when I am not using it and it is not on the rechargeable base.

Bad engineering I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I liked the design, but it is very badly made phone. I owned it for approx. 6 months, and the batteries on the handsets died completely. (When receiving incoming calls, the handsets shut itself off after 3 rings or so.) Also, CallerID and your phonebook does not link (sync), so in most cases, you will just see bunch of numbers, even if the phone knows / recognizes that it is a phone call from your friends or relatives.

It seemed to me like it was just waiting for the warranty to run out before the base died, though! About two weeks after the warranty ended (i.e. one year after we purchased it), the base station became completely non-responsive. I tried their website's troubleshooting steps (unplug it, remove batteries, wait five minutes, then put it all back together) to no avail.There is NO outside-warranty support whatsoever, so we're without a home phone until we buy another one.Since this is the second vtech cordless phone we've had where this has happened to us, we will not be buying anything else from this company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Dud","review":"The phones did not work when I received them. To avoid time and return postage I went to a local store to purchase another set. Of the new set one of the batteries did not work. After switching out the batteries I finally got the phones to work. The phones are stylish and look good. The only issue I have is the choice of ring tones and volume. Three of the tones sound exactly the same and all the tones leaves a lot to be desired. The volume level only goes to five and with the tones that sounds the best you can barely hear the ringing.

When the phone rings in the family room, I can take the phone to another room to speak without having to turn the television off for others.

Not very good for the nights we forget to charge it overnight. If the battery life was longer this would be a great phone.

I'm not a power user and have not used any additional functions. I think the phones are sleek and stylish, and they work fine. I bought the basic base station and single extra handset to see how I liked it, and I liked it well enough I wanted to upgrade to more handsets. The product description right here at amazon says: \\"upgradable to include additional handsets\\"But amazon does not seem to offer any way to get additional handsets. So I googled, and no matter what I looked at or where I could *NOT* find additional handsets, which I now need. I finally broke down and called Vtech. They told me you can *ONLY* get additional handsets when you buy the base station initially. You can't add handsets later. I consider that a major rip-off and will never buy from Vtech again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY-- WON'T LAST 6 MONTHS","review":"Oh, I wish I had read these reviews before I paid $90 for this!!

Even when I wasn't talking on it but it was left off the charger for minimal time it would die, both handsets gave the same problem.

The first phone failed after a day, I called VTech (VTech HQ only 20 mi. from my house, Big plus I thought then!) Not much help there, so I returned phone to Amazon for an instant replacement. Replacement phone had the same problem. I called VTech support again & finally found out that \\"Version 1's\\" had a LOT of these problems & Amazon does not have Version 2. (and VTech NOT pulling Vers. 1 off the market, WHY NOT?) I was then told to ship phone to the Texas service/support center for replacement (at MY expense) with a Version 2 model which would take 4 to 6 weeks, No Thanks, I returned it to Amazon for a full refund.

A sense of despair surrounds this album, and in the end it is one of the few albums in devil rock that achieves its goal of creating a convincing and sustained mood of wickedness. Standout tracks are \\"Mother,\\" \\"Am I Demon,\\" Twist Of Cain,\\" \\"Not Of This World,\\" and \\"Soul On Fire.\\" This is an excellent album by the former Misfits front man, and it is one of the best heavy metal albums of the 80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is the Rue power of Danzig","review":"I found Danzig at a dark and odd time in my life and of course it was Danzig I that started helping me through it. No matter how many times I listen to this album I just can't get the images the songs create out of my head. With \\"Mother\\" you can just imagine Glenn strolling into his girls house telling her mom and dad off. \\"The Hunter\\" is my favorite song due to the fact of it's sexual overtones \\"I don't use no love gun, don't need no kissin', when I get a hold of you honey, light you up like christmas...\\" I think Danzig has made me into a more well rounded and darker individual. A very good album for those wanting to find a little more in the metal industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"DANZIG (1988)","review":"This Danzig album is definately the best Danzig album of them all. Glenn has the awesomest voice-a mix of blues and sort of country. It's really cool. It's not too heavy and tracks such as mother and End of Time will make you an instant Danzig fan!P.S. Don't forget to check out some of the old stuff from the MISFITS, Glenn Danzig's previous band."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one stands the test of time!","review":"This is the first album from one of my favorite bands. I think it's just about the very best Glenn put out though I must admit I like all of them. I remember being 17 and wearing alot of black and hanging out with my friends blaring Danzig out the windows. Now, I'm turning thirty and when I listen to this cd it brings me back. This is one that stands the test of time. Back then, this was a very different style than what most bands were putting out. Still, its some of the best music of that era. Glenn has one of the more unique and distinct voices in music. His singing voice is good on both the ballads and the faster songs. There's not a bad one on this so its easily played all the way through.My favorites are \\"Mother\\", \\"She Rides\\", \\"Twist of Cain\\" and \\"Soul on Fire.\\" Danzig is a great band.

This is a raw, but rocking metal CD. The guitar sound is unrefined but works with the songs and their dark tone as does Danzig's measured yowl, and they have just enough melody that you can sing along. Danzig is an evil person and he tells you that on every song. I like the songs but they could use some theme variations. Most people probably know \\"Mother\\" by now but \\"Twist of Cain\\", \\"Am I Demon\\" and \\"The Hunter\\" are strong songs as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twist of Cain, YEAH!","review":"There are many records that were made as an attempt to scare parents. There are many records that have tried to capture the imagery and sense of evil. The first Danzig record was released a very long time ago. I was very young upon it's release. I would listen to it in my room alone and get fruck out. It still freaks me out. It's a great album to spin as an adolescent and it's a great rock album. It has weird devilish hillbilly rock appeal. It has tough guy symbolism and Mother is still a great effew to those who would like to censor what the kids listen to. On later Danzig records he/they conjure up more of a sexy werewolf/demonlover/vampire vibe and that's cool, but they hit the nail on the head right through a map of hell. I can't wait to see what the kids keep trying to come up with in an empty effort to top this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Danzig by far","review":"Don't waste your time trying to pimp other Danzigs. This one is the best by far and its not close. Also, Mother is probably one of my least favorite tracks here. End of Time is AWESOME. Gotta love She Rides, Am I Evil and the opening track as well as the killer Not of this world. The most complete Danzig althought the last 2 tracks are a bit weak. I have all the Danzig CDs and he never topped this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love glenn","review":"If you like the misfits, you will probably like danzig. It is way more metal than the misfits but the musical complexity is off the hook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping music evil","review":"Former Misfits and Samhain singer Glenn Danzig turned out this solo self titled debut which found the perfect melody and mix of blues and metal. From the awesome and catchy opener \\"Twist of Cain\\", which will have you banging your head in no time, to the blusey \\"She Rides\\", \\"Am I Demon\\", and the popular rocker \\"Mother\\", this album found Danzig and his crew (including former Samhain bassist Eerie Von, guitarist John Christ, and drummer Chuck Biscuits) still a little rough around the edges, but the band would get better as the album's progressed (the best Danzig album by far is \\"Danzig 3: How the Gods Kill\\") and Glenn's voice never sounded better up until this album. If you've never listened to any of Danzig's solo work, or if you like a little blues influence with your metal, then check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh huh huh - he's all shook up.","review":"Twist of Cain is fine, some of this is beyond parody. Neat album cover though - don't get stuff like that with MP3 eh? Overall, don't waste your money - form your own band."},{"rating":"2","title":"After Samhain","review":"Glenn Danzig is an old man with no sense of humor. The music was fine, even getting play on MTV with Mother.. The main problem is his webmaster and his fans who are totally 80s. He was a one hit wonder with Mother, and both this and the Thrall album went platinum. There is more to the music than meets the eye- Danzig obviously relishes in seeing himself as the menacing, evil heavy metal frontman. Sabbath-like stereotypical heavy metal. Danzig successfully aims for the grey area between truly menacing evil and wink wink nudge nudge dark humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danzig's 1988 Debut","review":"Ex-Misfits lead singer Danzig, comes back from the grave with his first solo record. Danzig, attemps to do a \\"metal\\" album, which doesn't even sounds like a metal album. It's more of a gothic/pop-metal album. Ok, it has some metal influence on it. But the point is, this album rocks. It's catchy and dark too, what else could you ask for in a album. Danzig still has that Misfits touch to it by bringning gothic to the pop world. Best songs off this 1988 album are \\"Mother\\", \\"Am I Demon\\" and \\"She Rides\\". Classic 80's album to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Danzig Album ever.","review":"Twist of Cain,Mother, Danzig's Self titled debut album with Newly named Danzig(formerly Samhain minus band members except him and eerie von) Classic Album,Bluesy,dark,Rock,Metal,Some punk aspect but not misfits, Not as dark as Samhain at least on this album.

Nicely done record, with the original version of \\"Mother\\" on it. This came out in the late 80's, and was clearly pushing ahead, past the hair metal bands and the speed metal stuff.

Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"It not only works for Honda/Acura 1998 and Up. This harness is exactly what you'd need if you want a parrot MKI9200 installed in your Grand Vitara 2008.

Ja Funmi and Samba are two amazing standouts on a collection that stands the test of time. If you are surfing the web and considering a first \\"world-beat\\" purchase, BUY THIS DISC! The artistry of Ade's ensemble is as joyful, tragic and complex as any Western symphony...I have had the luck to see this man and his group three times, each time a sublime experience...only one caution: if you buy this- watch your wallet: you'll end up spending all your money on more African music, 'cuz you'll be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"College Memories","review":"I used to listen to this album incessently when I was going my 'reggae' period in college. My friends and I were also smoking alot of 'Boo' as my friend from Nepal called it. Anyhow, I remember the delicate interweaving melodies and rythms of this album to be almost hypnotic and to result in relaxing and joyful feelings.

Just as Islam is being penetrated as never before with the gospel and the need to reach out is the greatest you encourage the already timid and disobedient church to stick its neck further into the sand. Conjecture and speculation should be no match for the clear commands of scripture but there are those in the church who will listen to false prophets who confirm them in their disobedience."},{"rating":"2","title":"An informative and eye-opening read","review":"This book was very informative and what the author has to say about muslims in France (where he resided) relates very well to what's going on there today. I appreciated that he had first-hand experience in the muslim community, and you get a \\"real\\" feel for Islam & Christianity in the end times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and bad","review":"The author's views on Islam are probably accurate. It is a religion that is diametrically opposed to the teachings of Scripture but his understanding of that becomes faulty when he tries to predict the outcome of things that God has expressly hidden. Prophecy fever always diverts attention from the needs of the world. I have not found a book that moves the church to reach out. The solution offered by the author of these sorts of works typically urge you to go literally or figuratively out to a mountaintop to await Christ and in effect to ignore the world. Follow this sort of advice and you will be \\"of the world\\" but not in it... you will out of fear flee the world as the world would flee any other danger. Perfect love casts out fear and the glory of the church is not in seeing the future and protecting itself but in sacrificial service to advance the kingdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"The book is interesting in its approach to end times. There have been many attempts to predict a timeline of end time events. I wonder why authors still do that? It reminds me of \\"88 reasons why the Lord will return in 1988.\\" I assume sales of that book have fallen off drastically since 1989. I guess we will have to wait until the timeline comes and goes for this one as well to evaluate the author's premises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was let down.","review":"I didn't finish it, I got to upset just reading not quiet half.

First, it is durable enough that I anticipate it will survive the entire stay. The street names are clearly indicated; the public transportation facilities are identified. Amsterdam can be a bit disorienting because it's a city build with concentric streets. North and South can be confused easily. I have found my bearings several times when I would have been lost without this map. If you are interested in finding you way about Amsterdam, this map will be interesting to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good map","review":"As a frequent traveler to Amsterdam, I found this map to be pretty much worthless. It is difficult to read due to the small/light printing of the street (straat) names, etc. Also, it only covers the city center area and does not show the southern part of the city at all. The StreetWise maps are much more comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed Economics","review":"Nixon's Economy is a fast paced, action packed account of Nixon's economic policy decisions and the politics that drove them.

It's a lot different from highlander since it has a lighter mood to it. It would have been nice to see Methos show up in an episode. I was surprised that they didn't show more female immortals coming after Amanda. Bottom line is that regardless of what the behind the scenes interviewers opinionate, this was a excellent show and it was getting better every episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amanda was not a good choice for the lead!","review":"The premise is good, the actors well Paul I thought was quite good the other supporting folks also quite good. What shocked and disapointed me was that unlike it's predecessor the lead couldn't carry off her end of the deal.I had thought an Amanda show would be fabulous, I loved Amanda in the original seires and in fact prefered her and much of the supporting cast over Adrian Paul for the most part. But what Adrian had that Elizabeth didn't was the strengh and skill to carry an entire episode/series.It shocked me very much I was soo looking forward to this show and as each episode aired and I got more and more disapointed I finally just gave up caring.I liked Paul I thought what they did with his character was so damn stupid and cheap, taken straight from Highlander and unoriginal.I do not know if I want this set I KNOW I don't want to hear them all snipe about who messed up, sorry folks you all blew it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A blight on the good name of Highlander.","review":"First thing, Amanda as the star? In the original series she was weak, selfish, unmoral and had to be saved by Duncan atleast 3 times! We never really got to see her fight because Duncan saved her! The original series writers self destructed the series so there wasn't really anywhere to go with this season. Where do they get Amanda being a Raven and a highlander. She was born in the highlands but moved soon after. It is absolutely boring, and all it does is tring to ride the coattails of Duncan and Connor. I highly do not reccomend this season, for the new fan of highlander nor for those of us who have followed the Highlander from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing...","review":"How could Elizabeth Gracen go from fantastic in Highander to lousy in Raven?

In fact the first episode is a swimsuit one where the whole family is trapped on a island. Yes, most series keep that kind of plot for the second to last show, but not Happy Lesson. They put it right in the sixth episode and out of the way.But like I was saying, it seems to be half-and-half, as a few of the episodes really touched me. In one episode Uzuki is mistaken by a little boy to be an angel while in another Chitose's oldest sister is wondering if she really WANTS to be a idol. Add the Annual Field Day, giant robots, Minazuki trying to decide which after-school club to join, a mother who once was trying to take over the world, lots of food and you have 125 minutes of enjoyment!Extras include sketches as well as clean opening and closing animations.

It doesn't teach, it doesn't uplift, it doesn't help you grow, and it certainly doesn't entertain.

At the time parts of it were somewhat fascinating. Now after years of listening to all sorts of electronic music, from Avante Garde to Trance, I must say that after a recent complete listen of this album, I probably will never put it back in my cd player again.

Remember, when it came out, all that preceded it was the pop perfection of Speak and Spell. So this was all arty and moody. Swinging wildly from end of the spectrum to the other, hitting some real gems along the way. See You - Brilliant. Meaning of Love - Brilliant too. All the moody synth-driven songs were just lush for the time, and I think I wore out the tape I made of it, playing endless round and round loops on my AIWA walkman. Oh god how I got into all the sad songs walking and pouting in snowstorms on the way here or there with this playing in my ears. I doubt you'd love this if it were your 6th or 7th DM CD, but if it were your second, you would treasure it as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The transition album.","review":"A Broken Frame is probably Depeche Mode's least known album. It is their second album as a group and also a transition album from their boppy Speak and Spell to the dark electronic gloom that would follow and characterize the band's unique style. At this time in DM's career the band was in a fragile state as the departure of band member Vince Clark left the band on limbo. For this album there were only three member and member Martin Gore assumed the role of songwriter for the group.Even though A Broken Frame spawned the fantastic track \\"See You\\",there aren't really any tracks that stand out. This is a pretty mellow album, but with great DM style instrumentation.This is not an album to dance to or with many fast tracks. The music is best enjoyed to just listen and visualize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous music unfortunatly written before better technology","review":"This is a truly great album as far as the music goes...songs such as Satelite are bound to tantalize for years to come. But the instruments of the era are very cheezy and definitly dates this album. If you are a fan of early 80's electronica, then you will definitly love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two quality singles do not make an album","review":"To say that there are only two songs worth hearing on Depeche Mode's second album, A Broken Frame, would be a bit of an exaggeration, but without a doubt the band suffered from the sophomore jinx here. It's not that the songs are consistently unlistenable; in fact they're pleasant enough, but nothing on the album stands out like its first single, \\"See You.\\" Even the album's one other highlight, \\"The Meaning of Love,\\" sounds like a Speak & Spell outtake. Keeping in mind that Martin Gore would churn out many singles as good or better than any on Speak & Spell in the years following A Broken Frame, it seems that rather than missing Vince Clark, Depeche Mode and Gore were just at a creative low point here. Only hardcore Depeche Mode fans need this, casual fans and neophytes should go for The Singles 81>85 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring CD","review":"I must admit I didn't \\"grew up\\" listening Depeche, instead, was indoctrinated starting when I was around 17 by a good friend, and later by who became my wife.

In addition to providing detail information about individual members of the unit, the book discusses the roles that the unit played in each of its battle encounters. Taking over seven years to write, the book was a lobor of love for the author who had ancestors in the unit.

Even better than the Beserk Series, and Akira. I loved It. The plot is about a Immortal Vampire Named Alucard who serves his Master Intergra Hellsing who is the Leader of the Hellsing Organizeation. It is also about a Girl that was saved by Alucard and he Tranformed her into a Vampire. Her name is Seras Victoria. If you like blood,guts and Violence you will enjoy it I guarette.

I can't wait for season 2 to come out in 2004!Reviewer; Kyle Hohensee of Cooperstown NY USA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellsing Review","review":"As a fan of the Hellsing series I can not honestly say this series is worth watching. There is no real reason to watch this series when Hellsing Ultimate is clearly the superior work. While Alucard is badass if you watch the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs and compare them to the manga of the series you will see that the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs are perfectly animated version of the manga. So don't waste your money on the impure souls series as one it has nothing to do with the manga and two its not even finished. Hellsing Ultimate is the only true way to enjoy Hellsing animated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series, but just know","review":"This is a great series (I highly reccomend it), but if you're looking for the super-stylistic, 3d backgroundified version, that is the OVA remakes that are just being released this year.

DO NOT BUY the product featured on this page. It is a pirated, \\"bootleg\\" release. The real Hellsing R1 DVD release was on 4 DVDs from the late great Geneon Entertainment. FX, on the other hand, is a known bootlegging operation, and none of the money you give them will reach the artists or actors who worked on this series.

Too bad it was only one season. Ended it like they thought there was going to be a second season, and there should have been. Alucard was one of the best vampires ever, not too good and not too bad.

I wouldn't call it the best anime i've ever seen, and they could have used more of the story line the anime was based on, but it was still good. Hellsing is an interesting anime about an organization in Britin hunting vampires with its own troops and two vampires of their own. The story was good, but could have gone more in depth in some areas, and they could have given it a better ending unless a sequal is in the making. The only people who would buy it and not be disapointed are major anime fans, vampire fans, and people with a dark sence of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it, however...","review":"there could have been so much more to this and...there is, i would like to say these discs are completely different from the manga and OVA. if you want to watch what you have read in the manga watch the OVA's if you want something different from what you have read buy these.i personally did not enjoy this as much as the OVA's and manga because i read the manga first and i expected more, it did not live up to my expectations and turned into something completely different and yet highly disturbing in its own right, it deviates so greatly from the mangas that there is the other series of anime called Hellsing ultimate OVA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete series uncomplete","review":"This anime was extremely well made. The graphics were dark and graphic matching the type of series this is. The audio was outstanding and the action was amazing. There were, however, a couple of things that did not make this series hit home for me. First the series is only 13 episodes, which leaves room for longing more. The series also is pretty incoherent, the beginning and end really do not fit in with the middle plot. The beginning just seems like they are adding much to the story except to further the characterization, the fixes this problem and has a smooth transition between episodes, but the end leaves wonder as to what happened, and what will happen.*spoiler*Arucard pretty much just hack another vampire and boom series over. *end spoiler*Though there are a few things that I found problematic with the series I still suggest adding it to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it's a pretty good series.","review":"I disagree with the editorial review on this series. The series is pretty cool. The person obviously dislikes anime and doesn't apprieciate the effort that went into the series. The series suffers because it doesn't follow the complete story of the anime, since only 1 graphic novel is released a year by the creator. However the last episode is awesome.With the planning of the series being completely redone and staying true to the manga, I would not buy this series unless you really can't wait. This one has a lot of plot weaknesses. The strongest point is the music. The music is wicked awesome, and will be around for the next series as well, which will feature a Mad Nazi major and his batallion of 1000 vampires laying seige to the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"No box, not Ultimate","review":"Has no box like it shows in the picture.

Accompanied by omnipresent Scarface samples, they managed to interpolate views on sexual politics, the music industry and the drug business into their raps on sex, violence and drug dealing. Also, they continued to develop their use of horror imagery and themes, which began with Assassins on their first Rapalot LP. And former dancer Bushwick's meditations on his stature turn into one of the best raps ever spit out.

Songs that make you hit the replay on your car stereo 4 or 5 times in a row. For me, it never came. I currently own every original CD he's put out, and I love his stuff, but there were so many songs that felt like they were old tunes re-fitted with new lyrics that I just couldn't get behind this CD.

Lyle is one of my favorite artists, but to me it feels like he might be coasting a bit.

But, very few songs here sparkle with the humor, depth, and compassion I've come to expect from him.If you are a Lyle fan, why haven't you bought it already?

This is the first of his cds which sounds like a traditional country album - with the exception of the 2 glorious gospel songs.

I think the best tracks are \\"In My Own Mind\\", \\"Nothing But a Good Ride\\", \\"Wallisville Road\\", and \\"Election Day\\".While \\"The Truck Song\\" and \\"San Antonio Girl\\" sound alike, I ask, Who cares?

So where was Hannibal Lector? Well, in a very intrigueing and disturbing fashion the author has hidden him in the text. At first I was disappointed and then I realised that this was literary detective story as much as it is a horror story. Which one of these characters is Hannibal Lector, disguised and under a new identity? And what is he going to do?

The author makes it easy to follow along and I ensure it is a definite page-turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The Pledge was one of my favorite reads of the year, and I have read a lot of books. It is the type of book that just grips you and has you looking forward to reading every chance you get. After you read a chapter you are always left saying well maybe just one more, and then another. It is quite long, but reads very fast. The characters are well developed and likeable, and there are numerous interesting subplots weaved into the main story. There is also some humorous moments, especially involving the dean. The main plot is very compelling, and the plot twists are numerous. I hope Rob Kean has another book this good up his sleeve. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil Rhyming Brothers","review":"Ok--I picked it up because it looked entertaining, but The Pledge just wasn't that great. The plot, on top of being drawn out and convoluted, was implausible. What kind of exclusive fraternity bids a pledge without knowing one blessed thing about his past? And come on, generations of former brothers that still hang around the frat house? It reminds me of the thirty year old guy who trolls around teen dance clubs trying to pick up high school girls and impress people with his fancy car. And, I was very dissatisfied with the way the story ended. I was hoping Mark would at last reconcile with his fugitive father, who was sort of at the center of the entire conflict--but we never even met the man!For me, the best parts of the story were the rhymes that Mark and the other black cloaked figures recited. Maybe the whole story could have been in rhyme--that would've been something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pledge","review":"Good captivating charactors. There are enough plot twists and charactors to keep the suspense through the entire book. It was set in a college, and the students were quite believable. Looking at the descriptions, I could just about find someone from my college days to fit each of Kean's charactors. Some of the \\"alumni\\" weren't as believable, however, this may be due to my pre-set convictions. It was a page-turner to the very end. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys best sellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable!","review":"It's not often that I can't finish a book; usually if I can't it's due to a lack of plot interest. This is the first book I haven't been able to finish because I disliked every single character, even the two so-called good guys. The first hundred pages had nothing but evil characters manipulating and getting away with everything. I disliked the main good guy (can't even remember his name) for ever being involved in such a disgusting frat, and his girlfriend for going out with him; for someone who was so against frats, it seems strange that she should be going out with a former frat member.One hundred pages into the book, and there was not even a glimmer of hope that the evils of the frat would be punished. All of the actions of the characters were infuriating and just depressing to read.Thanks goodness I didn't buy even the paperback version of this book; it would be one that I couldn't even display on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a disappointment","review":"I'd heard this book was really hot ... And I'll admit, there were some good \\"hazing\\" scenes, but overall, I found Kean's writing pretty tame. Not nearly as good as Alan Dickson's _The Greek Way_ or Michael Nambla's _Barely Brothers_."},{"rating":"1","title":"failing grade","review":"Wow. This has to be absolutely one of the worst novels I have ever read (and I've read some of the stuff profiled in Pronzini's GUN IN CHEEK and SON OF GUN IN CHEEK). This is the literary equivalent of an Ed Wood movie-- ludicrous situations and dialogue so bad they have to be read to be believed. Jaw-droppingly awful. How did this thing even get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cathy's review","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I hate reading a book and having questions about what happened to the characters at the end. The author had way too many things going on in this book. It is almost as if he wanted to included every idea he has ever had in his life in one book. Additionally, the verse was way too poetic. The subject matter was not beautiful, so it was unneccessary to use the imagery that he did. In my opinion, there were just too many things going on in this book and its a shame that they went unresolved. This book would have been just as good if it was half the length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story of cover-up's","review":"As a first novel for this author, I thought that he wrote an excellent novel! I enjoyed this book so much! The story revolves around a fraternity and the secrets they keep at the expense of others. A former member of the fraternity is conflicted about the novelty of brotherhood or the truth that must be found! There are questions of who to trust and who really is behind all of the bad things happening! This was a mystery which also showed how dangerous greek life can be. Although it was fiction, I think that there are some real issues with hazing in this story. I would definately recommend reading this story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic to the extreme","review":"Which of Bowdoin's fraternities kicked Rob Kean out? And why did he leave Bowdoin before he graduated? (The jacket copy says he \\"attended.\\") My husband, a Bowdoin alumnus, refused to read this book beyond the first chapter saying that it bore absolutely no resemblance to his experience.People have commented about the unrealistic characters of Mark and Shawn. How long would a college of the stature of \\"Simsbury\\" put up with a dean like Templeton or a befuddled president?Also, if Sigma were indeed the all-powerful, brothers-to-the-end, world-controlling fraternity it is made out to be, why was it that NONE of the Simsbury College trustees was a Sigma?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greek life, not at its best!","review":"I am a sucker for any novel set on a college campus, prep or boarding school. Unfortunately, I found the book to be suffering from the toos - too wordy, too long and too much going on and not enough fully explained for my liking. I think the premise was a good one but needed some good editing and then some pulling together."},{"rating":"1","title":"have yet to read a worse book","review":"This book is probably one of the worst and unrealistic things I have ever read. The characters (especially Shawn) are unrealistic, as is the portrayal of a fraternity full of murderers, rapists, and thieves. Sometimes I wish someone would write the truth about what fraternal organizations do...this kind of trashy libel is getting old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book","review":"This book lacked any factual representation of Greek organizations and seemed to be simply out to get a rise from people who have sons and daughters in those organizations. The plot was weak and unfounded, the portrayal of the fraternity members ridiculous and stereotypical. Perhaps Mr. Kean should do that thing called \\"background research\\" before he writes another novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjective Overload","review":"I read the first chapter of this book at the bookstore one night and it was pretty catchy. I then decided to buy the book and was extremely disappointed. This kind of prose would never make it past any self-respecting college professor. How it got past an editor at a major publisher is beyond me. The writing is so childish and predictable. The author seems to have a vast knowledge of adjectives and somehow feels that no noun is complete without one. The story is filled with many subplots that take far too long to develop and only serve to annoy, not add suspense. Obviously the author never learned one of the golden rules of creative writing: more words (700+ pages for a murder mystery/thriller??) does not always equal better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, Disappointing, Elitist Rhetoric","review":"Like a movie of the week, this one droned on and on never really managing to break the surface of what was behind all the hatred. (Someone give Kean a hug.) This book is far too jaded for someone with so much promise (as the book jacket claims). How many times can a reader tolerate phrases such as \\"partying like rock stars\\" without it sounding hackneyed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly bad","review":"Wow, I'm surprised that anyone gave this more than 2 stars. This is a candidate for the worst book I've read in my life. It starts bad and gets worse, with stupid characters and absurd plot twists.Most grating is the consistantly bad writing; Kean simply writes poor sentences, and it can be painful to read them. I mean, I don't expect Nabokov, or even Grisham, but this was just an amateur effort throughout. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised after reading Kean's thanks to his collegues at a big consulting firm for their support. Hey Kean, go back to your day job shredding documents rather than writing them!Maybe I just felt cheated because I had to lug this 720-pager home from the library and back."},{"rating":"1","title":"How on earth did this book get published?","review":"The author shows some promise: the plot is intriguing and fairly unpredictable. But his characters are hackneyed and two-dimensional and his style is extremely immature: overblown, self-indulgent, trite prose. A strong editor could have improved this book immeasurably by cutting 50 pages and several hundred adjectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, unbelievable story","review":"Several things bugged me about The Pledge. One, I thought it was terribly written, full of cliches and stereotypical characters that bogged down every page. Author Rob Kean desperately needs an editor; the book's 514 pages could have easily been sliced by a third. I was skimming through the final pages, something no novel should ever make you do. Plus, there was another thing that nagged me throughout about The Pledge - it should have been set in the 50s! Eliminate the few references to cell phones and e-mail, and Kean's bunch of mafia frat thugs would have been much more believable conducting business in any era but the '90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down- Buy this book!","review":"This book invited me inside and made me wish the story would continue even after I had finished the last sentence, primarily because of the feeling underlying what Mr. Kean has written. Kean obviously has passion for the craft of writing. It's apparent in every paragraph that he loves words and goes nuts when he has a good story to tell. The plot is interesting, though in places it is needlessly obfuscated. The main character, Mark Jessy, is beautifully drawn, fully realized, and totally believable. On the other hand, the females in the book are less believable, tending more to sound like juvenile fantasy figures than real women, but that's forgiven because the book works."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Matter; Less Art","review":"Seldom do I not finish a book, even a bad one, but this novel was more than I could take after 100 pages. The author, a genuinely nice guy I heard in an interview, fancies himself a writer, but I found little in the story beyond stereotypes and cliches. I am astonished that the book was not edited more tightly. I am even more astonished that Kean received a $1 million contract for this book, a second, and movie rights. All the best to him, for in matters of taste, we are all experts. What a country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not wait to get back to this one!","review":"So nice to get away from the legal mysteries and medical thrillers. May be a little far-fetched but couldn't be more exciting and fun to read.Never knew what was coming next. Loved the writing style and the author's clever way of describing things. Particularly, rumors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, fast read. Gripping...","review":"The book was written to read fast - I read the whole thing in one sit (I missed some classes too, oops) The story line is well thought out and flows evenly, but I find that the descriptions of the charecters and scenes a little too perfect for reality, aside from the coruption. However, it is well made up for with the many plot twists that grip the reader to continue reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"He gets small colleges right; plots and writing wrong","review":"Wait for the mass market paperback.Though I read this in one sitting it was more to study what not to do when writing, and for the record this is one of the rare times I agree with Kirkus' scathing review. A terrible freshman effort starts this two book deal with Warner; lets hope the second novel is actually edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pledge","review":"If your looking for an entertaining read,pick up this book. Make sure you keep inmind the definition of fiction and you won't have a problem. The time frame setup of the book was a new approach to me and enjoyable.Great start for a first book,worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"formulaic in the dullest possible way","review":"The collegiate greek system setting promises intrigue, but what a disappointment: movie-of-the-week level plotting, female characters a notch above caricature, cliche after painful cliche. Waste of cash and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly awful","review":"Too bad that Mr. Keane doesn't understand what fraternities or humans are actually like. In an effort to write a drama, he fails to write realism--the characters were as shallow as those found on 50s sit-coms, and the ruthlessness portrayed in the Sigmas was previously reserved for Lex Luthor. A cheap attempt at cashing in at the unfortunate dark side of the Greek system, the book ignores all the good that fraternities and sororities do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner, I could not put it down","review":"Coming from a small liberal arts college in New England myself, The Pledge vividly portrays life within the cliques of these small schools. From the \\"jock fraternity\\", to the \\"women lib leaders\\", the story rings true to life at a small school. The twists and turns always leave you guessing the ending. Overall, a fine effort by Mr. Kean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reception for AM Talk Radio","review":"I purchased the Sangean WR-1 radio for it's AM feature. I enjoy listening to Talk Radio.

Great for beginners wanting to get a handle on how a sound system works from power amps, pre-amps, microphone differences to why feedback happens and how to stop it, and lots of other practical advice on how to mix live sound. Good for more advanced sound people who want to advance their skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gives you everything from basic to complex","review":"This book is great for anyone interested in sound reinforcement, or sound in general. Stark starts off with the basics of sound, then covers microphones, smaller scale PA systems, then concert touring systems. His language is easy to understand, and his book provides information on all aspects of live sound, from miking to processing. The use of diagrams are very helpful, and he breaks the book into sections which make it easy to use as a reference guide. However, this book is not for the professional, or someone who is very knowledgable about sound or sound reinforcement. I would recomend this to a beginner or an intermediate level sound person who wants to learn more about how to reinforce sound. In short, if you have taken courses on sound, or are very knowledgable this book isnt for you, but if you want know how to wire a full concert PA system will all the works, this book is for you...

I liked this book a lot. The Tale of Matsura is an ancient Japanese literature, written by an anonymous intellect of that time. This tale per se is such an amusing story, but in many other ways (what ways? Read and find them out yourself. I leave the fun part for you!), this literature will invite you to a voyage in medieval Japan. Lammres constructs this book with two parts. Read the second part, the main body of the tale, first if you are not familiar with the tale. Lammer's translation of the tale is one of the best jobs done on Japanese literatures. Then, move onto the first part, Lammer's analysis. His analysis is very insightful and thorough. Therefore, it might appear to be daunting, but don't be afraid. It won't bite you. In the end, you would realize it has been worth reading.

They explain the post-war troubles pretty well.I don't think the Bolshevik threat plays too well anymore, but I'm sure it was quite timely back then and worked better.If you like mysteries, give it a shot. Hopefully, we get more free Christie over the next few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Plot, weak premise","review":"This novel made an interesting addition to the books of Agatha Christie. Using neither Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, this book ventures off into the spy world after World War I. The book is reasonably fast paced and has an interesting story to it. However, my problem with the book is that supposedly, all the Labour party leaders are secretly Soviet. I must say that detracts from the plausiblity of the story, and therefore also it detracts from the excitement of the book. Other than this major glitch, it has interesting characters, a dubious and diabolical foe, and a surprising twist at the end, good for any mystery. It is also free, which is obviously a major plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better free Kindle titles","review":"I found this little novel to be a real page-turner and a heck of a fun Kindle read (especially for a freebie--at least as of this review).

It's a fun departure from the typical whodunit model, and once events begin to snowball, the story moves at a nearly addictive pace. I am used to the unexpected twist Christie plots generally take, but the end couldn't have possibly been imagined by even the most astute reader/sleuth.It is not meant to be political, terribly thought-provoking, nor even credible. It doesn't have to be to be excellent escapist fare, and in this it succeeds very nicely. Characters are well-defined and engaging, and the locations well-depicted but not tediously so.

The chrismatic yet unknown Mr. Brown is behind all of this, and no one knows who he is. Join our heroes as they chase him down with several false leads and misidentifications.

However, my fears were unallayed. This book is in no comparison to 'Postern of Fate', the last book featuring this daring duo, and also one of few mysteries of Agatha that entirely lacks a plot.From the first pages, the story has a tightly woven plot that toils for more of a surprise effect than realism. Reminiscent of 'The Big Four', another fantastically interesting mystery, 'The Secret Adversary' is made for those seeking adventure in their lives, not a feasible plot.With Christie swinging her signature style of convincing you the murderer really IS the other person (when in reality it is the man on the right), nothing could be more of a thriller and relaxing story than 'Secret Adversary'.

I was quite pleased to see that one of the books I'd yet to read, Secret Adversary, was free on the Kindle.This is a cute, rollicking story set in the 1920s. It has a light air about it, and one can't help but adore the characters of Tommy and Tuppence, who are featured in several other Christie novels and short stories. I found the writing style to be quite different from the usual Christie novel: it was gay and sunny and fancy-free, and although I was somewhat taken aback by it at first, I found myself falling for how fun it all was.The mystery itself involves spying, a secret government treaty, and other twists and turns, with an ending that could be considered shocking only if you weren't paying any attention. Secret Adversary is one of those nice little books to read when you don't feel like thinking very hard, and I loved it for that very reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"great freebie- fun book!","review":"This is the first book in the Tommy and Tuppence series by Agatha Christie.

Problem? The Advesary isn't a secret! Halfway through the novel it becomes clear that the mystery person can only be one of two people. Typically A.C. makes things much more uncertain. I was dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiling the Secret","review":"I can see why this book was free because, quite frankly, you'd have to pay me to read it again.Tuppence and Timothy, two friends who are very poor, hatch a plan over lunch to get some fast cash, even if that means doing something illegal. Somehow, they stumble into the midst of an international espionage ring, trying a find a secret message that could topple governments and start world wars.Sounds exciting and, yet, it just wasn't. This isn't a traditional mystery because there's really nothing for the reader to do--no brain cells required for this. Just sit quietly and read. This book was so long. It took forever for the thin plot to get going anywhere and most of the story just seemed so pointless. It finally starting picking up the pace a little more than halfway in and can honestly say I enjoyed that part. Alas, though, it was too brief of a moment to save my interest.Dame Christie, I'll just catch another series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible !!!","review":"I don't believe Agatha Christie wrote this thing. It is totally a piece of junk. The beginning 4% of the book (that is how much I can carry on reading) are all about two losers babbling the most mundane conversation.

It shows the creation of motivations for war and military action that come out of the personal issues of Generals and politicians. It underlines very clearly the massive destruction of lives as a brutal meaningless war (WWI)in the trenches went on for no reason except the personal ambitions of generals and politiians."},{"rating":"2","title":"price is high but so is the value!","review":"I know that this N&A edition is priced high but I payed the $25.95 here at Amazon and I was not disappointed. The General is one of the best war books I've ever read. It tells the tale of Herbert Curzon as he rises through the ranks to being a general in the British military. It's brilliant in revealing the world, social and political, of WWI Britain. One admires \\"old-school\\" Curzon and those like him and yet one is also shocked at the inadequacy of \\"old-school\\" tactics and their results. This book is gritty and polished, much like the British officers it illustrates. The war bits are very good though tragic. I had read The African Queen and disliked it. This is the second book of Forester's that I've read and I thought it was brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a comedy program.","review":"I waited and waited for this DVD thinking it would show some of the funny sides of our beloved Dom.

However, I must admit to being disappointed. The premise is intriguing. It's reunified Korea and a string of murders are happening with the victims being once-prominent government-employed scientists. The story deals with cloning and genetic experiementation and could have been a tightly-crafted futuristic thriller in the vein of 'The Minority Report'. Also, the inherent cultural struggles of a newly reunited country that developed differently for over 50 years. However, the wooden acting from the cast (it's worse if you watch in original Korean) and the lack of direction sink the movie. The action scenes are adequate, but otherwise a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really for kids with food aversions","review":"I'm sure this book has great information for those of you dealing with kids with strong food aversions (e.g. kids who only eat 3-4 things). But if you're looking for advice on getting a finicky eater to try more foods, this isn't that book. Luckily we seem to be moving past the reluctance to try foods, so I'm not going to worry about it, but this book is being donated or passed on since I won't be using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A significant improvement","review":"Given that there were already some 4 other versions of the Action Fleet Snowspeeder, I wasn't even sure if this one was worth buying. Fortunately, it is. Unlike the previous versions, this one is a very accurate reproduction of Luke's Snowspeeder as it appeared in Empire Strikes Back. It has a much better paint job than the previous versions, including battle damage. Sadly, this speeder doesn't include any figures, so you'll need to scrounge up 2 Rebel pilots. It's too bad the Action Fleet line was canceled - this speeder shows how good Hasbro was getting at making these vehicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Memoir","review":"I believe Alistair writes it as he remembers it. When facts here differ from other versions, I think he honestly believes what he tells in this book. Aside from Neil Aspinall and Mal Evans, he was probably the next closest insider to them from early to the end. He questions Peter Brown's version which is interesting to note. Much here is anecdotal and told in a conversational manner. It is true that there are not too many secrets revealed, but like other \\"insider\\" accounts,it does shed light on it all. Most interesting is how the Fabs refused his calls when Allen Klein gave him the ax. Oh, and Taylor co-authored \\"Hello Goodbye\\" but is too humble to ask for his name as co-writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A product of its time","review":"I bought this at a second hand book shop for 1 ($2), I would not want to spend much more than that.The book suffers from two major problems; the date of publication and the author's journalistic style.Regarding the former, the book was published a few years before the collapse of the Soviet Union and now that the archives have been opened (to an extent), some of the chapters are inaccurate.The latter problem is the author's style. Oberg is a journalist and this is no academic text. The book has no referencing whatsoever, no foot noes, no bibliography and even no index - we simply do not know where Oberg got his information. Oberg also has a tendency to write in a hyperbolic fashion that seems more at home in a tabloid newspaper.These two problems combined mean we get a lot of speculation, guess work and unnamed 'sources'. Oberg simply doesn't know what happened in a lot of cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt the pains of the children turn to trust and healing.","review":"I did not read this myself, but heard it read on a local FM station by Dick Estell - the \\"RADIO READER\\". I could hardly wait for each day's half hour installment. As the heart-wrenching sorrow and confusion of abuse and abandonment of the author and his brother turned into rescue, trust and healing, this story kept me glued to the radio. Though out of print, it will be inspiring to anyone who loves to see the wonder of human helping human, and the spirit's ability to heal and overcome adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal, honest, heart-breaking. It made me angry.","review":"I read Hole in the World while writing the story of my own dismal childhood. It made me realize that mine wasn't as bad as I had thought, even though it was pretty bad. This is a shocking book, one that causes tears to fall thinking about this boy suffering at the hands of a stepmother while his father did nothing, abandoning his responsibilities as a father. It is shocking that school officials and neighbors didn't intervene. Hurray for Stanley's courage in going to the police. Most shocking of all is to know, from volunteer work I do now as a retiree, that this kind of abuse continues and, if anything, society is even less able now to stop it or cope with the effects on its victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hole in the world","review":"I first read this book many years ago after seeing Mr. Rhodes do a television interview.

Ever sincereleasing early material from his hometown of Brighton, Bonobo caught the ear of critics and fans alike, which prompted a collaboration with a certain MR Scruff, and a signing to label Ninja Tunes. Now a worldwide audience can discover the subtle riches and mood buildings of \\"Animal Magic\\", it jazzy breaks and dreamy soundscapes, all designed for the perfect, most beautiful, chill-out experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not *that* good","review":"I'm missing what everyone is raving about. Yes, lots of downtempo released these days (and yesterdays) is derivative, but that hardly makes this a masterpiece. Where I differ from the rest of the peanut gallery is that I've heard everything on this album done before and done better. Mukta does a better sitar (in part because they know how a sitar works instead of changing the synth voice to 'World - Sitar') and Piero Umiliani did these strings (change voice to 'Pads - Strings') before. Some of the synth work itself is not unlike the simpler work by Boards of Canada, but without the technical wizardry they use to turn their instruments from emulators into expressive tools.Hey, I still like this record, and I'd certainly buy it again. I just wanted to like it more than I do. I suspect that once Bonobo get a grasp on the capabilities of their tools and the concept of timbre becomes intuitive, they'll be excellent. For now I think they rate a Good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never shipped.","review":"This item showed to be in stock when I ordered it. It was never shipped.

It's my favorite of all their albums to date. \\"Summer Of Love\\" captures the early 80's spirit and I think really transcends most of their other work, including Cosmic Thing. \\"Ain't It A Shame\\" is a classic B-52's trailer trash ballad. I can still remember every word. And \\"Communicate\\" is classic B-52's techno. The B-52's had a wide range of sounds in the late 70's and especially the early 80's and this album displays that range in the best light, I think of any other album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first introduction to the B-52's","review":"And still my favorite despite all that I've taken in since then, which is EVERYTHING! This is a truly amazing album. \\"Summer of Love\\" and \\"Housework\\" are my favorites. They are kicky and fun. \\"Juicy Jungle\\" proves shaking your thing is good for the planet. The album wraps up with a less danceable but sweet and happy song (a la Cosmic Thing), \\"She Brakes for Rainbows\\". *Sigh* it's a must have for any B-52 fan, and I would recommend it as a first taste for anyone who has never experienced them, before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun","review":"This is another FUN creation from the group!

It has true New Wave music, and is fun to sing with, Dance to, and even fall asleep to, depending on what song you're listening to. The best song on the cd is probeley Ain't it a Shame. That song is a soothing, relaxing song, but it still sounds like b-52 material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slight step up","review":"B-52's albums released in the mid-80s don't exactly tickle my fancy at all, since they'd pretty much abandoned their original sound and hadn't yet come upon that overproduced late-decade Nile Rodgers dance sound which became so infectious (and so chartworthy). This isn't really an exception, though it shows the band moving away from the dull cheese-fest \\"Whammy!\\" into a collection of actual songs. I give the band credit for the gorgeous pop of \\"Summer Of Love\\" and \\"Ain't It A Shame,\\" and the bizarre synth excursions of \\"Detour Thru Your Mind\\" and \\"Girl From Ipanema Goes To Greenland,\\" but the rest of the album is basically a studio mess (\\"Housework\\"? Give me a break), not helped at all by the death of Ricky Wilson. Most of the bandmembers worked solo for this release, therefore drawing possible comparisons to the White Album, were the White Album about 50 million times less good than it actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic calypso","review":"This is now over 10 years old but is still one of the best compilations available.

I tried reinserting it and starting it up both before, during, and after mowing. I gave this plug an hour of my time, and then I gave up.

Bring on Morrissey!","review":"Smiths - Morrissey: let me give you the conclusion that took me 18 years to arrive at. Besides the song Meat is Murder, Morrissey doesn't have a bad song is his catalog. I used to think \\"Kill Uncle\\" (by Morrissey) was a lame album and that \\"Maladjusted\\" was worse. I traded in both cd's only to buy them back years later. It is a disservice to judge The Smiths and Morrissey album by album, this one is more sorrowful, this one has the right mix of angst, self-indulgence, wit, blah, blah, blah. Stick all the songs on MP3 format and press random: it is sonic Heaven and Hell. Morrissey IS the Mozart of our time, he will die as a blip on the musical scene with most people drawing a blank stare at the mention of \\"How Soon is Now.\\" Oh wait, didn't he write the theme song for \\"Charmed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Smiths.","review":"Their best LP, with Johnny Marr's acoustic and electric guitars in the forefront of the mix and perfectly balancing Morrissey's deliberately off-key, crooning vocal delivery. Even the vegetarian sing-a-long \\"Meat is Murder\\" (easily the weakest track) cannot take away the fact that this is an essential Alternative Music album (recorded in the mid-80's, when the term \\"Alternative\\" actually meant something). \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" is the soundtrack for every lonely isolated boy, with its recurring themes of celibacy, isolation, and self-pity. The blatant dancefloor mix of \\"Barbarism Begins at Home\\" proves that this band covered all musical bases with equal earnestness. A masterwork LP, and one of the decade's essentials."},{"rating":"2","title":"memories","review":"i hadn't heard theses songs in such a long time. my old cd was scratchted and i couldn't find it anywhere. thanks for the excellent quality and great condition cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beef: Savour the Flavour of Murder. (TM)","review":"This isn't the Smiths' best album, but it's pretty good. It's main weakness, I feel, is that Morrissey's decided he needs to address specific social issues, losing to a certain degree the amiguity and richness his lyrics possessed in the past. The best tracks--What She Said and That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore--are the ones that stay farthest away from that, although Nowhere Fast is undeniably good. Okay, so Rusholme Ruffians and The Headmaster Ritual Aren't Bad, and even Barbarism Begins At Home has something to be said for it. But I absolutely HAVE to dock the album as a whole a star, just for the title track, which may have been intended to make a powerful statement, but just comes across as being very, very silly. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic 2nd effort from Morrissey, Marr & Co.","review":"This was the Smiths' 2nd album, and a very good one at that. I would still recommend \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" or \\"The Smiths\\" (debut) before this, but it's still a worthy one to add to one's collection. \\"Meat Is Murder\\" shows Johnny Marr's maturity and mastery as one of the 80's best guitarists. \\"I Want The One I Can't Have\\" and \\"Headmaster Ritual\\" absolutely rock. Flat-out stunners. And \\"Well I Wonder\\" and \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\" show the Smiths at their more contemplative brooding mood. I think I'll go listen to it right about now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Easily the worst and most disappointing album in the Smiths' catalog. Here the group tries to tackle every cause under the sun, and come up with an album that sounds flat and uninspired. There isn't even one song on the album I can recommend.

Meanwhile, Meat is Murder, like a rotting carcass, should be given a wide berth."},{"rating":"2","title":"voodoolord7is off.","review":"Merely a response to the supposed insight offered by the above-mentioned persona.

With my old kettle the thumb of the hand holding the handle could push a lever and lift the pouring lid, while with this one the lever is too far away and you need to lift the pouring lid with your other hand.

Granted I didn't read the comic book, so perhaps it was more of a theme there. I thought they went way too overboard with the love story in this movie. I don't have a problem with love stories, but I didn't go to watch Spiderman for the romance. For the amount of action that did happen in the movie, it was great. Willem Dafoe is awesome. No doubt about that. I recommend people see him in the movie Shadow of the Vampire if they liked him in Spiderman. Toby McGuire did a good job too, even though the guy had to spit out the most nauseating romantic lines I've heard in quite a while. But Kirsten Dunst, talented actress that she is, just didn't seem the best suited to the role that she played.

This movie tells the story of how Peter Parker, a nerdy (and therefore smart) kid, turns into Spiderman, the (probably still) smart, cool hero. Tobey Maguire is great as Spiderman because he looks good. I don't know- is it Tobey Maguire in the Spiderman suit too? Or is it a stuntman. Well whoever it is in there looks nice as well. The conflicts within Peter/Spiderman are also conveyed, as well as the \\"gift or curse\\" aspect. The special effects are really great to watch, probably the best part of the movie. It's just a really fun movie, especially the \\"swing from building to building\\" and the \\"launching spider webs\\" parts. Go see it for great entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't like this movie","review":"Ok, some of the movie was good, but the story line was really bad.

Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with [other reviewer]","review":"This movie is awful. The only characters that have characters are the evil ones. Spiderman's girfriend's hair cannot be that red. The last lines were so lame I died laughing. Where was Peter Parker learning his new powers? Do movie makers know the word \\"forshadowing.\\" Simply not worth the time. The beginning had me falling asleep and the touching ending had me laughing out loud. The girl playing Peter Parker's love interest need dental work.Rent Dagon, not Spiderman."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW DID THIS BECOME SUCH A HIT????","review":"Usually, I'm open to movies, and I'm far fromt picky about what I'll go to see, or what I'll be dragged off to have to see. But this movie was very disappointing. I've never been a Spiderman fan, but I've never been a Batman and Superman fan either, and I like most of those movies. I guess the reason I don't like this one is that it takes the word 'corny' to a faraway demention. Oh yes, it has some touching moments, and some funny ones. The kissing scene between McGuire and Dunst has become pretty popular, and it will continue to be famous. Willem Dafoe is creepy enough, but then again he's always creepy.So, to conlcude, it was good, but it just wasn't THAT good."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE, EVER!!","review":"Honestly, don't listen to anyone that says a thing remotely negative towards this movie. It is the best movie ever!! And don't worry that you don't know anything about Spider-Man, you don't need to. It has great acting, awesome FX, wicked action and even a bit of romance, but not enough to ruin the film, *cough* Pearl Harbour *cough*I would recommend it to ANYONE. Any age, intersets, or religions, you won't be disappointed. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvel History in the Making!!","review":"All I can say is WOW!!! From the opening scene to the end credits, I was blown away by the visual effects and storyline. Although there were a few differences between this version and the comic version, the story of Peter Parker and Spiderman are pretty accurate. Maguire does an excellent job playing Peter Parker, as did Dunst, who played Mary Jane \\"MJ\\" Watson. Excellent cinematography and special effects!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spider-Man.. Rating not high enough. On a 1-5 scale 4*s","review":"Spider-Man... Would I see the movie agian, yes! Would I have picked other actors to play the two lead roles Mary-Jane Watson and Peter Parker, yes. Ok... maybe not for the part of Mary-Jane, but for the part of Peter Parker, yes. Maguire wasn't a bad choice he just made the character look sickly to me. Casting could have picked another Spider-Man/Peter Parker.I did enjoy the computer graphics animation. The movie is definately worth a look at on the big screen. Very action packed. Though I gave this movie 4 stars that does not do it justice. On a scale of 1-10. This movie is an 8 1/2.Recommend! However could be scary for young fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER!!!!!!","review":"OK PEOPLE: THIS MOVIE REALLY [stunk]!!!!THE GRAPHICS WERE GOOD BUT THERE WAS NO CONCLUSION!IT WAS PRETTY STUPID.I WOULD NEVER BUY IT OR SEE IT AGAIN.DON'T BUY IT.IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE IT, RENT IT AT THE LIBRARY FOR CHEAP!THE PREVIEWS MADE IT LOOK COOL, I SAW IT, AND IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!I am 15 years old...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"I didn't go in the movie theatre expecting a lot, and even those expectations did not stand for long. The special effects - the only strength that this movie could have - were corny and cliched. What tops them all is the shot of peter climbing on the \\"wall\\" - clearly he was climbing on the floor and thd shot was on its side. The characters? Again, cliche after cliche. Bad guys look evil, good guys look like saints. And don't even get me started on the green goblin - was that supposed to be funny? The dialogue was horrible too... Don't see this movie. Maybe if I were a spidey fan i would think twice, but since i'm not - here it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know why but i just cant connect with him","review":"I just dont get why everyone says its so good, its not.The sequel is okay, but this one just sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER-RATED TRASH","review":"This movie was mediocre at best.I was reading the other reviews & didn't know if I should laugh or cry.One guy was saying how Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast;I've seen more emotion out of a brick.The people that say the effects were so seemless should rush to the optometrist immediately. I mean come on,I thought I was watching a video game...from a few years ago.This movie is only slightly better than the FF movie from a few years ago.I can't believe the same company that did the effects for LOTR did these effects.Clearly they put all their energy into the far superior LOTR.Thank God Daredevil & X2 came out to wipe the bad taste of a poorly done superhero movie out of my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spidey comes out with a Bang!","review":"I was never a comic book fan as a kid, yet I still knew who Spiderman was (don't we all). So, I felt compelled to watch this film. To say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. I really enjoyed this movie. A fun action packed ride. Certainly one for all to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman!","review":"Spiderman is simply amazing. I saw it on the big screen the week it came out, and I'm glad I spent every penny. It will not disappoint you.I am a life-long fan of Spiderman, everything from the comics too the old cartoons. This movie puts all else to shame. It is full of action and suspense and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. Thrilling and stunning.The action in this movie is what makes it so great. Stylized. The movie also goes out setting perfect room for it's sequel, Spiderman 2. (Spiderman 3 comes out may 2007). While I do have to say that the sequel, Spiderman 2, is much better than the first, this one is still a five star movie that surpasses other superhero movies (i.e. - the Hulk, Daredevil, Catwoman).A full five out of five review. I own this movie and I'm glad I bought it. I would strongly advise you to do the same if you're a fan of this genre even in the slightest."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality film","review":"Spider-Man is a really good movie if you ask me. I went to see it twice and got the DVD the day it came out. It's a great film. Tobey Maguire plays a good Spiderman. He's pretty dorky as Peter Parker, but that makes him seem even more unlikely to be a super hero, which makes it so great. The first fight scene, when Peter is fighting with that guy, Flash, is really well done, especially when Maguire is dodging the punches in slow motion. Also, I think that the costums of Spiderman and the Green Goblin are really cool. The Green Goblin's mask is awesome. My only problem with the movie is that it takes a while for it to really get going. It's not until about half way through the movie that Spiderman begins to battle witht he Green Goblin. But once it gets going, it's a really good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing \\"Special\\" about this edition","review":"... this has got to be one of the worst \\"Special Editions\\" around. The movie is great but the EPKs ... big time.It has barely anything substantial. It's predominantly various interviews with the cast and Stan Lee and they talk exactly the same thing in each interview; with about half a dozen clips from the movie that repeat several times over. There is no actual behind-the-scenes nor any of the teasers that were immensely popular 8-12 months prior to the movie release.The concept art gallery was good but they could have included some more. Probably the only positive thing I found on the \\"Special Edition\\" was the Activision game demo. But for the people who already have the game...oh well.Definitely a huge disappointment for me. Wish the studio had spent a little from the millions they earned in the box-office to make make this DVD a true \\"special Edition\\" for the fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Dissapointing Extras!!!","review":"I love the movie, I think it is wonderful. However I was EXTREMELY dissapointed with the bonus features. With two discs you would think that they could have put the deleted scenes in there somewhere. My main purpose in buying it was for the now infamous cut scene with the twin towers. I would have returned it but my husband wouldn't let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiderman DVD Collector's gift set isn't that good!","review":"I love the movie! It is literally a comic book page that has come to life. But the Collector's edition is a farce. For the so called \\"collectible\\" items you receive it is way over priced. First you receive a cheesy reprint of the first Spiderman story. Big deal! You can get that at almost any comic shop. Second, a John Romita and Romita Jr. print. It's really cool! It's the first Spiderman cover redrawn by these two legends. The problem......it's not even autographed individually. John Romita Jr's. autograph is printed on it. Come on guys.... you could have the thing signed. Third, you receive a 35mm cell. Fine. It's not numbered. Gee.....how collectible. Fourth, It has an additional DVD with Stan Lee and Kevin Smith. Ok...fine. Bottom line is....I have a cool movie and a nice box to keep some comic books in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Movie To Break $100 Mil In Three Days","review":"The first movie in the Spider Man trilogy is a great and fun superhero movie. It might not level up to The Dark Knight, and its sequel, but overall, I like this film, and it's no surprise that many people like it.Rating: 4 stars/5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"What is left to say? Amazon's service is great - and the movie was delivered as though I just picked it up from the manufacturer.Spiderman was not a movie typical of my normal purchases, but I'm glad I bought it. It has a great story line and has something for everyone - even women like the movie. The movie industry has worked hard to make their movies more appealing to a wider audience, and they hit a home run with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPIDERMAN","review":"I was not thrilled when i saw that Maguire had been picked to play Peter Parker..i can't stand him, usually..all simpering, weird looking, and bug eyed, but he's not bad in this film..still he looks nothing like Parker from the comics..Parker is brown eyed and much better looking in the comics, but i digress, anyway, this movie worked for me..Kirsten Dunst was ok as mary jane again she looks nothing like the hot Mary Jane from the comics, but as Maguire does not look like Parker it works, now i did like Dafoe as Green Goblin, he was perfect, though i do wish his mask had moved with his facial expressions..they could have done alot more with that...but his fight with Spiderman at the end is spectacular, as for Falco as Harry..yawn...If your a fan of Spiderman, you'll like it..if not well, maybe not, i just saw the third one..and id rate the films..Spiderman 2, the best..then Spiderman 3, then this film..i gave it four stars but it's really more like three and a half at the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"WTC included?!?!","review":"I hope that the trailer and scene with the World Trade Center are included on the features of this DVD.I felt the movie was really good except for the obvious post 9-11 ending of the New Yorkers getting involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was stupid!","review":"I didn't like this movie it was so corny! It had bad acting, bad special effects, and not a very good script. The stunts looked so fake. Not to mention an awful score. When I saw the trailer to this movie it looked pretty cool but when I saw the movie I didn't really like it. Tobey Maguire is the worst actor I have ever seen and he wasn't a good Spider-Man. It should have been Freddie Prinze, Jr. He would have been a good Spider-Man then Tobey. If you see this movie you will be wondering why you saw it so don't see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the words of Comic Book guy, \\"Worst movie ever.\\"","review":"This movie was monumentally bad. I was blown away by how truly awful this film was. It didn't come close to any of the Batman or Superman movies, not even the duds like Batman and Robin or Superman III. Even for a superhero flick this was thin, foolish, convoluted, and just overall no fun at all. If you want a good comic book movie, go buy the original Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. And, at all costs, avoid this travesty of a summer \\"blockbuster\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this","review":"Granted the first say 15 minutes of this movie was ok, but the rest has led me to label this movie one of the biggest disapointments and over praised movies ever. As a casual fan of spiderman I thought the visual effects seemed childish to the mastery of the visual art as presented in Star wars attack of the clones. Further the love story was even worse. The best movie of 2002 was not Spider Man. That honor i would humbly give to Atack of the clones or the Oedopian Minority Report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprized","review":"To see how bad they let us down. i was expecting much more.

I expected a lot more from Spiderman it didnt' seem to hold true to the comics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old.","review":"Tobey Maguire makes an incredibly cheesy Spiderman. The special effects aren't that bad, but I've seen much better. There's nothing really new about this superhero flick, just the same old good-vs.-bad junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spider-Man, Legendary!","review":"Spider-Man is a movie that has become one of the most successful films of all time. It has made over $791 million world-wide an is a top DVD and VHS selling world-wide. The comic strip is the most popular in the world and now the films are hitting the big screen. It holds many records at the box office and made a huge $117 million in its opening weekend. There are now Spider-Man comic books, Films, Cartoon Films, Console games, merchandise and much more! This is now a franchise and nothing can stand in its way! The sequal Spider-Man II will hit the cinemas in 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME SEE BEFORE IT\\"S GONE","review":"This movie was awsome there was alot of action and that is what I like. So you better go see it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star Wars fan who is now a Spidey fan!","review":"I had never been into Spider-Man or any other comic book hero before and was a little skeptical when a friend suggested I see it. Star Wars was my big thing and I saw it first. Spider-Man almost seemed puny at first. At first. I have now seen it 3 times and it gets better every time! The special effects are so real and the story line is comfortable for all ages. Romance, action and Tobey Maguire! Who could ask for more? I now like Marvel Comics and other related items as well and it's ok for those who aren't into it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Spectacular ... GREAT MOVIE!!!","review":"This movie was one of the better superhero movie. Unlike Batman, there was some light behind the superhero. There is great acting (Tobey Maguire as Parker and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin). There wasn't a minute where you doubted either character. There were also some really good cameos - Ted Raimi as Hoffman, Bruce Campbell as The Ring Announcer, Lucy Lawless as some random interviewie, and Stan Lee (he's in a crowd of people when the Green Goblin attacks at the festival). It also stars Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, J.K. Simmons, Rosemary Harris, Gerry Becker, Bill Nunn, Jack Betts, Stanley Anderson, and Ron Perkins. An excellent movie - two thumbs up! WAY UP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting...","review":"I'm a big Spider-man fan, and I know one thing, that Spider-man: The movie could be anything, but true to the comics.<br />I have all the first magazines published and from the beggining, Spider-man always used a web shooter and not web coming out of his wrists. That was a great error that they made on this movie. The other big error is that Spidey never met Mary Jane before he fought the Green Goblin, actually, the first guy he fought was the Chameleon, took him about another 5 vilains to fight before he fought the green goblin the first time, and he never really killed him!!! A big hoax, that's what this movie is! <br />It is great to have a spidey movie, but they could at least not invent so many stuff, they could respect a little bit more Stan Lee's idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman is great.","review":"Ok, I'm a really big Superman fan first of all. But, I am also a really big \\"superhero\\" fan. I loooooved this movie. I wasn't sure how Tobey Maguire was going to fill the role, after all, I always saw him as a little kid. Well!! Little kid is all grown up in this flick, and all I can say is \\"Woohoo!! Those tights are FANTASTIC!\\" LOL I recommend this movie to anyone, it's great for the whole family. Don't miss it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie of 2002","review":"This movie with all of it's hype still met the unbelievable expectiations. What a smart and action packed movie. The movie goes into great detail about the how's and why's of spiderman without letting it slow the story down. The action scenes were seemless between computer animation and real footage. Add in a love story and a story about a boy just trying to fit in. Near Perfection. Plus with all of the bonus material available on this DVD how could one pass it up. This movie is also suitable for most children, there are very few curse words if any and some mild violence, which could make it too rough for very you children. This is a wonderful movie that I must recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job Marvel","review":"This was a good movie and it stayed with the comic book. Except for Mary Jane. His first gf was Gwen and she died on the bridge. I still enjoyed this movie. If you are a fan of Spider-Man then you will enjoy it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny Movie!","review":"Although I am a fan of Spiderman this movie did not do any justice to the Spiderman series. Lines were cheesy and they could have done a better job on picking out a better actor for Spiderman. Tobey Mcguire just was not a good Peter Parker/Spiderman. Don't waste your money on buying this movie, it's too corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A BUMMER","review":"The only reason this got any stars (at all) was for the direction, and I suppose a couple of the characters. The story was lackluster.I wasn't really pulled in to it and I'm a big Marvel fan. Kirsten Dunst was unconvincing,of which pails in comparison to her Virgin Suicides performance. Simmons performance as Jonah Jameson was enjoyable. I wont go into this to much further other than to say that if it weren't for Mr. Raimi this film would be a wash. Totally forgetable. DISSAPOINTING!! I hope whoever, does a better job with the Fantastic Four and The Hulk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great stuff (if you have a 30-second attention span)!","review":"This film is basically representative of modern action hero films: lots of flashy computer effects propping up a predictable and lame story. In other words, it's a perfect example of how Hollywood panders to the lowest common denominator (which keeps getting lower). Those who were raised on video games, live in their Mom's basement with their comics collections, and can't pay attention to stories and characters deeper than a puddle will love it. Thankfully, I didn't have to pay to see it.Those who want engrossing stories and heroes, sans computerized eye candy, should look elsewhere. Perhaps Spartacus, El Mariachi/Desperado, or Clint Eastwood westerns?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared Miss Muffet from the theater!","review":"One of the most irreverent films. The characters in this film are 2-dimensional. The storyline is not that strong. The storytelling is choppy and disjointed. Some of the effects don't look too impressive because you can see that it's been computer generated.Kids will enjoy it for its sophomoric action. Not a film that will enrich the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"tobey maguire can't act","review":"this is a rotton movie with terrible acting. it is like watching a badley dubbed film but instead of the actors mouths moving to the wrong words they don't move at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the hype...","review":"Spider-man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie.

So, we hired the DVD the other night expecting to be dazzled. The film is so 'formula Hollywood' it's not funny! And to top it off, full of digital effects. It's not the worst film to come out this year, but far from the best. The only reason it has done so well is because it's a childrens film. Kirsten Dunst is miscast in this film, by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Columbia's already committed to TWO sequels????","review":"Yes, I realize it's a comic book. Yes, I realize that this is aimed at the mentality of a 12-year-old boy (and hits a bulls-eye at that!) But come on! The writers went for the obvious every single time! And the scenes that were supposed to explore the romantic tension between the hero and his beloved made me laugh out loud every single time because it was so poorly written. And what was the Green Goblin trying to accomplish anyway? For a good comic-book movie, skip this dreck. Watch Tim Burton's Batman instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adaption of the Comic!","review":"I am a fan of the Spiderman comic books, and I was incredibly satisfied with the way \\"Spiderman\\" the movie turned out. Although in the book, Spiderman wasn't able to naturally produce a web, but I like the way the film changed that. Any an of the comic should go see this movie, they won't be dissapointed. I didn't think Tobey Maguire would be able to pull it off, but he did. This movie was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than Burton's Batman Flicks","review":"This is the best bigscreen adaptation of a major comic superhero that I've seen, much better than the chaotic messes of Burton's Batman films (though I thought Michael Keaton was excellent as Batman). Tobey Maguire's characterization of Peter Parker/Spiderman is perfect, though I do hope he doesn't get limited to the role, since he is probably the best Hollywood male actor of the twenty-something age group.Sometimes I think Raimi still goes for too much close-up violence in that sort of goofy but sadistic cult director way (as does Peter Jackson in Lord of the Rings), but overall this is a serious action hero movie that manages to have some fun. It sticks pretty close to the Spiderman many will know from the 60s comic book, but the story and conceits have been largely updated for this century.Here's hoping Ben Affleck as Daredevil (another Marvel favorite of mine) turns out as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spidey rules!!!","review":"This movie totally rocks!!

Tobey Maguire's body was so hot after being bitten by the spider. Just look at his abs, and muscles. As for his face, it is kind of dorky still, I guess he is sort of a nerdy hunk. It's just too bad that I heard that he just did it for the movie. Well I guess I will have to see this movie over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm caught In The Web!","review":"This is one of the best DVD gift sets that is on shelves today!Tobey Maguire is NOT the best actor out there, but he plays the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man better than anyone else could ever do. The 'Special Features' on the DVD are as good as they sound, if not better! The extra goodies that you get in the DVD box set is worth the extra money.Overall: Buy the box set if you are a fan of Spider-Man. It is totally worth the extra money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real fan's point of view","review":"This movie reeked for the same reason most other superhero flicks did;they killed the villan.Why the studios don't think we will come back if they don't have the Hollywood ending.Most comic heroes didn't kill their adversaries.The Green Goblin killed himself after many years of battling Spidey.Why not stay true to the comic?Superman did;Lex Luthor made it through three movies.Why introduce a character that is a formidable enemy,just to kill him off in under two hours?If you select the pop-up fact feature on the dvd,it details everything the director butchered from the original comic.On it's own i did find it entertaining and fun to watch.It still would have been better had the Goblin cleverly escaped Spidey and exclaimed \\"We'll meet again Spiderman!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"dont listen to the [reviewers] below","review":"Who are these [people] saying Spider-man was bad? I mean really now who are they, this was one of the most entertaining movies of the decade and these people are complaining about \\"not enough action\\" and \\"slow pace\\", did you want constant explosions? Did you want them to just ignore the fact that Spider-man has an origin, I mean really. And whats with the people saying the special effects are bad? Do they work for george lucas or something? Where the heck did they see better special effects. Spider-man is a great movie and a great starting off point for a whole slew of movies. And for those who say its too much like superman and batman: All super heroes have to get their powers somehow, of course the first movies will have a basic line to them, they all have to introduce the character and story, what the heck do they expect.

Toby Maguire provides a decent performance as Peter Parker in the begining, but when he turns spiderman he [stinks]. The acting was poor, the long drawn out proffesions of love by kirsten dunst and peter parker made me want to throw something at the screen. A slow begining just got progressivly worse. I couldn't believe it. When the green goblin, who looked like an idiot in that suit, said \\"the itsy bitsy spider\\" i wanted to walk out. If it hadn't been so close to the end of the movie i would have. Never have i been so dissapointed in a movie, ever. The only other movie i've seen in theaters that bad was Wing Commander with Freddie Prince JR. Props to Josh Krogan of Nickleback for writing an awesome song. Wait for it to go to the dollar movies. It was a waste of 2 and a half hours and 7 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total fluff","review":"I was very excited about this movie when I heard that Sam Raimi would direct it. I thought he did good work on the Darkman movie, but I think he lost some of his edge, because this movie was just plain bad. If it had been a debut of a new filmmaker this movie would be forgivable, but Mr. Raimi should be very, very ashamed.The story is basically non-existant, the bad guy is just plain stupid (why didn't they choose Doc Octopus as the bad guy), the acting is awful and even the CGI is sub-subpar.Let's just hope they won't make more of these or give it to someone with a little more depth.

And when you think about the plot, you realize that there is no substance, no soul to this \\"blockbuster\\". ... That is all Spider-man is- an attemp to gain truckloads of money by making 4 or 5 sequels.

The action scenes weren't too bad - though the special effects were too rubber-like. I didn't like the Green Goblin's cheesy villain cliche lines. The movie was VERY predictable. I don't see how some people say it blew away the original Batman movie. At least Batman had some style and nice atmosphere(and I'm not a Batman fan or anything). Spiderman was just... generic"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate to Say This, But ...","review":"I'm sorry, but I hated this film. So much so that I refuse to see the second one.Tobey Maguire looks about 12. He did not convince me that even with super powers he could battle evil. \\"I did all my own stunts.\\" Please! In just about all the action sequences, Spiderman was so cgi that he looked like a slimmed-down Shrek with red spandex on.The only positive feeling that this film left me with was knowing that I was right in all those school yard debates many years ago: \\"Who is the better super-hero, Spiderman or Batman?\\" I was on Batman's side, and this film made me feel all the more justified in my choice.I felt sorry for Kirsten Dunst. She's a good actress, and she got stuck with this.The best thing about it was it had a Nickelback song, and it's to Nickelback that my one lonely star for this film goes to.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder if Mr. Raimi ever read Spider-man...","review":"I can deal with:1. Mary Jane being a neighbor of the Parkers (what???)2. Green Goblin's Transformer face & costume3. Ohh yes, the terrible CGI...But Mary Jane falling off the bridge? next time read the comic, Mr. Raimi, or you could watch X-Men (I have to say that I'm not big fan of them) or Batman and learn how a good comic book based movie should be done. Take this from a 22+ year reader of Spider-man......to quote J. Jonah Jameson (BTW him was excellent) from the movie: \\"crap...crap...mega crap\\".

And let's not forget Peter's tired \\"sense of humor\\". What does he say? Stupid 5h!+ like \\"Hehe! Sure beats the subway!\\" and \\"nice outfit, did your husband buy it for you?\\" This movie is TERRIBLE! The CGI is horrid as well. Spider Man hasn't looked THIS cartoony since the 1960 series. Green Goblin looks like an overgrown action-figure. Willem's acting reaches low camp. Kirstin Dunst is neither stunning nor talented. She is not Mary Jane. Just as Tobey is not Peter Parker.

Because Peter Parker wasn't a muscle bound superhero, Marvel comics heros were and are primarely Science bound heroes. With alittle bit of action thrown in, and Spider-Man was no exception. He had to fight villains while on the other side of the city his Aunt is in the hospital because of a heart attack. Tobey Mcguire did an awsome job as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst was okay as Mary Jane. And to disagree with a previous reviewer, this story is straight out of the golden age of Spider-man comics, yes they did change some of the origins. But again, it actually didn't hurt the story.

I looked forward to seeing Tobey Maguire (one of Hollywood's greatest at the moment) portray the web-slinging / wall-climbing friendly neighborhood Spider-man. Although his performance as Peter Parker by day, Superhero at night is right up there with any he has done, I was disappointed in the movie as a whole! The story line, even though true to the comic book and animated series, was too predictable and put me to sleep. I wish there would've been more twists in the plot or maybe an attempt for movie producers to create their own.

The movie would present a much more serious and mature movie if Spiderman didn't swing towards the camera on everyshot. The movie plays like a videogame and does not achieve any realism on any levels. The only good part of the movie was Tobey Maguire's stuttering persona, which is perfect for the part, and Willem Defoe's cackling laughter.

The romance aspect of the movie was played out much to much and even the promise of exciting special effects did not follow through. The only good thing about this movie was the ever erasable Toby McGuire, who was perfect as Peter Parker. I am a big Kirsten Dunst fan, and I must say that her acting in this movie was nausiating.

The next day (had to go back, you know), same thing. I just saw it again on Christmas Eve, and again, pure bliss.It's smart. It's fun. It looks good. It sounds good. It IS good.

Sure it's not perfect but what is? It's really what a fun movie is all about and it doesn't feel like the 121 minutes it is. The first disc, actually has more of the fun extra-wise with the pop-up webisodes and MAKING OF vignettes along with two commentaries. One that's okay (the sam raimi one) but a really good one (visual FX Crew). The second disc is mostly promotional stuff except for the great documentary about the Spider-Man comic. My main complaint with the DVD is that the menus are a bit frustrating to navigate and that the second disc could've had alot more but this is still worth owning. Go for Widescreen though, Fullscreen crops off alot of the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this one!","review":"You can't go wrong if you are a Spidey fan. This DVD set has it all! The special features alone make it worth the price. The movie is an updated and condensed version of how he met the Green Goblin. I hope there is a sequel. William DeFoe plays the best villian yet. They have to bring him back for the next one. I don't believe John Malcovitch would have been as good as the Green Goblin. He was one of the first choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"Comic\\" Flick","review":"As a stand alone movie, the movie is a good action movie with elements of romance and class struggle tossed in, but not to the point the movie becomes \\"depressing\\" or utterly dramatic to the point you forget its an action movie. Like some of the reviewers before me, I realized when I bought my ticket what kind of movie I was in for, and actually it turned out better than the Batman, Superman and Spawn movies combined.For one thing its Spiderman, and so it goes and looks on screen as close to any comic book adaptation should get to looking like...well a comic. The action is similar to the old comic book and cartoons and the characters don't get utterly ridiculous like they did in all the batman sequels. If you like action movies or dig comics than this movie is a blast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the hype...","review":"Spider-man in no way lives up to the reviews and acclaim from fans of the movie. Yeah sure, there are visual effects that left some people (.... people) in awe, but they left me saying \\"how cheesy...\\" The special effects are no greater than any other new movie, and in fact, without these effects, there really is little plot left to this movie. And when you think about the plot, you realize that there is no substance, no soul to this \\"blockbuster\\". It is merely Hollywood's newest excuse to capitalize on a franchise. That is all Spider-man is- an attemp to gain truckloads of money by making 4 or 5 sequels. And I dread the day the Spider-man II comes out, because I know that it will only lead to Spider-man 3,4,5,and 6. Lets face it- sequels are never as good as the original, and in this case, the original..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"Clark runs to the rescue and opens his shirt to show his \\"S\\" uniform.

Lots of big ballon- figures fly in the air and thereafter the Joker attacks. The Joker laughs horrifically and has a split personality. Yep the same scenes are present in Sam Raimi's film, except that the character is Spider-man. Is it any wonder that I feel like I've seen this film before.

Plot is laughable and very childish, characters are unbelievable and what is most important, it lacks any kind of special graphic novel \\"environment\\". Instead it is just boring teenage action movie. However, as it had huge success among critics and in box office, producers probably decided that there is no need for any improvement and made even worse one - Daredevil. I bet Spiderman 2 will not be any better, so I suggest to forget about franchise and enjoy GOOD comic book adaptations like - BATMAN,X-MEN or BLADE."},{"rating":"2","title":"From A Long-time Spidey fan","review":"I'm really looking forward to this big-screen version of my favourite comic - I've been reading all the Spidey titles for 20 years. I think Tobey Mcguire is an excellent actor, although I'm not sure about the new-look Green Goblin...but I guess I'll get used to it. My only fear is the usual one people have when a cherished franchise recieves an adaptation into a new medium - will it capture the essence of the comics correctly? I don't know how Sam Raimi will cope with handling such a big project as this, so different to his other work, but I'm pretty confident he'll do the best job possible.

Just a poorly made movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comic Strip Film!","review":"Spider-Man is probably the best comic strip film ever made! It has the same feel as one of the old Super-Man episodes, but much more colorful, and better special effects.The DVD is packed with features. The biggest complaint I had with this edition is the theatrical ratio format of 1.85:1. Most widescreen editions are released in 2.35:1 ratio, which separates it completely from the full-screen format.Another complaint I have is the casting. Tobey Maguire is a very good actor indeed, but I felt that he was a bit too dorkie for this role. Kirsten Dunst is good, but not a strong enough actress to star in a huge block-buster like this.However, the action, special effects and fun will more than make up for the movie's pitfalls. Go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of 2002!","review":"\\"Spider-Man\\" is the best movie of 2002. Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker who lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) from the death of his parents. He gets bitten by a radioactive spider and when he has spider abilities, he becomes Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is amazing in her role as Mary Jane Watson, Peter's beautiful classmate. James Franco is great playing Harry Osborn, Peter's best friend. And Willem Dafoe is good playing Norman Osborn, Harry's dad. The picture and sound quality from the DVD are good. The extras are superb including the \\"HBO Making of Spider-Man\\" and the commentary.

I thought it was a bit Hollywood, but anyways a great film. The first film i saw by Sam Raimi was Army of Darkness, which was hilarious. I then went on to see Evil Dead 1 and 2, quick and the dead, and the Gift. When i saw this though i was very excited. this film has great acting from tobey mcguire, kirsten dunst, and william dafoe from one of my favorite movies Platoon. Although it doesn't follow the comics exactly and modernizes a lot of things, it still manages to keep things drawn out and easy to figure out. it revolves around the green goblin and spider-man fighting each other for right and wrong and such, but also talks about mary-jane and peter's relationship. although not true to the comics, the relationship is still interesting to watch. i do wish the dvd had better commentary by sam raimi and the crew, like the evil dead commentary he's done, too bad. the dvd has a lot of material, but most short and boring. movies still great though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected","review":"I was expecting 3 disks... only received 2.

Spider-Man is my second favorite comic book character of all time topped only by Tigra, the Were-Woman. Since she is female, that means Spider-Man is my favorite male comic book character. It was wonderful having the Green Goblin in this movie. He is my # 1 favorite Spidey villain. For good reason. His wondrous performance in this movie rocked my world like never before. The acting was perfect, and so was the special effects and the stunts. Oh, and Mary Jane was just as beautiful as she should have been. Go Spidey! Go Goblin! Go MJ!

You needn't be familiar with the comic book. Charactors develop naturally and can be sympathized with (or hated).Special effects are outstanding. Nothing more to be said.All in all and outstanding movie -- suitable for everyone in the family.

If someone likes to see foreign films and wants to get a DVD from another zone (i.e. Europe, Japan, etc.), well, too bad for you, because where multi-zone players are common in other countries, they are relatively hard to get in the U.S., and you can't play a foreign DVD on a regular American DVD player. So, say you teach a foreign language/culture. You are out of luck if you want to show your students real films from other countries, not just the ones distributors deem profitable for U.S. release.

It has a cool lovestory with Peter Parker and Maryjane. But the best part is all the cool special effects. Spiderman swings all over the city just like Tarzan. Or I guess Spiderman! It will be perfect to watch the movie on DVD because the special effects will look sharp and realistic just like at the movie.Its also full of funny jokes, like Spiderman's first outfit. He starts as a wrestler, and has to make a suit out of sweatshirts and stuff. Spiderman also makes fun of the bad guy, Green-Goblin. He calls him Gobby for short, which makes Gobby mad.There's some tragic parts too. Spiderman learns a lesson when he lets a crook escape.

This is a pretty typical tendency that you see with most comic book (Xmen, Hulk, Punisher) and fantasy (Lord of the Rings, D&D) movies.An entertaining movie with some great visuals, it nevertheless suffers in a few places from some absolutely AWFUL dialogue..

As we all know, 9-11 took place, and after that, people just needed something to get them happy, and spiderman just happend to be out at the time, so that helped its HUGE boxoffice turnout. I love how film didnt show off all of what spiderman can do, which will make spiderman 2 even more kick ass. I also love the fact the they didnt not really use universally known actors in the leading roles. I think it makes it more real then say.. Daredevil, in which a HUGE bignamed star was the hero, a huge named actress was the leading lady, and a BIG actor in Micheal Duncun for the villien. This movie was more realistic and more correct.

It should be no surprise then that the at-long-last big-screen story of Peter Parker and his alter ego would be a letdown. Some of the special effects are as bad as those seen in \\"The Hulk,\\" and that's saying something. What's worse, the filmmakers seem to have banked their film's success on those FX, with the plot of this 2-hour film otherwise as flimsy as, well, a spider's web, and with just as many holes. Meanwhile Tobey Maguire goes through practically every scene with the exact same goofy, clueless expression on his very uninspiring face. Kirsten Dunst does well as MJ, but Willem Dafoe, bless his heart, is laughably bad in the role of the Green Goblin. His costume is even worse.Spiderman 2? I believe I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie to see again and again","review":"It's just a fun movie. Special effects were great, and some of the liscense they took was actually an improvement. Maguire played an good Parker, with that geeky kind of outlook on everything. For a first movie that has to introduce everything and everybody, they did a wonderful job (much better than I expected). Defoe overplayed his role a bit, but that is kind of his calling card anyways. The web slinging was excellently done (computers are wonderful things).Yeah, if you are looking for a movie that is 100% comic book faithful, you might be a bit irritated at some of the changes. But if you are looking for that, you need to stay away from Hollywood all together.If you are looking for a fun night with the family, or just want a good fun action flick, this is a definite good choice.

At first I thought the spool and cutting blade at the top would be useless. I was just going to store a spool of twine in a drawer and use scissors.I now feel the spool and cutter is well worth it. The entire set can sit in a corner of the kitchen, on a shelf, and with the ease of cutting it as you pull the thread it is far more convenient.We actually use the twine for all sorts of none cooking functions, such as small pieces to tie plants to stakes, tying together loose items like straws, and of course for tying roasts, poultry, and other items we are going to cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally dissatisfied","review":"The sheets were way too small and very thin.

I would love to know how they could ever get the list price of $112.00 for these sheets!

I purchased this sheet set believing it was a quality item, as it \\"retails\\" for $112. I have purchased jersey sheet sets previously, and have been very pleased with the quality and fit. However, this set is completely useless. The fabric itself is quite sheer; I literally could see my hand through the fabric. After washing, I attempted to put the sheets on the bed. The corner seams of the fitted sheet did not accommodate a deep mattress (unusual for bedsheets these days), and the top sheet was neither square, nor of sufficient size to allow overhang. It barely covered the top of the mattress. I was unable to tuck in the sheet at the bottom of the bed. I am VERY disappointed in what was advertised as high quality. I, too, will be trying to return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft, nice, but not really worth the price","review":"I bought these sheets because they were on sale at Amazon. They are soft, a pretty yellow, and nice to sleep in. However, the sizing is way off. I bought the queen size sheets, and it was very short and would not fit well over queen size mattress. I am currently using it on my twin size mattress (it actually fits pretty well, a little baggy) because I didn't want to go through the hassle of a return. These were inexpensive, but here I don't think I even got what I paid for - a queen size sheet set. If you are sheet hunting, I would not recommend that you purchase these. On a side note, for the sale price at Amazon (I think around $20) you can get better quality jersey that fits well at Target. And if you didn't like it, returns would be easier than at Amazon.

Same hassles on both: handle will burn you; use a mitt or potholder. Which is a nuisance. They are easy to overfill, leading to boil overs, which can kill the flame, but leave the gas going if you aren't there to watch it. Again-- annoying, plus a safety risk. As others have noted- the lid can be difficult to remove. Finally, it leaks at the joint where the metal tip on spout screws onto the tea kettle.

Two months later the lid became unglued. It took forever to get a replacement part as I was shuffled from person to person. Chantal would not replace it I had to go through the store. Fine. It was replaced. I was once again happy with my cute little kettle. A year later the enamel coating inside the teakettle has all but completely flaked off. I take excellend care of the kettle. Really it was a splurge for me and what a dissapointment it turned out to be.I'm now afraid of I've injested a toxic lining.

So dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not be happier","review":"I bought this kettle as a gift to myself for the holidays. This has been an excellent kettle so far. I only boil water for tea in it, about twice a day, and so far no problems. It boils water quickly. The whistle (which sounds like a harmonica..very cool) works every time, and is loud enough to hear anywhere in my house. The whistle flips up easily, and stays up. It feels solid and well constructed. No chipping of the enamel at all (knock on wood).To address a few issues as to why some reviewers may have complained.#1 Do not overfill it. The whistle will work.#2 It has a metal handle, duh, it will be hot, so use a mitt. Just like when you handle your pots on the stove.#3 It is a teakettle, not a pot, so boil water in it, not soup, not hot chocholate. It is normally quite easy to clean.Lastly, this is one sharp looking tea kettle. A lady at the store told me that Chantal actually makes a handle cover for like $3.00 if you call the 1-800 number on the tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't whistle while it works","review":"It's beautiful, it boils water perfectly, but after one week of daily use, the whistle didn't work and the kettle was destroyed before the burning odor reached me. I returned it for a refund where I bought it (at chantalstore.com to avoid sales tax), should have read these reviews first. Chantal offers this caveat with their care instructions: \\"Do not rely on the whistle to remind you about an unattended teakettle - on occasion, the whistle may not sound.\\" This is as absurd as asking a customer who's just bought an expensive phone not to rely on it to ring upon receiving an incoming call. When I emailed Chantal, they told me they've been selling these for 35 years. So they've had plenty of time to fix the whistle, guess they just don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Design Ever","review":"This is the worst designed tea kettle I have ever owned! Note that the handle is metal - that means it gets HOT! So when you are ready to pour, make sure you have a big oven glove on. Note that the lid is under the handle (and also metal so also HOT!). It is a challenge to open the lid at all given its location under the handle, even more of a challenge when both pieces are very hot. Also, to pour, you need to open the metal spout cover (also HOT!). So I give it a star for attractiveness, and yes it is so sturdy, I have yet to replace it, but I would not recommend this particular model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much dough for too little whistle","review":"First the handle came loose, then the whistle wouldn't work, then the enamel chipped off the rim. What a pain, what a useless, overpriced piece of hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"tea kettle","review":"This kettle is very nice looking. But, the handle gets BURNING HOT! and it takes a very long time to heat the water because of the small bottom surface. Not very practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and quiet; not what it used to be","review":"I'm very unhappy with this product compared to the (allegedly) same product I bought literally decades ago. I recycled the old one (and on second thought wish I hadn't) because I felt I'd left it one too many times on the burner without any water in it; also, it looked very scuzzy inside. I knew as soon as I lifted the new one out of the box that it was much more cheaply made. It feels lighter and just doesn't look or feel as solid or well constructed. All of that wouldn't matter much if it worked OK, but it doesn't. I can barely (and sometimes not at all) hear the whistle from the next room; my hearing is fine but I really liked the loudness and beautiful two-tone, train-like whistle on my old teakettle. I called the company and they very graciously sent me a new whistle, but that hasn't solved the problem and I'm probably going to just give up. I think that, once again, \\"They just don't make them like they use to!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Although I loved the kettle's appearance and used it a lot, I had to discard it beacuse the inside eventually rusted. I opted to replace it with stainless steel---much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed a year later","review":"Unfortunately, I hoped against hope that maybe some of these reviewers were mis-treating their teakettles and mine would be fine. I got this for my wife for Christmas, and it only took a year for the whistle to literally rust apart and break. The kettle still works fine, but the pleasing whistle is gone. I expect a lot more from a product at this price point. My Oxo kettle this replaced gave years of good service and I only retired it because I wanted something that looked nicer than the Oxo. Big mistake. There is also visible corrosion on the hinge for the tea kettle. We baby this thing, so there really is no excuse for it wearing so horribly. A tea kettle should be able to withstand water and heat over repeated exposures. That's its job. Unfortunately, this one isn't up to the task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this kettle!","review":"I bought this kettle seven years ago and love it still! Cleans up easily, heats water quickly, and I love the harmonic whistle. The water has to be at a full boil and the lid closed properly before both notes sound. No problems with my kettle at all, and I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chantal Classic is only Teakettle I will use!","review":"I have used a Chantal Classic teakettle for years and accidentally left it on the gas burner, water boiled away and totally ruined it, cracking the enamel and destroying the white enamel. I replaced it with another brand teakettle that came with good reviews which I used for about two months. After burning hand on handle that was not supposed to retain heat, splashing boiling water everytime I poured out of it, and having to hold the spout open the whole time while pouring water, I gave it away. Plus, if I was in the other room, I could not hear the whistle. Ordered new Chantal Classic Teakettle in red and I love, love, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whistle","review":"I have had this teakettle for 10 years and like it very much. It still looks like new. I just purchased one as a gift for a person who is hard of hearing and she is very pleased with it.

It is sturdy and easy to care for."},{"rating":"2","title":"25 years and still an essential in my kitchen!","review":"I've had my Chantal tea kettle for 25 years and it still looks new! I selected it back then because of product reviews that said this was \\"the\\" tea kettle to have! It has not disappointed me over the years! It is attractive, easy to clean, boils water quickly, and the harmonica whistle is ultra cool! Every now and again, I'll add a little vinegar to the water to give the kettle a good cleaning on the inside. There is no corrosion or any other discoloration on the inside. The outside of the kettle still looks great too. And the seals/gaskets are still good but if they were in need of replacement AFTER 25 YEARS, Chantal sells the parts. If you are trying to be \\"green\\" in your product selections, choose this kettle--it will last a lifetime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product it used to be...","review":"I had a Chantal Teakettle for over 20 years. Bought it when they 1st came out with the Hohner whistle...Gave the original one to my daughter & it is still working perfectly.Bought this one for a color change. It is rarely used. More of a decoration on the stove & a way to cover hot burners.Less than a year from purchase & being used less than 10 times...the whistle part flew off.Contacted Chantal. They will replace it...for $15...because things happen & things wear out. After 6 uses???I don't know if it's because they are made in Thailand & China now...but this is NOT the same teakettle I used & loved.Definitely not worth the money now."},{"rating":"1","title":"whistle didn't work on first day!","review":"I received the tea kettle today. It made a quiet tone (not loud enough to hear in another room) the first time I used it. The second time I used it, it boiled for a long time with no sound whatsoever. I am returning it. No one seems to have mentioned that it's impossible to hold it by the handle and open the spout with the same hand. I do have small hands, but not any smaller than lots of women and it's not even close. I doubt even someone with large hands could do it. Shouldn't you be able to use a tea kettle with one hand?It does look very nice, but isn't worth $20 in my opinion, and definitely not worth the $100 I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaay overpriced! Low quality","review":"This kettle is beautiful, but ours rusted out, and fell apart after only a couple of years. Not only that the service from Chantal was awful. We are very disappointed and would never buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Time Former Chantal Fan","review":"I was a huge Chantal fan 20 years ago, and I have owned two Chantal tea kettles. Like a previous reviewer, I owned my first a long time; I purchased it 17 years ago. When my daughter went off to college three years ago, I gave it to her as I wanted a new color; she is still using the old one and loving it. The new one doesn't hold a candle to the old one; the whistle doesn't work properly, and after two years the handle on the lid came off. I tried to have a friend who is an expert welder weld it back on - no good. I contacted Chantal and they were useless - asked me to purchase a new lid which I would not do as I had already had issues with a pan handle coming off and they couldn't repair or replace it. It is obvious that the workmanship of this very expensive kettle is not what it used to be. Buy something else if this will be anything but a stove top decoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funky","review":"just the songs just another sucker, games(original version) and games are enough for me....the intro to just another sucker caught my interest cause it sounded like something that would have been straight from Sonic the Hedgehog 2...its just proof that he was ahead of his time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of info here","review":"This book almost has too much info , at least for the novice horseman or woman.

It explains everything (and in plain language) from hoof balance and hoof \\"reading\\" to why to go barefoot in the first place. It also touches on other reasons that may contribute to hoof lameness. It has been an eye opener.

The book leaves me wanting to know and see more and more on the topic. I am \\"sold\\" on the technique. I found the book excellent and hope to gain more insight with future clinics, or perhaps, a professional in my area to check my work. If a person is not interested in trying the technique, this book will certainly make a person \\"think\\" about currently accepted practices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Horses!","review":"I have purchased this book twice now.

(sorry)I think every horse owner should have a copy of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated content","review":"Be wary about purchasing this book as Pete Ramey has stated many times, both on his DVDs and in many of his articles, that he has changed his views on a lot of the information included in the book, much of it quite fundmental. Full marks to him for admitting that he was wrong in the first place but the book is way overdue for re-writing. It has been demonstrated many times that the wrong approach to hoof trimming can lead to far more problems than it cures and using for reference a book that contains misleading information is a recipe for disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to barefoot trimming","review":"A basic, through introduction to trimming a horse's hoof for barefoot living.Be aware that the author feels he has learned a lot since writing this book and thinks you would benefit from buying his DVDs. Contrary to the review here he does not repudiate this book, but just feels it is very basic and he makes DVDs now instead of updating this book. We knew this before ordering and are still 100% happy with this book because we prefer written material.Also, on page 13 of this book it says:\\"Reading the Horse Owners Guide to Natural Hoof Care is prerequisite to learning anything from this book.\\"That book is by Jaime Jackson, so you might want to order them both together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Understand","review":"Well written in easy to understand writing style.

I just don't see what I'm supposed to be seeing, you know?This book actually gave me a couple of \\"clicks\\" of understanding. I wished that I'd gathered more from it than I did, but I'm happy for what I got. Not exactly a page turner, especially when you only partly understand what you're reading, but it may mean more to me as I learn more.

It seems that a good half the time it does not spin well -- it flops around like dice. ... ...... I collect Put & Takes, and like having this in my collection. The booklet is a nice touch.

Now I don't listen to it at all. \\"Stages\\" and \\"Delirious\\" are still good, but on the rest of the songs the pounding electronic rythms and synthesizers drown everything else out. Their earlier albums hold up better because they don't use as much studio B.S. to flesh their songs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eliminator Lite","review":"The boys from Texas followed up their smash album \\"Eliminator\\" with a similar sounding album that features far fewer good songs. The burner \\"Sleeping Bag\\" opens things well enough, but it is not until you get to track four and the ballad \\"Rough Boy\\" that you get another first rate song.

After giving a brief background on the theological basis for the ritual, Cruz immerses the reader in stories about the various types of relics populating Catholic churches around the world. The result of this study is both interesting and educational.While the book is a valuable resource, it does suffer from being a bit dated. It was printed in 1984 and hasn't been revised since then. An updated version would allow the reader to learn recent developments in the verification of these relics, like the tests performed on the Shroud of Turin in the 1990s. By providing updated information, Cruz would give the reader a better basis to understand all aspects of this ritual.Even with this shortcoming, Relics is a good starting point for anyone wishing to learn more about Catholic relics and the devotion they inspire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"My husband and I both agree that this book has some fascinating facts; however, it is poorly written, making it difficult to follow.

This is an amusing linguistic travel adventure written in diary format. Because the author phonetically spells the Spanish words Melanie learns, I found myself saying some of the words aloud and learning quite a few things along the way. An appendix of all the foreign words Ms. Weston used would have been an added benefit to the book.

What I mean by that is, the best song on the album is Undercover which is a song from the Spider-Man soundtrack years ago, that was included on this album for some reason. Thank goodness it was because without it, the album would not even be worth having. I don't know what happened but this album just isn't that good compared to his first 2 albums. His other releases had some standout songs on it, this one doesn't at all. Hopefully his next release will be much better. Say maybe more like his debut album, which is still his best album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Circle","review":"Pete Yorn's latest, Nightcrawler, effectively finishes off what he started in 2001, completing a trilogy of discs that capture a day in the life (2001's \\"Musicforthemorningafter\\" and 2003's \\"Day I Forgot.\\") Fans of Yorn have been waiting years for this release and it's certainly worth the wait. \\"Nightcrawler\\" again serves up a wide collection of pop-fueled rock songs, coupled with those ballads that only Pete seems to make work. A few standouts include \\"Undercover,\\" \\"The Man\\" and \\"Bandstand in the Sky,\\" which was featured on his \\"Live From New Jersey\\" CD a few years back, which was a tribute to the late Jeff Buckley. There are a few songs here that don't entirely work, but Yorn makes up for it on those that do. An excellent addition to the Pete Yorn catalogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY is this trilogy out of print?","review":"It baffles me that my favourite series is out of print! This trilogy is refreshingly told from the perspective of Guinevere, starting with \\"Child of the Northern Spring,\\" continuing in \\"Queen of the Summer Stars,\\" and finally culminating in \\"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn.\\" This book is fabulous, but to fully appreciate it, you must begin at the beginning.

One of those was The Mists of Avalon, which told the story of Arthur from the Goddess' point of view. Another was Mary Stewart's cycle of books on Merlin. But, Persia Woolley brings a fresh perspective to the Arthurian books, from the point of view of his Queen. I highly recommend this series of novels of Guinevere, for their sensitive treatment of this most wondrous of Queens. Before she was a queen, she was a woman. Many of us too easily forget that fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"great ending to a good series.","review":"I really enjoyed this book, as the final installment to the series.IN this valume, we see Camelot falling apart as the Grail Quest consumes the companions. Lancelot and Guinevere finally consummate their relationship.The relationship between Arthur ans Mordred, his son by Morgause, comes to a head, and the story ends as it usually does. But, this story makes it all fresh. Its morew realistic them MZBs story, without all the magic interfering. Don't get me wrong, MZBs book was, and still is,one of my favorites. But its nice to see a book(or trilogy) where for once, religion isnt such a large part. Its the people more at center stage. This book is more historical fiction then fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Salif Ever Recorded - the most African","review":"This Album is not very well known amongst Salif Keita followers in the US because it was released too far ahead of his rise to fame on the US world music scene.

Basil Mahon, who obviously loves Maxwell, has done a wonderful job of summarizing his life. Biographers of such prodigies have to avoid deluging their readers with too many details on the one hand, but on the other hand they have to avoid being so brief that their subject ultimately remains elusive to their readers.Mahon has done a masterfully dealt with this dilemna. By going through the more important stations in Maxwell's life, but always providing more detailed sources in the appendix, often with insightful critiques of these articles, he has opened a doorway to understanding the Maxwell's life and works. If you are looking for a good biography of Maxwell, or simply just a good book to stimulate your interest in science, for you or your children, I highly recommend this book.\\"He achieved greatness unequalled.\\" -- Max Planck"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good biography of a great scientist","review":"James Clerk Maxwell is one of the greatest scientists not only because of his many great contributions but also because he inspired so many others who went on to become outstandingscientists. The impact of his work is so far-reaching that itis difficult to find the right words to describe it. Thus, itis rather curious that no major biographies of Maxwell have been published.This biography by Basil Mahon attempts to address this void.This is a good book that is enjoyable to read. James' strengths, both scientific and personal, are presented inan engaging style. But, one cannot but feel that, given the greatness of the subject, the biography is not as vast in scope as one might expect. This is a simple biography of a great man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for those interested in how one of the world's most creative scientists went about his life of discorvery.","review":"In the history of science there are only a few true human beings who used their genius in a humble and open fashion to uncover some of natures best kept secrets, while remaining true to their principles, friends and family. James Clerk Maxwell was one of these largely unsung heros.[ As was Paul Dirac who started his studies in Electrical Engineering some decades later]I recommend this book to all those engineering and science students interested in how a fundamental pillar of modern science and engineering, electromagnetics, actually came into being.One hopes that some of todays students will be able to follow in the footsteps of such a true scientist and well rounded human being as James Clerk Maxwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"The history of an outstanding simple man...James Maxwell","review":"When I started reading this book, I have seen something similar to the history of one of the greatest mathematicians, Euler.Euler and Maxwell were probably similar in several ways, they were true genius but still kept in contact with normal people and enjoyed life. Their fame is not proportional to their contributions, Maxwell and Euler are in the same category as men like Einstein, Newton, Da Vinci.Basil Mahon has done a great job of telling Maxwell life and presenting his contributions to science in a way that a lay person can understand. The great thing is that he presents the methods or models used by Maxwell to reach his conclusions. It makes easier for us to understand the thought process of a genius.Clearly Basil Mahon admired his subject, and by extension the reader will get involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book","review":"I've always been interested in the lives of people who has contribute in any way to science. When you read this book you learn the life of Maxwell, you learn how Maxwell solved difficult problems and also Maxwell teach you lessons of life.It is curious to me how people can see things that others not, and it is interesting that most of the greatest \\"brains\\" of all times come from this island, Great Britain.Lots of people say that they know about the Electromagnetic theory but few really understand what's behind. I just want to learn more about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Great Reward ~ Depeche Mode","review":"To call Some Great Reward synth pop is unfair since that means that it is ligt sounding and has lyrics that basically talk about nothing. Some Great Reward is an amazing mid 80's release and has tracks People are People, Master and Servant that all shot up to the top of charts all over the world. This album also has strong non single tracks like lie to me and something to do. They are much more experimental then their critics ever give them credit for and the sounds used on Some Great Reward and Construction Times Again are not even remotely the same. The lyrics are not as trite as many critics have accused the for being and I consider it to be one of the best albums released that year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are People People","review":"Some Great Reward takes the first big step towards more mature sound and lyrics. Blasphemous Rumours is one of the greatest songs crafted by DM. The breathing at the end gives an eerie feeling that would be felt during Black Celebration. Master and Servant and People are People, along with Blasphemous Rumours, are the highlights of SGR. The only flaw in SGR is that some of the tracks feel as if they were not completed. Other than that, SGR contains some of DM's finest work and my all time favorite DM song, People are People."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Depeche Mode's best!!!!","review":"This is one of the finest CD's I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Each song has great feeling and instrumentation. And this CD contains three of the greatest DM songs ever written Blasphemous Rumors, People Are People, and in my opinion one of the greatest songs I have ever heard, Somebody. This is a great CD and a must for any good CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"True '80s alternative","review":"While this album immediately transports me back to my college days, it still has a lot of merit to it, and is well worth a listen. \\"Somebody\\" is every love-sick kid's favorite song, and the album feels a bit dated, but \\"Blasphemous Rumors\\"--which blasts organized religion--is still amazing and \\"Master and Servant\\"--sex, sex!--rocks. The '80s synthesizer sound is here as well as a kind of gritty industrial atmosphere. In my opinion, this is Depeche Mode's best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disjointed but all the songs are great anyway","review":"It's a good album. I'll give it that. Every song has something in itself that makes them good songs. They all seem paradoxical to be place side-by-side, though. Maybe that's how Depeche Mode is. They've always been some what enigmatic.Themes on this CD range from romance to bondage to parodying sappy love songs to social justice. Every song on this CD is good. I just question the fact that all these songs are so different from each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great album by the best band in the world!","review":"i bought 2 days ago this album and i've suddently fell in love with it! songs are really fantastik, full of passion and lyrics are ok too. the best songs of the album are \\"something to do\\" \\"lie to me\\" \\"people are people\\" \\"stories of old\\" \\"master and servant\\" and the absolutly wonderful \\"blasphemous rumours\\"! a must for all the dm fans! believe me, this is ok!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some early recordings of a fantastic group.","review":"This is the first Depeche Mode album I listened to and that was 20 years ago and I still love it.

As with all DM albums, there are some songs that can be found on other albums. I bought a used copy to include in my \\"digital format\\" collection to replace my analog cassette. I originally bought the album back in the mid '80s; and this album still has the magic feeling all these years later.I noticed that there is a remastered version available and in hindsight I would have opted for that since I am a bit of an audiophile. However, if you do not have a HiFi system the original CD is good quality for a normal system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Great disc from the 80's. Not a ton of filler on here. Album is best when listened to in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the CD...IF YOU WANT!","review":"By the time I picked up this album, I'd already heard the songs Somebody, Master and Servant, Blasphemous Rumours, and People are People on other releases so there wasn't much new material here. It's clear to me that those are the best songs from the album with People are People and Somebody being my favorites. However, there's something about the two Alan Wilder penned tunes I've heard (If You Want and Work Hard) that I really like. Are there any other DM songs he's written? Those songs have made me interested in seeing what his \\"Recoil\\" project is like (although I'm sure it will be quite different).Anyway, if you're looking for \\"Something to Do\\", I suggest you buy this album. It's especially worth the price if you haven't already gotten \\"Catching Up With Depeche Mode\\" or \\"Singles: 81-85\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, like Construction Time Again","review":"I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger \\"early Mode\\" post Speak and Spell choice.

He moves from anthem to ballad without missing a beat, better than anyone since Bob Dylan.

A must for anyone who wants to know what the Replacements were about."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite mats album by any means","review":"I've never understood why so many people place this at the top of the Replacements canon. The songs are fantastic, but the album sounds like the producer (Tommy Ramone by the way) put a layer of plastic over the recording. The lead guitar is never allowed to roar, and the sloppiness that made the Replacements so fantastic is reigned in. That being said, \\"here comes a regular\\" is one of the greatest songs ever written, and the rest of the album isn't bad, but it could have been much better since the songs are there. The next album is way over produced, but the sound is way more open, making it a far better album, even though they kicked Bob Stinson out after Tim. Personally, I like all the early albums a lot better. The early \\"hardcore\\" stuff isn't really that much different from the later stuff, its just less polished. I really can't get past the horrible production.

If you want to know where big-name bands like WILCO cut their teeth, check out any of the Replacements albums, and you will hear what I mean.Other especially noteworthy Replacements albums are PLEASED TO MEET ME and LET IT BE, both of superb crafting.Westerberg is an expert at exploiting auditory habit -- and diverging from it tunefully. Just when you think you know where a lyric is headed, it bends around and grabs you by the short-hairs. Just when a measure seems predictable, a fresh chord strikes your unsuspectiting ear.Westerberg is a poet and a genius. If you are tired of Westerberg, you are tired of music.This one must be heard.

I've always considered Tim to be Pt. II of a series of an incredible triple (you guys know the other two albums...). Other than the obvious comments I can go on about the extremely high quality of the songs, I have to give Tim a 4 star rating because Tommy Ramone's (yes, THAT Tommy) production was so one-dimensional; he actually mixed this album using HEADPHONES because he was almost deaf from playing drums with the Ramones. But it's par for the course; leave it to the Replacements to hire a near-deaf producer. Seriously, along with Elvis Costello's first three, The Beatles catalog, Big Star's albums, and the Rolling Stones' Mick Taylor period, the ' Mat's three middle releases are some of rock's most listenable and important albums in rock's recent history..."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellence plus","review":"I'll agree with others that rate this album up there with \\"Let It Be\\" as one of the Replacements finest. Song after song, Paul Westerberg shows what an amazing songwriter he is. Pick your favorites from amongst these goodies, but really there isn't a dud to be found. The big decision for most fans, especially those that already own a copy of \\"Tim\\" on CD or vinyl is, do the bonus tracks make this worth buying again or not? As with most reissues, the bonus tracks here are a mixed bag: a couple of unnecessary alternate takes along with one very good unreleased track (\\"Nowhere is My Home\\"), and some very interesting versions of the superb \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\" --- a roughly recorded but mesmerizing acoustic version (maybe not the stone-cold classic that Peter Jesperson rates about in the liner notes, but still pretty wonderful), and another electric take.

The production is a squeaky clean, but not to a fault. Dig \\"Little Mascara\\", \\"Bastards Of Young\\", \\"Kiss Me On The Bus\\", and \\"Hold My Life\\" for kick-a$$ lyricism as well as chops.

Part memoir, part travelogue, with a little history thrown in, Tirana writes of fly fishing without the self deprecating humor of John Geirach or beautiful prose of Bill Barich. He somehow manages to make moments which lend themselves perfectly to writing-like courting his wife and being held at gunpoint-and make them drab and boring. It is a quick read, a little snobbish, as one reviewer has stated and certainly not the worst book ever, but really just another fly fisherman who feels compelled to tell the world the joy we receive from our sport, and fails to convey its beautiful aura."},{"rating":"1","title":"a snobbish view of flyfishing","review":"Once again a rich somewhat snobbish writer thinks he has \\"captured\\" the essence of the sport.

What's the girl worth? I'm thinking a lot. While a pretty girl in a strange land always makes for story, a dark western eye's subtle slice through Europe is entriguing. Ms. Fitzpatrick offers the sol y sombra of Madrid, battling her amorous and paternal demons with the distilled emotion and stabbing sincerity of a matador. While her problems are salt of the earth, her texture is sublime. Although she may fall at times, you'll want to lift her up. I can't wait to lift her up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother...","review":"Initially, I started reading this book because it is about someone who went to BU (where I am currently an undergrad). However, after forcing my way through it, I want my $13 back. The author's writing is full of unfounded self-importance, and, to be honest, I could not stand the main character. I could relate to her problems, but not to her tendency to do nothing but whine about them. Overall, I found I spent the entire book just waiting for it to be over. For Catherine to DO something... even the promised \\"exciting nightlife\\" scenes are boring and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in 3 Months","review":"I replaced my thermostat in two vehicles after an overheating incident in our Chevy Van. I didn't want the same failed thermostat causing a new over heating problem, so I replaced the thermostat in our van and in our Jeep Cherokee with these \\"Failsafe\\" thermostats. Within three months, neither vehicle would get to operating temperature. In fact, both failed during the Fall months when the temperature typically never gets to 80 degrees F. Neither vehicle would generate enough heat to operate the heater properly when the temperatures dipped below 30 degrees F.I replaced both thermostats with OEM. Both of the \\"failsafe\\" thermostats were stuck open as a result of the added \\"failsafe\\" clip. As far as I can tell, these thermostats will always fail once the vehicle gets to operating temperature. Both vehicles now operate properly with the OEM thermostat.

I love how these can be peeled and sliced. The downside is that there are that many more pieces to contain because it's more fun to take them apart than it is to put them together. I would also like to express a caution about the orange peel. When it is separated from the inside of the orange, the pieces have very sharp points. My daughter stepped on one when she didn't see it and really hurt the bottom of her foot. It might not be a bad idea to remove these pieces from the set completely. None of the other fruits seem to have a hazard like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expecting literature....BUT","review":"When I began this book, I was in the frame of mind that War In Heaven was \\"literature;\\" with that I struggled the first 100 pages. Then I shifted my reading-expectations-paradigm to mystery-mode and really enjoyed this book. This book reminded me of the novels by Arturo Perez-Reverte; similar writing, arcane/spiritual nuances, good versus evil, who's in control and who's being controlled.I enjoyed the \\"religious\\" subtleties in the book and also how Williams plays with the concept of God in the paradox of good and evil. In essence, the individual, in creating their own reality, also creates their own eternal life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovecraft meets Chesterton.","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, but I can't imagine recommending it to anyone, because the author's perspective is very hard to ascertain. The prose is cleaner and easier to read than \\"All Hallows Eve\\", and the atmosphere is definitely less ethereal. the story is such a strange mix of Victorian and modern ideas; imagine if H.P. Lovecraft and G.K Chesterton wrote a Father Brown mystery, and then made the mystery a subplot. Again in this work, as with the previously mentioned \\"All Hallows Eve\\", Williams does an excellent job bringing his characters to life.I must admit I began reading Williams because of his association with the Inklings and C.S.

More human than Kraftwerk, Gottsching travels similar but less paved landscapes than the classic Autobhan.Along with Michael Strother and CAN's Michael Karoli, one of the best guitar players of Rock and Electronica to ever come out from Germany.

Not a bad 'electronic ambient' effort to check out when you're in a 'certain' frame of mind, but a bit too new-age like for me. I can listen to this disc, but not all that often.

The overall quality is very poor: the quality of polish is below average, the after polish file sighs is everywhere, two holes are dead on all four notes, the slide is jumpy and noisy. For less money you can get Suzuki SCX-64 that is head and shoulders above this one in about every department. The sound of this is very bare bone, primitive, unsophisticated. The harmonica not responsive as Suzuki. Overall you got my point , buy Suzuki, for the money I really can't recommend this Hering.

It was probably just build-up that I could have boiled away with water and vinegar, but I didn't investigate too closely because I'd been eying this copper beauty. After less than two years, it looks more like an old crone. You have to polish it for it to look decent, but, since it's copper plate, polishing seems to be taking off the copper. I can now see silver underneath..As for function, it heats up quickly, the whistle works, and it's a great size. However, as several reviewers have pointed out, the handle is too hot to touch without an oven mitt after you've boiled water. And I want a bit more than function. I use a kettle several times a day, and it never leaves my stovetop except to be cleaned. So I also want something that looks nice. This ain't it.I like these kettles, despite the too-high price, which may keep me from buying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"This teakettle is the most \\"high maintenance\\" item I have in my kitchen. At this price, I expected a much better protective coating on the copper. I realize that copper does need to be tended to, but this kettle looks terrible all the time. I have been very careful to wipe it dry whenever I use it, but one drop that I missed left a black spot that still is noticeable, no matter how much I polish. And the first time I used the recommended polish to give it an allover clean up, the color changed dramatically -- it doesn't even look like the same kettle. And now, it needs to be completely polished EVERY DAY. Do not buy this copper kettle! Before I had to replace it, I had the black version, and it lasted me 10 years.

I washed it over many times, but it didn't go away. I wrote the company, and in the reply, they indicated that it shouldn't be doing it, and it was indeed an unhealthy situation if it was. I probably should have sent it back to them and try to get a refund, but I just threw it away, having never used it.

This is a story of sacrifice without regret and of the costliness of redemption for all of us. As Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote, Grace is not cheap, it cost God the life of His son.

Be aware all modern day sideband radios will be off frequency from the factory. They will work fine on AM but will have to be aligned by a tech for sideband operation. This will run about $25. The real test of a quality sideband radio is whether or not it is stable and free of drift. I am happy to report that the new Chinese made Cobra 148 GTL is stable once it has been aligned. They are now made to Cobra's specs by Ranger Communications I am told.

It's only 20% down/80% polyester, which means it won't be as warm as something that has more down in it. It was very thin & flat. Not what I was expecting.

It's both convenient and compact."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite kitchen organizer.","review":"I have several of these corner organizers in my kitchen. They work great for a variety of items not just dishes. It is a good organizer for bowls, lids, coffee cups just to name a few. They work well side by side or alone. Note that the Grayline brand is a bit higher in price BUT it has additional corner stablizer rods. These make these very sturdy. I use Fiesta dishes and they are pretty hefty but these hold them with no effort. I have one in my kitchen that does not have this extra rod and it is not as sturdy and will easy bend if anything heavy is placed on it. I have to use it for something lightweight like plastic lids and such. You can also turn these on the side to use.

I had quite a few laughs and I recommend it to those who believe in science and thus can treat this book as a work of humorous fiction. The \\"facts\\" are so distorted and out of context that I am shocked this is not categorized as a work of fiction. I guess Mr. Panzer is not familiar with third-world development and that the primary mechanism for progress in these developing nations is birth control.

Strip away the enflamed rhetoric and you have..nothing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvinced","review":"I came away from this book wondering how it got published.Concerns about kids and cancer are raised but never substantiated; worse, when scientists say there's no cause for concern, the book attempts to discredit the scientists and keep peddling the concerns.The same holds true for most of the issues raised; time and again, scientists say a particular issue is not a problem, but the book's author and his main protagonist doggedly maintain there COULD be a problem.The author goes well beyond the precautionary principle he freely advocates; he seems to expect scientific assurance of zero risk.Scientists who disagree are demonized and discredited. Lay people who agree with the book's thesis are quoted liberally.By the time I got to the Brahma bull that calved (bulls don't bear offspring, folks)on page 44, I was convinced of only one thing: this book cannot deliver on its publisher's hype.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment for the uninformed public - no facts needed","review":"Duff Wilson can create a drama, and can paint the \\"good vs evil\\" scenario very well, and develop and animate characters. As a fiction writer for entertainment purposes, two thumbs up. The unfortunate part about this book is that it is represented as non-fiction, but unlike good documentaries, it very obviously includes only one side of the debate. If anyone takes this book seriously, and is genuinely scared about the health risk of North American food, please look into the true facts behind this or any other similar fear mongering story. The actual facts were evaluated in a court of law, and the accusations were proven false. Despite this, the tabloid network has jumped at this story because it is controversial, and they need a break from reporting on more UFO's and Elvis sightings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad book","review":"I was just getting into Fateful Harvest when September 11th hit. I had to force myself to finish reading, because suddenly the book's theme seemed so trivial and self-righteous.What difference does it make whether organic farmers use animal waste or other farmers use industrial waste? Is one type of waste \\"better\\" than the other? The question seems so trite right now. Our food supply seems like something to be thankful for right now, not something to create more fear about.This book simply saddens me now. Surely there are more important things to campaign for these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read -- mindblowing true story","review":"Don Delillo could not have imagined this. I was more blown away by 'Fateful Harvest' than by 'A Civil Action' or 'Erin Brockovich'. Those earlier works were isolated cases of industry abuse, while this book exposes a real-life toxic waste scandal focused ultimately on the food eaten by billions. What's most scary is that the scandal is still going on! -- toxic waste is turned into fertilizer, and spread on the food supply; but the politicians shrug while lives are destroyed. Wilson, an experienced investigative reporter, does a great job of distilling the science (and the politics) behind the news story. He effectively weaves the life of an unlikely small-town heroine into the larger perspective. It's definitely a compelling and accessible read. I did it in a day and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"I purchased this identical item in a local fabric/ craft store for $4.99. It is going back the next time I go there! The loom is plastic, which I don't have that big a problem with. The \\"loops\\" are horrible, some type of thin synthetic which would be a disaster when holding a hot cookie sheet. They are odd shaped, \\"rolled\\" but basically open fabric (not a \\"tube\\"), some look dirty or marked with ink. They seem to be some sort of synthetic scraps. Not at all the potholder loops I remember from my childhood. I am SO glad I opened this before sending it to a friend's child as a gift!! I would have sent a substandard gift and I wouldn't even have known that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this product!","review":"This is not the pot holder weaving set you remember from your childhood! It is made of plastic and ours broke on the first use. The hook is terrible and the whole thing stinks of making something as cheap as possible regardless of the result. Your children deserve better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poorly manufactured","review":"I wanted to teach my daughter the basics of weaving before we moved on in level of difficulty, so when I came across this item I remembered my early days and thought it would be ideal to teach the principles of weaving to her with.The loops it comes with are made out of a rather frighting synthetic fabric, and appear to be cuttings from a failed tights factory. The petroleum used to manufacture them could have been better used to manufacture Gasoline.The hook broke in the middle of use on the first project. Flimsy as all get out, it's now being glued back together and the seam reinforced with tape.The idea is a phenomenal one - its a time tested learning toy, but this one fails due to poor manufacturing. I would suggest spending the money on something better made. I know I will be doing so and very soon.For Concept and what it can teach - I give it 4 stars.For manufacture - well giving it any star is really being generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic look religious wars in 16th Cent. Paris.","review":"Diefendorf's work shines as an excellent book on the battle between the Catholics and the Hugenots in 16th Century Paris. She has clearly done a lot of work on the subject. While the book can be long winded at times, she tries to keep the reader interested with many anecdotes. Truly a fantastic work. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Calvinist or Catholic history or to anyone interested in French history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case for the price","review":"I had needed to get a proper camera case for awhile. The basic one I'd gotten with my digital SLR wasn't big enough and as a result I ended up carrying parts of my camera kit loose in my bag on occasion. That got me a broken lens, so I finally sat down and paged thru the 100s of bags to find one that isn't too expensive, too camera bag-ish, too big, too small etc. And so I landed on the Ape Case Pro - Large by Norazza. I like it. It holds everything I need it to (4 lenses, 1 camera body, miniDV camera, tapes, accessories, etc) + I can have my monopod AND a tripod attached to the straps at the base of the bag. I don't know if it is the perfect bag, but it sure does most everything I need it to and hangs pretty tidily off the back of my wheelchair as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product Overall","review":"I spent time researching various Camera bags. It is hard to know which one will be right for you but the most important things for me was design (will it work for my purpose), durability and price. Overall I would say I am very happy with this bag. I debated on the medium or large option but eventually went with the large bag just because I know I will add more stuff as I go along.The large back is perfect for my needs (Canon t3i and two lenses). It is a well made bag - seems like it will last. As mentioned before the strap is not the best but will do for now. I do like the inside being yellow as others have mentioned also.I would recommend this camera bag to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large bag, although size is a bit funny.","review":"Make no mistake, this is a rather bulky bag. It's heavily padded all over and protects the equipment from the elements.The only odd thing I have is just that I didn't expect the bag to be \\"fat\\". Since I'm used to the dinky Nikon starter bag, this bag definitely blows that one out of the water.It comfortably holds my Nikon D90 + Grip with 18-105 lens, Charger, Cleaning supplies, battery stuff, lens filters, Canon P&S;, and still has space for 2 lens and another camera body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera bag","review":"I really do like the camera bag for holding all of my accessories in one place, but when I go out I use another bag, because this one was just to big.But I do like the yellow color in the inside of the bag you can really see your accessories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"If this product was made from a material that is water resistant ,it would be unbeatable.

Yellow lining of the bag is a nice touch.Bad News: Much less compartment space than I had expected. Either padding is too thick or bag needs to be a bigger.More Bad News: Inside pocket zipper jams and separates when you try to put anything thicker than a notebook inside. I normally would fill the pocket, but zipper is so poor quality it comes apart easily. I returned the bag.Make bigger. Fix zippers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"This book really gave an insightful and intriguing depiction of Sicily, its traditions and its history.

That any publisher found ON PERSEPHONE'S ISLAND worthy of print astounds me! Be warned, you get exactly what is promised, a journal! Simeti's is a dry account, devoid of humor, insight and passion and is written with a lofty phraseology: a deadly combination that had better not be contagious! To be honest, I found the book so dull I was unable to read it straight through, so after eighty pages, I began skiping around in search of entertainment, since there is no story. I found none!If you're searching for an escape to another place, a glimpse into another life or culture, or just plain fun, look elsewhere! You will find none of the above here! Half a star-because the cover is very nice, if misleading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read","review":"Picked this book because of its previous rating and read it prior to visiting Sicily. I found the book a delightful read and Simeti's images to accurately describe the Sicily we saw four weeks after finishing the book.

You are not going to get anything very artsy or porgressive here. Tad just goes for the throat and doesen't let go. Meaty riffs and angry, growly vocals are what you are going to receive. There's not a dud in the lot, just mostly solid tracks and a few great ones. Grease Box, Throat locust, Leafy Incline, and Gouge are my favorites. If you like grunge or metal, definitely own this. Tad does the grunge and metal combination the right way, unlike talentless bands like Godsmack, Staind, Breaking Benjamin and many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tad","review":"Good album, especially the song Grease Box.

How can amazon charge this much money for this and put a 1997 issue date on it?! Anyway, poor mastering aside, this as a stellar \\"lost Gem\\" by Aerosmith that gets 5 stars for the songs, but only 1 star for not being remastered. Every song Rocks. Just don't buy it until it gets remastered (the first 3 songs are available remastered on The Aerosmith Anthology)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Flat Aerosmith","review":"I have to say Done with Mirrors is a disappointment. Maybe the title has to do with the fact that trickery was used to make this album seem like a finished work. Seems like it was pretty hastily slabbed together. And while I do like the live, raw feel to the compositions, it does not make up for the fact that the songs are lacking personality, musically and lyrically. Nothing really stands out from the muffled blues-rock drone, despite a couple of moderately interesting tracks (My Fist Your Face and The Hop). Seems rushed really, maybe trying to cash in on the hype of the band being back together again after 6 years apart. So, while I applaude the fact that little production and mix magic was used as in some of their more resent stuff, I can't quite accept the apparent lack of effort and enthusiam put forth. Barely got 39 minutes out of it, even with a rerecorded Perry solo and bonus track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Their Best","review":"I don't remember recommending this album because it is not the best of Aerosmith by any stretch of the imagination.

The rest is just....terrible! Man, what a dissapointment! I'm sorry I can't seem to formulate an intellegent opinion on the music but it was such a bad listen that I think I'm still reeling from the shock. Stay VERY FAR away from this.

Thankfully, it's still listenable. There's simply not any high points. If you to hear \\"let the music do the talking\\" you're better off getting the Joe Perry Project version. After this album, the group cleaned up their act and starting making good albums again. All this album is the group trying desperately to capture the brilliance of their '70s masterpieces. They still have their signature sound but the songs just don't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"Let's put it this way... at least they made up for this with \\"Permanent Vacation\\". This is really the only sour fruit to come off of Aerosmith's tree over all of their years of making music. This is one of those types of albums that you'd hear OTHER aging rockers making (like the new Lynyrd Skynyrd, or The Rolling Stones) now because they've basically run out of ideas, but don't know how to do anything else. The only reason these types of albums sell any copies at all is because they have such a loyal fanbase. Don't get me wrong, I love Aerosmith! They're NOT one of those \\"aging rockers\\" because they stay up with the times, and are definitely the best American rock band ever (if not the best World rock band ever), but this album is just bad. Avoid it. Even \\"A Rock In A Hard Place\\" without the licks of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford is beter than this getting-back-on-track album. At least they made up for it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly One Good Song on this Album","review":"Done with Mirrors continues the Aerosmith tradition (started with Draw the Line) of bad albums with exactly one good song on them. In this case the one good song is the first one, called \\"Let the Music Do the Talking.\\" They borrowed a riff from \\"Draw the Line\\" for this song but it fit in nicely.\\"Gypsy\\" is not bad but a lot of the songs are embarassing, the work of forty year old men with nothing to say churning out a hard rock album.At its budget price I can't say to avoid this album but don't expect an entire CD full of good songs. Think of it as a single with \\"Let the Music do the Talking\\" and a bunch of second-rate B sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Partially 'Done with Mirrors'","review":"I am a huge fan of Aerosmith, just not of this album. A couple good songs (particularly 'The Hop') but unfortunately the whole exercise just feels like the band ran out of studio time. Songs are rough drafts and the production is barely adequate. Ted Templeton must have recorded this one is his garage. The autobiography 'Walk This Way' (a must read for any fan) discusses how the album and its lackluster sales forced the band to dry out once and for all. The next release was 'Permanent Vacation' and Aerosmith was back! So, perhaps the album served its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say?","review":"This is the album that they all put together, after being apart. It's certainly not their best. I dare say it is the worst - HOWEVER - there is NO bad Aerosmith song - just some that are not as good. There are some good ones on there, and if you are a true AeroFan, you MUST add this to your collection. I haven't listened to it as much as my others, but I must admit it is not as bad as everyone says. And the fact that they had just gotten back together and beaten the odds, and were on their way back to the top ALONE should convince you to get this. And it's cheaper than the others, too.

This is one of those times. This one takes me back to hazy nights of Whiskey, Drugs, and Women in the mid 80's (you weren't really there if you remmber it clearly). It's a good timing party album. Maybe not great but a good listen if you like old Aerosmith. If you like gritty, stripped down Bluesy Rock played by some guys desperate to get back in the Rock 'n Roll game, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let The Music Do The Talking","review":"Original lead guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford re-joined Aerosmith in 1985, and this album marked the beginning of their hugely succesful late-eighties comeback. It didn't get nearly as much attention as \\"Pump\\" or even \\"Permanent Vacation\\", partly because it lacks the obvious pop hit, I suppose, but it is actually a very solid hard rock record, perhaps Aerosmith's best since \\"Rocks\\".The production is excellent, the riffs are big and dirty, the arrangements lean and mean, and \\"Mirrors\\" opens with one of Aerosmith's best songs of the 80s, the high-energy \\"Let The Music Do The Talking\\".Other highlights include the funky, mid-tempo swagger of \\"Shame On You\\", the wonderfully titled groove of \\"The Reason A Dog\\", and the gritty, riff-driven two-guitar onslaught of \\"My Fist Your Face\\", a superb slice of melodic hard rock.Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"REAL\\" reunion album","review":"Contrary to popular belief, this album marked the return of Joe Perry. \\"The Reason A Dog\\" is worth the price of the album alone. Steven Tyler's tongue in cheek lyrics make this song very entertaining. Also the Aerosmith remake of The Joe Perry Project's \\"Let the Music Do the Talking\\" brings what the original lacked, Aerosmith. This is by far the most underrated Aerosmith album ever put out. This is personally my favorite Aerosmith album. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated Aerosmith album ever!","review":"Done With Mirrors is a classic Aerosmith album, but no one seems to notice. It's got great guitars, drums, vocals, etc. Also, I guess no one hears the great lyrics and music. Some good songs are \\"Let The Music Do The Talking,\\" \\"Gypsy Boots,\\" \\"Darkness,\\" \\"The Hop\\" and \\"Shela\\". I recommend this album to anyone. I hope people agree with me that this is totally underrated, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Aerosmith's best, not worst, you silly people","review":"I think you people are all missing the killer track!

If you're going to get into C. S. Lewis's thought, even if only a sampler, get something like THE BUSINESS OF HEAVEN or THE ESSENTIAL C. S. LEWIS or THE QUOTABLE LEWIS? Items like these characterize the industy that has grown up around C. S. Lewis: all sorts of merchandise is being published cashing in on Lewis and his life -- with Hooper largely at the back of it. If you want a novelty item (which is all this will ever be) or just a little gift I guess you could buy these, but why not spend a little more and buy a real C. S. Lewis book?

He may be fun after you've had 10 beers, and everybody is sweating on you on the dance floor, but this is definitely not powerful electric blues. Ed's voice has no dynamic features at all. In fact there are only 2 songs on the CD that I would ever listen to more than twice. Obviously, Ed has a sense of humor, based on his \\"Icicles In My Meatloaf\\" song, but other than one other song, there is no \\"Blues Meat\\" on this CD. To be frank, I doubt anyone with real blues expertise and experience could possibly rate this above mediocre.

I'd put this on a reading list of books about the theology of purgation; The Divine Comedy, The Great Divorce, etc.At times I found Williams writing style a bit thick but I suspect that was intentional. I particularly enjoyed what seemed to be a slam on logical positivism and literary post-modernism in the character of the clerk.Some classify this as horror and perhaps it is but it wasn't really scary to me. In fact, the clerk just winds up looking like a boob. Maybe the scariest thing about it is the choice one of the characters makes for hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore","review":"I agree with all the 1-star reviewers. Paragraphs never end, and Williams keeps saying the same things over and over again. The most interesting character was the little deformed 'dwarf woman' and the croaking sounds she made in lieu of speech. I scared myself trying to make sounds like she must have made. That was the worst scare this book gave me. Simon is a pretty lame excuse for pure evil.

Andy Spence aka Organic Audio truly has his finger on the pulse of world dance floors, whipping together twelve cuts of Afro and Latin influenced grooves. Try DJ Gregory's mix of looped horn blasts, triangle, and cowbell on the opening piece, or the steel drum euphoria of Tugg (Nathan Curran of Faze Action) to see what I mean. Or Tosca's \\"Honey\\" reinterpreted into a vibrant thump-along from Spence himself, who also contributes the oh-so-clever \\"Unspinached Symphony.\\" Nods go to the Idjut Boys as well, for their dubbed up bass ballad \\"Whokitsh\\".Nope, there's no Africa-ca-ca chanting or other fodder here, just solid, inspired rhythms tied to a modern house aesthetic. And if Soul Ascendants' step into wah-wah space funk (\\"Pachacuti\\") is a stretch too far, no matter.

Mostly it covers massage and stretching. It goes over evaluation of the normal horse, identifying problems, preventing problems, massage, exercise therapy, and specific regimes for specialist disciplines. A specific regime is not included for jumpers. The massage section had lots of pictures and showed you, step-by-step, how to do it. Not worth it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful...","review":"I did not find this book helpful in any way and do not recommend purchasing it for your library. What the author considers helpful tips are statements of the obvious. For example in the Suppling Exercises Applied chapter, a Tip from the author is: \\"You can rest yourself and the horse in between each exercise, or just continue into the next one straightaway.\\" Advice such as \\"blankets should fit correctly\\" is equally ridiculous. There are many other excellent books to use as resources - feel free to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books on the subject","review":"This book is a \\"What it is\\" book rather than a \\"How to and Why to do it\\" book. The preface explains why: the author notes that in the UK it is ILLEGAL for horse owners to apply medical/specialized knowledge without the permission of a veterinarian. So- there is no detailed information, just a description of the problem and a description of the treatment.

It covers the major events such as the siege of Wounded Knee and the arrest of Leonard Peltier. It examines in detail the Oglala Sioux reservation at Pine Ridge and its chairman Dick Wilson and his battle with AIM and Russel Means. Other AIM leaders such as Dennis Banks are examined as are the various trials sourounding AIM activism. Those are the books strengths, its weakness is that it does not give a good overview of the state of Native Americans in the U.S in thsoe two decades, concentrating instead on the places where activism took place and where shots were fired. However their were another hundred reservations where such things did not take place, including large reservations such as the Navajos and it would have be nice to learn more about politics and economies in these places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"An outstanding work from an outstanding person. This book represents an extensive investigation of the way those who challenge the status quo and the lies of history are dealt with by the \\"pillars of our society\\".The Indian people whose lives the book documents, like many others in our world, are in the front line of this challenge. They deserve all our support. Reading this book is the least you can do to acknowledge your own humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook Example","review":"Bestseller or no this thing reads with all the flair of a high school history book.

I especially enjoy books that take a balanced or at least comprehensive look at the subject matter. I understand that most history texts have a point of view, regardless of how hard the author tries to be balanced and fair. This book did not even make the effort. I was ready to be persuaded either way the author, but instead came away feeling the same way i do when i listen to a lawyer is describing how great their client's case is.

What I got was a book so biased, so \\"white men bad, native good\\" that it stunned me. The author heaped the hyperbole high and wide. He is apologist for any native action, accuser for any white person's thought. I came away thinking that Peltier probably belongs in prison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, thought-provoking, action-inspiring book","review":"This is an excellent book. Peter Matthiessen covers all the bases. His depth of coverage is astounding. Everytime I had a question about a person or event, they were answered somewhere in the book. It is an amazing telling of what are truly frightening events in our history. It creates a desire to learn more and more, not just about what happened to the Lakota people, but about our government. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!

Also, tracks, Stepping Stone, Voodoo Child (Slight Return) and Killing Floor comes from the Monterey Pop festival, June 18, 1967 and the rest are studio recordings. I think that it's worth getting because of the material and the insight that it gives into some of Jimi's more obscure songs.

The character development is extraordinary prompting the reader to really connect with the characters. LeBlanc's presentation of the information through the perception of the messiah makes the reader want to learn more. Because there is a level of depth to this book that is hard to find elsewhere, it should be read cover-to-cover, not skimmed. LeBlanc has made an impression, and I am awaiting his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for the sequel","review":"Quite informative and not at all simply a \\"bathroom read\\" as one reviewer here has opined. The book covers topics from A to Z (E.g. \\"Actors\\", \\"Fireballs\\", \\"Talking in the Movies\\"). However, if your particular interest is \\"Goofs\\", the basics are covered (E.g \\"Bloopers\\", \\"Boom mikes\\") but you'll find much more for specific movies at the Internet Movie Database (imdb.com). Another reviewer here states the index could be better. I agree. The index seems to be inconsistent, listing only some of the book's topics, but lots of movie titles and actors. For example, a question on the book jackets asks\\" Why don't movie actors wear seatbelts?\\". Good luck finding the answer easily. A handful of the movies chosen for inclusion may seem obscure, but this is still an entertaining book.

Ebert is one of the few critics I agree with more times than not. After reading the reviews from other readers I was looking forward to the read even more.

Sorry I wasted my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ebert at his inimitable best","review":"This is not a general book about movies, but a reprint of selected \\"Answer Man\\" columns. As such, though there is some useful information about film and production techniques and quite a lot on the furor over letterboxing, the most interesting parts of the book allow us to relieve specific moments in recent movie history, for instance, getting glimpses into the thought patterns of fans before, during, and after \\"Water World.\\"I would have liked a little more context to some of the columns; after all, some of the hot topics of 1996 are all but forgotten today. Also, I always thought of Ebert as an extreme political conservative, in opposition to his late partner, the liberal Gene Siskel. So how come he reprints hate letters from political conservatives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pigeon Post","review":"This book is one of my many favorites in the series. It still holds the same imagination and romance, but the characters begin to face more dangerous and sometimes threatening problems.Near the beginning, confusion arises that is not to be solved until the end of the book; Captain Flint sends a letter telling the Swallows, Amazons, and D's (Nancy, Peggy, John, Susan, Titty, Roger, Dick, and Dorthea) that he is sending Timothy to the Amazon's house. He does not mention who Timothy is, and so they somehow assume that he is an animal. Then, they decide to mine for gold.

I can't read it past about ten feet. No matter what the other features are, I wanted a clock I could see the time on, and this does not fulfill that. I am using it for a radio just so it was not a total waste of money. My vision is 20/20, by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to expectations","review":"could not figure out how to set the alarm... too many buttons.sound was excellent... too bad we had to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pain","review":"Difficult to see, which in my book makes it pretty useless. I wear contacts and remove them at night. During the night I cannot see the clock which is only a foot from my head, due to the color/lighting of the face. I've never had this problem before. It is easier for me to read my husband's clock which is placed across the room. The atomic clock feature is nice, but otherwise not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual alarm clock","review":"This is a nice clock radio with many features.The main problem with it is that I can't seem to do a thing without the instruction manual. Setting the alarm time is quite a production number. If you get confused or frustrated by messing about with buttons, you will not like this product. If you don't mind patiently perusing the manual when you want to set the alarm, then it really is pretty nice. It looks great on my dresser, and it gets really good reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing given the price","review":"Electronic tunning is poor - I can hear multiple stations simultaneously. After any power interuption it takes about a day to get a signal for the automatic time adjustment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it","review":"This clock has all the features I was looking for in a new bedside clock radio. It is simple to set up. However, the screen is an amber color, and the digital numbers are so faint that I could barely see them. There was no way to adjust the brightness of the screen, so it was worthless for me and I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad to get rid of it","review":"The RCR-2 is terrible..we could not get the Alarm to ring or have the radio go off the way we wanted..one day it would buzz but not on the on the correct staion mext it would go off on FM when set to AM. It did or did not do whatever you can think of. Maybe I had a bad one or maybe I'm too stupid to follow the instructions. Two of us --one reading step by step and the other person hitting the settings...no luck..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sangean Digital Clock Radio","review":"Somewhat disappointed. Digital information on the face is unreadable unless you facing it directly. Any angle and the face is totally washed out. The back light it way too bright. Of course you can turn it off, but that makes it useless to see at night. Also too many images on the face that are unnecessary. I don't know who designed or tested this, but they didn't do a very thorough job. Again -- disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good functions, poor display","review":"This clock has great functionality as far as the dual alarm settings and radio presets go, but the display is, in my opinion, absolutely terrible. The display is a back-lit LCD with very thin number segments, making it very hard to read from more than a few feet away, especially at night. This is really unfortunate, because otherwise the Sangean seems to be a great product. The atomic clock synchs up to the NIST time signal very quickly (I've had other 'atomic' clocks take a long time), and it is very easy to program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent weak-area reception","review":"We live in a very weak reception area, poor for public FM stations, worse for AM stations. The RCR-2 does an excellent job of bringing in a decent signal for both FM and AM stations. Sound quality is, relatively, poor, but as a bedside radio, often used with a mono earphone, it's excellent. Preset stations are easy to set, and all controls are easy to use by feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO PROBLEM, WELL MADE","review":"Bought this unit over two years ago and have never had a problem with it. Learning to operate all the functions took a while (there are a lot of features!).

Called factory and they were very helpful (hint: the switch is on the bottom of the unit). Overall very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain To Program","review":"Based on a number of things I'd read, I thought this clock would be much easier to use than it is.

My guest room now has a fancy clock however..."},{"rating":"1","title":"sangian atomic clock","review":"It's fine except that you can't see the time if you are not right in front of the clock. The numbers are to faint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sangean RCR-2","review":"Our old bedside clock/radio/alarm finally quit after 20+ years. We selected the Sangean RCR-2 as a replacement mainly because of the automatic clock feature and because we lose power occasionally. A plus for this unit is superior FM reception compared to the old one. However, the setup for the alarm is overly complicated and it took a couple of tries to get it to work the way I intended. Overall, I am satisfied and I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design, Time/Date washed out","review":"It's the same as other reviews, CAN NOT see the time/date at night, LED background washes out the time/date. All they had to do was make the time lines 2 or 3 times thicker. Also, the radio can not pick up any FM stations (my old cheap alarm clock picked them up).I bought the clock for the automatic time update and dual alarm (I use the buzzer anyway). It's weird the later it gets the lessyou can see the display (when you wake up in middle of the night trying to see the time, forget it, you can stare at it for 5 minutes and you still won't see the time (we had the clock about 6 feet away, then moved it to 2 feet away still the same thing). I hope who ever designed/tested this clock was fired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little radio, good little price.","review":"I looked at the competing radios up to $200 dollars. Here is why I like it:1 - I often use my headphones so I don't disturb my wife. Not all the competitors permit headphones.2 - Speaker sounds quite good - not the best, but quite good.3 - It will pick out the time from the weather bureau (so you don't have to set it). It may take a while, or hours, but it works.4 - Easy tuning, easy to use scanner to get stations, easy to set and use presets - even if it is dark and you are groping for the buttons.5 - Display is clear.6 - Alarm works fine. (Note competitors either don't have clocks, alarms, or have an over-stylized, next to useless clock on the Tivoli.)Get over the instructions written by someone in Asia with poor knowledge of English, and you have a great clock-radio.Also, I have already dropped it twice. Still works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sangean RCR-2 Digital Atomic Clock Radio with Dual Alarms","review":"Worked to specs. I am married and my wife often needs different alarms.

The display is too bright or completely off. It is a little complicated to set, and to unset. I like to set alarm 2 to buzzer as a backup for alarm 1 in case I sleep through alarm 1. When I don't sleep through alarm 1 I have to push 3 or 4 buttons in the right order to stop alarm 2 from going off. That can be tricky when I am just waking up.But the radio is very good, digital tuning with lots of presets is what I was looking for, and the automatic time setting feature is handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice radio","review":"Like the radio, easy to operate, pretty clear sound.

(I know how to set them per instructions) I've pressed \\"reset\\" button for three seconds without turning this nuisance alarm off. The reset turns all other settings off, or to default.The other problem is readabiltiy. I place the radio on a slightly elivated dresser and cannot read the time while laying down in bed.

Being woken up at 2 AM was enough for me to ditch this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrical items not always what they seem","review":"I bought a digital clock radio through Amazon for my wife who was wanting a digital radio. I assumed a little naively that this is what she wanted. When it arrived, it turned out to be a digital clock with a standard radio. For the price it was reasonable so we were happy. The item, however was from the USA and could not be used in Australia. US mains power runs at 115 volts. Australian is 240 volts. Voltages differ from country to country and I expected that a large business would have been aware that an electrical appliance must be appropriate for the country of use.While there is the safety net of return of purchases, it cost me $53 to send it back - about the cost of the item itself.Take care when buying electrical items - ask questions if you can't find information on the voltage.

The two pieces of the \\"adjustable\\" pole won't go together properly, so it's not only not adjustable - it won't stand up straight. The set screws that fasten the top and bottom onto the poles are microscopic. I guarantee no one has a phillips screwdriver that small, but even then, the screws are too large for the holes provided!

I believe as long as the plate is not over 11\\" it will fit nicely. It is sturdy and finished nicely. I have white cabinets so it just blends in great.

If it was a 5 min. music video this I could endure, but at 2 hours it made me want to puke. Also I tried not to fall asleep watching more than half an hour of pointless and boring close up shots of ugly blokes in a darkened meeting room staring and squinting at each other, at documents etc. The totally unlovable character of Robert Redford made it impossible for me to identify with him, while Brad Pitt was same as always, not bad, not outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spy","review":"Robert Redford is Nathan Muir, a CIA operative that is a day from retirement.

The plot is improbable, the dialogue a little overdetermined, many of the characters [typical]. Yet, despite its faults, I find it to be quite a bit better than the average spy flick. The set-up in itself is interesting: Robert Redford's character becomes something of a spy within the CIA; the line between good guy and bad guy is not so easily drawn here. The script is merely serviceable, but the film creates an adrenaline-soaked atmosphere through its jumpy camera-work and unexpected ... twists. Unlike most action movies, it gives you something to think about, a ... situation to consider and question. Plus, how many big Hollywood flicks have a juicy, sly Charlotte Rampling cameo? That in itself deserves credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special with Spy Game","review":"Unfortunately Redford, although an incredible actor can also hit a wall now and again. I found this film to have a large concentration on conversations that were supposed to be meaningful in regards to the mentoring ability of Redford's character. Instead it ends up being just talk, and at times almost seems to appear as if it has no real purpose. They would have been better off finding some real former spies and making a film based off of those experiences instead of the dull, boring effect that this thing emits. Really just could not find anything good in it, and although it has a great cast, the roles they fill are just that...filled, but not enough to make this film have any rewatchable value."},{"rating":"1","title":"good moive , terrible picture quality","review":"A very god movie as far as content, but terrible picture quality as far as it being high def.

For the intial DVD viewing, all the film montage multimedia effects involved in navigating the menus was somewhat entertaining. But, after the initial viewing, all this repeated material felt like a force-feeding. Also, the design of the soundtracks prevents the viewer from changing the languages/surround sound/director's commentary/subtitles at will through standard DVD controls. Instead, one must always go back to the overly elaborate menus (more film montage repeats) for any simple change, which quickly becomes quite tedious. Lastly, I would like to mention that the so-called \\"Alternate Ending\\" is identical to the \\"Theatrical Release Ending\\" with the exception of different background music. Certainly not worth buying for the \\"Alternate Ending\\" bonus material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spy Game (widescreen DVD)","review":"DVD problem: unable to turn off hearing impaired captioning.

This appears to be a systemic problem with other viewers as well. Think twice before buying any UNIVERSAL DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to stop captioning","review":"I think I could have enjoyed this movie if the captioning would stay turned off. After turning captioning off through the menu, it only stays off for a couple of minutes. Thought the first DVD was defective and returned it. The second one is doing the same thing. I decided to research this and found that it is a known problem--mostly with Toshiba players (which I have). I own other DVDs with captioning that do not turn on automatically."},{"rating":"2","title":"I REALLY liked it","review":"I know some people find it just average or a mildly entertaining flick but for some reason it is one of my top 5 films. Honestly, I couldn't really tell you why I like this film so much. Maybe because of all the locations and the events that occur in them? Maybe it's because I like the acting? Honestly, I have no idea. For some reason I could watch this film every week and I would enjoy it all the more. If you didn't know, the soundtrack is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"Excellent actors, scenes, photography and story.Watching An action packed movie with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt? How wrong can you be?Spy game has a blend of action inside and outside the CIA offices. It also shows what a man can do and how far he can go for love.Some of the story takes place in Beirut during the civil war in the late 1970's. Since I lived there during most of that period, I can say the recreation of Beirut and life in that city during that crazy time are pretty accurate. Enough said.DVD quality, picture and sound are excellent. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's up with the subtitles every other chapter?","review":"I picked up this dvd today and had a problem right off.

Whether I was in a bad mood or not, I don't know, but this was sooo slow. I was not captivated by the plot and Brad Pitt was not believable in his role and I didn't feel connected with the story.

I've read other reviews, and it seems other people are having similar problems. I have a Toshiba SD-1600 so maybe it is a Toshiba-specific problem. I emailed Universal so I'll see what happens.....Maybe Hollywood executives should stop holding fundraisers and giving money to Bill Clinton and his pinko Democratic friends and instead, take some time and effort into actually checking to see if a DVD works before mass producing and selling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spy Game","review":"Want good Leatherface?

I love Brad Pitt movies(I haven't seen 'The Mexican' yet though) and so far this is his worst. The entire plot is rediculous. Robert Redford always staying one step ahead of the other agents. NONSENSE! He always having to tell the story of 'Brad Pit's' character. They'd flash back 25-30 years and Both of them had the same hair style, sideburns and wrinkles on the face(Robert Redford) Too much time in the sun Robert-ever heard of sunscreen? Overall, this movie is ... and should be reported as so. I bought it first and lost bigtime. I highly recommend renting first. That's if you don't care to lose a couple of hours of your life. PS. I never had the closed captioning problem. ... Just thought I'd throw that in.

The story isn't new, but Robert Redford and Brad Pitt are a good team, and there are enough twists to keep your interest. Redford intially mentors Pitt at the CIA, but then follows his career as a spy. When Pitt is caught in a trap, Redford tries to help him escape. Good effects and production values make it worth at least a rental, but the acting and story may implore you to buy it. I didn't find the picture and sound so dramatically different to warrant buying this in Blu-ray. I think most people interested in this movie will be satisfied enough with the standard version.

This is a long movie, 127 minutes! It did keep my interest.Robert Redford and Brad Pitt star in this one. Redford, Muir, is on his last day bfore retirement from the CIA. Brad Pitt, Bishop, once his \\"protege\\", is in a chinease prison and about to be executed.The entire film is Muir flashing back to when he had originally met up with Bishop, and while explaining this to the CIA, is also trying to help Bishop escape. Does his plan work? Hmmm...I will not give to much away. It's a fast paced, well acted, sometimes funny, and very engrossing film that makes you think.It's directed by Tony Scott, who is good at giving us very stylish looking action films like \\"True Romance\\" and \\"Enemy of the State\\".For fans of Brad Pitt and Redford, you get to look at their cute faces a lot. Even in his mature state, Redford, is still very charming and handsome.Worth the rental fee!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its moments, but otherwise dull","review":"This is an okay one time watch, but it is not worth the purchase.

On many players, Toshiba particularly, the close captioning for hearing impeared appears after running a few minutes and can't be switched off. These are much worse than subtitles as they cover a large part of the screen at times and makes watching the movie very frustrating.

Every scene has some form of annoying music which changes in an ad hoc fashion. There is no need for it and in the end cheapens the movie - I could not wait for it to end - it irritated me so much Such a pity - two good actor messed up by the sound effects people. I felt so relieved in the few parts that had no artificial background noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than it has any right to be","review":"For all its posturing and its stops along the blots on America's post-war copybook, Spy Game's probably no more realistic than The Spy Who Loved Me, but it is considerably better than expected considering its pedigree. Despite a few moments where he got carried away with the stylistics (such as the unintentionally hysterically funny freeze frame captions repeating a deadline every time someone mentioned it to underline the drama) and a rather silly ending, the pros definitely outweighed the cons for once in Tony Scott's espionage saga. Harkening back to the cynicism of 70s conspiracy thrillers like Three Days of the Condor but ultimately lacking the guts to go all the way with its nihilism, it's a lot more engaging and entertaining than it has a right to be. But it is hard to believe that CIA execs would be so genuinely delighted at the prospect of their own agents being executed by foreign powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"good action and background - BAD LOGIC","review":"A story within a story, the background (flashbacks) on recruitment, training and action of Bishop (Brad Pitt) is nice to follow with some real \\"how to make a spy\\" sequences.

Back at Langley, the top members of the CIA are trying to figure out what went wrong with Bishop's mission. The movie is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It tracks the history of American covert operations through the last couple decades; moving from Vietnam, to Berlin, to Beirut, to China. You're caught up in the adventure as Muir trains Bishop to be the perfect case officer. I give this movie four stars because it's exciting and it realistically portrays the world of a spy. There are no laser watches, evil doctors, sports cars with rockets, or explosive pens. In short it's not a James Bond spy film, but its great none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't turn off captions","review":"To turn off the captions in this movie, one has to go all the way back to the menu [the regular 'subtitle' hot key is locked off for the dvd], wait through 5-10 seconds of music clip, scroll through the menu, turn them off, and once that happens, they stay off for 1-3 minutes at a time.note, these are the captions [which are mostly on screen, not just near the bottom edge, either], not the discreet subtitles.I doubt it will affect every dvd player, but it was extremely distracting... it was an effort to get through the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"I have seen this movie probably 15 times and I NEVER get tired of it.

It was in the way they did it - the distortion never sounds intrusive or discordant but complements the detached vocals for a cohesive music of eerie beauty. In this crucial way the music differs from most of the output of the industrial genre, in that it has a flowing, hypnotic quality. My favorite tracks on this seminal album include Just Like Honey, The Living End, The Hardest Walk, Sowing Seeds, My Little Underground and the sublime You Trip Me Up, a poignant blend of the tender and the ominous. Psychocandy is a successful experiment in blending feedback with melody, creating atmospheric but always tuneful soundscapes that linger in the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dual disk problems!","review":"This disk would not work in two differentdrives in my computers and in my regular cd player (a Samsung) it would take over a minute to load and then would not play track one (but played the others ok).

I think this is because she really goes out on a limb here, and not one lyric, not one note is compromised. It Must Be Love is a tremendously deep and poignant tune. The rest reward careful and repeated listenings - beat poetry layered on top of crisp, Steely-Dan melodies. And I think here she finds the perfect balance between wistfulness (as in her debut) and maturity (which marred her second album). Lovely and earthly and spiritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarkably informative","review":"This quaint little booklet has much more to it than the amusingly retro title - it is one of the best writings I have come across on the subject of developing sexual harmony in a committed relationship. It was originally written in 1931 and has several minor limitations (modern birth control had not yet been invented), but that is also one of its strengths - there is much we can learn from the perspectives of that time. Yes, people had sex in 1931. Another limitation is a cultural bias - but he has valid insights onto relationships that can be taken separately from his cultural biases. This booklet (and, I imagine, the other works on the topic by the author) is extremely worthwhile for anyone in a committed sexual relationship, and for young people, as a great counterpoint to junk culture's ridiculous misportrayal of sexuality.

The cup holder is easy to put on and take off, but the baby can't take it off, so the baby bottle or sippy cup can go there, maybe clip a bottle leash to it, and you're all set. Looks stylish with the pretty, bright blue color. The wheels are like a hard plastic so they won't pop or lose air. All 4 wheels have brakes. Looks stylish, feels comfy, easy to clean, easy to use. The bar across the lap is easy to take off or put on and it's a little bit squishy/bendy in the middle for comfort, unlike regular hard plastic, which I think is really cool.

But it sounds almost identical, on the 'Substance' album 3 minutes of the song was edited out, I guess for more space on the CD. The LP (vinyl edition) version of 'Substance' if you can get a copy had the true 12\\" version unedited as well as all the other substance songs. The reason I'm writing this is because once you get into the song like I have with the 12\\" versions and then listen to it on the CD only edited slightly it still makes you think about the fact.

Disc Two is another matter, featuring leftovers and throwaways that for the most part are of little interest. The shame is that the first CD is not available alone (as it is on cassette). The beauty of New Order is that their elaborate sounds challenge your mind as they move your feet. For that, \\"Substance\\" is well worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great basic PIC book- literally.","review":"This is a good beginner's book on PIC 16F84 microcontrollers as long as you don't mind spending an additional $100 for a third party PIC BASIC code compiler. All of the book's lessons and programs are based on this BASIC compiler (no commonality to Microchip's MPLAB). There are some truly useful projects described such as serial communication, servo motor control and switch inputs, so if your goal is to get a design up and running quickly, this might be for you. It would be more accurately described as a user manual for the BASIC compiler rather than a PIC microcontroller reference.

The PIC Microcontroller Project Book is in fact such a book. However if you want to begin using PICs, then this is an excellent place to start. The book begins at the beginning and describes the use of the tools necessary to produce code to be programmed into the PIC.Further chapters give instruction on programming in PicBasic with simple examples of programs to get the PIC to do what you want. It is as it suggests a Project Book. I find that I learn faster with this structured stepwise instruction.I found the book useful and informative. The book is for the person who is starting off. To delve more deeply into programming PICs, you will need to do further reading, but, you will have a good basic understanding of the operation of PICs and their potential.I would recommend this publication highly and congratulate the author on a job well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive catalog","review":"This book is little more than a catalog for \\"Images Company\\", just like all of the other John Iovine books that I've read. Of course what the author fails to mention in each book, and even on the company's web site, is that _he is the owner of said company_. And yes, you can order just about everything you need from him, but be prepared to pay as much as 600% over what you would pay anywhere else (digikey, mouser, radio shack, etc). Once again, I'm left feeling cheated.One more thing.....the book is only 195 pages long, not 272 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starter book-not quiet","review":"I recently bought this book in order to learn Pic programming and avoid learning assembly language. I tought that my begginer knowledge of C++ will be enough to understand Basic. But it was not so. Lots of program structure explanation used in Basic is omitted and simply assumed. I did not mind that the book reffers to only one tool for programming as that is the best way for the begginer to go. However, if you have no prior Basic language knowledge, stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"Do not buy this book! It is nothing more than a giant catalogue for Images Co. (which the author owns). It teaches you less then any other thing you could buy (including the PICBasic assembler instruction book).

Since this book is suppose to take the newbie (judging from the almost agonizing explanation of binary counting)from ground zero I would extend the opinion that the errors are critical failures and eliminate the usefulness of the book. If however you are already a somewhat able \\"hacker\\" (or a professional Software Engineer like myself), the book is a great way of learning the basics of firmware writing and does in fact transfer the knowledge it is supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners could do better!","review":"I think this book was written just to generate revenue! While it might be OK for experienced electronic technicians, it's weak on advanced subjects. I also disagree with the author's suggestion of PicBasic over PicBasic Pro. In my opinion, 'Pro' is a better buy.Also, beginners should beware of some serious schematic errors. For example, in two circuits there's no filter capacitor between a bridge recifier and a voltage regulator. While errors like this are easy to overlook, for a newbie, it means the difference between a circuit that works and one that doesn't. I would have expected better editing on a book geared toward the beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for nothing. PIC Basic, not basics of PICs.","review":"This book is maybe OK but the first half of the book covers a evaluation board and the operating program of one certain type of PIC.

I even like the \\"Humane Waking System.\\"But after only a few days, the pretty blue light you see in the pictures went out and wouldn't come back on, so that in the dark we had to shine a light at the clock to see what time it was. That was aggravating but not fatal.However, recently the self-setting feature has gone haywire as well. The clock still sets itself, but it always sets itself between 78 and 79 minutes fast. There's no way you can set the time manually and turn off the auto-set, so we completely ignore the time on the clock face now and set our alarms for an hour and 18 minutes before when they're supposed to go off...and we have another old clock radio right next to this one that actually keeps time (although we have to set it manually) and whose digits we can see.We've had ours for a little over a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I bought this item a couple of years ago, and it seemed great according to the description. But it is almost maddeningly complicated to set up for the alarm functions. In fact, after I finally got it to wake me up I quit trying to change radio stations or volume levels. Also, it has a real hard time synchronizing with the time signal from Colorado. I have a small wristwatch very near this clock and the wristwatch nas no problem getting the correct time, but this thing, with its big antenna seems to have a terrible problem recieving the time signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"not completely reliable","review":"My husband bought me this clock radio as a gift. Not long after using it, the blue backlight stopped working. We fiddled with the brightness controls, but nothing helped. It just stopped. I resigned myself to not being able to see the time in the middle of the night. Then recently, the time itself stopped working correctly. The analog time and the digital time showed two different times, neither correct! The digital clock began running way behind time (not good if you want an alarm to go off on time). I was just about to junk it and order a new clock radio when I went in to take a look at it one more time, and both clocks are now reset to the correct time and seem to be functioning... after more than a week of not working right!

There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there. Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.

On the other hand, there is nothing truly bad in this movie: it merely lacks anything good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Effects are not all a movie needs.","review":"It bothers me to see that almost all adaptions of Video Games to the screen focus entirely on special effects and not on plot.

The Licker's CGI looked better in Resident Evil 2, the Night of the Living Dead had far better zombie make-up, and Michelle Rodriguez continues to be one of the most annoying (and worse) actresses in Hollywood.It's sad to see Paul Anderson go from Mortal Kombat (the ONLY good game movie) and Event Horizon, to this junk.

But if you are a diehard Resident Evil videogame player, you will need to divest yourself first of Resident Evil cannon in order truly enjoy its cinematic interpretation which clearly stands on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fun. Fans of the game will hate this movie. To them I say \\"Keep an open mind idiots!\\"","review":"While this movie bears the name of Resident Evil it does not follow the game story line at all. In fact other than the evil corporation Umbrella, the zombies and the licker, this movie has nothing to do with the game. If this movie had been called anything other than Resident Evil it would have been an excellent movie. Milla Jovovich is a severely underrated actress she is great as Alice. All the cast is very good you feel for them when they get hurt or they die. In my opinion those who are hard-core fans of the game keep an open mind and try too watch the movie as what it is: a good Zombie flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Listen....not exactly like the game, But still awesome","review":"Don't listen to the other reviews, which say that this movie is not exactly like the game, but really close. When the first installment of Resident Evil came out on Playstation, it scared the crud out of me. I thought that no movie could compare to the adrenaline rush that came with the game. I was REALLY wrong. Don't get me wrong, because I don't scare easily. This movie was amazing. If you ever played the video game...don't expect anything...you will be taken by suprise no matter what. So, just go in there as if you haven't even heard that name before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good...","review":"One would think this is yet another poor movie based on a Video Game. That's wrong...This is a good entertaining movie that does not take itself that seriously but provides some good thrills. Combined with the excellent score from marilyn manson, this turned out to be a good movie.Heck even my wife liked it and this is not her thing at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-existent plot but it's working!","review":"The plot (if at all) of the movie has been reused many many times before: evil corporation, things gone wrong. But all this is not the most important for horror thriller (although it never hurts) as this movie proves. This movie has suspense (at least it kicked my adrenaline), the special effects are quite good (I would do without the monster in the end though, which I thought was silly) and the acting is more then adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea for a prequel","review":"Since Night of the Living Dead never gave a real explanation for the return of the zombies Resident Evil would make a good prequel. At least that's how I have it set up in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than its sequal","review":"I saw Resident Evil: Apocalypse before i saw this one, and may i say, this one is WAYYYYY better. This movie has it all, gore, guns, zombies, lasers, and, yes, decapitation. With a heavy metal soundtrack, a heroine clad in nothing but a red dress, and big guns, this is a flick best watched in either an attic, or a basement with minimal lighting at midnight. Great movie. 5 stars. keep away from kids under 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I Can Say...","review":"Is that you should avoid this film as if it was crawling with Ebola. It's utter nonsense, with hardly a cranial cavity on its' shoulders, much less a brain. The acting is so wooden I have half a mind to use it to make furniture. The plot doesn't make a lick of sense (something about a wicked corporation that runs the world and makes a new, deadly man-made virus, for no apparent reason), and the action sequences are utter trash, with no sense of urgency for the characters, because we don't care about them anyway. \\"Resident Evil\\" is crap on celluloid. Avoid as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anderson succeeds yet again at ruining another movie","review":"If he had had any sense, he would have done a direct adaptation of the game, like the killer novelization. But no, Anderson has to do his own thing, and he saps the plot of most of its intrigue, adding his own horrible touches. The movie's opening was confusing, the acting was mediocre at best, and the music, as usual, is totally forgettable. Any movie with zombies has the potential for being scary, but Anderson's pounding metal score ruined any atmosphere the film could have had. All of the monsters, save a horribly adapted Licker, are cut from the movie. The entire movie was painfully boring, save one scene involving a security laser, which was the only redeeming thing about this horrible film. If this reflects his adaptation plans for 'Resident Evil: Nemesis' or the dreaded AvP movie, then we're sure to be greeted with two more pathetic, horrible jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"The score to this film was flawless but, the movie itself is just another average in my book. Marilyn Manson did the score for this movie and he did a job! If you watch the commentary to this movie they said that they didn't want to show zombies in the beginning because, you knew that you were gonna see some any way. The film didn't even have enough gore to be a serious zombie movie. I give this 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A visual treat but empty","review":"Resident Evil was fascinating as a visual, technical piece but overall empty as a movie. And as a horror movie, there were no thrills, no jumps, no real scares. I anticipated every zombie, mutant doggie jummping out from corners. Most of all, I kept wondering why Milla Jovovich, who is such a good actress, deliverd such a flat and emotionaless performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duh...It's a new Resident Evil chapter.","review":"This movie was awesome. It ADDS to the overall storyline of Resident Evil. It is NOT a movie based on the original Resident Evil video game. It DOES have an original character in it (Nemesis, who gets an appearance at the end if anybody pays attention). Even if nobody knows anything about Resident Evil, the movie is well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I'm not really a fan of the comic book or video game based movies, however, \\"Resident Evil\\" is one thrilling movie. The story line is well put together and original for the most part (ok, so there are zombies, past that though...)The sequel to \\"Resident Evil\\" I think makes this movie even better and you should definately watch both, in order. While Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigues might be type-cast, they certainly deliever when it counts.Those who play and know the video game I'm sure will like the movie even more then the uniniated such as myself, but do not let that stop you from see this surprisingly good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"It's a zombie movie based on a popular video game, so I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised. A bit of mystery, characters with personality and -- of course -- the zombies all came together to make a good film. Science fiction and horror fans are right to love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"I went into this movie expecting to see something good because i have played all the resident evil games but instead was very disapointed for starters its an R rated film but i have seen more gore and horror in most M15+ movies secondly you only get to see the lickers the zombies and the rotting dogs which were killed off a bit to quickly and with all the experimenting going on there was not one tyrant in the film it is only mentioned at the end as mentioned in other reviews they had 40 million and milla jovovich to work with and it only came out as a very average film"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT SCI FI / HORROR MOVIE","review":"I wasn't a fan of the video game series but I still loved this movie. I would say this movie is a cross between Blade + The Matrix. If you are a Sci Fi or a Horror fan you should at least enjoy this movie. The only problem with the movie is the strange ending but the strange ending leaves it open for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad movie but it needed more","review":"...this movie was pretty good. What I think it needed was not to be cut so much. It seemed to go from one scene to the next with jump cuts that practically gave you whiplash (like going from the scene where there in the office And Milla kills the guys sister, right to them getting a back to the rest of the team running from the Zombies without anything in between). There was more of this movie people! I think the things that kept it from being great were left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully the'll come out with a directors cut. Still I think it deserves a sequel an a shot at being a better movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Video Game adaptation I've seen in a long time.","review":"Resident Evil was one of the most scarious, and loudest action filled movie I've seen in a long time. If you forget that the movie uses a lot of themes from different movies(i.e. evil computer, zombies, very ugly and dangerous monster), you will enjoy it. If you are a fan of the video game, you will love it.But there are a few things I didn't like about this movie. One, the acting. Now it doesn't get as bad as RE1 Barry's \\"Master of unlocking\\" bit. The acting is kind of how RE2 was made. Two, there were a little too many plot holes for my taste. Three, the only time they deal with the final monster (the Licker) is at the end.But overall, if you're looking for a good action movie, this is the one to go to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome","review":"This movie was fantastic. Its started with a bang and didn't let up, definately keeps you on the edge of your seat. It follows the game enough to keep RE fans happy but still surprised. Milla was great in this role! I can't wait for DVD release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evil Is Resident","review":"The world has been waiting for this and now they'll know how it all begins in this action adventure based on Survival Horror at it's finest form in RESIDENT EVIL.Now at first i was skeptic like the rest of you, but it's shown me through the trailer that it will be one hell of a movie. The movie should be good and i'm sure that it will...enjoy!^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Dissapointment","review":"I have to say that Resident Evil was a worth-while movie. However, considering it was supposed to based on the first installment of the seris confused me. The movie and the game had some small similarities in their story lines, but all-and-all they were practicly different adventures altogether. I was dissapointed in the fact that not all the chacaters and monsters of the video game were present in the movie. And, most of all, that many, many key elements were cut or changed. But in spite of all that, the movie was really good. Nasty but good."},{"rating":"2","title":"game-based movies","review":"I've seen all the video-game based movies that came out from \\"Mortal Kombat\\" to \\"Resident Evil\\", since they're both directed by Paul Anderson. When I seen this movie in theaters, I really liked it alot, because I seen a few zombie flicks on TV. The special effects were awesome, making the blood look too realistic. I'm also looking forward to the sequel, if they ever make one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prequel to the best series of Games","review":"When i first heard about this movie I thought heck yeah, this is gonna take right off the games and when I heard George A. Romero was writing the script I was enthrilled even more. I later found out that he was fired and his script would be scrapped, that really (made me mad) especially after reading Romero's original draft for the movie. I found out they were going to have a new story with new characters and only 3 monsters: the zombies, howlers, and licker. I got back into it because I found out this was going to be a prequel to the games giving them a back-story. I downloaded it first off the internet to see if it was truly good and it was. Then I saw it in theatres. It was excellent, it suprised that the guy who did Mortal Kombat: Anihilation did this film. This film was really a one of a kind deal and a great risk because it didn't follow the games but it followed through. I will buy the dvd, you should too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably The Worst Movie I Have Seen","review":"You know I have heard a lot of people love this movie, but when I watched it I was utterly dissapointed. I have played every Resident Evil game that has came out and I loved every single one of them. One of the things I liked about the game was the well developed plot. This movie does a horrible thing to that plot. First the movie is about a a virus that allows the dead to come to life as zombies that wander lifelessly feeding off human flesh. First the mansion would have been better left off the movie entirly it served no purpose other than to give us a few glimpses. Whatever they did to the police teams was atrocious and it still leaves me confused. The movie throws you into a situation where the police are holding people hostage during a raid on the house. I must say the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent special effects, but they do not make up for the mutilated and awkward plot that was created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Movie","review":"I have never played the game, so I don't know who the characters were. And the movie didn't help either. After watching the movie, I still don't know any history of Milla's character. I don't even remember the name of her character. The movie's ending felt to me that there was no ending, even though I heard there will be a sequel.The movie had a few jump-out-of-your-seat moments. The laser hall was awesome. The makeup and effects were okay. Other than that, the movie really [stunk]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie Commando Meets Plotless Doom....","review":"I was reluctant to watch resident evil, considering it was based on a video game. Well, my fears were realized in this hack-n'-slash skin fest. First the good: the first fifteen minutes were excellent. Great tension, great screenplay, excellent action. (Especially the scene where they are trapped in the elevator). The movie went down hill from there, into some campy zombie-killing thriller featuring an impractically clad heroine, and dozens of super-model looking commandos. sorry, I had to pass on finishing this, about the time the woman woke up in the mansion, my brain began to go numb. Perhaps the sequel will be better? But then again, considering the success of past video-game based films, perhaps not..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another crappy Paul W.S. Anderson film","review":"First of all the CG sucked. Second, Michelle Rodriguez can't act. She rolls her eyes to the back of her head with every line as if to make it more intense and stronger, it doesn't work. The movie doesn't really follow the game much. And although I never thought about this until I heard someone else say it, why would the computer send out all those little lasers and not just the \\"net laser\\" if it's job was to kill any and everything? The answer is, so they can include more unecessary action without incorporating it more smoothly and intelligently.If you want to see a good zombie flick, rent the original Night of the Living Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie","review":"I absolutely hated this movie. Resident Evil was the first Playstation game I ever played and I loved it. The game had enough of a plot and storyline that they could have made a MUCH better movie out of it.. if they had even bothered to set the movie in an abandoned Umbrella mansion in the woods, it would have been better. This movie is NOTHING like the game OR the books. I especially hated the cheesy outfit the lead character was wearing.. she was supposed to be a STARS team member, and they don't wear miniskirts for mission gear! HELLO!The whole thing was just stupid. I hope that the director of this one doesn't try to tackle any of my other favorite Playstation games for movies.. if he tries to come out with Parasite Eve I'll be violently ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawd awful!","review":"This movie SOOOOOOO sucks! I won't even waste my oxygen going into all the reasons why it does!Just know this... I have a personal collection of currently 538 horror films.... And I've prolly seen close to a thousand! I own most the Resident Evil games, and love those, although the series is getting moldy. Obviously I pick up just about anything within the horror genre... I will never claim ownership to this dreadfull title! Also know that considering that it boasts itself as being the movie based a videogame series that features flesh eating zombies... There is not one on screen munching of any kind! Anyone who says otherwise is full of it!If your that confused with all the horror afficandos and Resident Evil fanboy adolescents having such differing reviews. Spend the few paltry dollars and rent it first! Buying this one without seeing it, is definitely risking ownership of a very expensive coaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and Unwatchable","review":"Derivative, boring, and beyond stupid, zombie flick \\"Resident Evil\\" misses every possible opportunity to scare, thrill, or even make sense. It doesn't even have the gorey guts of its video game inspiration. Your best bet? Skip this soulless claptrap and see how good movies weave complex plots, well-drawn characters, and true scares into a terrifying whole. \\"Aliens,\\" \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\" and \\"Blade 2\\" are an excellent start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best scary movie I have ever seen","review":"If you are a fan of the game or not, you will like Resident Evil. That is, if you can handle a scary movie. This one will have you jumping out of your seat. Scary stuff is around every corner. Eerie environments (like the spooky quiet rooms in the game), monsters that pop around corners, as well as the good ole blood and gore that accompany any resident evil game fill this movie. Watch it if you are ready to be scared!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gamers Movie","review":"Well last nite I went to go see the movie and I enjoyed the movie beyond rlief. Because it related to the game... Seeing the graphics of this movie was great, personally I liked the twist in the story and the evolving stages of a licker to a hunter. It keeps you wanting more and I cannot wait to see part two if they come out with one. The plot behind this movie was excellent... During the movie u wanted to see more of the game come out, in the theater all u heard if u were surrounded by RE or in japanese (bio-hazard) fans was when is Tyrant or Nemesis going to show. To the people who made the movie I think it beats any other game movie cross over and congrats."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this movie.","review":"It was exactly what I expected and even a little more.

More entertaining than one would expect from another video-game adaption, but the visual effects are so laughably poor and the concept so ridiculous that most die-hard horror fans will see this to be a direct rip-off of George A.

Ten points to anyone who can figure out Jovovich&#65533;s character&#65533;s name before the credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Resident Evil\\" is a noisy mess","review":"I\`m one of the fans of the video game {Resident Evil} the game is really scary but with the movie nothing scary here exceptfor some awful acting and lame special effects in fact the video game is a lot more fun than the film.All we hope for is some cool special effects and fight scenes But even on that level, \\"Resident Evil\\" is a disappointment.I do not think being a fan of the game could've possibly improved my enjoyment of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I guess you might have to be a fan of the game in order to enjoy the movie. But I doubt that even if that were true that one could derive any enjoyment out of this piece of trash. There is one moment of pleasure, for all you gore fans, but that is the extent. I hated almost every moment of it. It is not that the story so much is awful, it is the execution. And, the acting is not all that good either. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"People actually like this movie...?","review":"Let me start off by saying if you like true horror/zombie movies, then don't even bother watching this movie, it's a horror movie made for the mainstream, meaning it sucks.Sure the lead character is hot, sure there are some nice looking zombies in the movie...but thats where all the good stuff ends.The video game for the PS1 (and it's gamecube remake) are amazing, both in atmosphere and story telling, why the movie didn't follow them more closely is beyond me. Instead you get some horrible story about a computer and the t-virus (which is the only thing in the entire movie from the games, that and the spider-man creature).Paul W.S. Anderson should not be allowed to make movies ever again, he is a stain on hollywood that needs to be cleaned away."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not deserve the name resident evil.","review":"When it came out in theaters i was a bit apprehensive but i got the courage to see it, well i was sad it SUCKED to the core. resident evil games rule cause of the darkness, storyline, creatures like my fav tyrants, spiders, alexia, steve and birkin.where was leon, claire, jill and chris.Instead they got a stick to play some drugged Alice. A licker as the main boss lol, yeah right lickers arent hard to kill in the games!!.

P.S IM REALLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better video game movies","review":"Yeah this movie is terrible. This film relies completely on those slit second scare tactics. Where it's really quite one second and then there's a loud noise which usually turns out to be nothing. When there is something, such as a zombie, it's not scary. The zombies are very boring. They stumble slowly to their victims. They're so frail you'd think they could just be pushed over. Which is how it is in the 'Resident Evil' video game. Which is why this game never should have been made into a film. I do like the games but the plot just isn't strong enough for the big screen. If they want to make a scary game into a movie they should have chosen 'Silent Hill.' It's not so corny. Not all video game movies are completely stupid. 'Tomb Raider' managed to faithfully bring Lara Croft to the big screen and actually improve her image. Sorry Capcom, 'Street Fighter' failed and so did 'Resident Evil.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I was waiting anxiously for this movie to be released and I am now wondering why. This was absolutely the worst movie I've seen in years. It is a mish-mosh of totally irrelevant scenarios and I, being a fan of horror for years, lost interest in the first fifteen minutes.

First of all, Resident Evil as a game was scary and had lots of gore and blood. As a movie that was rated \\"R\\", it didn't even stand up to the video game in that aspect. The movie should have been PG-13. Come on! This is supposed to be RESIDENT EVIL, not Scooby Doo! The Blair Witch was scarier AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN SEE THE WITCH!

Not many names were mentioned in the movie except for Rain, but this was definetely one of those edge of your seat type movies. I stayed tense through the whole movie and I normally don't get scared or jumpy through any movie. Definetly good if you want to be scared. The plot was real good in the beggining, but it went downhill from there, mostly because it was confusing and didn't make much sense and the end left you hanging in a most unpleasent way, which is why I didn't give it five stars.

It was a damn good film that was true to the game in ways, yet original in others. Some people have said that the acting wasn't too good. I disagree. Milla and Michelle gave great performances, but my favorite character in the whole movie was Matt (Eric Mabius). I mean c'mon, he becomes the Nemesis for crying out loud. True, he didn't play a big part, but it was excellent nonetheless. The zombies could've been better, but what can ya do? It coulda been gorier, but again, what can ya do?

However, this is a pretty good movie. (Not to mention Mila Naked) It lacked something along the way, and the super creature zombies [were bad].

Definately worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milla kicks!","review":"I've never played the game, and quite frankly, had no expectations for this movie at all. The friends I took to the movie with me had played all the games, and I myself was a fan of the lead actress Milla Jovovich ever since 'The 5th Element.' What surprised my friends and I about this movie was, even though it is basically a slasher flick, I got scared! They built up suspense through thoughtful story telling, and the characters were not obnoxious teenie boppers obessed with sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. If you're into action or horror movies, you'll like this. Don't expect depth, just fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"paul w.s.anderson you SUCK","review":"what have they done to resident evil this movie is crap the story is so basic it reminds me of zombie 3 but edleast that was funny this is not even funny its just dull. resident evil the game kicked ass it was scery and the zombies looked cool they wer roting and looked dead but the zombies in the film wer just guy's with white face paint on and normaly when a zombie bits someone it draws BLOOD not in this film the zombies seem to like liking guys heads just whach the scene when the guy gets draged in to the lift and the CGI in this film is worse than the spawn movie.George A. Romero was going to direct this movie he evan had is own script and iv red it and it was much beter than this crap film and paul anderson thinks he is going to direct alien VS predator i hope he dosent coz he SUCKS he hasont done one good film ever paul anderson dont quit yor day job coz you SUCK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch","review":"This BD has great video and audio quality. The story is just, ok. Seems the story has been done before, govt experiments unleash a killer virus, kills then brings you back to life, this time we dont stop it. This movie I think is the best of the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good showing of high definition","review":"First off, let me say this. I love the Resident Evil movies, almost as much as the first 3 games. That being said let me best describe my review in a short but concise way as to why I gave it 2 stars.I have this movie on DVD as well. I have an upscaling DVD player. My upscaled DVD version of this movie looks almost exactly the same as the supposed High Definition Blu Ray version using a PS3 on a Sharp Aquos 1080p LCD TV. I don't know the reason behind the lack of fidelity and image clarity, but honestly, except to say you have the Blu Ray version with the rest (I got the 2nd movie for free in that 5 free movies deal), go with upscaled DVD. The sound quality is better on BluRay, but not so much better it warrants buying the Blu Ray over the regular DVD movie.Heck, I saw it on TV on an HD channel and it looked the same, that is, nothing special.So it looks ok, but don't expect superb quality, and instead expect a lot of graininess."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You're all going to die down here.\\"","review":"This movie had me going for a while. At first I thought that they would base is on the acclaimed capcom resident evil. Thought that they would base it on the frist game in the series. If you really wanna know where it fits in the series, it's sort of like a prequel to the events that unfolded. The mansion in the movie is not the one in the game. It takes place at a different mansion but takes place during the first game. This movie left me shocked most of the time what with the countless surprises and consistant 'have to hurry' flow. It's the perfect begining to kick off the series. The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is becuase the zombie effects could've been a littl better. But, other than that, that's all. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY UNDERATED","review":"I can not figure out why for the life of me why this movie was considered bad. It was awesome. The zombies were cool. It had a killer sound track. A WAY above average story for a zombie flik, excellent pacing and cool mutant things.The only thing I disliked this movie was because jill sometimes did karate on the zombies and on one point ran up a wall. But its only a minor flaw. BUY IT TODAY. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Resident Evil-best movie!! Hope people see it for a sequel!!","review":"I would have to say that Resident Evil is the best movie that has came out recently so far. I hope the rates go up so the fans of the game itself can be able to see the sequel. The story made up was awesome, <b>at most</b>, it didn't have changes within clothes, uniform, STORYLINE, and not to mention the NAMES LIKE T-Virus, etc. I hope more fans take in view of this real awesome movie and makes its boost towards the roof...."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE EVER","review":"Man this is a great movie. Its got action and nudity. Milla jovovich naked for 3 sec. its worth in. And this is a great movie anyway.

I loved this movie. Had I not known better, I wouldn't have known that this was a game first. I was confused to the first minute, but so was everyone, I think. Right after that the movie progressed in a confortable manner, not to mention startling every five minutes. I now want to learn more about the Resident Evil world.

But \\"Resident Evil\\" still satisfies the most important movie requirement - it's fun. It's designed for the same audience that enjoys hack & slash video games, and in that regard, it succeeds totally. I suspect the critics who can't understand this are the same ones who actually think trivial pop-culture [movies] like \\"American Beauty\\" really do deserve Best Picture awards..."},{"rating":"1","title":"All wrong! This movie makes the game look BAD!","review":"In one word, HORRIBLE!

I admit, it was cool to see a bunch of infected zombies walkin around eating people, but the background of the movie was horrible. The entire first 45 minutes were the most boring 45 minutes of any movie. it gets better, but the zombies arent scary at all and it just needs more suspense. the entire movie was a sinch to predict. Thats what makes it bad. If you go to see a horror movie and you can predict when there will be a zombie at every turn, its not gonna be that scary. the graphics were ok, but it just didnt have that \\"ew >:-(\\" and \\"ahhhhhhhh <=-0\\" like the game. the point i'm trying to make is that the 2nd R.E. movie is gonna need a lot of work to get a good rating from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y'know what? You ain't miss'n much here...","review":"I'm reviewing this movie because after renting it (thank god!), I had a very good mental vision of how cool this action/horror slasher flick would be, little did I know that dissapointment was just around the corner...I mean, wow, they really screwed up here with one of Playstation's most popular video games in history.I wanted blood, but there was barely ANY, what were they thinking? Resident Evil is all about the blood 'n the zombies, which mind you, not EVEN ONE get's it's head blown off, which is how you kill them idiots! No wonder Alice's team suffered so much! The most redeeming, interesting part of the movie is the way it tries to give suspense and surprise, it fails on some levels to say the least but it is the best feature.The way the movie ends is stupid too, it basically ENDS where it should've BEGUN, thus resulting to a tiresome sequel that may I say was a total flop!Might be pleasing to some, but I've seen better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real bone movie!","review":"Yeah it's geared to teenie boppers... And that's who'll probably like it till they get to see some real zombie flicks!In my top 5 worst movies ever.

Just look at the previews, even they look like a disaster. Why make an action film this bad and THEN give it a theatrical release? Still curious? Here is the movie in a nutshell, its a very simple formula folks: throw in every tired action/horror/scifi film cliche, add an annoying heavy metal music soundtrack, base the 'plot' on a boring/simplistic computer game (kill the zombie, find a key, open the door using the key, repeat), add plenty of gore and a hoochie female lead and mix. What do you get? A wasted evening at the theatre and a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resident Dreadful","review":"So far the worst film of the young millennium, \\"Resident Evil,\\" based on the video game series, is sheer torture for all of its 100 minutes. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about it whatsoever. The only frightening parts of this wreck are the dreadful script, the haggard plot (people blast a bunch of zombies while trying to shut down a supercomputer in an underground lab), and weak acting by equally weak actors. Milla Jovovich is a far cry from Angelina Jolie as a respectable female action hero, no matter how hard the media tries to incite a rivalry between them. If you were foolish enough to actually pay money to watch this, then immediately go home and cleanse your soul with the superior \\"Tomb Raider.\\" Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not scary but pretty fun","review":"I went to see this film when it first came out and I was syked since I love the video game. I was wanting to be scared to death but that didn't happen. I didn't even get a shiver. The film is done as a action film, not a thriller so don't expect to piss your pants in fear. The action scenes are decent and the gore level is up there...some of the CGI is a little corny but Jovovich is enough to make you forgive the defects of the film. It's fun and entertaining while not living up to the hype I placed on it. I give it four stars because for what it is, an action film with a beautiful star, it pulls through. It just doesn't have the same feel the video game has...it doesn't do the game justice in that respect. But if you want to see a bunch of people shooting zombies and rabbid dogs then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad for an action flick","review":"I'm a fan of different genres of film generally. So as far as this type of genre is concerned, I have to say that it's a pretty decent action flick as long as you're not looking for anything with substance. Good effects and fight/action sequences. For those I definitely appreciated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, but noting like the games","review":"this movie has been torn apart by viewers and critics and i just cant stand it! this movie wasnt that bad! its got great music (not the slipknot crap but the instrumental pieces are great!) one thing i was disapointed about was the complete story change from the game to this! its practically noting like it except for the fact of flesh eating zombies. if this film was based on the novel by S.D. Perry it would have been amazing but they decided to go original. its still a great movie but i just wish it was based on the novelization done for the first game! the thing i was very happy with was the ending. its not sad but its not good. its got the perfecvt lead off to a sequel. i only hope its based off of either resident evil 2 or resident evil 3: nemesis. if so, its gonna rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Teen Fare","review":"I was quite disappointed with this movie. The music is high quality teen fare (the youngsters seemed to like it). Don't have high expectations of the film however if you are a hard core horror/sci-fi fan. This is no \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" or \\"Evil Dead\\". Wait for the cable release - there is nothing in this film that can't be shown on cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Horror-Entertainment","review":"Thanks to some bad critics I didnt expect to much and so I was very suprised, how good that movie is. Forget Tomb Raider. Up to now this is the best videogame to theatres adaption I saw. Thrilling, stylish, chilling. Okay, some of the actors played far better in other flicks (Michelle Rodriguez acts horrible in some szenes, and some cuts are not always logical) but still it grabs you. For gamers it finally opens the whole story and Anderson proves that after \\"Event Horizon\\" he is still able to direct some fast paced sci-fi-horror entertaiment. Not enough a \\"Zombie\\" Movie? Who cares. Take some popcorn and enter this bone-chilling Hitech-thrillride that will give you the adrenaline-rush you expect. Also a big A for the atmopsphere that hits the Game-Feeling perfectly. Cant wait for \\"RE2:Nemesis\\"....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resident Evil","review":"I watched most of it then skipped to the end.The beginning was promising- the special op type guys were cool & professional-especially their commander. Some of the special effects were cool. But all in all I was disappointed. Perhaps if I were better aquainted with the video game I may have enjoyed it more.

It focuses on horror, suspense, gore, big guns, and the occassional naked Jojovich. I watched this movie on a whim, expecting it to be horrible drek. After all, it's based on a computer game (which I've never played) and the previews were AWFUL. However, against all odds, I found myself absolutely LOVING this movie. Great beginning, great suspense, great pacing, great soundtrack, and a great ending that keeps on giving you more just when you're afraid it's over. Let's put it this way: I have a little under 200 movies in my collection, and this has just become one of my favorites. This is not intellectual or deeply moving -- but it is fun as heck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resident Evil UMD Review","review":"Ok, If you are a die hard original RE fan you should really go see this movie.. Although it does not stick to the original story line as in the Playstation version of the game, It does however touch on some of the events. I rated it 4 stars only because I thought If they actually sticked with the original story, they would have made for a really good movie. You know.. Creeping around an old Mansion and finding trap doors and having zombies fly out at you.. Im so addicted to the original game.. that it is somewhat sad.. The game just rocks..Anyways, getting back to the movie, if you love zombie movies and played alot of Resident Evil.. this is a must see... It's definetly filled with action and gives you more of an idea on how the T-VIRUS came about, and how evil the Umbrella Corporation can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"BEFORE THIS MOVIE CAME OUT I HAD HIGHLY ANTICIPATED TO BE A GREAT MOVIE, BUT IT SUCKED SO BAD AND IT WAS STUPID THE GRAPHICS WERE HORRIBLE IVE SEEN SCARY MOVIES FROM THE 70'S THAT HAS BETTER SPECIAL EFFECTS THAN THIS CRAP.

If not, maybe there will a special...If the movie stinks, then the soundtrack won't. After all, they did get new tracks from Slipknot and Static X.Either way, let's pray this won't stink.

SUPERBIT is supposed to represent the top of the line and best image quality a DVD can achieve and many times those DVDs are actually reference DVDs. Well, the quality in this SUPERBIT edition of RESIDENT EVIL is so so, not bad not good, just like any other DVD. It certainly does not do justice to the SUPERBIT term. Other DVDs that honor the SUPERBIT name are the FIFTH ELEMENT and THE BIG HIT version but this version is nothing to talk about. It is not as terrible as the other SUPERBIT DVD or Charlie's Angels but if you are buying this DVD for reference or video quality purposes look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best science fiction movie of our generation","review":"I was sceptical of this film, like everyone else out there. But having been a fan of the brilliant and acclaimed Capcom game series, I gave it a shot. MY GOD. The story, the acting, the effects, the pace of the whole works...all incredible. The film's slow build-up sets an eerie, haunting atmosphere that has an interesting undercurrent of what could go wrong in this nation over the next decade or so, if we let it go on. While Jovavich is again subpar in her mediocere tough-girl acting skills, the gorgeous Michelle Rodrigeuz is a wonder to behold. This movie, disturbing and dark, upsetting but intriguing, is a trans-gender shocker that took my breath away, and the plot was complex and kept you guessing until the end. It also lacked predictability, thankfully. I can't wait until the sequel!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RE review","review":"OK I have to start by saying that RE is my all time favorite video game series hands down, it kicks A$$.

Well, there's always that upcoming sequel..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice movie with style","review":"This movie some how follows the plot of the PS game Resident Evil. It talks about how a syndicate turns into zombie and Milla Jovovich has to find out what has happen. It has many scary scenes and most of them got me. Milla is stylish in this movie that has [awesome] fight moves. The special effects are cool as well. Overall, it is an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best video game adapted to a movie","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at how solid this movie was.

I even noticed similar sound effects and background music at certain points of the movie!For all of you Resident Evil fans out there, go see it! You won't be disappointed!

This film is great, many references to the game. Many zombie scenes. The zombies look great, even build more on them then the game ever did.

The film takes place before the events in the first game and ends right in the middle of 2/3. Zombie infested Raccoon City is also seen, as well as the origin and identity of Nemesis!

Milla Jovovich gives an excellent performance and proves that she has what it takes to carry off the lead in an action movie.While the storyline stuck with the games very well, it also was done in a way to entertain anyone who has never played the games. The action starts at the beginning and lasts to the end, leaving you gasping for breath and begging for more. Some scenes actually had the audience applauding at their conclusions.I so hope for a sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"-Good-Resident Evil in my opinion was a great movie. I enjoyed the plot, characters, and effects. The zombies looked very realistic and the movie was very creative.-Bad-The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because in the begininng I found the plot a little hard to follow. As movie went on I stared to understand it more.-Overall-If you watch this movie (which you should) make sure to pay close attention in the begining 10 - 20 minutes otherwise you may get a little lost.

This is a good radio, I have used it outdoors, indoors, and have taken it camping many times. The only issue I have is with the volume control, after about a year the volume control got to the point where it was no longer linear. As you turn the volume control the volume goes up and down, it does not get gradually louder or softer as with most volume controls.

I have a copy of their earlier collection, Nomad, which is one of the best New Surf releases ever. This doesn't compare. I got this CD expecting a more subdued atmosphere with a little mystery and espionage thrown in. Unfortunately, they sound like a bad Vegas Lounge act. I should know, I live in Vegas.

And the book started out along that track. Easy to read and lively and with lots of examples. The big problem I have with the book (and I only made it to hour 12 before I had to quit) is that there is no way for the reader to practice and learn the concepts in the book. There aren't any practice exercises or drills. There are screen dumps of code, but I didn't find the examples useful since I was looking for web-based applications rather than more mathematical types of examples. The examples also get very big and complex early on in the book. Experienced programmers will probably be able to follow along, but then they might not be buying this book in the first place. I'm still looking for a good, step-by-step way to learn Python."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written for a beginner book","review":"What I like: - Easy to understand. The author did a good job. - Casual writing style. (You learn a thing or two about Zen.) - Includes enough ref info on its topics, but not too detailed/technical.What I don't like: the editorial works. - Sample codes/output are presented as computer screen dumps. The color (gray scale) is hard to read, and characters are small. - The book description touts CGI as one of the book topics, but it's only covered lightly and briefly to add much value. - Chapter/hour 1 and 2 should be combined as 1. Too brief & too light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need an Aneurysm, this book should do the trick...","review":"...this book is garbage, and that's exactly where the book is now. In the garbage. The author needs to go back to school and get educated in the english language. He is very knowledgable in programming, he lacks the ability to put his thoughts in english that others can understand. He stops his thought half way through sentences. He has run on sentences, typo's, combined with the fact that he NEVER explains a single piece of code in the book completely, he famous lines in the book are \\"we'll discuss that later\\" which never happens, and \\"do you remember this?\\" NO, BECAUSE YOU NEVER EXPLAINED IT!!! Very frustrating, and i'm an undergrad student that has been punching out code in Java for 3 years, and I'm totally lost, how is that possible? 2 simple words for this book, don't bother.

Chun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"Although the book claims to be written for the novice programmer, I don't think it is really suited to such a reader. Throughout the book, the author introduces things without explanation. This is particularly a problem with the code samples. Most of the code in the book is taken from other projects that the author had worked on and is often not very illustrative of the points he is trying to make. Also, much of the code has parts that are unexplained. If I had not already been familiar with a few other languages, I don't think I could have followed this book at all.Finally, although Python is often used for text processing tasks like sys admin, cgi, etc., almost all the examples in this book revolve around calendrical calculations. Maybe fascinating for the author, but agonizingly dull for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended...","review":"This book looked good when I started reading it, and even though I read through the whole thing and learned a few concepts about OO and Python it is definetly not a beginner's book.

One thing i will say for this book is that the chapters on Tcl/Tk were quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"You are better off reading the help and intro files at the python website than buying this book. There are numerous times where code is not explained and you have to figure things out more so than you would expect from a book that costs you money.Though you can understand what the program does, the actual meanings of script and calls are left unexplained; this book lacks the precision needed to explain programming and obscures a simple and powerful language like python. This book could not possibly teach you python in 24 hours, nor will it do anything but confuse and frustrate the inexperienced programmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books teaching Python","review":"1.

The language seemed a bit clumsy and not that well thought out. The man's voice sounds like he's trying to be soothing, but it's not working. He also talks in the beginning about your skull and your heart in a very biological way--not terribly relaxing visualizations. It actually made me a little tense. He also kept saying to relax over and over...maybe it's just me, but I think it should be done more subtly--if telling someone to relax was all it took, we'd all be a lot more relaxed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this CD thinking was going to be better than others I have tried but simply to me is not.

That would be \\"Give Me It.\\" That's what sounds like a constipated chicken. Robert Smith is like \\"ahhhhoooo\\" and \\"rawkkkkk\\" and \\"SCREAMING FOR LOVE, SCREAMING FOR AIR\\" which is exactly what you hear from a constipated farm animal.

I don't care for that one and it's the reason I only gave this album 4 instead of 5 stars. My favorite tracks are Dressing Up, Empty World, Wailing Wall and The Top. Those are some of my very favorite Cure tracks and I never tire of listening to them. I'm not terribly fond of the bonus disc on this one either. I think it's less interesting than the previous ones.

The album touches a nerve that few artists dare to go near. Feel the pain! Love it! Embrace it! Don't be afraid. \\"The Top\\" is for all of us freaks out there who can't relate to what the rest of the world is doing. Don't miss \\"Piggy in the Mirror\\", \\"Give Me It\\", etc. This is not the \\"incoherent\\" album the critics touted. This is real, unadulterated pain and angst set to music. NOT TO BE MISSED.

I see these things all the time (i.e. slouched posture, mouth resting open.) More importantly he tells you how to change your own style in case this is not something your parents taught you.

She singlehanded brought dance music back from the disco backlash. Even without much promotion and a unofficial single that got some radio airplay (Spotlight), the album still managed to go platinum and peak at #14. Yes, #14 is low for Madonna, but this is not a studio album.A must-own for any fan of 80's dance music. Shep Pettibone specially remixed every song for this collection (so those of you who have the 12\\" to Everybody, this is a different mix).

This version has become the accepted standard version. \\"where's the party\\" is amped up into a funky party anthem with more power than the orginal. The rest of the remixes are only average and for some mysterious reason we're given pointless dubbed versions of some of the songs already on this album instead of remixes of other songs.

YOU CAN DANCE !! I dint buy this cd till 1998, But I had the casette that was given to me, I love how all the song's are blended in one after another. I really like Spotlight, how she sing's ( DONT BE AFRAID TO FALL- ILL HEAR YOU WHEN YOU CALL AND ILL BE BY YOUR SIDE) I like that line. Anyway its a good album. sounds good especially for its era 1987-88. And who ever sais its a a flop do to its sales world wide is screwed up in the head!! It did good for its time, now at 1.7 million copies in the U.S soon to be double platinum. 5 million WWD. so what thats good. Look who followed Paula Abdul,Jennifer lopez and now Mariah Carey.

It's a great blast from the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Dance","review":"If you already have her first three albums, there is no good reason to get this other than if you want the one new song, Spotlight. Spotlight is a fun ditty, but you can decide if you want to pay for all the other songs along with it. I thought that the extended dance remixes of her hit songs would be new and fresh, but really they are the same songs, just spread over six minutes. The one exception is the version of Over and Over, which does have a different sound.

It has two failry massive screws that are several inches long that would not \\"bite\\" wallboard and even plywood blocking.While it is very flexible with the swing arm, rotation and tilt adjustments we are finding the tilt mechanism a bit challenged by the Panasonic's 16 pound weight -- in spite of the 30 pound rated maximum of the bracket. Even when the tilt screw is tightened with a reasonable amount of force, you can cause the TV to drop further if you bump it lightly. It's not clear why this is occurring -- and its not an issue if you handle the TV carefully as you move it about -- but I would be skeptical that you could keep the tilt on a heavier TV if you used this bracket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality!

He skillfully supports all of his claims fairly unlike Bard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly bias overview. Cannot recommend it","review":"When I bought this book, I did it because I was curious if someone has actually managed to reduce the Middle East conflict to something the average person can absorb without taking sides. I was completely disappointed!! This book may present some facts, but when it comes to behind the scenes analysis, it will automatically assume the Israeli side. In covering certain crucial events that have impacted the course of history in the region, the authors will make attempts to present the Israeli justifications with no or little reference to the bias sources. If you are new to learning about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, this source is NOT it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving","review":"The book tries to deceive the reader into convincing him it is fair, but at the same time it makes one side to be the side always to blame (Palestinians) while the other is just calm peaceful doves (Israel) who are just victims and did nothing wrong to anyone! From the progress of events since 1948, and the long history before that year, this is clearly not the case, and thus the book is completely biased and odd-handed (as compared to even-handed!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is so nice to know.","review":"The middle east has been a crazy episode in the world for so many years. It is difficult to understand why a piece of property smaller than almost every state in the US with less people then the 405 freeway at 4:00PM bothers so many Arabs. I do know for a fact that Israelis build hospitals and schools and Muslims blow them up.

The book also has the advantage of being fun to read, and really offering all the information in a way that even a person who has never heard of the conflict can learn all the basics fairly from one source.

Bard's a biased author to start with AND claiming the Palestinians are not native to the land even though they speak a unique Southern Levantine dialect is patently absurd.

Almost all of the historical myths in this book (example: that Israel defeated superior forces in 1948, that the Palestinians left voluntarily and were not ethnically-cleansed by Israel, etc.) have been totally repudiated especially by the legitimate Israel historians such as Benny Morris and AVI Shliam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter","review":"This is a very good starter for anyone wishing to learn about the battles over Israel. My one quibble is there could have been some better editing (I noticed a few typos) and he could have had more information on Arab and Muslim countries sooner in the book, and more of it. It tends cast the region's conflict in terms of how the region deals with Israel, and tends to give Israel more of the benefit of the doubt. For instance, I think he could be harder on the whole idea of the settlements. But I woulnd't accuse him of pro-Israel bias, as some of the clealry hate-filled reviewers below do. There is naturally going to be an appearance of bias in an unadorned account, because the Arabs have chosen political change through the murder of innocents. There is not moral equivalence. See the book \\"Right to Exist\\" for more on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bard shows partiality, not objectivity...","review":"I have been working with Palestinian Christians for five years now in their attempts to maintain dignity and a living wage in the face of the Israeli Occupation. This book does a disservice to their plight, painting a picture of pre-Israeli Palestine as a desolate, un-developed land and the Palestinians as unorganized southern Syrians with no sense of attachment to the land. Try telling this to the men and women who harvest olive trees that their ancestors planted 1,000 years ago. Read Munib Younan's book for a better firsthand account of what life is really like for the Arab peoples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Important Presentation of Israel's Case in Mid East","review":"This is a expansive case of Israel's case in the Middle East conflict. Often from the newspapers and media one might be unaware of the deep historic connection between the Jews and Israel. Arab propgandaists keep saying the Jews stole the Palestinians land and there is no connection of the Jews to the land. This book details the kings and prophets and judges and centuries of life in ancient Israel/Judea. And in modern times the struggles of the one Jewish state in the world - as opposed to over 20 Arab countries. It includes the attack at the start of 5 Arab armies on the modern state of Israel and the absolute rejection of the right of the Jews to their one state, where 650,000 Jews lived as of 1948 in British Palestine (not thieves of others land)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Objective history for beginning students!","review":"Why are all these countries whose names I can barely pronounce all of a sudden on the front page of my newspaper, day after day after day?

The section on the Deyr Yassin massacre is truly pathetic. And the description of the events surrounding the downing of an Iranian civilian airbus by the USS Vincennes in 1988 is so completely inaccurate and totally contrary to the facts (as established by a joint Newsweek and Nightline investigation, a BBC investigation, and the ICAO investigation) that I literally thought this was a work of fiction. With Daniel Pipes as a consultant, what can you expect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"The extremity of opinions presented evident here shows that the book was anything but unbiased.

It almost convinced me that the arab people where violent sadistic people, while Israel had always done its best to help palestinians. Even when Israel had to force palestinians into leaving their homes, it was a necessary thing to do. Before buying this book, I strongly suggest for you to read the author's background. Its funny that they would choose a powerfull jewish activist instead of someone more neutral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for a Complete Idiot's Guide; VERY Biased","review":"While I realize it's hard not to be biased about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I think we all expect the Complete Idiot's Guide series to be more factual & even-handed, rather than grossly opinionated. Mr Bard gives no voice to the Palestinian or humanist sides of things.If you want to learn more about this subject - along with all of the Middle East, I'd recommend The Middle East for Dummies. This writer gives both sides of the story and reminds me of the diversity and plain sense of \\"just wanting to get by\\" that everyone in the world shares.Also, note that many of the reviewers for this book (as well as the Dummies book) are very biased themselves - just check out their other reviews. It's pretty shocking. Example: Jill Malter - she lists herself as a \\"zionist\\" on her profile. How do you think that affects her opinions here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This is an extremely biased and misleading book. Arabs are portrayed as being belligerent and religiously barbaric, while the Israelis are shown to be innocently in search of peace and at all costs willing to compromise. The core issues that sparked the ongoing Middle East conflict in the early part of the 20th century are conveniently distorted; which reflect Dr. Bard's anti-Arab views."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Biased Opinion","review":"I read the book as an American trying to understand the motivations behind 9-11. I figured that a book on Middle Eastern Conflict would provide me with a broad summary. I soon realized that almost the entire book focused on Jewish history with Israeli/Arab conflict as a sub plot. Bard's account of this history is very one-sided. I am no historian, however, any \\"complete idiot\\" can see in this conflict there are no innocent sides as Bard portrays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liars","review":"All of you guys who are kicking and screaming that the book is biased yet you're definitely not pro-palistinian should wake up and smell the coffee.

Deny it all you want but shame on YOU for being so biased and slanted.To all of you open-minded and honest readers out there: the book has tons of information, all true may i add, and makes it easy and enjoyable to read through such a heavy topic. Then you decide who is right or wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Propaganda","review":"I was excited to find an easy to read and comprehensive text on the complicated problems of the Middle East but was soon discouraged. I honestly began the book with neutral feelings about the conflict. However the book is so blatantly biased toward the Isreali point of view it destroys the credibility of the author and \\"Idiot\\" books in general. It could have been authored by the Isreali government as far as I could tell. My copy is being returned to the publisher. It was that bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I figured that with all the books out there on comparative history, that the Complete Idiot's Guide would at least provide an objective look at this centuries old conflict. The first couple of chapters were somewhat informative (in a very basic kind of way) on the histories of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Unfortunately, that is where the objectivity died.This book is an excellent source on the history of the conflict from the Jewish perspective. I blame myself for not reviewing the author's biography before purchasing it. The bias can easily be found there.I hold no partiality for any of the three religions discussed in the book. I simply wanted an unbiased summary of the conflict. You will not find that in this book. It took everything I had to simply finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read, but extremely informative and fair!","review":"While this book is fun to read, it actually delves deeply into the issues at the heart of the conflict. Bard has done his homework and presented an objective and fair look at sensitive topics. This book is an excellent guide for those trying to determine whether what they read in the papers is based on fact or propaganda. Would make a great gift for college students and for those interested in the Middle East, no matter what their level of expertise.

The LP and cassette tape are sitting without a tape deck or record player to play those on, so it's time to buy the CD.

I discovered new favorites and found myself singing the tunes long after the CD had finished playing. The lyrics will keep you coming back, too.

Inspector Abeline (Depp) of the London police has stumbled onto a killer like no other he has ever encountered. A man that ritualistically and methodically hunts his victims and mutilates them in the most vicious manner. While most of London is shcoked by the killings, Abeline pursues him not only through the foggy streets of the city, but also through the intense bureaucracy of the London police force. While the plot is rather light the imagery is simply stunning. Intense (And gory) scenes of murder and Abeline's opium hallucinations shock the screen in a hazy red/green wash. While not altogether thrilling, it does offer a good sense of cinematographic inginuity."},{"rating":"2","title":"So creepy it's good!","review":"This 2 cd set has tons of features that will clue you in on the whole legend of Jack the Ripper.

Johnny Depp and his co-star was excellent in this film. I was so enrossed in this film., I missed making popcorn or eating any lunch. The scenes in White Chapel took care of my appetite.One thing that impressed me about this movie is that it was so accurate right down to the cockney accent of the street walkers.

Over the years, historians and mystery writters, fiction and non-fiction alike, have had to \\"fill in the gaps\\" where old Jack is concerned. Since there have been more books written about Jack the Ripper than any other serial killer in history, the task of out doing the previous movie producers and writters is not an easy one.

The extra bonus material is well worth having. Check out some of the Amazon sellers for GREAT prices if you already own the single disc version.I especially enjoyed seeing how accurate the scenes were from line drawings from police reports or newspapers of the time and from crude photographs depicting the murder sites. The brothers Hughes did an EXCELLENT job recreating late 19th century London's White Chapel district.I'm happy with this buy. The movie disc is exactly the one in the single disc version with the same bonuses which actually are pretty decent. The 2nd Disc is loaded with lots of interesting info on making the movie, \\"Ripper-ology\\", possible suspects, etc.John Rowin1ear"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Disappointing","review":"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is that the settings, costumes and atmosphere do a great job of evoking London at the time of Jack the Ripper. However, I found it unnecessary and disrespectful to the memory of Abberline to have him portrayed as a druggy and a \\"psychic\\". The facts are interesting enough; why this embellishment? To appeal to today's audience who seem to relish uncontrolled substances? It is my feeling that most serious Ripper fans would not only be disappointed in this film, but also find it a very poor depiction of everyone involved, including the prostitutes. They are much too \\"pretty\\" in this film. Filmakers seem adverse to portraying these poor, unfortunate ladies of the evening as the sorry alcoholic, sometimes toothless and very ill women that they were. But I guess audiences are more attracted to pretty faces then to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Alan Moore original","review":"As a fan of both Alan Moore and Jonny Depp, I was looking forward to this movie.

It is really an assinine, immature effort and a wonder that this made it out of editing in this state of hackneyed disconnect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Twist","review":"Overall a nice twist on the tale of Jack the Ripper. The film went in depth with what could have been the motive behind the 1888 slayings in Whitechapel. We will never know the true story, but From Hell delivers an explanation the plays well as both an enjoyable film and a stab at one of history's most notorious figures. Brutal, sad, and thought provoking. A definite recommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Blech","review":"This movie was so dissappointing. The whole movie annoyed me, but the most annoying part was the stupid background music that played all through the film. And it got louder and louder and louder! The \\"Ripper\\" theory was [weak] and I agree with other posters--BORING. Heather Graham's clipped British accent fails when all the other prostitutes have a cockney accent. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloodier version of \\"Murder By Decree\\"","review":"This film is not unique in that it is simply rehashing an old theory which first appeared on film with \\"Murder By Decree\\". Christopher Plummer played Sherlock Holmes, who discovered precisely what the druggie police inspector does in this film--that there is a momumental \\"conspiracy\\" afoot which seeks to get rid of the threat of an earth-shattering scandal. The only difference in terms of plot is that the inspector becomes involved with one of the Ripper's intended victims. Otherwise, the only difference is that there is more blood and gore in this version, along with much more detail depicting the seedy side of the oft-romanticized Victorian era. Though I am by no means a \\"Ripperologist\\", I was still disappointed. Stick with the classic (and might I add, original), folks; it will be out on DVD in 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torturous","review":"While this film looks really nice and the camerawork is relatively impressive, it is finally a failure in filmmaking. By no fault of either the Hughes Brothers or Johnny Depp - the only mystery here is how such a talented group of people made a film like this. It isn't enough that the Jack the Ripper story has already been done in so many ways that it has ceased to be interesting, but here the identity of the ripper is telegraphed to the audience at such an early point in the film that it is laughable - like a Scooby Doo cartoon almost. Additionally, it's difficult to suspend disbelief at times - espescially when confronted with Heather Graham's rosy cheeked and milky complected prostitute - who shows her connection to the grotty and filthy streets she inhabits by her perfect straight white teeth and a smudge of dirt on her face. Ultimately a failure, but perhaps worth a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Hell","review":"I have always been fascinated, and a little bit freaked out, by the jack the ripper story. Johnny Depp carries off his part of inspector abberline with accuracy and believability.

Indeed, the legend of Jack the Ripper is interesting to study, and this film brings the story to life on the silver screen as well as to your home on DVD. The Hughes Bros. give the story itself a new twist while staying true to the historical aspects of the story. And playing up on one of the theories actually DOES NOT take away from this epic horror film. In fact, the theory they play upon is the theory I believe was the actual truth. The DVD has a wealth of behind-the-scenes information as well as information on the case and the several theories that have flown around since that grizzly fall of 1888! A worthy entry into the DVD collection!

He's a terrific actor but he just doesn't cut it as a opium smoking Inspector Frederick Abberline. He's too young and frankly, if Abberline was this weird he wouldn't have lasted on the force. Heather Graham is completely out of her depth. She looks wrong for the part, (How many street walkers look this healthy and pretty?) can't do the accent and can't act.

Definitely recommended for mystery and suspense buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"from hell and back, what a ride!","review":"I went and saw this in the theatre over the weekend. I can't say I've heard such a quiet audience, completely enrapured in the screen images. Johnny Depp is an intuitive inspector, assigned to the heinous crimes comitted against the \\"Unfortunate Women\\" of a seedy London Neighborhood. To bad about that Heroin addiction that caused him to chase the dragon until the end. Heather Graham plays Mary, one of the last victims of the man who gave birth to the 20th century. I won't include any spoilers, but the last 30 minutes are of course the best. I was swept in the emotion of the moments, and felt pity for the man who caused all of this mayhem. Please DO NOT take your children to see this movie, there are several graphic images. Although they are few and far between, each one is a vignette of bloody tragedy. This is more suspense than it is thriller, and it is sure to be one of those movies you watch on a chilly night, wrapped up close to someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Period Piece","review":"I thought From Hell was very good. I think Johnny Depp is one of the best actors of our time. The costumes and atmosphere were done really well. It really made me feel that this is what this dark and dirty place was really like.

Although the MPAA forced the directors to go easy on the gory details of the Ripper's killings, the facts are here, more or less intact, and most of the major theories are represented as well Johnny Depp is excellent and, surprisingly, Heather Grahahm is also very strong, this being her first period piece.The movie has a laconic, dreamy feeling, and is pretty intoxicating. The movie isn't as scary as it could probably be, but there are many ghastly, gruesome moments that had the audience flinching, I recommend it highly, especially on the big screen when all the beautiful cinematography and direction show through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous violence","review":"The premise for this movie is facinating, and it could have been outstanding.

Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly as a beautiful, healthy and charming street hooker. This alone should tell you that the Hughes brothers aren't even trying to make a remotely accurate film.

(Also visually stunning is Johnny Depp as the inspector). The cinematography was outstanding. This is a very interesting take on the Jack the Ripper murders, and seemed quite credible, probably because of the attention to detail for the period. There are some gory bits, although I did not feel these were gratuitous due to the subject matter of the film...however, I don't recommend this film for anyone who is a bit squeamish.

Many call this film the best looking film in a decade, and I agree. I do however, have a few greviances. For the most part, this a truly accurate depiction of the Jack the Ripper killings (such as murder sites, body locations, detecitves, some suspects, etc.) but the ending is not accurate. I am not going to give it away for those who have not seen it, but It is very innacurate. I do realize that this was adapted from a graphic novel, but I at least expected the Hughes brothers to change it for the movie, because, after all, it is a very major detail.

I wouldn't have been so appalled by this...if his film hadn't been as witless, pointless and thoroughly demeaning as it was. The best I can say about the \\"creative geniuses\\" is their DP did a good job.Concerning the rest of the film, Johnny Depp puts in his typical bland performance, Heather Graham attempts an Irish/UK accent, and HOW BLOODY OBVIOUSLY CAN THE KILLER BE IN THIS VERSION!

It doesn't, it does what most films on the story do, which is to add in barmy and bizarre conspiracy theory for the sake of sensation and to make the terror and horror a entertainment factor.The story is not entertainment, it's the worse kind of tragic conclusion to wasted and abused lives and that should be the message of any film exploring it's continued mesmer.The victims are as much abused by this kind of inhuman exploitation as they were when they lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is like watching something that came FROM HELL","review":"um.......i like johnny depp. I like heather graham. theyre both great actors especially johnny depp. But what in tha hell where they thinking when they stared in this catastrophy of a movie.

The casting itself is passable with Heather Graham, and Depp and Holm have good chemistry together; however, the only truly believable characters were the whores themselves...derelicts of society who use their womanhood as their livelihood- constantly striving for absolution from their sentences to poverty, only receiving it in horrific deaths.The DVD comes full of extras for the die-hard fan (as DVDs should): commentary, featurettes, deleted scenes. In my opinion, however, the \\"deleted scenes\\" are actually \\"deleted shots\\" since most last no more than a few seconds.Overall, it's too much of a \\"whodunit\\" pipe-dream. Ol' Jack would have turned his nose up at a tale that is so uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost opportunity","review":"This looks and sounds wonderful and the performances are top-notch (with the exception of the woefully miscast Robbie Coltrane and Heather Graham). How unfortunate that it's marred by a plodding script which wanders into over-complicated conspiracy theories, and direction which only momentarily rises to the pitch of terror required by the subject. In a genre where anticipation and payoff are the key requirements, interest here is quickly lost. That this film is so close to being good makes it all the more disappointing. Recast a few characters and cut 20 pages from the script, and it would have been a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good movie","review":"The movie is definately not a good movie!

And Jack the Ripper wasn't caught and nobody knows who he is. Johnny Depp is his usual best but even he can't save this weak film.

Jack the Ripper is one of the most gory and horrifying peroids in London's history and a great subject for a movie.Unfortunately this treatment fails on all levels. Despite a good cast the acting is consistently terrible and even though there are some creepy scenes I felt I was watching an Andrew Lloyd Webber production.I couldn't tell if this was supposed to be a comedy or a gothic drama or a horror movie.

From Hell","review":"This has got to be one of Johnny Depps best performances and one of the best horror films made in the past ten years. Being a lover of special effects and Hollywood gore I'd say this is a must for any Horror and Depp fan. The one draw back of the film is the female lead played by Heather Graham, a completely one-dimensional character. If you are looking for a love story within this horrific theme you will be disappointed. The sparks of lust fly but never ignite.One of the most interesting and charismatic films of 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Hell","review":"Good Movie but I think it should have had a better ending but I guess they wanted to make it more to what really happend in real life. even will the ending I enjoy it.. it was good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good!","review":"What a great movie!

The cinematography is wonderful and lush. The leads fare well but could have been recast with unknowns or more believable actors. It has a nice easy pacing and creative/modern editing, but it lacks in story. Although, we follow Jack the Ripper anonymously until the end (good choice), I feel that they should have left his character at more of a mystery since no one really knows who he was anyway. Ian Holm is wonderful and his acting is well worthy of the film's dark and and haunting look. The Extra DVD is loaded with cool stuff, including a fascinating look at Absinthe.... ****stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Simplification","review":"I regret having to write a criticism of a fellow Unitarian's efforts on an all too important subject. The title of \\"Learning to be White...\\" leads one to believe that the issue discussed is, indeed, racism. When, in fact, Thandeka does little more than use race and racial references describing the human tendency to hang out with the \\"tribe\\". Whether the subjects of her study are white, black, hispanic, or other tribal thinking people, the issues of moving outside one's own social group are the same. Black kids bringing home white friends suffer the same shame and threat of abandonment that white kids do. Jewish, Catholic, Italian, Christian; every group who thinks that they have a lock on the good and right life feels threatened by outside strange influences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Scholarship","review":"Having read this volume twice, I conclude that the author has joined a series of book reports together and ignored primary sources.

I only reccomend this to people who are sure they arent going to want get all JD cds or people who are collectors. Other than that, the Cd is excellent. But, the Cd I reccomend for an introduction is the cd, Still.

At times this album seems over produced, but the flow, and humor of the lyrics make this album an excellent experience.

Then Roger releases my favorite album of 06 \\"The Land of Pure Imagination\\". So naturally when I found out about TV Eyes from his site, I was interested.As has been stated and restated, the album sounds like it was written and recorded in the 80's. You can detect the influences (\\"Mission: Submission\\" has a distinct Gary Numan keyboard sound, the bass on \\"What She Said\\" sounds as if it were lifted directly from a Tones on Tail recording) yet the album is all original.

Why would you write those load of crap novels before this one to spew out more crap. Their styles in each book are different. The first one was just another Star Wars book, the second one was written like a James Bond story, and this one seems like they've tried to create a suspense novel. Well, they failed in each way possible. The biggest problem is that they were given important information to write with. And after reading three books you'd think that you'd learn something that you didn't already know. Everything turns out like you'd expect it to and yet nothing we didn't know.And why were the novels so long?

The NJO has had it's ups and downs, but these three books mark a definite all-time low. The first 9 books, as far as I'm concerned, were the NJO glory days, with a few books afterward being up to par, such Traitor and Destiny's Way. All of those books were an enjoyment to read, and I always looked forward to picking the book up and reading about an exciting space battle or a harrowing Jedi/Yuuzhan Vong duel.

The end result is simply unsatisfying.All three of these \\"Force Heritic\\" books could have been been made as one single book - or even left out entirely!

Still, you need to buy several because each tube does not hold enough product. I guess I was comparing it to \\"Gray Away\\" which is no longer available.

It's that bad. This guy could have matched vocal wits with Roy Orbison, but doesn't seem to care. When I think of all of the cover songs that he could have redefined...please write to Robin and let him know. And, my dear Robin, I still love you, but PLEASE do your audience the favor of once again changing direction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SOLO ALBUM!","review":"Great solo album. Robin can definitely hold his own, as if there were any doubt about that!! My favorites on this CD are \\"Please\\" and \\"Watching You\\". I also like Robin's rendition of \\"Love Hurts\\". I found it ironic that \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is on this CD. The Bee Gees sang this song in tribute of Andy on the Documentary--This Is Where I Came In. It made me think of Maurice's death less than a month ago. I'm sure we will hear alot more from Robin in the future. This CD is a must for true Bee Gees fans. Thank you Robin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin shows his diversity with MAGNET","review":"I found this albumn to be a delightful departure from some of the standard sounds of the past. Wonderfuly diverse with a fresh new sound. \\"Don't Wanna Wait Forever\\" combines a fabulous soul like back up vocal with a great catchy tune and Robin's \\"I am a tortured man and it's all because I love you\\" vocals. \\"Please\\" delivers a memorable beat and fabulous vocals. Let us remember that there are also Bee Gee's albumns that don't sound like \\"The Bee Gees\\" per se, but rather show a diverse and unique talent. Think PROMISE THE EARTH, which I find to be a fantastic dance track with an alternative flair. It is this diversity which enables the brothers Gibb to always surprise and delight,and is precisely what MAGNET delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the passion??","review":"I love Robin Gibb and have loved his singing ever since I can remember listening to h im and his brothers back in the 70's. However, this CD was a terrible disappointment to me. Robin has such an angelic voice mixed with sounds of passion and soul. He sings like an angel. But this CD was, in my opinion, not the typical Robin. He sounds like he is trying to keep up with the current trend of hip hop instead of singing songs that match the passion and soul in his voice. I am very disappointed with his choice of music in this CD. I still love him and all of his previous albums and will continue to listen to his other songs that he recorded with his brothers. I would like to hear a solo album of just Robin singing more from his soul with the passion that he has inside of him reaching his listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Response To \\"bland beyond belief\\"","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer that this CD was not really worthy of Robin Gibb's talents but the tasteless remarks about him were over the top.Unless you actually know the man and his travel habits, how would you have any idea how much time he spends with his family or whether or not he saw Maurice in the months prior to his death?For being 15 years old, you certainly have a great command of the English language, with the help of whomever your footnote indicated edited your review.

I thought Robin sounded very good, but he seemed like a fish out of water with the hip-hop feel of the music. \\"Please\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" are the only two tracks that had any staying power for me-- \\"Please\\" had an especially nice sound to it, but even that song had too many background vocals for my taste, which was how the whole album felt to me.

I looked at the credits before actually popping the CD into the the player and noticed that with the exception of the BG remakes, they were mostly written by other people! I'm not sure why he let other people write the songs since he's completely capable to write his own songs. So what gives?I do not reconize any of the song writers credited on the CD and gee...I wonder why?? The song writing is terrible and the production is even worse. Most of the time Robin's vocals are drowned out by medicore backing vocals. Poor song writing doesn't help here.Did I mention the songs were terrible??The remake of Another Night in NY is a droned out, boring remake and the original wasn't my favorite either.Please is a great song to fall asleep to when you're having a bad case of insomneia.Advice?

Not many of us have the chance to interact first hand with people with disabilities, but it's a fact that they are a part of our communities, and reading this book is a good way to learn more about them.

The overlooked gem is 1982's \\"Wake Up My Love,\\" which should have placed higher than No. 53 on the U.S. charts. \\"Best of Dark Horse\\" has long been out of print, yet Harrison deserves an expansive 1970-2001 compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Hearted","review":"Best of Dark Horse is another half-hearted attempt to gather George Harrison's greatest songs together.

Greenland made use of the current digital synthesizers (he was a sound designer for Ensoniq) but in a way that was totally unique to John. His pieces on this album are more \\"tone poems\\" than pretty little tunes; in fact they share more with Stravinsky or Holst than the New Age \\"knife and fork music\\" which was popular at the time. These are bold singular tracks, challenging and rewarding of repeated listenings.Over the years most of the digital synthesis of the '90s has faded from my playlist.

Don't get me wrong, there were some extremely funny scenes. However, Hooker just isn't that good of a writer. It shows, as the book gets better as it goes along.Hooker employs that basics of black comedies about war: ironic repitition of monikers, and presentation of absurdities with a stark descriptive style that highlights the absurd. That's all very nice, but there is no real common plot thread throughout the book. Characters appear and then disappear for sixty pages, so the gags at their expense aren't as funny; since we lose a sense of how uptight they are.Buy the movie with Donald Sutherland, and read Joseph Heller if you want a great black comedy about war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy book saved by a great movie","review":"One of the few times I'd recommend skipping the book and just watching the movie. The book is so poorly written that it takes having watched the movie or the television show to fill in the gaping holes in the plot and character development. Richard Hooker must have had the good fortune to find a publisher who needed a book but who didn't have an editorial staff.

Having seen the movie several times I found that I knew almost all the stories already, but that did not lessen the enjoyment of reading it.

I felt absolutely cheated because I paid $26.99 for three episodes that they really could have saved me money on and put them in with Season 9. Or they could have at least not made this set cost almost as much as a season's worth of DVDs. I also wasn't particularly impressed with the episodes, especially \\"Bless All the Dear Children.\\" It was like the producers ran out of ideas and put anything together just to have a show for viewers to watch. And the \\"Look Back to Yesterday\\" about Albert dying, I thought in the episode where he was using morphine, at the end of that episode Laura says that Albert returns to Walnut Grove as a doctor. But then with this episode he dies before ever becoming a doctor. I could be wrong about that, but it doesn't change my mind about being disappointed with this set. I would have rather had these episodes at a much cheaper price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little House on the Prairie","review":"This is a great addition to my collection.

Boylan Cane Cola really tastes very, very close to the way I remember Pre-New Coke being. It has bite, an edge of berry, and manages to be full-bodied without becoming heavy. Too many \\"small batch\\" sodas have fancy bottles containing average sodas, no better than the supermarket brands. This is not one of those sodas.

Within a few lessons, I was putting together ideas with Rosetta Stones' French tutorials. The program uses photographs to piecemeal together ideas.

This is a new direction for the band, and it took some time to get used to.After a few listens the album will start to grow on you. You'll start to pick up those things that make this band so great. Sadly a lot of this things are hidden in the production. It's a little more slick then anything they have done previously.Once you have accepted this new sound you can get down to the songs. They are all pretty good. The highlights being all 3 Crane Wife songs, The Island, and Yankee Bayonet.As a long time Decemberists fan I understand the disappointment some are feeling, but give this a little time, and it'll grow on you.

After reading all the good words, I was expecting to be blown away. Then after a couple of listens I realized I had had tricked myself. The Decemberists aren't the kind of band that blows people away. The Decemberists are a band that charms you and soothes you with loving songcraft and theatrical whimsy. Crane Wife didn't inject directly into my blood stream like the infectious Picaresque (my first of the band's CDs). In fact, some two weeks later, Crane Wife is still slowly soaking in. I dont hear the adventuresome and free spirited Decemberists I've grown to love. In fact Collin even seems a little more uncertain in his singing on Crane Wife. Not the lyrics, just the execution. \\"When the War Came\\", \\"Yankee Bayonet\\" and \\"Shankhill Butchers\\" are standouts. 4 stars is being nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I have ever heard","review":"I said before that Picaresque wasn't as great to listen to the entire way through as picking out a few songs. The Crane Wife blew my expectations out of the water. You can listen to this all the way through and take the songs out and put them on a playlist. Be warned that some of the songs may take you a few listens to really enjoy, and by that I mean that you need to listen to them more then once to really get it. Colin Meloy doesn't always write songs where the meaning is apparent right away or in the subtext. But it is worth it.SongsSHOULD LISTEN TO DAILY:3. Yankee Bayonet5. The Perfect Crime #26.

The Crane Wife is versatile, sometimes upbeat, sometimes depressing, but always deserving of the acclaim that the Decemberists have garnered. \\"The Island\\" has beautiful musical transitions between the three parts, and \\"The Crane Wife 3\\" is a marvelous opener.

Great observation. There are in fact many excellent reviews of this album.If you read the lyrics, you'll want to do research on a few words and references. It helps the album's inspiration come to life. I looked to Wikipedia to read what the story behind \\"The Crane Wife\\" is about. Great story - in the original folk tale a man nurses a wounded crane back to health, marries a woman, and loses the whole deal by getting greedy. There's more to it than that: just check it out.The sheer craftsmanship of the musicians on this album is outstanding. You'll find a colorful variety of instrumentation and a moving dynamic between word and sound.Joseph Campbell would be proud - this album is what keeping myth and folklore alive is all about.

Somebody should also fine him $500 for polluting the ether with that \\"per-fect currrrr-rye-um\\" hokum.And the pseudo-intellectualism of the whole endeavor is just blatant.

I am very familiar with their type of music, and loved the INDIE part of the Indie Rock that they play. When I heard that they had signed a deal with Capital I was afraid that they would sell out and stop producing their specific type of music. But that was very far from the truth.Instead, they took their music to the next level with their new studio and the result is this CD. This is their best album by far to date, and I can't stop listening to it. I really look forward to what they will come out with in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crane Wife according to Soozler","review":"As usual for the Decemberists, this isn't meaningless melodic background music.

I love how their music is on the upbeat side but their lyrics are abit on the dark side. And all the songs are telling a story. O Valencia and Shankill Butchers are excellent. I especially like Shankill Butchers because it is actually based on a real gang. Their songs are different than the typical junk that is floating around this days.

You have found it","review":"Very simply the best band currently operating, and one which owes its oeuvre to a wealth of literary and rock traditions--and to brilliant frontman Colin Meloy. Decemberists lay the foundations of rock and roll structure beneath an array of American 19th century literary themes by the likes of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, AND IT WORKS. Amazing.

In retrospect, I would only buy this book again if I had over a year to study for the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go elsewhere for study material","review":"I earned a 680 on the real GMAT. On actual past GMATs that are published, I got a 690 and a 680. I only got a 560 on Barron's practice test! Many of their pratice questions were logically flawed. Buy the real past tests from ETS. You will get practice with the way the GMAT people actually think."},{"rating":"1","title":"included software is terrible","review":"I have quite a few complaints about this book.1) The CD is an exact copy of the text of the book. I am not quite sure what the point of the book is now that I have the CD.2) The software doesnt give you a score on your practice tests! Even the free software that is available from GMAT.com will score your practice test! This software also will not score your essay, you are supposed to have a friend score it for you. (Again, the free software at GMAT.com will score it for you).3) When \\"reading the book\\" from the CD, the format is awful. For example, the math review section is 97 pages long. The controls are \\"Forward\\" and \\"Back\\". If you dont read it all in one sitting, you have to click \\"Next\\" until you get to where you stopped.My advice: Buy another book, and download the free software from GMAT.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of crap","review":"It won't allow me to give negative stars, or I would. This book goes through a useful page and a half telling you how the computerized GMAT testing works and how different it is from paper tests, then proceeds to give you five paper tests. What sort of moron publishes a book that announces its own uselessness in the first chapter?This book is a worthless piece of crap. Don't buy it. Your money is better spent twisting the bills into rolls and setting them on fire. You have a better chance of improving your score by paying $30 to an illiterate homeless person to take the test for you.I am in the process of contacting Barron's to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The questions are very strange - the logic is seriously flawed and the conclusions the authors make are VERY questionable. Questions themselves are either very easy or very hard. DO NOT waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever!","review":"I have never used such a sorry excuse for a GMAT prep book. I'm not even done with diagnostic test and yet I cannot believe how many errors/misprints there are. Like the above readers, I too would like my money back. Your money is better spent elsewhere. Stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"This book really wastes money because its stuff is outdated andbiased. You will find this book can not improve your scores on actual GMAT test if you are studying GMAT through this book.In verbal section, SC and RC are very poor because they havedissimilar with actual test. Really, not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, Incorrect and pretty much useless","review":"Don't bother with this book, there are much better books out there. The questions are often awkward and don't seem to match what I ran into on the GMAT. Additionally they teach you stuff which you don't even need for the GMAT. .. For example - the quadtratic formula.. Don't need it!My guess is these books aren't updated as frequently as some of the books by Kaplan/Princeton Review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad a 0 star isn't an option.","review":"Many of the questions/answers were logically flawed. Buy the real past tests from ETS. You will get practice with the way the GMAT people actually think."},{"rating":"1","title":"a reader","review":"This book did not provide me with adequate material. Questions contain faulty logic, questions are misprinted, and in general, this book was disappointing. Example: One question wanted to know, \\"...which of the following conclusions cannot be made?\\", giving several conclusions which referred to a passage. The passage stated that trains left NY for NJ every minute, and vice versa. All trains traveled at the same rate. The answer: A train that leaves NY at 4:00 will pass 60 trains before its destination. This is a very confusing answer because while the total number of trains passed on the journey is 120, 60 trains are indeed passed along the way. It is further complicated by the fact that one of the answer selections is none of the above. I sent an email to the co-authors, each replying that the other wrote that question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has more mistakes than I can possibly make","review":"This book has been horrid. I've only been through the first 35 pages, and I've already found three VERY HARMFUL mistakes on the math. I need as much help as possible on the math, not screwed up answers. Numbers have been wrong, entire questions have not matched with the answers, etc. And the worst part is they explain the solutions in the toughest way possible. Don't waste your money on this one. However, I highly recommend the GMAT for Dummies. It explains the math very well, and even (quickly) goes over the basics. It's a lot cheaper and much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book, but you get what you pay for.","review":"The reading comprehension is poorly designed. The passages are way too long compared with the real test. The questions are too easy and too detail-oriented. Sentence correction is also too easy. CD-ROM is useful but only to a limited degree. Suggest you only use this book when you have too much preparation time before the real test."},{"rating":"1","title":"authors are of 4th tier business school faculties","review":"Given my solid background in Mathematics,I rarely make mistake when dealing with it. Kaplan's quantitative section even failed to meet my expectation of \\" real math thing\\" problems. Surprisingly, I made some errors in this book's math section. No doubt, I'd suggest the authors of this book get some serious math concepts since their math skills are severely rusty.For non-native english speakers, you wouldn't make a good use of this book's verbal section. You'd be going nowhere! Get the verbal sections from Kaplan and Priceton Review instead!You need clues and hints to tackle Gmat verbal. This book does not give you any!One good thing about this book is that this book is worth it, in the sense that it helps you to meet GMAT requirement from 4th tier Business schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter and complete garbage","review":"The questions in this book use some warped bizarre logic with no basis in reality (or the real test). I found myself feeling incredibly stupid because I wasn't getting answers correct and for the life of me, couldn't understand why.The tips offered by this book are useless as well, and don't correlate specifically to the test (ie - a (lame) general overview on logic is given instead of how to solve the GMAT logic questions).Use the ETS book (The Official Guide for Gmat Review) and the Princeton Review book instead.The night before my GMAT the power went out and I accidently burned this book when one of candles burned too low... this was too good a fate for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst possible choice","review":"I recently used three books and CDs to prepare for the GMAT. The ETS one is very good for practicing, Kaplan's is entertainig and provides useful tips, but Barron's was a huge disappointment. The book is extremelly unfriendly, and the software gives the impression that it was written in a hurry just to be able to match the competitors' offers. The tests and questions provided are quite different from the actual GMAT, and contain a significant number of errors that can do more harm than good to the student. In summary, I'd recommend to stay away from this book/software, and go for ETS or Kaplan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed ... bad investment","review":"The software is nothing like a real thing. I agree with the previous reader - you have to scroll these poor 5 lines and you waste your time on this scrolling exercise.Many of us students are looking for more practice tests from the CD (test like conditions) - whereas here we have been given just one test and the software keeps crashing!!!I would not recommend this product for GMAT preparation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed - would like my money back.","review":"The screen format of the CD practice tests is nothing like the real thing -- 4 or 5 lines at a time. I wanted to practice reading from the screen to get a little faster at it and this was a waste of time to even load the program. Also I thought the reading comp exercises from the book were incomprehensible compared to the GMAT-published excercies. I am hoping to find a way to return the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"unless you are out of excercise books","review":"I chose the book because its content is pretty accurate, and it has tons of questions. Yet, as I was pratising the tense excercises, I lost my track: the question styles are off GMAT style and many questions seem to be artifically awkard. The book has 5 tests, yet all in the old GMAT format. I especially do not like the software, which has only one test in it and does not resember real GMAT experience.On ...(the webseite), I sorted \\"GMAT\\" books by \\"bestselling\\"and I found 5 books that fit my needs and have >4.5 stars. These five books have been helpful to my progress! I wish I had logged on ... (the website) and read others' comments earlier. Well.Good luck to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"FELT GENEROUS, SO I GAVE IT 1 STAR","review":"Another typical album from the Apache. The album made me BOOMSHAKALAK all the way to the toilet!!!

However, common sense (which I didn't have at the moment of purchase) will tell you that ice water attracts moisture...moisture attracts flour...flour and water make...paste! What a mess! So maybe I missed something, but can't figure out what. Every time I put cold water in the pin it sweats on the outside...so there you go! I since found a very nice WOODEN rolling pin, heavy duty with nice handles that has restored my confidence in making pie crust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it says it is","review":"This rolling pin is exactly what it says it is. It can be filled with cool water (and even ice if you have thinner ice cubes) to keep your dough cool as you work it.

I am a Haircut 100 fan as well, but this album unfortunately finds Nick waist deep in the parts of the 80's that we'd like to forget: tinny drum machines, synthesized horn sections, and sacharine mixes. A couple of power pop gems and typical Heyward craft are buried by over-production and gloss. For fans, there are a few great moments, most notably \\"Traffic on Fleet Street\\", a pretty ballad that showcases Nick's ability to transform a mood into music. But there are others that make me press eject and reach for his more recent releases. Again, diehards ought to get it for the sake of their collections, but the casual fan would better appreciate the Greatest Hits or From Monday to Sunday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading publication","review":"For some reason this magazine has been shipped from South Africa and contains South African entertainment, articles, stores etc....not what I was expecting at all!No where did I see it mentioned that it would be a South African publication - waste of $118!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fab","review":"This is an excellent \\"chilling out\\" CD.Light a candle, pour a glass of wine and turn up the volume!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows promise, but not quite there yet.","review":"As this was recommended along with Barbara Hambly's latest, I decided to give \\"Dead March\\" a go. Unfortunately, it can't help but suffer in comparison with \\"Wet Grave.\\" Several things in the book struck me as being underdeveloped, and I think the main fault was the characterization. Too much information about the characters is given in expository chunks; rather than letting us discover who these people are through their actions and their conversation, we're simply told what their attitudes and personalities are. The story would have been much more effective if they'd been allowed to reveal themselves. The premise itself is fascinating and seldom-seen, but the presentation of the author's ideas would have benefitted from some more subtlety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with period details","review":"Although the cover states that this is a Civil War Mystery, the details contained about the war itself are pretty slim. Instead, we're given a lot of other details, such as medical information for example. The mystery itself doesn't really get explored before the first 150 pages. It loses a star for it, but overall, and enough interesting read that I'm looking forward the second installement of the life of Narcissa Powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"some of these guys are gone now but they still rock","review":"If you are a Tom Petty fan, and if you like George Harrison or even just fondly respect him, and if you like witty lyrics and good music the Wilburys don't disappoint. The CD has like, 18 tracks,so you can really get into it. I cooked a whole dinner while listening, and just the fact that I cook probably shows that I remember all the guys in the Wilburys.

Too bad for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too hokey pokey and sing song for my taste","review":"A little too hokey pokey and sing song for my taste. I think that the group just basically rested on their individual laurels as performing artists. If you listen to the words of most of the songs it sounds like they just went into the studio to record without having any forethought. I would think that recording artists of this caliber would be able to to at least sound like just didn't drop into the studio just to jam and produce whatever. It sounds disjointed, like they are not connected to each other musically. Overall, rather disapointing after you get over the initial excitement of the combination of the artists. Not a CD that makes me want to listen to it again and again,how about you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice production - no imagination","review":"First the good: this album is a textbook lesson in studio production. It sounds beautiful. No surprise there - you would expect five multi-millionaires to be able to afford the best.Now for the bad: this album has no imagination whatsoever. Lyrics are shallow -- generally about picking up girls in bars. Dylan sounds like he started with the rhymes and worked backwards. Musically, nothing but the same tired old chord progressions and melodies. The songs written by Harrison and Orbison are generally what they were writing 25+ years ago.I'm sure this album sold a bunch when it first appeared -- when are music consumers going to start choosing creativity over packaging?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top o' the Marks - Challenge!!!","review":"Proven test of time!

The album spawned from there. Check out Roy Orbison'shaunting \\"Not Alone Any More\\", too. Music to melt thehardest of hearts.

Over the years I have bought and sold a lot of CDs, but I've never even thought about selling this one. Not only that, but I still listen to it frequently (though of course now it's on my ipod - gotta keep up with the times after all). Unlike some \\"all-star\\" albums, this one isn't an ego fest. No one artist tries to outdo the others or steal the show. Instead, it's as if these five remarkably talented musicians just sat around having fun in the studio and ended up with some great music.

Almost every track is brilliant, but what's most incredible about it is that it actually made me rethink my total hatred of \\"country\\" music...Roy Orbison's performance on this album made me go out and buy everything he ever recorded that I could get my hands on.

Super Group is a nice way of putting it. George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne AND Bob Dylan! Its almost laughable that these guys actually got together and made the records ... first, you see who is in the band. Then you hear it. This really is a terrific album, why? I'll tell you ... because you hear trademark input from each individual member and because when all of the various parts combine, you hear the beautiful sound of perfect Acoustic Guitar, tight Drums and Bass, extremely apt Vocals and Lyrics and all smoothed over by the genius of George Harrison's Lead-Guitar.

What he presents here is a glimpse into the deliciously sensual world that these models are so adept at creating. It's more fantasy than documentary, more beautiful than reportive. But is does all this with a distinctly grand and illustrious style, and the girls are so amazingly, so breathtakingly beautiful - long, tall, curvaceous angels that are experts at \\"turning on\\" before the camera. With the enthusiastic eye of a party-guest and the attention of a true voyeur, Karkau tantalizes us with scenes that are erotic, imaginative, sophisticated, and fun - with photographs that bring us closer to each model's secret.

There are lots of very funny episodes in tbe book.Nonetheless, this is not Nesbit's best work. Enchanted Castle, Five Children and It, Phoenix and the Carpet are better, since they also incorporate magic.

The authors are naval architects and one of them is a former naval officer, so they know their subject inside and out. The drawings are certainly impressive and very useful to any modeler or historian of the subject.The projected designs of battleships never built by the major naval powers is a distinctive feature of this series and certainly interesting, considering that many of these designs were paper studies.

It tasted like watered down soy sauce and there was a very unpleasant tangy after taste. Yuck! I'm not sure who taste tested these but they need to go back to the drawing board. You can find a much tastier meal than this for 320 calories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I tried this today and it was not edible. Way too sweet, strong soy sauce taste, just nasty.

Also features Cassandra Gava as one of the first Asian-American female cops in movie history, and a cameo appearance by character actor John Timmons. Well-written, well-paced, entertaining story, with Bill Ferrell portraying a believable, sympathetic, \\"ordinary guy\\", an anti-hero with whom most of us can actually identify. Jodie Fisher's character development will surprise some women viewers. While everyone knows Shannon Tweed was a playboy centerfold, did you know actor Ted Prior modeled for (I believe it was) Playgirl? This film is underway to becoming an underground cult classic -- and not because of the controversy it stirred among TV Channel 4 viewers in the U.K.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mahjongg","review":"I started playing mahjongg at a free gamesite online while at work.

No patches needed and it doesn't mess up your computer like other games can. I whole heartedly recommend this to any puzzle lover!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a most unusual and enlightening memoir","review":"A fascinating and well-written story of a young child being taken by her communist parents out of the USA during the height of the anti-communist hysteria, living first furtively in Mexico, then Prague, Czechoslovakia under an assumed identity -- interspersed with some years in a China at the brink of the \\"cultural Revolution\\" -- and how the return of the family to America had to be orchestrated. It recounts how the intelligent idealistic parents - and then the author herself in her teen years - were deluded into believing communist states really promised a more just society, until disillusionment set in. I also found it very interesting that the author, immersed into a Czech society and schools, considered herself almost more Czech than American (while her parents hardly learned the Czech language). Her love of Prague is very poignant to me, since my family lived there when I was 5 to 12 in the 1930s, escaping the Nazis just before WW2 started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosetta Stone is great!","review":"I received Rosetta Stone Spanish, Level 1 for Christmas and I love it!The interaction and learning activities are easy to use and help you to pick up the language very quickly.

Now I can access it at home online and use any set of lessons I want, for the cost of a library card, which I had anyway. Actually I spent quite a lot of time on the French module, but when I got to Paris I had very little occasion to remark that the children were about to jump off the table.

Worse still, there are no present tense examples of any of these verbs, so you will not be able to use them in the real world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"Too much money for too little results. There is no grounding done up front so you have no idea how to string together the words you are learning. I had to refer to a translation service to understand what the often repeated articles were.

This first self-titled album from the guys, was a milestone in Christian music. It won them 2 Grammy's in both jazz and gospel. It was also the first and only time a Christian act was nominated in the Best Newcomer category. Even such industry giants as Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder had to take notice. The a capella sound was given a major shot-in-the arm with the release of this classic. With rich vocal harmonies, and impressively unique arrangements; Take 6 recorded traditional black church music like it had never been heard before. 'If We Never Needed The Lord Before,' 'Mary,' 'David And Goliath' and 'Get Away, Jordan,' all stand out along with two outstanding originals; 'Gold Mine' and their trademark masterpiece 'Spread Love.'

I used it only 2-3 times a month and it's not even a year since I bought this - quite upsetting. The brush roll mechanism works fine, but what's the point when there's no suction, it defeats the whole point of having a vacuum cleaner. My old Hoover lasted me 5yrs and the only reason I finally ended up replacing that one was because the wheels had come off. I am sorry but this will be my first and last Eureka product. It sucks to now have to look for a new vacuum cleaner when money is so tight at the moment. I understand this was less than $100, but still, this was sadly just simply a waste of money. Would think twice before spending your hard earned $ on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was It Bad Luck?--This Died on Me After ~6 Uses","review":"This vacuum lasted just barely long enough for me to have no option but throw its carcass away and \\"eat the loss.\\" Sure it seems reasonably priced, and there's no disputing that it's lightweight and compact for the suction you get out of it--until it stops sucking. In my 43 years (25 of which include first-hand purchases of vacuums), I've never had a vacuum that died on me as quickly as this one did. Was it just bad luck? If so, then my low rating should be appropriately overwhelmed by high ratings from those who were not so unlucky. As I submit this review, this vacuum currently gets four stars from the Amazon population, so it appears that I was unlucky. Still, buyers beware. If you're as unlucky as me, this vacuum will die more quickly than you can go through a handful of disposable razor blades.

Thank goodness. Finally a vacuum that pleased me.Super lightweight but well made. Attachments work as promised and it really does have all the power of a big clunky vacuum. It took 5 minutes to put together. They have a huge sticker (that peels off cleanly) that tells you to remember to swith the setting to hose vs floor and suction for bare floor vs suction and spinning brush for carpet which I briefly forgot and had a moment of panic when it wasnt doing things well. After I spent 5 minutes getting to know it.... all is perfect. I read a few reviews that said the cord was in the way but I wonder of those people didnt see the tiny cord loop up high on the handle that solves that issue. I am so happy I bought this instead of the more heafty and expensive one I originally wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eureka 437AZ","review":"The air is blowing out under the bottom front of dust collection can. As a result, the air blows away the dust before the vacuum cleaner sucks the dusts in. To prevent from blowing the dust away, the handle should be held very low, so that the air blows up rather forward to blow the dust away.It is convenient to vacuum the stairs because it is light and the motor is strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"This is the worst vacuum I have ever had. First, it reeked of toxic plastics for months, so I had to keep it in its own closet and wear a mask when I used it. Second, dust clogs the top making it difficult to take apart to clean the filter. Third, the integrity of the whole machine is based on a tiny piece of plastic (about the size of two staples) where the filter fits to the top. Not surprisingly it keeps breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, but right....","review":"I had purchased this as a gift. I was at their house and tried it out.

The problem is that over time with only moderate use (once a week use over a small area) the wheels fall off. There's a plastic tab that keeps the wheels on and it wears out. I took it to the vacuum repair place and they said the only way to fix it was to buy an entire new head which costs about the same as a new vacuum ($80).

I have a happy mom. The only drawback is that she doesn't answer her phone as often because she's vacuuming. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"This vacuum is perfect for our small home.It does a good job on hardwood and rugs,and is quick to switch between the two.With alot of pets(cats&dogs;)in the house it picks up lots of hair.Its lightweight makes it easy to do stairs.We don't have carpeting,but the rugs are the same kind of material and with the brush going it does a good job.The attachment called the powerpaw uses the suction air to spin a brush and it works good on getting hair off furniture.The exhaust air blows out the front and makes those hairballs come towards the intake or anything else that easily blows around.This vacuum is well designed and at the price I got it for($70 on sale),its a steal.If you have a large home you could have one or two per floor compaired to some of the pricey vacuums out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST vaccum ever!!","review":"This little vacuum is amazing. I live in Hawaii and we have dust like you can't imagine. Eureka got it right with this one, it's light yet powerful and does a great job on the carpets and on things like window sills and furniture.

It's also very light and easy to move around. I'm glad I selected it and bought it - did quite a bit of research beforehand. The only downer is an inevitable one, I guess: cleaning the filter afterwards is a bit messy and time-consuming. But it's either that or buy a bag model and have to shell out for all those bags! NOTE that you MUST clean the filter each time and also check the bottom roller for threads; otherwise, the unit will be too clogged to work correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka! for the Small Place","review":"I bought this Eureka when my large vacuum was being repaired. I was surprised at how well it worked and how good my back felt afterwards!If you are elderly or have a small place, this would be an excellent choice. It is also great for those \\"in-between\\" clean ups.There are some easy-to-use features. A button on the top lets you switch from carpet to hard surface vacuuming without having to put the sweeper in an upright position. There is also a large knob that allows you to switch from floor to hose cleaning. It comes with three hose attachments and the handle retracts with ease for storage.This vacuum is bagless. Make sure you dump out the canister after each use. I found that if you do not, it tends to get clogged easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!","review":"I purchased this mainly to vacuum up kitty litter that my cat tosses everywhere. It vacuumed up the large kitty litter particles with a single swipe so I am very pleased. When emptying the vacuum bucket, I was shocked...there was a good 2 inches of dust in there as well! I hadn't realized how dirty these floors were until I vacuumed them! The dust was super fine which demonstrates the relative suction power of the vacuum.Besides its function, the vacuum cleaner is light as advertised. The dust bucket comes on and off very easily which reduces the likelihood that you'll end up dumping its contents all over the place. The adjustable handle is quite nice too.Overall, this vacuum does as advertised and I'd recommend it to anyone. I haven't had it for a long time, so I can't discuss the longevity of the vacuum, but I had a similar vacuum from Eureka previous to this one, and it survived well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka I got the Optima 437az","review":"Great Vac, lots of power, nice features , easy to use and the best feature is that you can turn off the brush motor, I have both wood and carpet area's.

No way! It's smaller but even heavier than my old big full-size Panasonic upright vacuum!Is it quieter? Not at all. Very noisy!It's worse. My old big Panasonic vacuum moves smoothly on carpets when brush is rotating, but this one is very heavy to move on long-leg carpets even when brush is rotating.

After the initial vacuuming, my attempt to put the cleaning cup back into the vacuum (at least 1/2 hr. worth of tries) was impossible to accomplish. Also, the seams of the part seemed to buckle.

I read a positive review in Real Simple magazine, and positive comments on Amazon.

My major complaint is that the dirt very quickly clogs up the HEPA filter. So I have to dig around in the filter in order to get the dirt out of it -- which means dust is flying around in the air. I have a chronic lung problem which is why I bothered with a HEPA filter to begin with. But now I'm sure I'm breathing in a lot more dust than if I could simply dump the dirt in the garbage.

The same day a ceramic utensil holder arrived in a carton with no top and bottom packing, just one plastic air bag on one side and the ceramic holder in about a dozen parts.

The Shark was just delivered and is still in the box, no rush on the cleaning thing, but it does have a 5 year warranty so I figure the cost per year will be less than the Eureka piece of junk.

After about 15 months the Eureka was like a cool robotic broom. It picked up what it could. Then finally after 2 years she died. I used the power paw for my cats tree, nothing else but my cats tree..and that died after a year.Another thing that i want to mention, this vacuum is HARD to clean! On Amazon(pre-purchase) I read some reviews mentioning this too but i didnt listen because I thought to myself \\"Oh it cant be that hard, I like to clean\\". UHHH no!

I liked the idea of the tiger paw to clean the stairs. After about 3 uses the tiger paw stopped spinning if you put any pressure at all on it. The cord is way too short. I have to replug 3 times in just 1 room! The cannister fills up very quickly and all of the dust collects around the top of the filter. Cleaning the filter is not the easiest task and is a pretty dirty job. While using it on my hardwood floors, I see it blowing dust, hair, etc. away from the vacuum.

The suction was great. I have a small dog and the hair was picking up before I was even near it. I gave up my powerful canister that cost me close to $400. for this and I couldn't be happier. At least now I don't have to call my daughter to come over and do this for me anymore.

However, removing/replacing the filter lid is difficult. The plastic threaded lid is poorly made. Even when the lid is aligned properly for removal/replacement, it will hardly budge. the filter canister and lid are lightweight plastic, so I can see a real potential for breakage when dealing with the lid. BE CAREFUL. Also, be sure you remove and clean the filter outside. The dirt/dust erupts from the thing. I haven't had the vacuum very long, so can't comment on durability. If it holds up and if I can finally master the filter lid, I think I will be glad I have it. I also recommend buying from Amazon.

By listening to this collection of soulful jazz, along with great vocals by Al Jarreau and Michael Franks, JOE SAMPLE can do no wrong. I never heard of him until I found out he worked with SIMPLY RED(Mick Hucknull) on their NEW FLAME album.Believe it or not, Joe's album was released in March of 1989 and Simply Red's was released in April of 1989--quite a venue with these 2 GREAT albums around the same time.In fact, Sample's style blends perfectly with Simply Red's and vice-versa. But SPELLBOUND is just that, spellbinding--fresh, crisp, smooth and free as a breeze(GEORGE BENSON?) His piano can fly through anycomposition and/or style of music. Also, U-TURN is an excellent romanticpiece of piano, strings and beautiful vocals. Either way, this CD canbring you to any place you wish to go. A real gem!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the books","review":"The Southern gentleman sure can laid down some wonderful tunes, and Spellbound is one for the books.

Thank God this is on a CD instead of a record, otherwise I'd have worn a hole in it by now and the needle would be shot. Take my advice, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated Sample","review":"I've been a Joe Sample fan since his Crusaders days, and while his music has always been suave, Spellbound stands out as one of his most sophisticated works. Here is an album full of a variety of styles which complement each other instead of clashing. I like almost every song on the album and frequently listen to it on my many road trips. I have seen Joe Sample perform several times and can attest to his inspired and inspirational virtuosity on the piano. On Spellbound, every instrumental is a winner. Among the vocals, Michael Franks on \\"Leading Me Back To You\\" and Take 6 on \\"U Turn\\" are the standouts. Tommy LiPuma, who has produced albums for the likes of Michael Franks and the Mark-Almond Band, produces another winner here. In my opinion, this is Joe Sample's best album since The Hunter. It behooves every real jazz fan to go out and add this one to the CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sample!","review":"This is definitely one of if not Joe Sample's best work as a solo jazz artist during post Crusaders.

Way to go Joe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Sample offers a little something for everyone","review":"I have had this album since it was released, yet I still have it in regular rotation in my personal collection. If ever there was an album that must be played end to end, this is it. A balance is struck here, and many artists should take a lesson. Joe Sample starts off with my favorite track of the album, \\"Seven Years Good Luck\\". Some call this driving music, others say its only good as background when entertaining. I think it should be listened to with headphones. It is a very soothing gathering of tracks that deserves your full attention. Yes, it has a light feel to it, but take note: this is NOT elevator music! The vocals are limitd to three tracks, with Take 6, Michael Franks, and Al Jarreau doing the honors. I have recommended this to many friends. It still stands up after several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Joe Sample...","review":"This is another CD that finds its way onto my CD player quite often.

It's hard to tell from the pictures but they ended up being nice (and perfect for what I need). They went together easily, are sturdy, and the height is adjusted easily as well. The metal could be compared to a heavy metal skillet pan you would use in the kitchen. They look fine and could be placed in a formal room without taking away from nice quality furniture. Like most of the other stands, they have a few fittings for different speakers and the wire can be hidden through the tube but takes a little patience. They are priced right and are the same quality of the ones I saw in stores for 3X the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I just bought these speaker stands. I have TINY Sony rear speakers so the fact that the stability didn't seem too great wasn't an issue. Once I put them together the piece that holds the two poles together worked on one but not the other. The connector itself is cheap plastic while the rest of the stand is made of decent quality metal. Didn't make much sense.

You can purchase much better quality stands for the same price or less, like the Omni Mount stands. I purchased these stands and screws stripped on first use. The part that tightens the two poles together to make them adjustable is plastic and will fail sooner or later as others have noted. I would not recommend purchasing these stands. Should you do so anyhow the biggest wire that will fit through them is 14 Gauge and only the smallest satellite speakers should be mounted on them. Beware though any pet could easily knock them over."},{"rating":"2","title":"So where's the free shipping?","review":"The speaker stands are very nice, compact and match the two I already have.

However, they are not compatable with the Bose 321 Speaker System. The bracket to attach to the speakers must be modified before use (and I mean cutting metal)and since Bose uses a wiring harness, you must cut the wire before you can feed it through the hollow tubes. I was just not willing to do all that when I can buy the overpriced Bose stands and not have to modify anything. I called Customer Service at Sanus and the guy I spoke with was nice but completely oblivious to what I had to say. He told me it shouldn't be that expensive to have a machine shop cut the brackets down to size and that if I didn't mind hacking through my speaker wire and taping them back together, it should not have any effect on the sound.

They are easy to assemble, universal in usage. The only negative comment - even though the stands are designed to feed the wire through the stem, it is impossible to do with speakers which have slightly larger connector, the openning not being wide enough. I had to run the wire outside along the stem and tape it to the stem to conceal it. Small price to pay for fine stands, though. I do recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made mostly solid","review":"These stands are solid, nice looking and disappear into my livingroom.

In addition, he seems to have had her accompany him to most of his major diplomatic meetings! Let us hope Ambassador L. Boggs will do a better job describing her mission at a key U. S. diplomatic post at the end of her tenure in Rome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting insight into an Ambassador's life and emotions","review":"I found this book to be an enjoyable easy read!

I planned to use these for wiping down greasy, gunpowdery handguns. Once you've used a piece of cloth for that, it's pretty much toast - you throw it away when done. These seemed cheap enough that I wouldn't feel bad about tossing them afterward. I thought, just how bad could these things be that they wouldn't be usable for at least wiping down greasy metal? Well, considering that they're almost the consistency of burlap, they're not usable for much at all. Yes, they are almost as coarse as burlap (okay, not quite as coarse, but certainly reminiscent of burlap), and pretty stiff and scratchy. I'll try to come up with some use for these things, but it's going to be tough.Probably should have purchased some of the shop cloths sold here that are apparently just chopped up tee shirts.

Mounting bracket is almost completely useless.","review":"The mounting bracket does not fit my bike. I have a KHS Flight 100 which I imagine is pretty standard because I have met several other people with them. The handle bars where there is no grip tape is too small for this mounting bracket and the light just barely stays on. It flops around when I ride and points at the ground most of the time. It satisfies the legal requirement for having a light, but in most ways it is not very helpful. I think a better mounting bracket would be made of metal or fit smaller sizes. The actual light seems like it is made well which is a shame because all the work put into the light is wasted when I spend all my time riding worrying about if this light will stay on my handle bars and where it will be pointing after the next bump in the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Light, Cheap Clamp","review":"I could not say more good things about the light itself, especially for the price.

Other reviews gave me a sense that it would work out well. It does, but the light could be a little brighter if I could change anything about it. This is good enough to make it from point A to point B, but it will not give an ultra wide circle of light - just enough for you to see immediately ahead of you. I am thinking of using a second one to project a beam of light a little further in front. Maybe the two lights will fit the bill. As for the attachment mechanism, it was fine - no issues there & there is a quick detach so you can take your light with you when you park your bike in places where accessories can \\"walk-off\\". I would buy again, but would also consider other lights as well. Pricing was not bad on this item. Switch was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously worst bike mount ever","review":"It cannot be this hard to make a good bike mount. I've gone through three headlights all dead for various reasons and I chose this because I just needed something simple for a lighted street at night.This bike mount is the worst piece of crap I've ever witnessed in my life.

There is a part that screws on and a strap that is pulled tight. I made this thing as tight as I could get it and it was still very loose on my bike. However, I was unable to untighten it after that. I had to cut it off the bike and throw it away. Maybe on a mountain bike or other larger frame bikes this would fit alright. I have a Trek 7100 which is a hybrid (road/mountain) and the frame just seemed to be too small for this thing. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED","review":"This is a great light for cars only to see you. It has two modes, one flashing and one steady.

GREAT product though!!! Just be aware of your handlebar size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The light is decent at best. While I ride in an urban environment, there are some places that are almost entirely dark. This light simply isn't good enough.The worst thing is the bracket. It's a pain to put on and off, and on my bike at least, I could never get it to stay on correctly. Every bump I would go over, the thing would dislodge and point to the ground.For $20, I didn't expect much, but it's definitely not worth it unless you're on an extreme budget.

I don't ride when it is completely dark out so I don't know if this light would be sufficient for that. It is a little difficult to mount on a padded handle bar but not impossible. It does interfere with my wireless computer. It blocks signals and renders my riding computer useless.

This light is very very bright. The flash feature doesnt distract you at all while riding. I thought it would when I first tried it at home. It provides a bright oval even light on the ground but again this light is not for you to ride in the woods in absolute darkness. It is bright enough for you to see whats in front of you and not hit anything and it is a great light to be seen by motorists. It can be see from sides which makes it perfect. I decided to purchase this light although there was an option for the Super Flash light because I thought to spend twice as much on just a flashing pattern didnt make sense at least to me. I would consider the Super Flash light if it was less expensive though. But I am happy with my decision it serves the purpose, it is bright and looks great on my bike.

But if you ride at night often, or intend to keep the light longer than a year, I suggest you find a different product.I've owned brighter lights, and the thing is really cheaply made. Prior to use I often need to twist the cap on/off a few times before the electrical contacts find each other again. Sometimes it'll turn off by itself, even on fresh batteries. I think the jostling of the pavement causes this. The plastic is cheap and brittle, and I'm waiting (hoping) for it to finally break so I can buy a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started good. Then became a nuisance.","review":"This bike light was cheap yet effective for a couple years. A few weeks ago, the on/off switch stopped working and the bike light always remained on.

I was disappointed however to find the quality and long term usefulness of the light very much lacking. The first of the two stopped working after the second use, for no apparent reason, regardless of new batteries. The bracket for the second light cracked after an average careless bump. Shortly after, the twist-lock mechanism that closes the light housing cracked from a 2 foot fall on to a wood floor. Besides the flimsiness of the plastic parts, the light cast by these lamps (while adequately bright), includes a ring of spots around it's edges that are very distracting in your peripheral vision,and offer no purpose at night. I would compare these to a very cheap flashlight that you wouldn't want to depend on if you really needed it. You would be better off buying a similarly priced cateye or something.Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Light","review":"I bought this light a few months ago, and I couldn't be more pleased with it.

It can be seen from a good distance and with this light you can avoid running over stuff in the dark instead of getting a glimps of what you just ran over like other lights. It slides off its bracket with a quick release that makes it great for when you need to leave your bike chained up. Great buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a SMALL, blinding spot :(","review":"I am truly surprised at the great reviews for this light; It's just another small spot of light on the road, two or three feet in front of the bike, which makes it totally useless as any kind of headlight either in city streets with lighting, or in pitch-dark (unless you want to scan the spot in front of your wheel for potholes while you ride).update: I found a Cateye EL220 for $27 that blew this out of the water :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike light","review":"This bike light is very easy to install and works very well.My only suggestion for improvement is that a front light is more likely needed for lighting, but if you press the button once you get blinking and you have to press it twice to get it solidly on, whereas for the Planet Bike Blinky \\"3\\" 3-Led Rear Bicycle Light, which is more likely used for visibility, pressing its button once puts it solidly on and twice makes it blink. It seems like either they should both work the same or else both be the opposite of how they are now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bike Light","review":"I purchased this light for my son who sometimes has to ride home a night on his bike.The light, lights up the area in front of bike pretty good.

I also bought their red tail light. Two small suggestions for Planet Bike. Program your products similarly. The headlight turns on and blinks initially with one click, then stays on with the second.

I can do this with the taillight, but it's harder with the headlight.

Good for night riding!","review":"I bought this to supplement/replace the existing headlight on my recumbent (which was mainly useful for letting others see me, not for letting me see).This light works great! I've used it twice so far: Once in the stygian darkness of the abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels, and once on the W&OD; trail where I live. It gives plenty of light to see and be seen! Illuminates a circle slightly larger than a typical bike path, and you can see probably 20-30 feet ahead. Very satisfied with it in this regard, it does exactly what I needed it for.I was a bit frustrated with the mounting bracket; it's slightly too big to fit on the bar, but I admit I may have installed it improperly (I was pressed for time and had left the instructions at home). I've wedged some paper underneath as a temporary fix until I can figure out what's wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headlight","review":"This is a great spot light, very bright, easy to install and does not move on the handlebar like some others claim. However, for road riding, perfect. But as far as mountain biking at night thru trails, not so good because is a spot light and you can't see on the sides very well. But a combination with this one and a helmet headlight, was the solution for me, so far so good. Very bright though. Merry Christmas to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The light works great until it has suffered water damage","review":"The only problem with this device is that it's not waterproof. I ended up buying a better light after about 1 year of usage and perhaps 5 or 6 rainy rides. This won't matter for those of you who avoid riding the bike in the rain at all costs, but for those of us who do this it's a matter of great concern.Water doesn't only get into the battery compartment, but oddly also into the front part where the LED's are. It's close to impossible to clean this area from the oxidation build up resulting from water.Another issue with this light is that the light going sideways could be stronger, so cars approaching you from the sides can spot you more easily.The bottom line is, the price is good and the lamp works well in general, but I feel obligated to tell you about the water problem since all the reviews seem to be missing this major flaw.If you still want to buy this, I recommend using tape to isolate it a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very long lasting...","review":"this is an ok light for the price. DO NOT get it wet. mine has been malfunctioning ever since I rode w it in the rain. it will turn on and off at random times, like when I'm not using the bike etc. I've never submerged this light, just exposed it to some rains while commuting. I'd buy a better light and spend some more cash for better safety, durability and longevity. there are much better lights available on amazon or at your local bike shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but a bit loose for smaller handle sizes!!!","review":"Really does the job. Comes with batteries, which is gets you going right away. One issue I had with it was mounting it on my Schwinn Katana road bike handlebar. The mount is made for handlebars greater than 1 inch, so be careful about that while selecting this product. It would have been nice if they supplied some shims. I just mounted on my tape which added some width and the light fits snug. Otherwise, great light. I love that you can easily snap it off and on for removal. That is just sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get A Knog frog light instead","review":"Really disappointed with this light. Even though it has 3 led's it's not that bright.

Get that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Lights!","review":"I've been purchasing various bike lights, but all of them did not focus in the middle, it's like a spot light, I can see 20 feet in front of me at night now, so I can use my other lights as a blinkers. I liked it so much I just bought another one. I've doubled it side by side, it's quite bright, I can see more than 20 feet... I wonder how it is with 3 of them side by side. I'll probably take this light for my next spelunking adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light not bright enough","review":"The light was not bright enough to illuminate.

It was easy to install, arrived at my house in a reasonable amount of time, and uses a common battery size.

Perhaps it was the low budget filming, that stupid motor-cycle with fourteen mirrors on it the 'hero' rides, or the really lame dialog, but I just didn't find Vampire's Anonymous to be funny.If bad acting, and stupid gags about sheep are your bag, you'll like Vampires Anonymous.

Eddie phones in a wack performance that no one buys anyway, and Owen Wilson should have his nose broken straight for opting to appear in this tripe. Not funny, not necessary and not even rent-worthy. If \\"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\\" is actually worse than this, someone needs to tie Eddie Murphy to a chair and make him watch \\"Raw\\" over and over until his eyes bleed.

Eddie Murphy didn't even seem to be acting. Pluto Nash was 10x the movie that this was, and that was also a total waste of my time also. This movie would have best been left on the cutting room floor. Now don't get me wrong, and think I don't like Eddie Murphy. I have enjoyed his comedy ever since I saw \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\".

Of the other three, this is arguably the worst. If you're a fan of the show, just don't even try to watch this. We didn't even watch the movie through. When we reached our tolerance limit, we fast-forwarded through the rest of the movie: All the action and none of the hackneyed dialog.

The story is boring and trite, and the only thing I found myself watching was the DVD counter to see how it would be before I was put out of my misery.

Eddie Murphy's character in this movie comes off as being rude, and extremely annoying. Famke Janssen really blew it with a very weak performance. Malcolm McDowell also falls flat on this one and Owen Wilson fares little better. I love all of these actors but the lousy script inhibits any chance of them really beinging forth anything worth watching on this movie.This movie could really have been great but is totally wasted on weak dialogue and unfunny jokes.

Its pretty much the type of CD you expect to be marketed on late night TV - just the immediately recognizable \\"hits\\" with later tracks thrown in. From the early period, where is Wild West End, Down to the Waterline, even Six Blade Knife, Comminque, Once Upon a Time in the West, Where Do You Think You're Going, or maybe Follow Me Home. From the mid period, leaving out Skateaway is unforgiveable. Later period is covered well (but given the paucity of earlier material of greater substance how did the producers then cull three cuts from the On Every Street album?). Since there isn't much alternative for DS fans, it probably warrants purchase. It is so insulting in content though, hold out until better offerings come along - if you can wait that long."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Classic Rock CDs","review":"This CD has all my favorite classic songs by Dire Straits on it. It's my number one CD to listen to during my one hour commute to work in my Nissan Maxima, which by the way only has a factory CD/Radio in it; however this CD makes it sound like a McIntosh. Some of the songs are recorded in the studio and some recorded live in concert. The sound on the live recordings immerses me into the moment, as if I were sitting in the stadium during the concert. The lead guitarist is simply one of the best. Stereo imaging is the best I've ever heard in my car. The CD's output is quite high, so I have to turn the volume down a bit before I play the CD or it will wake up the neighborhood. I highly recommend this CD and it merits being a \\"must have\\" for the Classic Rock fans like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"EDITED!!!","review":"I realize that they had to edit this CD in order to put all the tracks on it...that's clear. My advice to all of you is to do what I did. Download all of the full versions of every song on the album minus \\"Private Investigations\\" and \\"Local Hero/Wild Theme\\". Leave those 2 songs off and you will have enough room on your blank CD to put the rest on it. The reason for eliminating these 2 tracks is....1. \\"Private Investigations\\" has no beat or rythym to it at all and is a boring song...and 2. \\"Local Hero/Wild Theme\\" is a cover of a solo working by Knopfler, so why is it even on here.

Get into them by buying all their studio albums. They are all full length. Plusthis is missing too many good songs. Where are they. Not a greatest hits album at all, plus Dire Straits are one of the greatest rock groups in history. I got into Dire Straits by buying this, then I bought On Every Street and it was more fulllength. Then I bought the others and they were better.Don't buy this. Get Them insted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Edited Version!","review":"I was pleased with this collection, until I realized that the entire second verse of \\"Money For Nothing\\" had been edited out. I assume that this was done so as not to offend sensitive ears with a derogatory term for male homosexuals, which was used as a shorthand device to make no doubt of the ignorance of the song's narrator. And Knopfler has always maintained that the song came from an actual conversation that he overheard. Too bad that irony is lost on the do-gooders, and that they have taken a song that makes a blistering point and have removed much of its power. A complete disgrace. Politically correct morons, 1, Rock and Roll, 0. I sure hope these people never listen to \\"Rednecks\\" by Randy Newman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good limited edtion.","review":"Dire Straits have made great music. So many even that you can't put them on 1 CD! But here's the best of CD, and what they did was putting all the short versions of their very best songs on 1 CD. Well that's one way to get a best of CD. But I think the versions are too short for the real Dire Straits fans. They are used to long instrumental sections. That's what i'm missing! Fortunately they have a limited edition. On the second CD you get a live-concert from the band. Good long versions!So my advise is: Buy the limited 2CD version or don't buy it at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware!!!censored version","review":"this sucks.

Why does the world have to be so damn PC?! If it offened someone in the first place they would never buy the album. If it doesn't offened you, then you DO buy the album.

I must admit I bought the CD for cuts like Sultans of Swing, Lady Writing and Money for Nothing but found gems like Calling Elvis and Heavy Fuel. The lyrics are rough at times but not foul and the music is not complicated, but tightly composed and very well played.

Mark Knopfler is a great guitarist, lyricist and a gruff but alright vocalist. Robert Sandall has written a well-written and informative short synopsis/bio about the band. The cover is ok but a bit boring. The photographs are all very nice and well done especially the one shot of Knopfler as it captures his intensity as he plays his guitar. I definitely recommend this album. 4 stars indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Best?

Big-time cave-in to the evil forces of political correctness!A better introduction to the band would be to just buy the album \\"Making Movies.\\" They haven't made a decent greatest hits collection for Dire Straits, and they probably never will :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - too many edits spoil the songs","review":"Firstly in response to the editorial - 'Communique' is not a dismal record by any means! It may not have fared as well as other DS albums and had no hits so to speak, but it was a good album!Its a shame that instead of releasing a 2 CD compilation, instead cramming 16 songs onto one CD meant editing so many great songs - 'Money for Nothing', 'Brothers In Arms', et al. More over, this collection has too many annoying live renditions of songs which were superior in their original studio format - 'Love Over Gold' in particular. With the new 'Private Investigations' CD out now (in single and also double CD form), check that one out, or stick to the original studio albums, this is not a showcase of DS at their best. Several tracks including the superb 'Telegraph Road' areis also missing from this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect, but...","review":"Good coverage of the hits and good sound quality, but two quibbles keep it from a 5-rating:1.

The opening track of Calling Elvis is a really nice version. A 12+ minute Sultans Of Swing - how can you go wrong?Definately worth the price in my book as a nice audio and video compilation.Just remember it is a PAL dvd!

This album is a perfect showcase of some of the worse excesses of 80s music. If you lived through the period it may bring back a few unwelcome nightmares. Clanging drum machines, booming growler vocals, and every sort of production trick that producers Rod Temperton and Dick Rudolph can bring out of their box of tricks. There is absolutely nothing original, refreshing or noteworthy about this record. Siedah's vocals sounded much lovelier on her duet with Michael Jackson. If you are looking for the same kind of sound you won't find it here. We're talking major turkey.

They also mess with the KJV text by adding double meanings that are different from the Old Scofield Bible.

The new antennas extended the range of my Linksys cable modem by maybe 10-15 feet, enough to allow my PC -- but not my wife's Mac -- to get service in a corner room that had previously been out of reach. A modest improvement, but (barely) worth the modest price of a set of second-hand antennas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Results","review":"While installation is a snap, I did not achieve a net gain in signal strength. I am using a Linksys WRT54G router and a Linksys WUSB11 hooked up to a TiVo DVR. The signal was fine until I had to move the TiVo about 30' further away into another room, where my signal strength fluctuates from 5% to about 25%, poor to marginal. I get up to a max of 30% at times with two HGA7T in a Linksys AS2TNC antenna stand, however, it usually hovers near 20% which is about what I averaged before. I plan on getting a Linksys WRE54G range expander, despite the configuration issues. I honestly expected to get much better results with the antennae than I did since all I did was move the WUSB11 into another upstairs room, whereas it had previously been directly above the room where the WRT54G was. I tried tweaking the placement of the antennae and the WUSB11, and the reported results were the best I could do. Some slight movements resulted in poorer reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help, waste of money!","review":"I have a Linksys WRT54G version 6 router with the latest updated Linksys firmware. I tested the signal strength and it was 3-4 bars from across the house, prior to installation. I immediately installed the new high gain antenans and it did not change the signal strength at all, still 3-4 bars. I tried powering down the router and re-starting my computer and it never changed the signal. I installed the original antennas and it was still 3-4 bars, then I re-installed the high gain antennas and it never changed the signal strength, still 3-4 bars. It didn't matter what laptop I used or the location, nothing changed.

Instead the bar level remained exactly the same.I understand that the walls between the room where the router is (relocation is not an option) could cause some blockage, but after reading the reviews and linksys own materials, I was led to believe that there would be at least some improvement.

I had - and still have - poor reception in my bed room and I bought these antennas to improve the situation. Now the problem has gone from bad to slightly worse.

I was hoping they'd make a difference","review":"I have a linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless-B Cable/DSL Router and I like it a lot! However, my signal was poor when I was at one end of the house. I knew it was just part of the limitations (it's about 70 feet away and it has to go through floors and walls. My signal would alternate between \\"Very Low\\" and unavailable. Then I read about these antennas, and I thought this would give it enough boost so I wouldn't have to add another WAP to cover the distance. Well, it didn't work out that way. It does keep my connection at \\"Very low\\" most of the time and sometime it goes to unavailable. I don't think it was worth the $44 that I paid for them.

I would not recommend these antennas to anyone. I didn't believe the reviews myself but found them to be true. I felt maybe some people were interpreting these antennas to increase the range and thus were giving poor reviews for that reason.

The card they sent back was a refurbished one which begs the question \\"Why didn't I just buy a refurbished one to begin with and save money?\\" The thing that really made me mad was that the antenna that came with the card had been chewed on by a dog! It was mangled. I contact Linksys service and the first person I talk to basically tells me to just deal with it. I finally have to call and speak with someone else just to get them to say they'll check into what they can do. It takes a total of 6 emails and a long distance phone call from Okinawa just to get them to offer to replace it.

At 19, I'm tempted to pick it up again as a refreshing escape from Macroeconomics and Brief calculus.The Twenty-One Balloons is an excellent read at the surface. However, it also offers up serious literary excellence. Any middle school English teacher, who would have their students read this book, would talk endlessly about the merits of the book. Foreshadowing, dynamic characters... it all flows evenly to produce a work easily readable for younger crowds but intense while still somehow whimsical for older kids.Overall, you won't be able to put the book down, and that's a serious assertion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Adventerous book!","review":"The Twenty One BalloonsIn the book, The Twenty One Balloons by William Pene du Bois a professor crashes on the island of Krakatoa in a hot-air-balloon then to discover hidden treasures on the island.

He then crash-lands on the island of Krakatoa then discovering a huge diamond mine and villagers hidden on the island.I very much enjoyed the book because I love adventure books and there is always something new to find on the island. And the only thing that was a little boring was the beginning but once he landed on the island it got much more exiting.

There is only one good song, in my opinion, and it is.....just alright. The album is not produced or mastered very well, and the lead and background vocals are not very polished. Don't get me wrong, Lucinda can sing - it is just that she....tries too hard at times on this album. She misses at least one note on literally EVERY SONG. I am not saying that to sound critical, I am saying that make a point that for me, personally, I do not like when singers that can clearly sing well, try to....over sing songs with unnecessary runs and vocal acrobatics - it does not add anything of value for me, it merely distracts, and that is the feel of this entire album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"Not even a little bit.

So I explored the option of a new charger, hoping that I could find one for dirt cheap, and hoping that it was an issue with the charger and not my phone. Needless to say, when you can get something for 2 cents, which I did (plus the $2.98 in S&H;) that is a great deal in any regard.It works. Plain and simple my W810i has survived falling down 500 foot mountainsides, water damage, as a doggy chew toy, flying out of my lap from the car onto hard asphalt, who knows how many times, and so on, and I am glad it will continue to survive for hopefully at least another year or two.The one problem with this charger is it is a little snug when I plug my phone in, and occasionally the phone will keep beeping (signaling it is beginning to charge) until I unplug it and plug it back in. Just an issue with an old phone I guess, and a charger that may be slightly too big.

Di Prima delivers on raunch, providing a wild tale of sexual exploration that begins with the main character (arguably Di Prima, who drew heavily from personal experience) losing her virginity and ends with the character's first pregnancy. Though sex is certainly the book's most prominent feature, Di Prima, a respected poet and one of the few female Beat writers to make a name for herself, also discusses her own artistic development and describes the life of a starving artist in New York in the fifties. Di Prima's no-holds-barred honesty (the sex is real, with all of the funky smells and personal quirks) and her joyful appreciation for the finer details in life (e.g., a good cup of coffee, well-sugared) separates this book from the murky sea of erotica"},{"rating":"1","title":"So engrossed in sex as to be indistinguishable from porn.","review":"I picked this book up because of my interest in the Beats, feminist literature, and the American immigrant experience. I was disappointed on all three counts. First, the only thing Beat about it is the era depicted, though I think it is far more about 1969, the year of its publication, than the '50s. Secondly, writing explicitly about sex does not make a writer a feminist just because she also happens to be female. It merely makes her a female pornographer. Thirdly, what little is mentioned of di Prima's heritage seems somehow pathetic and ashamed. Too bad. I doubt I will go on to read other di Prima work, but I suppose there must be something there in order for her to have been so highly regarded. This book is a waste of time and money. How was it picked up by such a major publisher as Penguin? Could it be that important an artifact of the '60s? It offers us nothing of the Beat Generation, and is an embarrassment to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Di Prima an honest voice","review":"Diana Di Prima, an honest female voice in a literary landscape that was a man's world.

In 1998 Universal released a Psycho Collector's Edition (which is $5 cheaper) which compared to the 2008 release has a different format (a better format I think), the same bonus features as this new release, the only difference is the Collector's Edition is NOT a two disc set. Obviously I had the 1998 Collector's Edition prior to buying this one. I thought this newer one would be better, its not. I expected more for my money. The DVD is already $19.70 + $2.98 = $22.68 and for what? Basically you're paying more money for a 2nd disc. Save $5 and buy the one from 1998.Don't believe me?

Now we cut away from the slightly open door. ....we hear that Norman is picking up mother...we , the audience are apprehensive..about finally seeing mother...We might think that Hitchcock will not tease us by just showing feet walking down the stairs..However, here is where his genius comes in ..we get again the dreaded \\"over head\\" shot of the stairs..( the last time we had this shot in the film is when Mr. Arbogast was done in.) Therefore, there is visual anxiety for the audience here..and with that the ( seemingly) appearance of Mother and Norman ..going down the stairs to the fruit cellar.This is not only pure cinema but pure audience manipulation.

Shocking the audience by killing off his heroine early on, he's the director who made viewers afraid to take showers. Hitchcock, who began his film career as a storybord artist, lays out each image in the film with precision, shot-by-shot drawing the audience into the growing horror of a deranged killer who could be lurching behind the desk of the next motel you visit. A masterpiece of suspense and shock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"She just goes a little mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes.\\"","review":"Psycho is considered by many to be the first and greatest slasher flick. I personally love Psycho. Like always, Hitchcock steps into unexplored territory giving us a completely original entertaining and psychologically exercising shockfest! The Bates Motel's got my reservations! The shower scene is still classic and always will be. Anthony Perkins is a good actor and Vera Miles and Janet Leigh aren't bad either. This movie is an hour and thirty minute mystery that leaves us screaming for more. Sadly, we din't get a sequel until 23 years later and Mr. Hitchcock had passed away a few years earlier. Oh, well we'll always remeber the classic. It'll always be the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best horror film ever....","review":"Psycho is the best horror film of all time. While new horror films rely on gore, Psycho uses tension, suspense, and a great score to thrill the audience. The shower scene is one of the most unforgettable scenes in cinematic history. Even more shocking is the staircase scene. Andy Perkins delivers what many consider his career defining performance. Current horror movies aren't scary; they are ridiculous spectacles of violence against teens and women. However, this movie set the benchmark that all of these new horror movies imitate. Most horror flicks make the audience flinch in disgust at certain brutal scenes, but this movie haunts the audience with psychological tension, and this makes Psycho much scarier than any movie out there. The remake of the film was a disgrace, mostly due to Vince Vaughn's unsympathetic portrayal of Norman Bates. In summary, all horror movies can't compare to Psycho. Gain some culture and watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make A Stop At The Bates Motel","review":"Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is best known for its unforgettable score and infamous shower scene which at the time of its release the most graphic murder scene ever filmed. But Psycho is so much than just a slasher film. It is an intensely compelling psychological thriller that draws you in with its riveting plot and first rate acting. Anthony Perkins is requisitely creepy as motel owner Norman Bates, but he adds so much more to the character. What could have been just a one-dimensional role, Mr. Perkins approaches it with depth and makes you wonder how Norman became the man he was. Janet Leigh is striking as Marion Crane who decides to steal $40,000.00 and ends up meeting her doom at the Bates Motel. Vera Miles, John Gavin and the great Martin Balsam all provide tremendous support. Psycho set the standard by which all subsequent horror films are to be judged."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been a fan since a kid","review":"This is by far my favorite horror movie of all times.

Bernard Herrmann's score is especially chilling. The strings all are sharp enough to send shivers racing down your spine toward the Bates Motel. The 90-minute documentary on the DVD is great, as are the other extras (which include the 6 minute trailer, promotional footage, production stills, and other things of the like).Unfortunately, the extra footage gets very redundant very quickly, with the promotional (and mislabeled \\"newsreel\\") footage basically restating what was said in the documentary.

No, this one deserves the best.It is more than just a scary shower scene. The story is strong. It's not simply a horror flick. And if it is the first time you're seeing it, there are some great surprises in store. If it is not the first time you're seeing it, you will remember it for life.

Don't see any indication from Amazon that the version(s) they have are black and white or color. I find it difficult to believe that in his lifetime Hitchcock ever okayed that happening.

To take anything away or add anything to it would ruin this movie. Psycho was filmed at a time when special effects didn't exist - and in this movie, they were not necessary.

You remove all that from most of today's horror movies, and you are left with a bunch of teens running around a movie set screaming and cursing every other word.Psycho is one of the greatest horror movies of its kind. You will want to watch this movie over and over again. Seeing it once just isn't enough.This DVD Collector's Edition is a must for every horror movie fan.

Whenever I see this movie, the music and the end where Norman Bates smiles at the camera still freak me out even though I have seen it and know what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all go alittle mad sometimes!(Norman Bates)","review":"I saw this masterpiece when I was 12 years old and let me tell you,I've seen alot of horror movies in my lifetime and this is the one that still scares me at certain points.The first time I saw Psycho,I was bored during the first 30 minutes of it.Untill Janet Leigh(Marion)got lost in the rainstorm and found the Bates Motel and meets Norman Bates played greatly by Anthony Perkins.Hitchcock was the master of his time and still is in our time,out of all of Hitchcock's films that I've seen,I believe this is his finest work...I recommend this film not only to horror movie fans,but also to fans of both Hitchcock and Perkins and also for people like me who want to be film directors.One of the greatest movies ever made and my second favourite film ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"The movie is great! Hitchcock is the master of suspense! And Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates gives a fantastic performance. In terms of the quality of the video, I think it was a little slow. A couple of times the video had to stop and reload. But that may just be a problem on my end; I'm not entirely sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie marred by technical glitch","review":"The movie was just as exciting as I remembered it but unfortunately there were several moments where the video and audio were not synched, and that was rather distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock's best","review":"I have never forgotten this movie from the first time I saw it in a theater. The shower scene scared me along with a lot of others there. At the time I had a Ford like Janet Leigh drove in the movie and would not open the trunk for a couple of weeks. I have it on tape and just had to add the Special Edition to my DVD collection of Hitchcock movies. It is one of his best. The fools that thought they could remake this movie were nuts. Part of what makes the movie so good is that it is in black and white. Besides no one can out do the master when it comes to mystery and the way he seemed to know the best actors for the roles. No one was as good at playing a Psycho as Tony Perkins."},{"rating":"2","title":"psycho(collectors)","review":"Well what is there left to say that has not been said said here already? This is the first DVD i ever bought and let me say it was no disappointment. The extras r to die 4 especially the making of documentary. It almost an hour and a half long! A have DVD for any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow but easier to swallow","review":"A devious office girl checks into a hidden motel after ripping a superior off of a large sum of money and deciding to return it, gets murdered instead. After a string of disappearences, some snoopy relatives find the motel. Usually one-glanced as an untouchable classic, some may see otherwise. The pace is too slow and the murder scenes aren't convincing enough. Also contains no suspence whatsoever. Black and white is good for this movie which the old timers will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Horror Film? Not even!","review":"I can't believe I wasted $2.99 to rent this movie on here. People are always raving to me about how awesome Psycho is, so I finally after years of hearing about it decided to watch it. And I have to say that this is a TERRIBLE movie. You say that this started the genre for Horror films? I say there's no way, maybe some of the 70's movies [and well 80's of course!] but this is in no way a 'Horror' movie. Its not scary, its not violent, its BLAH. I understand that its an old movie, and back then there was only so much you could do because of the technologically [and the fact Hitchcock didn't have much money to make this movie] but I think it could've been better then it was. I just have to say, for a movie that so many people rave about I'm pretty disappointed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the scariest movie ever made.","review":"I had expected a really good movie from Psycho because I had heard so much good things about it. I didn't ghet what I wanted, because this film is just terrible. The way the camera was shot was stupid cupid, the director could of done soo much better, the acting was terrible, the music gave me a headache and the screenplay and special effects were silly and made the film boring to look at.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), criminal on the run has just been stabbed and killed by a mysterious person at the Bates Motel. Now all her friends and family are looking for her, if only they didn't, they have got a terrible case of 'mother' on their hands.I do not recommend this film at all, it is no true classic, and NOT the scariest movie ever made.Also, the shower scene is absolute rubbish. And that is definitely NOT the most well-known and best scene in movie history."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a great classic","review":"This movie was so un-scary that the only reason it is a 'horror' film is the dishonor it gave to the name Hitchcock. All the 'shower scene' did for me was give me a roaring migrane with all that squalking and squeaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would almost be funny if it weren't so dull.","review":"The only admittance I can muster for this video is that it was probably influential in its day. However, all the praise heaped on Psycho is basically garnered from that and has very little to go on, in reality. Nowadays, this movie looks incredibly homemade and, at times boring, especially during the parts where it is obvious Hitchcock is trying to build \\"tension.\\" Plus, it's in black-and-white, which makes a movie look old right away. When Hitchcock tries to bring in the \\"psychological\\" element to the movie, it looks even worse, because it is dreadfully apparent that he has no idea what he's talking about. Thankfully, someone decided to remake this movie, but that wasn't very astonishing either, since everyone already knows from this movie what the story will be. Save your money and go to the theater to see any horror movie you want--it's guaranteed to be more believable than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycho","review":"Psycho is a love it or hate it movie. For some the psychological elements may be hard to grasp. It is not the type of movie that will cause you to jump out of your heart, but keeps you curious about what Norman is thinking about. Worth watching at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five-star movie --NO STAR REMASTERING!","review":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE LEGACY EDITION DVD--THE BLU RAY IS AMAZING (5-stars) AND WORTH DOUBLE DIPPING (or in my case triple dipping).I am not a techno wiz so I have no idea what it takes to remaster an older movie, but this was NO different than the collector's edition that came out several years ago. I was very disappointed as there is still a ton of specs during the movie and it's very grainy. In fact I am not sure this isn't WORSE than the one before. If they can take a movie from 1940 (It's a Wonderful Life) and make it almost flawless, why couldn't they do it to Psycho, which was made 20 years later. Very disappointing. The special features are all fine but half of them were on the other disc too. But regardless, you buy a dvd for the film and this is a major let down. I want my $20 back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliced but Nice","review":"Absolutely stunning blu-ray of this great film. I somewhat lament the loss of data on the top and bottom (as this is the theatrical presentation, cropping the full frame). IMHO, the picture (particularly the shower scene) suffers a bit. Still a must-own though. More Hitchcock please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films ever. period.","review":"This is without a doubt Hitchcock's best and is incredible in every way. There is brilliant acting from Mr.Anthony Perkins as well as Janet Leigh. This was a groundbreaking film that changed the face of movies forever. Although it's old, the story is one the really caputres you and sends a few chills down your spine. and who could forget the famous s hower sequence! supposedly, after the movie came out, there was a 40% drop in shower curtain sales. You know a movie is good when it affects sales!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycho Collector's Editon","review":"Psycho is one of Hitchcock's most well known and most suspenseful movies, and this DVD is just what any Psycho/Hitchcock fan could ever want. We get Psycho presented in widesceen along with tons of extras including the making of Psycho documentary,news reel footage,photo gallery and more. Great DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Undeniable Masterpiece","review":"Alfred Hitchcock has more masterpieces than any other man in history, though it seems. One of the best filmmakers, and one of the best storytellers in all of history. Psycho is no exception.The story of Norman Bates. With all the inventions being taken, this movie could have been a set up to fail, but it succeeds on every level.Must See. Definite Must Own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still scary today!","review":"When Hitchcock first released this film in 1960, it scared the shit out of audiences. Now today, it still frightens many viewers, young and old. The remake is good, but simply not the same as this masterpeice. Thankfully, it's not too violent, unlike all the new \\"teen slasher fliks\\" (Urban Legend, Scream 2). Followed by a excellent sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock's Best Work","review":"Ever since I saw a special about hi on AMC I've been an Alfred Hitchcock fan. I just recently seen Psyco and it was a great horror movie even for the 1960s. I recognized that many scenes fromPsyco were spoofed in such shows as Family Guy, The PJs and The Simpsons. I'd recommend this movie to Hitchcock fans and people who like classic horror films, but if you are looking for nudity then buy the remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCAREY AS HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS IS THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER (ESPECIALY THE SHOWER SCENE I JUMPED WHEN I SAW IT IT FREAKED ME OUT) ANYWAY PRETTY GOOD DVD AND EXELLENT MOVIE NICE PLOT TO."},{"rating":"2","title":"A career best. But why no Oscar for Perkins?","review":"Alfred Hitchcock wired Anthony Perkins to apologise on behalf of his film-making colleagues, after Perkins was denied an Oscar for his portrayal of Norman Bates. Perkins's performance is indeed remarkable, mature and haunting.The shower sequence is a masterpiece, but I think the scene in Bates's parlour where he and Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) discuss life - including Mother - is a poignant and brilliant performance by Perkins.Perkins became tragically typecast, but he transformed Robert Bloch's ugly-mannered Bates into a youthfull and tender-natured man. Psycho is an outright classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive horror film","review":"If you want the original crazy killer film, this one is it. Though it's in dull B&W, that doesn't matter. The spectacular performances, the horrifying music, the spooky atmosphere of the Bates Motel and the house, and the ever-classic shower scene really make for one of Hitchcock's best-best suspense films. And the way the film builds up to the horrid story of Norman Bates is also entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hitchcock's greatest films","review":"From the first time you see the original Psycho. You want to see over and over again. This master of filmaking will be enjoyed for generations of filmwatcher forever. A must see for student filmmakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great movie! It gave me big chills.","review":"Psycho was a great movie! Even though it was black & white it gave me big chills right after the shower schene. The music made it even more scary. NOBODY can replace Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and all the other actors were just as wonderful. If your looking for a good movie to rent, rent the FIRST Psycho. IT'S GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent~","review":"This movie was a great film! I just loved it. The black and white version is great. Im reading the book, too. Anyways, in this film, there is this girl Marion Crane (in the book Mary) that steals about 40,000 dollars and goes to stay at the Bates motel where no one goes that much since the new road was built. This guy, Norman Bates, is obsessed with his mother which lives on the house on the hill. (the big one). They are both maniacs, and im not giving away any endings. I've seen most horror films and this one was one of the bests!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true example of wonderful film making!","review":"Let me get this straight, I've read some reviews that people think Psycho is utterly dull, a disgrace to film making. Well, these people don't give a damn to great movies. I admit, to audiences now, it is not scary, but it sure is suspensful. For example, when Lila Crane is walking up the hill to the house, that is far more suspensful than any bomb or monster in any movie. Hitchcock knew how to make a shiver go down someones spine without any special effects. A true example of wonderful film making!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I remember Psycho being good but not this good! With enhancements in blu-ray and sound, this movie is crazy! (No pun intended). You will be amazed at the clarity despite its original black and white! Its visual eye-candy and the sound has been transformed from original standard mono to HD 5.1! The music score and sound effects in HD 5.1 sound terrific! Its a classic Hitchcock film with great enhancements that make this classic horror experience unforgettable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"psycho","review":"very good for this era, good to watch on holloween if you like a movie without cursing and a lot of blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Entertainment!","review":"This is how a DVD should be done.

This is a chiller classic and can give you goosebumps to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycho w excellent transfer and good extras","review":"I remember watching Psycho on TV when I was around 12-13 years old. I still remember the shocking parts well. 25 years later I thought that I remembered it so well that I wasn't particularly interested in re-watching it. Anyway, finally I bought the 'Universal Legacy Series' edition DVD, and I'm glad for it. First of all, the transfer/picture quailty of this DVD is fantastic (just like Vertigo in the same series). I watched it on a projector. And the movie is far better than I remembered, the actors are excellent and the black/white photography superb. Ok, you can always make a remark about the explanatory psychiatric speech in the end, but this was a requirement at the time to get it through the censorship! This, and other fascinating things, is explained in the interesting commentary track, well worth listening to after watching the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I always here good things about \\"Psycho\\", but when I saw it I was less than impressed. The screeching music gets old, FAST, and it is so slow moving that it is amazing to think anyone would (could) stay awake until the infamous \\"shower scene\\" (not scary at all, by the way). After the \\"shower scene\\" the film goes steadily downhill and ends too abruptly. Very overrated, and not recommended. The extra star is for Anthony Perkins' performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overrated...","review":"Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film, Psycho, is about a woman who gets killed at a hick motel in the middle of nowhere. That's about it. I don't see how this film is scary... it's in stark black & white and the \\"thrills\\" are few and far between. Simply put, Psycho is boring, and everyone knows that William Friedkin's 1973 masterpiece, 'The Exorcist' deserved the top spot on AFI's 100 Years 100 Thrills. Psycho is an overrated movie, but then again, all of Hitchcock's movies are overrated..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic film to come to blu-ray","review":"I loved this movie it's in my top 10 tens of all time. A classic film black and white. The acting and directing was great. Alfred was a great director enjoyed all his films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Pictures and Indexing! Some poor pricing!","review":"As mentioned before, the pictures and index system is great. The pricing however, is set so that the editor/writer can sell his surplus at a great profit, and pick up cars he is in need of, at a low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks in Hot Wheels history , not all HW products listed","review":"The history section is rather limited on a year by year basis. The Hot Wheels products released through the years are not all present. Pretty pictrues though if that is what you are intersted in. It is uncertain what the prices are based on since production numbers on the individual cars are not released by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for photos, LOUSY for Pricing info !!","review":"I must agree with one of the other reviewers here, that this book is really a sham for collector pricing info...even to establish a baseline. The photos are good, and certainly helpful to those entering the hobby, but I was very disappointed with this edition. The author is out to make a buck (or more), but has failed to deliver the book that I was expecting. Forget about the pricing, and enjoy the pictures........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment - Expected More for a third edition","review":"Strauss really had a great opportunity to ensure himself as THE sources for Hot Wheels information, and he blew it. Errors from previous editions were not fixed, information was withheld, and updates were not provided. Once this was the BIBLE of Hot Wheels collecting, now it's merely a book with decent (and old) pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lead, Follow, or Get out of the Way","review":"How amazing that a toy such as Hot Wheels should create political dividing lines, pro or against Strauss. Like it or not, as Hot Wheels guides go, this one is the best of the bunch. While improvement in several areas could be accomplished, clearly this is the best \\"one-stop\\" source for Hot Wheels info. No book is ever going to give you the up-to-the-minute value of a collectible. That is impossible. Use the pictures to identify and the prices as a rough GUIDE and you will not be disappointed. Cudo's to the Strauss' for doing a third edition, flawed or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is more than I expected!!!!!!!!

Most guides want you to find the car then have to find the price in the back of the book. Tomart's has the prices with the photos. The photos were also the best quality and in color. This was a big deciding factor for me when I decided to shell out my $29.95! There were a few model variations(i.e.Ambulance 1792-1991 with plastic siren) that wern't included but should have been. This is forgivable however, given the book's quality. Keep up the good work Tomart!

Too bad most of the new collectors buy this book, from recommendations from other new, uninformed collectors. Buy any of Bob Parkers books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other side of Devo!","review":"Awesome music with a distasteful cover art (go figure). Really like the 'western-sounding' flavor IMO. The lead singer from Devo was the singer for \\"How Can the Labouring Man Find Time for Self-Culture?\\"I recommend this album for anyone working on the farm.As good as Boys Don't Cry (you can't find any song from their one-hit wonder \\"I Wanna Be a Cowboy\\" so I have done random search, but there is an extended version you can request on Flashback Alternatives).Whether you like this genre of music or remember one-hit wonders from the 1980s, this album should hit the spot. A great listen on-the-go!It is probably safe to say you might have heard of Devo, but not heard of Martini Ranch. (Yes, again, ode to the farmer. Giddy-up! - I am no farmer.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid rock n roll album that doesn't belong in any genre","review":"I'm a fan of X and love Exene's vocals so I thought I would give this a try. This has become my new favorite album. It combines the old school punk stylings of X, with rockabilly/country and even surfy guitar riffs peppered throughout. You can't really classify this album into one genre, which is why I love it so much. My favorite tracks are Last Dance and Down Where It's Down. The more I listen to it, the more I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure what to do with it!","review":"I registered for a Boppy because it seems as though they're everywhere and on every \\"must have\\" list for nursing moms. However, 8 weeks after the birth of my son, I'm still not sure what to do with it. The only real use I've found is to prop him up by sitting him in the center. It's totally useless for nursing. I'm a relatively slender and tall woman and it doesn't fit around me at all - not even close! It's not wide enough to go around my waist and it leaves a big gap that he falls into. The only thing I use it for when nursing is an elbow prop when I'm holding him, but a $5 throw pillow would work just fine for that.I think the Bobby is very over-rated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Splendor of the Temple","review":"For those of you who are interested in old archeological times and histories, this books for you. Written by Mr. Alec Garrard, he gives you a backstory from the time of King Solomon's first temple and to the Babylonian destruction to the return of the Jews to Israel after the Persian victory. He gives you step by step time frames and a chronological timeline of it's entire history even up to muslim rule and finally to the rebirth of the state of Israel. Plenty of pictures on almost every page with closeups and his own miniature scale model of Herod's temple and temple mount built from years of research and investigation. The man constructed every tiny brick in his family's ceramic ovens to complete his rendition of Herod's temple. Excellent, thorough book on the Jewish temple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS VOICE IS THE MAIN INSTRUMENT HERE","review":"Another superb collaboration between senegalese singer BAABA MAAL and his close friend guitarist MANSOUR SECK .Western african harmonic folk melodies are alternated with a sweet emotional and sentimental guitar playing through the whole recording very vividly .Among the best voices worldwide and one of the best world ethnic recordings ever made ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me hammer, got me axe, do you know why?","review":"The author has a good solid grasp on what it means to be a dwarf.

Unless you have a basic understanding of chinese you will learn chinese with no context and therefore not be able to use a word of it (or sentence of it -- we don't know what we're learning, so how can we use it?). My son and I are learning it together and though he's a stud at it, even he can't figure out the meaning of what we are saying.A big disappoint given the hefty price.

Mandarin, to the English speaker, is so very, very foreign. Before you realize it, Rosetta Stone really does teach you the language in a very simple, go at your own pace way. Rosetta Stone shows pictures of a girl, boy, woman, man, dog, cat, etc. and an accompaning sentence below. Before you realize it, the student learns which word(s) mean what and this continues through the lesson into more and more complex situations. Highly recommend the product!

Reminds me of an assignment I had in a college writing class to write a descriptive paper about watching someone eat a sandwich. It might be a good writing exercise, but to the reader, it's pretty dang boring. In fact, I found \\"Lunch at the Piccadilly\\" so boring I quit reading two thirds of the way into the book. Life is too short to read boring books! I highly recommend Edgerton's other books, but this one is not worth the time or money. Sorry, Clyde."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"\\"Music is Just Poetry Without Words\\"","review":"The title for my review epitomizes Edgerton's writing style and story in \\"Lunch at the Picadilly.\\"This is a story of the subtle relationships that emerge as we all go through the different stages of our life.Edgerton once again manages to create inventive characters and throws them together for humor and thought provoking moments. There is a little mystery, a little love, a bit of saddness but most of all truth.You don't have to be from the south to enjoy this novel (but it definitely helps)!

Blackout not only passes that test it gets straight A's both in its coverage of technical details and in drawing the reading in to its plot. Digital TV, which I know more than anyone wants to know about, is a complex issue - so far mainly a technical, political and economic disaster. In Ward's book, just like real life, American's are addicted to their good old analog TV, until - unlike real life - Ward's TVs begin to blow up. While this may sound fantastic, Ward manages to weave in accurate details without leaving the reader behind. Indeed, once he establishes his characters and the technology background, the pages turn faster and faster until the reader slams into the conclusion. In sum, an easy to read beginning that draws the reader into an exciting techno-thriller plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting new techno-thriller","review":"This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.

However, as I read through this book before letting my daughter have it, I was appalled at the quantity of negative content in it. The entire setting is among people who are very much the opposite of the beloved characters in the rest of the books: they are rude, aggressive, and degrading toward children. There are several instances of gratuitous violence, graphic descriptions of the macabre, and even a character made out of a dead girl. The morbid tone throughout the book is disturbing. It is not in keeping with either the description of this book from the editor's reviews or with the nature of the entire series.

I've read books for fourth graders with more depth, developed characters and plot than this one.

Look at his early paintings and see all that they have in common with everything else he did. Notice his reoccurring primary palette, his interest in outlines, how a turning windmill could perhaps have some connection to his decision to turn a canvas on end, and his love of nature and quest to understand everything as a vertical and horizontal mark.

For example, he leaves out many details about pond construction because he believes it should be made from concrete, and should be left to a professional along with electrical wiring, surveying, and landscaping.As far as a reference book on koi, I found it to be excellent, and it certainly gives a different perspective on pond setups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning!

Could've seen more of Ron Pearlman, though.Yes, there are a couple of cheesy moments, but the good stuff far outweighs the bad. Very very enjoyable film. Looking forward to a disc release, and hopefully an extended edition - rumor has it that Weinstein and Co trimmed 15 min off the end to make the movie fit on one less reel, saving money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy Canadian Blu-Ray!","review":"As has been reported elsewhere, the blu-ray version of this entertaining and well-done mash-up of fantasy and scifi, Beowulf and Predator-like narratives, has been irresponsibly and irreparably ruined in the transfer offered by Alliance of Canada. Similar to what Alliance did with Se7en, they have cropped the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 down to 1.78:1! Not sure what \\"genius\\" was behind this decision, but for anyone wanting to see this film in blu-ray, hope the currently financially-challenged Weinstein Group are one day able to offer this film in the US with the transfer it deserves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Unpredictable","review":"This is one of the better movies I've seen in a while (theatrical releases included). The characters are rich, not forced into stereotypes (e.g., the jealous rival). The extended backstory is revealed in manageable bits that add to rather than detract from the suspense. Plus, Jim Caveziel, Jack Huston, Sophia Miles, Ron Perlman, and John Hurt - how bad can it really be? Take a risk and rent this - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See Movie For The Adventurer","review":"I was pleasantly surprised and pleased to view this DVD movie. It's surely proof that a great movie does not have to be at the theater. The story is superb and imaginative. A man from another world in out space crashes onto earth and finds himself among tribes of Vikings. A powerful evil creature plagues the area he now inhabits because it arrived with him unintentionally. Feeling responsible, he is compelled to exterminate the beast. He will need help but he must earn the trust of the people around him because they recognize him to not be from any place near them; if they only knew. Get yourself a big drink, snacks, a compfortable place to sit with some friends and you are all set for a great movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film! Can't believe it didn't hit theatres!","review":"Outlander is one of those movies that really suprised me. I picked it up because I am a big sci-fi fan and I like Jim Caviezel but honestly wasn't expecting much more than a rev'd up syfy channel type of movie. Boy was I wrong! This flic is fantastic. The special effects are amazing for a film this low-key and low-budget. The creature is especially satisfying as it rides the line between creepy, cool, and savage the whole way through. The actors are strong and the story is original and enjoyable although it feels like it gets a little hung-up at times(not to bad). It even has a pretty suprising twist 2/3rds of the way through. It looks especially nice on blu-ray with the surround cranked up. If you see this at your local store grab it, or order it here. You won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent Sci-Fi","review":"In some ways it has elements of Beowulf and Highlander. The cinematography, acting, and special effects are all spot on. A good flick when you feel like something a bit different."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING-best portrayal of Vikings in a movie so far............","review":"have seen the following movies pertaining to vikings , Pathfinder, Beowolf and The Vikings and I must say this movie is as real as they were, the premise is a little out there but the movie is so freaking beautiful the Morwen is really eye catching and makes you wonder where the Dragons and Vikings combined, If you love fantasy with a thinking twist or new unique creatures then this is for you, LOVE this movie,"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTLANDER is Underated","review":"After purchasing this supposedly B-movie sci-fi/historical mix, I can't believe how well done and cool this movie was!How was it this wasn't pushed at the movies? It is just as good as most other sci-fi action movies, with better and fresher concepts, as well as some special effects, as many other films of this genre.Like Pitch Black, this sleeper movie will definately please those action/adventure junkies out there that don't even have a clue about this fun and exciting film.There are some big name actors here, and they do a decent enough job, but it is the alien monster and the pacing and look of the film that wins the day. Actor Jim Caviezel should stick with these types of movies.When you mix sci-fi space men and alien monsters crash landing on earth during the Viking age, you can't help but sit up and pay attention.A must see film for those who love fun and exciting popcorn movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY, A WONDERFUL FILM, RIVETING ACTION!","review":"I have sometimes been misled by very favorable reviews of DVDs. This one is exceptional! Have watched it time and again. Friends who have watched it with me agree and have recommended it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly 4 stars, but close enough","review":"I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if it was an option. This was a good movie; entertaining. Way too violent for my usual tastes, however. Some scenes were just over the top violent. The acting was good. Overall, a good sci-fi movie, definitely reminiscent of Aliens, Predator, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outlander","review":"One of the best SciFi's I have seen in recent years. This was a rental based on a few reviews at Netflix and a pleasant surprise it turned out. Many of the recent films of this genre lack story and character development, but this does not suffer that as much. The hero doesn't seem quite right at first and Ron Perlman is underused, but otherwise fairly well cast and acted. The special effects actually didn't make me laugh at all, which can't be said for many SciFi movies being released recently. The back story when viewed is actually good and leaves us feeling some sympathy for the beast. The Vikings are believable and the costumes, sets, and weapons go a long way in bringing us into that realm. Well worth at least a rental. I am seriously thinking of buying it because of the good replayability and Amazons sell price. If you enjoyed this, catchThe 13th Warrior.CA Luster"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outlander","review":"True Sci-Fi fans will find this tale believable and inspiring...makes one expand ones concept of life in the universe.The acting and story line is above average.The special effects are above average for the time period produced...In fact, while perhaps not up to the current action film standards, the effects merge well with the content of the picture. With a little imagination, this story could easily have been turned into a series worthy of following."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serviceable","review":"If you're looking for a movie with a great premise but so-do execution this is the one for you. I tolerated it and found it watchable because the lead actor gives a decent performance and I like the era. However the person(s) in charge of historical accuracy and costumes should be fired. Everything looked like Xena Warrior Princess and the \\"Vikings\\" didn't act like Vikings at all, be it their customs, their dress or their symbology. The script was half assed and the direction/cinematography was crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"After an ultra-brief theatrical run, Outlander finally sees the light of day on DVD. Jim Caviezel stars as Kainan; an otherworldly traveler who lands on a Viking-era Earth. Along with him is a revenge driven, murderous beast called the Moorwen, that wreaks havoc on the populace that Kainan now finds himself an honorary part of. Truly mixing plenty of elements from Beowulf and Predator alike, Outlander is a fun and surprisingly inventive sci-fi opus that is definitely more worthy of having a big time theatrical release. Caviezel is good, as is Sophia Myles as the lovely princess and John Hurt as her father the King, and Ron \\"Hellboy\\" Perlman is on board as well in a brief, but more than fitting, role as a rival clan leader. The only real flaws of Outlander lie in its CGI effects work, which really display just how small a budget director Howard McCain and crew had to work with. In that respect alone though, Outlander is surprisingly good sci-fi fare, and definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outlander","review":"Sci-fi adventure where the future revisits and tries to create a Viking Saga. Seven more words needed to complete task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Co-Stars try to carry the movie.","review":"The plot line on this is plain silly and predicatable from the trailer from beginning to end. However, I did watch the whole thing. Some of the lesser character actors were enjoyable and gave a kind of humor to the story that made the interplay between characters \\"fun\\". In retrospect, the plot was distracting and the characters were fun, but couldn't carry the film for the whole movie.One last note. I usually enjoy Caviezel but not this time. The movie took itself too seriously. It would of been better with a \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" feel and have more fun with the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outlander","review":"Very good movie entertainment: A Viking tale with a powerful blood thirsty alien. A movie mix to cement you to your chair until the last sentence has been spoken! I would not spoil a second of the movie for you with even minor details of this tale. Please, honor the R-rating... you would not be doing the kiddies a flavor by allowing them to watch this oneOutlander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly yet Satisfying","review":"My friends and I rented this thinking it was going to be one of those terribly done films you typically see on the sci fi channel. Once we started watching the film however our expectations were cast aside as we quickly discovered that there was a lot of effort put into this film. If you can get over the fact that there are alien races out there that are for all intensive purposes \\"human\\" this is a really fun film. I wouldn't spend a lot of money buying it but if I saw it for under ten bucks I figure it would justify the buy.My verdict is that this is great for a group of guys looking for a fun popcorn movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sci-fi viking flick","review":"Having read internet buzz surrounding this film for months and frustrated over an extrememly narrow theatrical release I had my expectations a bit high for this film, so when I first gave it a spin I was a bit let down. This is not the holy grail of fantasy sci fi films and it definitely has it's flaws but upon a second viewing, a few months later and with more reasonable expectations I was pleasantly surprised. This is a decent, very enjoyable movie. Some odd casting as noted by other reviewers re the viking king and, as also noted elsewhere, a wasted Ron Perlman. That being said I did like this movie and wish there were more like this to discover. Pick this up along with The Mutant Chronicls for a great low budget sci fi double feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see a movie come from nowhere to amazon TOP movies!","review":"I watched this a couple of weeks ago, and said to myself \\"wow...a great flick\\". I'm glad to see it's now one of the best rated movies to rent on Amazon. It deserves it. If you're looking for avant garde genre-breaking plot, this isn't your ticket.

Loved Jim Caviezel as usual, Sophia Myles was great.","review":"Jim Caviezel was great, as usual. Wulfgar (whoever the actor is) was a great character and didn't fall into the usual brute trap.

Mostly because of its viking appeal, which I love. But I have loved other movies with Sophia, and James (Kainan) reminds me of a man I know and love. The plot mixes sci-fi with historic romance. If you're looking for another Beowulf, this isn't it. You can nit pick all you want about the historic inaccuracies, but understand that the movie is for entertainment.I loved how there are easy tie ins regarding Annunaki, reptilians, and humans, as well as the quest for more 'land'. (That will most likely go over everyone else's head).I can see why it wasn't much of a big hit, it seems like an EXTREMELY good Sy-Fy channel movie (though its not since their brand movies are always laughable and the acting sucks). Thats why I didn't give it 5 stars. It isn't a Braveheart, closer to a 13th Warrior type flick. So if you liked that, you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good movie!","review":"I liked this movie. It had (James Caviezel) in it, the actor from CBS's Person of Interest. He plays a space traveler who crash lands on a planet. He had a lizzard type of thing on his ship, the animal starts killing everone on the island. because of the time period that he landed in, his weapons are limited to bow and arrows swords and axes. It's almost like a preditor durring that time period. they end up killin it. and he thinks about goin back home to his planet on a rescue ship but decides to stay and be the new king of this group of people. I thought the movie was gona suck but it was pretty good. It is really something that is worth renting well worth the 4 bucks! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable SciFi Movie! Recommended!","review":"Outlander was a surprisingly good movie! No plot spoilers from me: Set in and around an Iron Age Viking village, this is a tale of an \\"Outlander\\" stranger who brings death and destruction with him as he attempts to destroy a very powerful creature. There is a very interesting back story and a good explanation for a lot of the character's actions. I also thought that they successfully merged the futuristic elements with the Iron Age culture very well.There is a lot of action and gore, but not so much as to be distracting. The cinematography, plot, and acting were very well done and the characters were nicely fleshed out (no pun intended). The creature effects were fairly good, but the CGI was a little lacking.Recommended for fans of SciFi, Fantasy, and horror genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Underrated Movie Should Not Be Missed","review":"The mystery of \\"Outlander\\" astonishes me. It has all the fixings of a Hollywood blockbuster - great story, timely themes, great actors, good special effects - and yet it got all the marketing treatment of a b-movie.Regardless, \\"Outlander\\" is a sci-fi fan's dream come true, a wonderful melding of futuristic science fiction and medieval warfare. The movie even extends beyond most sci-fi scripts and tries to establish a backstory of the \\"creature,\\" even gives the creature a name, a motivation and intertwines its history with that of the protagonist.Don't get me wrong, \\"Outlander\\" isn't a perfect film. It suffers from being just a bit too long and stumbles over a few cliches and movie moments that will make you say \\"Saw that coming,\\" but it is so original and fun that it should have gotten more attention than it did.Four stars for the movie, and an extra star out of pity. Five stars total for \\"Outlander\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This movie reminds of me of Pitch Black and others that flew right under the radar. Amazing special effects!

The special effects are impressive. The dragons look life-like and vicious. The fighting scenes are bloody. For example, there's a scene where a person was beheaded by the tail of the dragon. The suspense is gripping. For example, when the dragon hunted people and ate them in the fortress at night.The background scenes are spectacular. They show gigantic mountains, and beautiful waterfall.The love story is briefly depicted but it's touching.In short, it's definitely worth watching. I own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for $1.99 rental","review":"For a cheap SciFi thrill, this isn't bad at all. Basically a Connecticut Yankee in King Aurthur's court mixed with Alien. Characters actually have some depth, and there's an interesting philosophical twist on the Alien angle. My only complaint was the pixelization artifacts in the darker scenes, even on the downloaded version. It could of been a black-level adjustment issue as well, but there's no easy way to adjust that for the Amazon player without a test pattern. That and Jack Huston's character makes him look a little too much like Johnny Depp.I was also quite suspicious of lava caves in Norway, but it seems there are actually active volcanoes there.4 stars because of the bargain price, otherwise 3.5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Like It","review":"I really really wanted to like this movie after I read the back of the DVD cover. ***SPOILER WARNINGS***But in the end it had way too many flaws and wasn't exciting at all. Here is this guy with unimaginable advanced knowledge and weapondry and he uses it to shoot a tree? They kill a bear and he waits until they are back at the compound to tell them this while the creature goes on killing? He dives back to his ship only to pick up pieces of metal instead of raiding the weapons locker? I just think the movie would have been better by actually incorporating his technology with their cutting weapon capability. The story did not do that, just give him a more powerful sword - woopdi do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outlander - not a movie that goes with the Outlander book series!","review":"I was so disappointed to get a movie that was not about the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon.

Great creature effects save what would otherwise be a cheesy movie. What would have been Beowulf reborn for the Nth time is instead quite unique. The acting is meek, a sad display considering some of the talent in the film. The monster is awesome- Gimme a hour and a half of the creature destroying stuff and I'd be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien meets vikings!","review":"If you like sci-fi movies like alien well this one is for you. What I really appreciate about this movie beside the fact that it has everything to please an audience is the originality of placing a creature like alien in a natural setting instead of a spaceship. Outlander is set in a viking era, so it gives the action scenes a lot more to interact. You will see beautiful forests, waterfalls, caves where the creature is roaming and hiding. The actors are very good and so is the story. And for the first time the movie has the correct aspect ratio of 2.35 that was not available in previous releases. My final word is that this movie is perfect for any sci-fi or creature fans, excellent special effects and action with great performances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlikely, but rewarding","review":"The premise of this Sci-fi film are a bit of a stretch, even for the world of sci-fi, but the realization is very well done. The alien is one of the best jobs I've ever seen on film, and though Caviezel is a bit wooden, he does an adequate job as the \\"star-man\\". It's good to know that quality sci-fi like this is still being produced out of the main-stream, which allows the exploration of themes and ideas that might not be normally considered by the hollywood machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding movie, Just one metalurgical error.","review":"This was certainly better than the cartoon version Beowulf. It was fresh and fun. Full of adventure and action. My biggest problem was when Canaan said we need stronger metal. Well viking age technology used carbon steel in their weapons. A piece of metal was recovered from Canaan's ship. To be stronger or harder than carbon steel the piece of the ship would have to be Titanium or Beryllium. Both of which have a forging temperature well beyond what a charcoal air driven forge can produce. I guess it could be some kind of space metal not yet discovered. Well, still a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Contrived","review":"A very contrived and for the most boring entry in the Beowulf rip off collection. The movie is slow paced, the acting wooden, the monster (when it is seen), average. The \\"space man\\" among the Vikings shtick has no purpose and is only alluded too. The plot has no twists and zero originality. Not particularly enjoyable, but not projectile vomit inducing either. Don't bother watching till on Sci Fi repeats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"If you enjoy the SyFy Channel's 'original' movies with their third rate acting, script and plot, then you might enjoy OUTLANDER.As a long time fan of sci-fi, I can usually find some underlying qualities in a movie with that genre.Not so with OUTLANDER...it's the worst of the worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as heck!","review":"This is such a lame excuse for a Sci-Fi movie and it's not even entertaining. The plot is basically just Predator set in Viking times with a stupid semi-love story thrown in. What a waste! You'll notice a bunch of 2nd-rate actors that you've seen in other movies and they are all unable to breathe even the slightest bit of life into this movie. I should have done something else with the 2 hrs I wasted on this junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"I tried to watch this movie. It had an interesting opening sequence.5-10 minutes into it I realized the acting is terrible, the plot(so far) is predictable and cliche, the dialog is on the nose and full of exposition. My sister and I are now laughing at every single scene. This movie is terrible. If you like bad TV-shows then you might like this film. I feel sorry for the director who definitely tried. Big sound effects, special effects, stunts, and very professional and highly skilled cinematography. But the director lacked one thing, a sense of who to cast and a sense of how to fix bad, over acting.I've wasted my 3-4 dollars on this film. I would be very angry about it, but I'm not because obviously someone spent a lot of their life making this film, and doing the best they could.I have turned it off before seeing the end and am moving onto another film."},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"Absolutely shocking.If some odd folks in Holly-land with waaaayyy too much time and money on their hands decided to get together to create the dumbest f***ing movie of all time, then Outlander put that group of idiots at the top of their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"I am a huge fan of any kind of medieval movie, especially when it is mixed with Sci Fi, so I had my doubts when I read the storyline of this movie. However, when I saw it I was pleasantly surprised. It is kind of a combination of 13th Warrior and Beowulf stories, and the result was actually better than 13W or any of the various Beowulf movies out there. Although I wouldn't say that the history is totally accurate, which is why I only give it a 4, I still recommend it for anybody who is a sci fi and/or a medieval history fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion of the Outlander","review":"This is a good \\"B\\" movie. Basically its about some dude from another planet that lands here during the viking era but in standard fashion loses all his futuristic doodads and has to use viking stuff to hunt an alien monster.

I watched the entire movie, so it's not bad; it's just not that good. If the writers had altered a few basic points this would be a great film; for instance if the monster appeared to be even a tad sentient, the entire plot would become heavier. Also, The monster is too large, basically. This basic fact spoils most monster stories. The story plods along pretty well. The monster waits patiently while the characters develop their interactions and slight storyline. The ending is predictable and broadcast weakly, but it's still enjoyable.It feels like the original story was going to explain the Beowulf myth by interjecting aliens; but that possibility gets lost along the way.

This movie should be called \\"Outlandish\\"","review":"Okay, I watched this movie because of the reviews from other people, but I was totally disappointed. Science fiction meets The Vikings... It doesn't really mash together well. Come on, a space alien dragon named moron or something travels through space or time with this outlander guy to reek havoc on a viking community, but everyone thinks that outlander is the killer. Boring... They try to go after moron (I think that might be his name) but there ends up being two dragons, blah blah, blah,... Guys don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"42 minutes was all I could stand","review":"It looked good on paper: Jim Caviezel, John Hurt, and a cool sci-fi concept, but lordie, it's bad. Bad bad bad. Writing is bad. Acting is bad. Makeup is bad. No reason to continue watching after 42 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours of my gone","review":"One of the worst movies in recent memory. Why is there no option to give ZERO STARS?I so wanted this to be a decent movie. Well, it was not ment to be. What was John Hurt doing in this I will never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SCI-FI Flick","review":"One of the best sci-fi movies in recent years. I was shocked that this movie did not get more fan fare. It is in the mold of Pitch Black meets Beowolf! Can't wait for the Blu-Ray, I will buy that as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Sci-fi? This movie is for you.","review":"As usual, ignore the critics if you like good sci-fi movies. This movie was awesome! The moorwen was cool, the acting was good, the effects better than any sci-fi original. An instant cult classic ala Pitch Black.I really wish this had had better (or any) marketing and distribution during it's VERY limited theatrical run. I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen. Still, as the title states, if you like sci-fi movies, then go get this one on DVD. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Scene","review":"I really liked the scene where he downloaded the Viking language and it was actually pretty painful. Not sure why the executives seemed to have slashed the budget in post production. I don't think the creature was fully realized. In other words, it seems they felt the film would not be a blockbuster so cut the CGI budget and opted for a cheaper version of the alien?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"The numerous positive reviews surprise me. Effects are good but acting, story and writing made wife and I exchange yawns and puzzled looks formthe duration. After watching 15 mins, we were worried we could have gotten free on Netflix, it was that bad. You can rely on reviews like we did or choose something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting concept, very good","review":"I will agree with some of the previous reviews that some of the parts were cheesy, but they took an interesting concept and did a very good job of it. Acting is a bit shaky in the beginning, also a tad cheesy, but picks up very well, good action scenes, good acting for the most part throughout. I would definitely recommend watching it, it's worth the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Perfumed.","review":"It's perfumed.

Ordinarily I love Dickens, but this one wasn't such a page turner and there were no attractive characters at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"Funny situations the Pickwickian club members get themselves into. Read at bed time, easy to pick up and put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting to say the least","review":"Good read so far. Can't wait to read next one as soon as it comes next week. So far I only have 2 parts of serial. What a great Idea to republish it the way it was intented tobe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pickwick Papers","review":"Dickens has produced a humorous story about some very interesting characters. He has cleverly revealed the disgusting conditions of the prison system for debtors and a corrupt and lax legal system without interfering with the continuity of the story. His characters are well defined, with Mr. Pickwick showing a complete ignorance of the lives of the ordinary folk, while still showing a compassion for the less privileged. An excellent story about social conditions in England, told in an interesting and light-hearted manner. Amazon has produced an a very readable copy of this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pickwick Papers","review":"Dickens is hilarious! This is a comical look at high and low society in England in the 1850's. You might recognize some of these characters - they could be your relatives, friends, neighbors - people are still the same. Reading the book on Kindle made it easy to check meanings of words like hosteler, portmanteau, trundle, and vicarage. Follow the wacky adventures of the Pickwickians as they travel through England, managing to live well without doing a lick of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Executed E-book","review":"This edition (ASIN B002RKSXJQ) is poorly formatted. There is a wide left margin throughout, and the amusingly long chapter titles get progressively smaller every few lines.I was willing to put up with it until I came to the scene in the parlor at Manor Farm, which appears to be missing some text. Either that, or Dickens is more post-modern than I thought, trailing off (with no punctuation) in the middle of a sentence.Amazon needs to do some quality control on this edition, and remove it from the store. There are plenty of others, why waste our time by listing inferior product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"formatting issues","review":"It's free - that's the major plus of this edition. As noted earlier, there are some irritating formatting issues, such as the lack of consistency in chapter headings. However, far worse is that this edition omits anything that isn't pure text, such as a key illustration and lines of song/poetry. It's still a funny book and worth a read, but keep in mind you'll be missing some jokes just because they were left out by the editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before there was Prozac, there was Pickwick","review":"Joyousness saturates this book. In a spare moment, you can grab it, read a page or two, and your whole day feels brighter. Slapstick comedy and wordplay and satire abound -- it's as if Dickens's chest must have been bursting with a thousand jokes, and this book gave him the opportunity. You come away feeling as if you'd spent a week in the country among friends, laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, action-oriented, not the Dickens I thought it would be...","review":"Pickwick and his entourage fumble their way through 18th century England.. it's a long book that sometimes seems longer because of the density of Dickens' prose. But it's also surprisingly fun and funny; you get to know the characters through their actions and the incidents they put in play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and superficial","review":"Being a Dickens fan, and having read all of the other Amazon reviews, buying this book was a no-brainer for me.Unforunately, the work is TOTALLY lacking in depth. All the characters are completely two-dimensional, if not one-dimenional: they lack development and in no way resemble real people with real emotions, desires, fears, etc - they are mere caricatures. Worse, the plotline wanders aimlessly. Certain passages do evoke chuckles, but the great majority of the writing is lifeless and indeed boring.This is the work of a very young Dickens, and it shows. At this point in his life, his writing skills had simply not yet evolved very far. The 700+ page novel is simply undistunguised and totally forgettable. I would HIGHLY recommend any of Dickens' more famous works (most notably Great Expectations), but this one is a waste of time. Do not let others lead you astray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickens' Best","review":"It's not often that I laugh out loud when reading, but Pickwick has many such moments. (See, for example, Mr. Winkle's equestrian adventure.) While Pickwick foreshadows some of Dickens' later work on social concerns, such as debtor's prisons and interminable estate litigation, mostly it is just a fun and funny book, with an endearingly aimless plotline and lovable characters. If you thought Dickens was all about darkness and tragedy, try this one. It's a real gem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs are missing from the text","review":"For some reason, all the songs in the book are missing from this free Kindle book. In at least one case, a song was the punchline at the end of a chapter, so it is a major flaw. I solved the problem by downloading the free epub version of Pickwick Papers and converting it to Amazon's MOBI format using the free Calibre program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"How could Dickens have written this book--so wise, balanced, informed, witty, tender, loving, and intelligent--at such a young age? I'm glad to have finally gotten around to reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Dickens with a sense of humor","review":"In college, I took a Dickens class. We read about a book a week. Needless to say I didn't get around to Bleak House. But I read Pickwick Papers, mainly because I was amazed at how funny it was. Dickens rivals Twain in his biting sarcasm and humor aimed late 19th Century society: The usual cast of slimebags appear; the criminal system, petty thieves, and lawyers, just to name a few.This book is a delight, and not all that laborious. It takes on all the political issues of other books, and leaves you with characters that are very real yet utterly fictitious; and since it was written in serial format originally; one can't wait to find out what happens next to these sheltered, naive, silly aristocratic characters who surely must have influenced Monty Python's Twit of the Year competition. Except Mr. Pickwick; the dignified President of the Pickwick Society. He's a twit, but one with moxy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No maps in Kindle Penguin edition","review":"The book seems great, but the whole reason I ordered it was to refer to the maps and notes - plenty of notes are there, and there is an enormous legend for the map, but no actual map in the Kindle anywhere. So half of your reference material just isn't there if that's what you got it for, as, 150 years after being published, that's most of what distinguishes a new edition like this. I emailed the publisher, but two weeks later they still see no need to get back to me, so consider this a defective edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion in a nutshell","review":"I have read Oliver Twist and found that this book's language was much more difficult to follow.

All the cuts are funky as expected, but I would of enjoyed hearing more hard funk jazz instrumentaion over the top instead of the more vocal tracks. Nonetheless, the CD still hits on all cylinders from the softer funk track \\"Duji\\" to the dirty groover \\"Fire Eater\\". If you're looking for some funky breaks, then you need not go any further than Pleasure's \\"Bouncy Lady\\". The CD on gets 4 stars because it fails slightly to live up to Pulp Fusion: Fully Loaded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless to anyone with an internet connection","review":"This strategy guide is useless to anyone able to search sites made by Battlefield 2 fans. The statistics such as weapon firing rates are outdated because the many patches that have been made for the game have altered numbers for balance reasons. It doesn't even mention over a half dozen of the game's weapons & several vehicles because it was published before either expansion pack was released.

As the owner of an envelope manufacturer, he had to make his success by selling well, building relationships, and always coming through on his promises. His experience is invaluable to anyone in the business community. His advice on networking and sales is excellent.

I do recomment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sales Primer","review":"Anyone interested in making sales (Any type of sales) their career, would benefit from reading this book. Much of the text borders on the obvious, however it's strange how often we neglect the obvious. I first read this book (9) years ago. I continue to pick it up to this date as a refresher. Harvey Mackey does an excellent job of making this a \\"I can't put it down book\\" Non-avid readers will breese through the pages.

Don't listen to the \\"thubs up\\" guy if he would have listened to Harvey he would not be in the position he is now \\"2 years latter\\". Harvey gives the reader real life examples of how to get ahead in your life. If your looking to get ahead in your job read \\"Sharkproof\\" by MacKay. Harvey's writing style is great, you can't put the book down.... I have read all of Harvey's books and have went out and bought more to give to people I have met who want to get more out of their life and their job.... in fact I applied one of Harvey's story's to my own personal life and got a job starting out at 40K per year. I highly, highly recommend ALL of Harvey's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swim with the Sharks or stay out of the water","review":"One of the top five business books I've ever read.

My AR, with pistol grip, works but the fit is not ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential long gun cleaning item","review":"I bought this as a gift for someone, only because I own the same one, and it's probably the single most useful gun cleaning accessory I own. Very easy to use, and incredibly helpful for both cleaning and working. I'm able to use all my long guns, from rifles to AR's to shotguns. The upgrade model is designed to handle breaking barrel/receiver guns better (friends have it and love it), but I get along just fine with the original.A great buy and essential in my opinion for long gun owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby!","review":"I needed a gun vise for a few projects so I purchased the Tipton Gun Vise. I really wasn't expecting much because of the plastic construction but when I opened the box. I was surprised at the ruggedness of the vise and the quality that was built into the vice.

The other session was Miles' first as a leader, and it is awesome. Miles plays great and Charlie Parker and John Lewis give good contributions. These sets are worth getting because of the rare chances to hear Miles's first sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soap!","review":"I love this hand soap. The pump is more convenient and less messy than the traditional Lava bar soap. I use it at the basement sink to clean garden grime off my hands and it works really well.

When I opened the package, one of the pump handles was not locked and the inside of the package was a gooey mess and half the product was gone from the bottle. I tried the lock-down on the handle and it wouldn't lock, so I think the problem is the manufacturer's, In shipping, the bumping around had managed to pump out half the contents. When ordering, be sure to tell this supplier that they must tape the handle down or something to prevent this. I sent the product back."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent author","review":"This book starts out with the legends of the native Americans about where things originated.

I haven't seen the Richard Gere movie yet but I can't believe it will measure up to the quality of the writing and the amazing edge-of-your-seat and yet literate caper tale that Mr. Irving relates. I know he's meant to be a rogue, but I also know he's one of our best living writers, who has written some splendid novels (including \\"Trial\\", \\"Tom Mix and Pancho Villa,\\" and the great art forgery tale, \\"Fake.\\") This current book, a first-person account of the Howard Hughes Hoax back in the 70s, is the way memoirs are meant to be written: from the heart, witty, with not a word out of place. You read this and you think, \\"I'd like to know this man.\\" He's wise and droll and he's led an adventurous life that few of us even dream of.

It kept me interested, especially when \\"Gabriel Macht\\" was in a scene, (personally, I think he steels the show) but it has its other strong points as well.

Some of the lines are cheesy but overall, its a clean, fun movie worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Outlaws","review":"This was a great movie.

For monthes I've been waiting for Farrel's sophmore film, and it wasn't a dissappointment. He does a fine job, as does the rest of the cast. The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is it lacked originality. Parts of it played out too much like \\"Young Guns\\". Other than that, it was what summer movies are all about : A Helluva of fun. Now let's wait for Farrel's next film, \\"Phone Booth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's face it...it ain't Tombstone and it doesn't try to be","review":"I really enjoyed it. One could argue that it was because I'm sixteen and I enjoy eye candy when I see it (hello Will McCormack, Colin Farell and Scott Caan!). It's a good flick for if you want a couple of laughs...some action and you want two hours for yourself. It's good for the general audience it's trying to reach but let's face it. It's not Tombstone, so don't try to stack it up against it. It doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, VERY BAD","review":"Can somebody believe those baby face actors, look like tough cowboys? I've always seen men playing cowboys in films, not smooth-faced teens. And who had the idea to put a rap in a western movie? If Colin Farrel wants to be a good actor he musn't accept these characters, and Scott Caan is very far from be that good actor his father is. And Ali LArter? She looks like a Barbie in cowgirl disguise, it takes more than a pretty face and whipped cream bikini to be a good actress.Keeo your money in your pocket and buy one of those good old western movies, you'll see good actors and good movies with good plots. Not this nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"I got to see this movie a week before it came out for the sneak preveiw and I was so upset I was going to have to wait a week to see it again, lol.

Actors grade C-. Action C. Special effects/Graphics C+. This movie was not that good at all. It was far too short. It ended at the climax which is very bad. The acting was horrible. The storyline was fiction based. I felt like I was the one that got robbed by Jesse James for $6.50. If they even think of a a sequel to this they are very mistaken. A very disapointing movie. Jesse James and his brother and his cousins the Younger's go to war with a railroad company."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pain","review":"Oh man, this movie scarred me for good. I had to watch it in a history class, which is a complete farce, since this is about as historical as the Lord of the Rings. To make matters worse, the movie is awful. The frequent attempts at humor are totally abysmal, and you can see the actors' embarrassment. What is this anyways? A Western for adolescent girls? What are a bunch of hairless pretty boy actors doing portraying wild hoodlums? What's with the pointless, gratuitous romance? What is this crap? Where are Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef when you need them? Unless you're an adolescent with an IQ between 30 and 90, avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"This movie is the one that should'nt have been made.

I saw it once and on that day I was so interested in the movie that I could recite everything that happened when the movie was over. I only do that when the movie is really great. And this film was how I saw it...GREAT! This movie was great because it was combined with Western action, comedy, and a little bit of romance. I hate romance but the connection between Colin Farrell (Jesse James) and Ali Larter (Zerelda) was adorable. I wish I was Jesse's wife because he is gorgoeus! I guess one reason I liked this movie was because of Colin's amazingly good looks. LOL! I highly recommend this movie to anyone. So grab a seat, get some popcorn, and watch an excellent movie, and I will tell you that you WILL be drooling over Jesse James! lol. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Outlaws","review":"American Outlaws is as much a traditional Western as A Knight's Tale is a traditional sports film. The two have much in common with one another given their irreverent, don't-care approach to the material, and both have one common ingredient to spare - FUN.American Outlaws centers around the exploits of Jesse James, but don't expect much in the way of historical accuracy. For any who even TRY to bash the film for its faults in this category, the movie simply laughs and shakes its head knowingly. It's hard to criticize a movie that revels in its own goofiness. That's exactly what makes American Outlaws so entertaining - not to mention some fancy, eye-dazzling gunfights and a charismatic team of young actors.If American Outlaws fails on any level, it seems to come to an end far too quickly. It's a short film, point of fact, and it almost feels like you've just seen a trailer as opposed to the feature itself. But it's a darn fine trailer, well worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional Garbage","review":"While early film offerings, such as \\"Jesse James,\\" supported the myth, and even some solid recent films, including \\"The Long Riders,\\" \\"The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James\\" and \\"The Great Northfield Raid,\\" bent facts to condense the story, \\"American Outlaws\\" has to qualify as the biggest piece of trash ever made from the standpoint of passing itself off as a serious Western. Mostly, this garbage allowed its cast of pretty faces the opportunity to play \\"cowboys\\" like a group of grade-school youngsters. Being a fan of American history, the West in general and the James-Younger Gang in particular, I remember going to see this film when it came out, and the only reason I didn't walk out was to make sure it was trash from start to finish. If you are looking for a Jesse James collection, try those early films and -- by all means -- purchase \\"The Assination of Jesse James\\" when available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shooting Range Hidden Feature","review":"In the special features menu, simply go to the bottom of the menu ( main menu, etc.) and go to the right with your control.

A train will appear. Press enter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie!!","review":"This is one of the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It tries to be Young Guns but fails on many levels! The complete historical inaccuracy really bothered me. Especially when they had the James' mother die after a raid by the Pinkertons. In reality, the James' mother lost her arm and their retarded stepbrother died in a raid even though the James bros. had retired and were living quiet lives with their families. The James Bros then come out of retirement to rob a large northern bank to exact revenge for their mother and dead stepbrother. Now I find that much more compelling than this drivel. Sometimes the truth is more interesting than hollywood's fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever.","review":"American outlaws is the coolest movie ever. It is about a gang that robs banks of money to build a railroad.The reason they do this is because the people who are building it killed thier mom.

He would go every weekend to see this one. The only other time I got him into the theater was to see Tombstone. American Outlaws has it all. From romance, to comedy, to history, to drama - it fulfills all areas and fulfills them well. Gabriel Macht who plays Jesse James brother, Frank was superb. I would compare his performance to that of Val Kilmer in Tombstone. Frank James made the movie for me! He was absolutley brilliant. We took our eight year old son to see this movie after we saw it the first time. He loved it. There is VERY LITTLE profanity and not as much violence as one would expect. This movie is a must see for any western/romance movie lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good outlaw movie","review":"\\"American Outlaws\\" has many entertaining scenes. Its action scenes are very unique, especially the bank robberies and their plannings. Colin Ferrill gave Jesse James his intensity that he deserves.

If someone gives you this video I might suggest watching it if you are unable to think of anything better to do. You would be insane to waste any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I must agree with critics nationwide, American Outlaws is one of the WORST films this year. Colin Farrell does a good job as Jesse James, but is in this film only as Eye Candy. One of the highlights of this film is Timothy Dalton's performance, but even he has his flaws with his so called accent.Kathy Bates has a small, ... role as the James' mother. Ali Larter also has a small role, and she too in this film ONLY as EYE Candy! Scott Caan only adds baaad humor to this film. The film is moreless a comedy than western. Very little action, LOTS of comedy. Really, the world could've went without this film, it was only made to make money, which it's not doing. All the performances are nothing but humorous. The film is very short,THANK GOD, about 95 minutes. The whole film is VERY,VERY,VERY BAD! If you want to go see a better film, see Curse of the Jade Scorpion! If you want to go see a baaaaad comedy, go see this film! One of the worst of the year! Grade D"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a BAD movie!!!","review":"This movie was terrible. It glorified murderers! Sure they might have intially started because of the railroads who were murderers themselves but the gang killed a lot of innocent people who had nothing to do with the railroads.

Better acting could have come from auditions at my local high school. Believe me, this is one that Colin Farrell will wish his whole life he could forget. The budget must have been tiny, the director and writer must have not seen any westerns, and based their production on Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman!For those of you that think it is a five star film, I pity you.

Although this tent-style greenhouse is a little cheaper than the polycarbonate models, one of the big fabric panels was ripped all the way up to the top, the whole structure was REALLY flimsy and we had no confidence it could survive our sometimes-80 mph winds. We had to send the greenhouse back because of the rip anyway, but rather than replacing the ripped panel, we replaced the greenhouse with a polycarbonate model (which we LOVE!).

Okay, now what? Who cares about the people in this book?I've handled some serious custody cases, and some that were not as intense, just like the one in this book. Of course everyone's adversely affected. That's stating a non-sequitur. The effect of divorce and custody on kids is a story that definitely needs to be told.

Particularly toward the end of his career, Piazzolla tended to become his own cliche, recycling a lot of the same harmonies and chord progressions. Saluzzi never does this--I own four of his recordings and every one is different. His music is probably something of an acquired taste--it doesn't have Piazzolla's popular appeal and there's less of a direct connection to tango--but it's fascinating stuff and well worth more than one hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maintenance Management Course","review":"Used \\"The Handbook of Maintenance Management\\" in a Continuing Education Course at a DOD installation.

I was forced to go back to Sephora to see the NARS colors that I had read about, to find cheaper similar colors and textures. I feel this book should be free, because all it does is sell NARS makeup. It does not explain how to use makeup, but simply which of NARS makeup to use on the face.

He mentioned that makeup articles in \\"these books\\" are blatently unrealistic because of the retouching, yet I didn't see one blood vessle in the eyes in any of the pictures in this book. He also says you should \\"notice the woman, not her makeup\\", but isn't that hard to do when you look at a face with acid green, orange and gold eyeshadow topped off with bushy eyebrows? All of the models seem to be in the same age range and are obviously professional models. How does this benefit the reader who really needs and wants advise? Why didn't he pick people off the street to really get his point across? The pictures are large and self explanitory, but he was better off choosing a wide variety of women based on age, race etc. so everyone benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider this book!!","review":"I knew nothing about applying makeup outside of what I had learned about applying the basics.

My big gripe about the book is that out of all the photos there are only 4 women of color, big disapointment.There is a thin see through microfilm sheet of paper on top to show you placement of the makeup products and their name.The makeup applications are great, no explainations on how to put it on.

The theme song is performed by two different vocalists, one female, and one male and they both do an amazingly beautiful job with it; very classy. The man who plays the harmonica is also talented.

On my last purchase I've bought the ones with the new Rolling System. The idea sounds perfect but it just doesn't work when you are packing.Once you have your clothes inside the bag and seal it, the act of rolling it demands strenth and caution (as the plastic can easily blow). The air won't come out through the seals.At the end I cought myself leaving the bag partially open, rolling it (using my knees on the floor) and then sealing it. My wife said she wouldn't have the strenth to do it.These bags are real space savers but rolling system doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poorly executed.","review":"I have used this type of bag for several years, traveling nearly every week. This is the first time that I have purchased this brand and it will be the last. The first time I used one of the large bags, I sealed up some clothes for 3-4 days as a test. The bags did not leak - great news. When I opened the bag, it ripped away from the zipper. Thinking I had been too rough with it, I tried again with a second bag. Same result. The bags that I have been purchasing from Target have been holding up for 15-20 trips before losing their seal. I was hoping for at least that much durability from the Space Bag brand, but I'll have to be disappointed.The plastic feels too thin to hold up to frequent opening/closing cycles. Maybe if you are going to seal it up then put it on a shelf, these may be for you. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail.","review":"Yes they do compress, but you're better off rolling the air out of a ziploc bag, then buying this.

I also noticed that it's difficult to even deflate the air out because the air backs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"These worked really well!","review":"I used some of these bags on my recent cruise vacation and I was able to bring a lot more clothes as a result. I probably could have packed the bags more carefully, and had fewer wrinkles, but some items did not need ironing anyway. Easy to follow directions for putting clothes in, you snap, then zip it shut and roll from the zipper to the other end which has air release \\"valves.\\" I probably decreased the clothes volume by 50%. They worked very well, and stayed shut during a long flight both ways.

I packed clothes for a 1.5 week trip to Korea, and this really helped out. Not only does it reduce the volume the clothes use in the luggage, it also keeps the clothes clean and compartmentalized. The space bag does take some effort to use since you have to roll the air out. As I rolled the clothes, the clothes typically shifted towards the end of the bag where the trapped air is expelled. This seemed to block the vent and prevented further air from being pushed out of the bag. However, I just had to jostle the bag to shift the clothes towards the other end of the bag and then continue rolling, and more air got out. Its not difficult, and much better than lugging a vacuum around. Overall very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bags break pretty easy","review":"I bought a few spacebags and they ended up breaking. One when I slid it on the tile to put it in the closet.( a pin hole. made the bag junk) One when I was pressing a blanket in the bottom... the seam broke. The others seemed to get air back in them over time in the attic. The under the bed bag works the best even though still letting air in over time.

They're essentially giant Zip-Loc bags, and honestly, I think I can achieve the same result with a Zip-Loc bag.It does remove all the air out of the bag by rolling the bag filled with clothes, and it is vacuum sealed. However, when I opened the bag to get my clothes out, the zipper ripped the bag along the top edge rendering it useless. So my suggestion, if you decided to buy this product, be careful on how you open the bag.The other issue I have is with its usefulness. The bags don't really save that much room in my luggage. You're restricted to how you pack because all your clothes are restricted to the bag. In the end, I was able to pack more items in my luggage without the bags by just tightly rolling up my clothes into logs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Bags Defeat Fee-Happy Airline Charges!","review":"Ever since 9/11 I've hated traveling.

Well, those days are gone. With all the airlines charging fees left and right to make up for their near-bankruptcies, I'm relieved that there's a solution - Space Bags! I stuffed 2 weeks of clothing into one checked bag (instead of two) thanks to these deluxe ziploc bags. They cost $15 but are reusuable, whereas I would have been out $20 to check in a second bag. While they aren't perfect (repeated use caused one to tear), the bags allowed me to maximize space in my carry-on. They are ideal - I plan on using them more in the future.

The small air escape mechanism forced me to position the bag in such a way to allow the air to escape. Secondly, if you don't hold it right there is a chance you'll pop the bag.

I don't know about anyone else, but it just makes me feel weird to think of TSA agents tossing through my undies! If they can see what's in the plastic bag, they usually won't open it up.The bags work multiple times, but eventually seem to lose their ability to seal up. I've had some pop because I smooshed on them too hard and fast while trying to push the air out and I've had the zip top stop sealing.

The light has 4 settings: low, medium, high, and high strobe. The brightest setting is very powerful, almost unnecessarily so for normal conditions. Typically while camping I find the lowest setting more than adequate. While biking at night I use the flashing mode to alert cars. Haven't been caught in the rain yet so I can't comment on the water-resistance.Only issue I see with the light is the hinge mechanism which allows it to tilt down. The design is basically a very crude plastic ratchet. I would imagine that adjusting the light many times might wear down the \\"tooth\\" and eventually stop working properly.

Bright, water resistant, comfortable. Perhaps a bit heavy, but that's OK.The problem I discovered quickly was in the ratcheting mechanism. It is the serrated mounts that allow the headlight to swivel up and down for aim. It is way too weak and there is NO way to tighten it! Because of the weight of the light housing and the bottom mounted ratchet, the light has an awful tendency to flip down! You cannot run/jog with this light because every step causes the light rotate and face straight down (or in your eyes!). You cannot go hiking with it. One hop off a rock and the light flips down. I cannot use it in canyoneering. IN a waterfall the water just pushes the light down immediately.I'm a very mechanically oriented person, but the only solution to this would be to glue it in your ideal, or straight upright position. But then you cannot get the batteries out!Still looking for the perfect headlamp......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gread head lamp","review":"I took this headlamp on an overnight hiking camp out.

This meant blindly pushing buttons until I acciently found the secret handshake to get the menu on my display. It holds it there until a power failure, and then we start over again.Then, over time, it started having trouble recognizing blank disks. Then it would recognize the disk and record, but not be able to finalize the recording (sometimes, even though it showed a FINALIZE FAILURE, the disk would be OK. Sometimes not.)

It shifts everything toward the green.It stops recording (some of the time) if there is a gap in the tape you are trying to copy. My old videotapes are full of these gaps. I think this problem results from Lite-on's (similar to other manufacturers') concern that I might copy copyrighted videotapes. So, the recorder is very sensitive to anomalies in the signal. Of course, this makes no sense because the law very explicitly allows people to make one copy of any copyrighted material for his or her own use.But this is not what I was trying to do, anyway.

It seemed as if it was totally made up on the spot. There are 8 moves and you do 3 or 4 \\"rounds\\" of each move. There is no set time for how long a \\"round\\" is, it appears to be totally random. So it is very repetitive and boring. You just get so sick of doing the same move over and over again.There is a lot of starting and stopping. Alot of \\"walk it out\\" and \\"take it down\\". The background crew spends about 50% of the video hopping around and high-fiving each other and going \\"Woo! Alright!\\" This makes it difficult to get a good cardio workout out of this video.

If you can stand still listening to this music, you are probably not alive. Baaba Maal mixes it up with a fantastic contemporary sound, electronics and all, and traditional Senegalese music. His singing is powerful and dynamic, and the instrumentation is wild yet captures the nuances of his voice; or is it his voice that captures the nuances of the music. You can decide that for yourself, but don't miss listening to it. If you like more traditional Senegalese music, perhaps earlier Baba Maal will be for you.

Unfortunately the remaining time on the disc could not be filled with more overtures, as these were the only ones recording in Quadrophonic sound, so pleas for the rest to PentaTone are to no avail :(These might be old recordings, and not 5.1 multi-channel, but they are still glorious in their Quadraphonic recording from the 70s.

It came within 5 days and I figured that was because of the Holidays. The address label showed it being shipped from Walmart. This concerned me but the contents were in good condition. It was sold as new and I am happy with the order. The dust jackets are perfect but the outer sleeve had a little crushing. These books are a great addition to any collection. I bought them to replace the paperbacks I had that were damaged in a flood. I can't wait to start reading them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's true; this version is wretched.","review":"Please listen to the other reviewers here who have said how awful this rendition is. I borrowed it from a friend because I'd just read the trilogy and was excited to hear it enacted, but I was sorely disappointed. The man reading the part of Frodo is so completely abysmal that I had to stop listening partway through disc two. I was so psyched to hear the story enacted that if Frodo had at least been passable, I would probably have listened to the whole thing. Instead, I bought the BBC version and am quite pleased with it. One caveat is that this version does include some sections that are omitted from the BBC rendition. In my opinion, if you really want to enjoy those sections, read them in the book. If you want to listen to a well-done and entertaining audio version of these books, please buy the BBC recording instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best...","review":"Regarding the Leatherette edition: overpriced and of mediocre quality. There are many older versions out there that are far superior. Try snatching one of them at an antique bookstore or something. Or just go for the nice Folio edition.This 'leatherette' version is just fat and ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collectors beware","review":"Ok so the world is a big place and it's full of strange people but I am surprised that anyone could be very impressed with the \\"Leatherette\\" editions of LOTR and The Hobbit. These particular editions are not ones I can imagine any discerning collector would want to own.I bought the two books because I am not a fan of Alan Lee's work and I couldn't find any other current hardback editions that used Tolkien's original drawings, (as the \\"Leatherette\\" Hobbit does). The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Beware of These Ratings!!!","review":"While both the books and the BBC adaption with Ian Holm are magnificent, the Mind's Eye (the version supposedly being referred to by most reviews) is absolute garbage. The voice acting is relentlessly undignified. Many characters seem to have inexplicable speech problems as their voices range from Goofie-like to Mickey Mouse-like. If you can bear to listen to the LOTR saga reduced to squeaky weirdness (I believe the smurfs analogy in a previous review was particularly apt--this is the Lord of the Rings as performed by smurfs) then by all means choose this set. However, if you want to hear a dignified work that truly conveys a sense of the grandeur, history, and nobility of the story, then the only option is the aforementioned BBC radio edition, with Ian Holm, Peter Woodthorpe (the ultimate Gollum--he must be heard to be believed), and other top notch actors. Please make yourself happy and get the BBC version."},{"rating":"2","title":"great edition at least just for the 400 textual corrections","review":"i have several versions, but this one is probably the most accurate and i feel that if you are a hardcore tolkien fan, you owe it to yourself to pick this book up.in addition, the 5 book set is by Easton Press (not Eastern) and they are available directly from Eastonpress.com. they are 5 volumes (lord of the rings, hobbit and silmarillion).--addition: if you are interested, there are UK versions of this book (in addition to a limited edition of the Hobbit). also, at least 3 paperback versions exist of the new 50th anniversary, corrected edition of LotR at least in the UK/Canada."},{"rating":"2","title":"The LOTR 50th Anniversary Edition","review":"Great book set!

Yet I have to say, regrettably, that I think Lord of the Rings is grossly, grossly, overrated.The dialogue is execrable. The poetry and songs are (largely) grating. The descriptions are (largely) uninspired. Most of all, the characters are as tangible as a Ringwraith without a cloak.It can't be that it seems cliched to me (it is the first - and last - fantasy novel that I have read). It can't be that I am too cynical (I thought The Hobbit was excellent). It's just that this fat lump of a book is plain poorly written. Sorry, Tolkien fanatics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why people love them so much, I will never know.","review":"Many people belive these books to be some of the greatest books ever written. I, on the other hand have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and do not believe them to be that good. Sure the story portrays a classic theme of good vs. evil, and the plot is a good one. However, these books are slow moving and not very exciting. In fact, the books are pretty boring overall. There isn't enough action and there are usually long, drawn-out conversations. I really don't believe that these books are worth reading, and if you really want to know what they are about, watch the movies. They are excellent and a lot more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was let down.","review":"Ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be a confusion regarding which edition we are evaluating. The book advertised is a paperback, and you are talking about the rich leather binding -- on a paperback?As to the content, the only reason I read it is that everyone I knew had read LOTR. I was curious, and ordered the book, only to see that in order to understand the book (I like to read first things first) you had to read The Hobbit. In my opinion this is like a fairy tale, and I think adults are too old for fairy tales. I care much more for realist literature, or books that write about someone strange, like The Stranger, by Camus; or Sartre's Les Mots. Also, LOTR is too long. Even Anna Karenina (and that is great literature) is shorter. The only reason I read LOTR is that I'd heard about Bored of the Rings, and wanted to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring!","review":"The books have super detailed descriptions of the geography of the places, which made the reading way too tedious. Besides, heroes are supposed to act like heroes, not like cowards. And that IMO is what Frodo is: a coward forever denying his mission. I could not finish it, not even out of curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst, most overrated series","review":"Ugh, this series is terrible. In fact, everything by Tolken is terrible. Reading his work is like pulling teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Towers is good","review":"I read this as a kid and here's my general recollection: The first book is insanely and unnecessarily tedious. The second book is quite good, easily the best of the series. The third book is so-so; I never finished it, though. The Hobbit is better than all of them.Tolkien was a below-average writer with an above-average imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and full of surprises!","review":"In this book, J.R.R. Tolkien describes the journey of men that are on a quest to destroy \\"The Ring\\". Throughout this book, Tolkien shows us how partners could have a great or horrible relationship. He casts shadows on all of his characters and has many surprises during this time. Though the characters have different views they all relate to today's common person. No one yet has created such a world where adventures like this happen.J.R.R. Tolkien showcases the fact that anyone could be the person to help the world. As readers are pulled into the text, they realize many important themes that can be put into life and many different situations. I recommend this revolutionary piece of art to all dedicated readers who are looking for a book that will grasp them and pull them into a fictional world."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get this confused with an unabridged book reading","review":"This is the radio version of the the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Everything is an understatement.This book was the deciding factor in my choosing to become an English teacher if that says something - which is should."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"For the longest time I wouldn't read Lord of the Rings because I thought it was too geeky. Well, now I know what I was missing. This is a great edition because once you read Fellowship you will want to read to other two books, so you might as well go ahead and buy this affordable single volume version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the books but this recorded version sucks","review":"I was very disappointed with the acting and production of the 9 CD boxed set. It seems to have been produced for children. The voices of the actors are more suited for Disney fairy tales than for Tolkien's Mastepiece. The actors use goofy Cokney English accents - Elves sound like Munchkins - terrible. Do not waste your money on this. I listened to the first CD and boxed the whole thing back up for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice, but...","review":"It's true Tolkien is THE king of fantasy, but this book is too slow motion. I really liked the characters and the journey, but sometimes it seems there is nothing else to read than \\"they got up, ate a few, walked a lot and slept\\", so i found it quite boring, and i finished it within 3 months, which is quite unusual for me. Worst of all is i think the first chapter, if you don't know nothing of tolkien's world you get completly lost with the Hobbits history!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the rings is no doubt superior to any other book","review":"I read this book when I was nine, and, now at 13, I have never seen better! J.R.R.Tolkien's books are MAGICAL! with his descriptions of characters and places, you enter into his world and see everything as clearly as he did.

It is as much a requirement as reading Proust, Joyce or Kafka. A joy from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Epic in a convenient single volume","review":"The single volume edition is both a blessing and a pain in the neck. The epic, one of the best ever written, is such a gripping story that once I begin reading the story (over and over) even from the middle I just can't put it down until I've read it through to the end.This means, however, lugging the heavy and large volume around, whereever I go. Separate volumes make this process easier. However, the joy of having everything in one place, the entire story as one book (as it was meant to be) is great.I spent too much time reading the forwards and notes concerning the various editions and corrections made to the story from print to print. I would recommend putting that off until you finish the main story (perhaps a few times). The appendix and notes following the story adds much to the experience.Once you finish the story, do read the Silmarillion."},{"rating":"2","title":"~*!*~AMAZING~*!*~","review":"I am on page 622 and i am addicted, all who consider buying this book 'throw cation to the wind' spend your money this is the best book i have ever read in my entire life, begin reading it and you will be thirsty for more, it helps to read the hobbit and the many other books written by the amazing tolkien authors, i am on buying them right now!The cover gives it a bit of...pizazz you could say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of Fantasy","review":"The Lord of The Rings is by far the most extensive, complex, and rewarding book I have ever read. It has all the qualities which make it a great story: characters, plot, dialogue...It is also prophetic, poetic, romantic...I started reading it a little over a year ago and I'm abou to finish it. To say that I liked it wouldn't do justice to the work. It has been such an envolving ride, I mean I felt captivated by the world of Middle-Earth and everything in it. There are not enough words to describe the feeling that one gets while reading this book. I hope everyone that reads it enjoys it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Box Set","review":"Rather than reviewing Lord of the Rings, which has been done many times by many people with a finer grasp of describing the wonder of the best book of the twentieth century than I, I shall remain content to say that this boxed set is neatly presented with Alan Lee's fine artwork on the outside. Many readers will find copies of Tolkien get rapidly dog-eared from frequent use so to have a box set that can be kept in a prominent place on the shelf is nice. It is also well-priced for its new design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy! Buy BBC instead.","review":"Please do NOT buy this version! It is horrible. For example, listening to Gandalf and Sauruman speak to each other in this version is like listening to two old geezers exchange pointless barbs in a nursing home for demented patients. Part of the reason it is so bad is also that the BBC version with Ian Holm is FANTASTIC. I still remember listening to the BBC version as a child and how it transported me to another realm. It took me years to find the BBC version to buy -- I finally bought it in England years ago. Now that you can buy the BBC production at Amazon instead of the Mind's Eye version, do yourself a favor and buy it instead of spending money on Mind's Eye. You will appreciate the difference. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most serious Tolkien fans will find this disappointing.","review":"I don't really like this production. To me the characters are all wrong. They way that elves are depicted seem very childish as opposed to being noble. Didn't like the portrayal of Bombadil either. Most of the characters are either over the top or come across as slow witted. If someone were first introduced to LOTR with this production he would be put off from reading the books and miss out on what a great work LOTR is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some thoughts on all books, really","review":"I've got an old version of the Lord of the Rings, more than twenty years old.So, some thoughts on the book.It is no doubt one of the best ever written, a real pioneer of fantasy. There are a great deal of reviews so I'll add just two things.First of all, the ending of the trilogy. Even nowadays, I hardly ever find a fantasy work that describes what happened to the heros AFTER the tale was over, after the heroics and saving the earth, etc. Lord of the Rings shows what happens when the Hobbits return to the Shire and have to fight to free it.The single thing I didn't like was the trip through Mordor, not because it was a dark section but because precious (notice the pun ...) little happened.All in all, a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This is a reread.

I was wrong though. After hearing the first disc, I googled it and it appears this is from 1979. It shows as the sound is, to me, poor, and the effects are weak.I look forward to getting the BBC version recorded in the 80's as I hear it was a lot better production."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Elves, Dwaves, Orc and the such, then read this.","review":"This may well be one of the best books ever written. Some people may like to think that Gone with the Wind(GwtW) is on par with this, but I would have to differ, GwtW may be an increible love story but in my mind it doesn't compare. Medival fantasy is not drivel as some people would like you to believe. It is the more opened mind people out there. You don't have to like Dungeons & Dragons to like this book. Just have the freedom of imgaination to let Tolkien take you to some place you have never been."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 5","review":"I have read the LOTR every few years or so and it never gets old.

This should be required reading for every student. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book!","review":"I like having the entire trilogy at my finger tips and the beginning goes over somethings that i hadn't seen before in the individual books.

Soon after, I saw the cartoon movie (though I don't think the cartoon did the book much credit). Then, again, when I was in eighth grade, I read \\"The Hobbit\\" because I was told we had to read a novel for reading class. This time I liked it even beter. No, let me rephrase that, I loved it. Then, I read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for the first time. I loved this book even more. It is the epic story of a world facing damnation, when, everyone comes together and rises up against their opposing force. Tolkien paints pictures and creates emotions that make the book feel real.

I meant to get the unabridged reading of the books and couldn't listen to more than a few chapters of this. The voices are terrible, cheesy and unlike who they're described to be, the musical interludes are long and dull, and so much of the description and explanation is edited out that it's hard to follow. However, I love the books and wanted to hear it in its entirety, so if that's what your looking for than definately go with the narrated version by Bob Inglis - so good and he does all the voices spectacularly (it also helps that he's English)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply mesmerising","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a rare thing, a book that is every bit as captivating the tenth time you read it as the first. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this truly amazing series. Each installment is just as brilliant as each other.

I can't recomend these books enough, if you only read one series in your life make sure it's the Lord of the Rings trilgy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I guess the fault was mine in choosing this product. I didn't notice that it was a dramatization. I thought I was purchasing the complete Lord of the Rings trilogy read word for word.

The appendix comes with hobbit family trees; a summary of the second, third and fourth age of Middle Earth; a history of the kings of men, and dwarves; the languages of Middle Earth that includes the equivalent of elvish and dwarvish runes on our alphabet. It also includes pages from the book of Marzabul (the book that Gandalf finds near Balin's tomb), wich is featured in one of the chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring.

Unfortunately, it is in fact an abridged dramatization about half the length of the original. As a dramatization, this American version is fair -- it uses actors to read the actual but abridged text.

The story in itself is absolutely incredible, but Alan Lee's paintings add a lot, being very beautifully detailed.

He also has an excellent singing voice; I was astonished to find there were so many songs written down in the books. The only major problem I had with this set is that it was finite.I had never heard of Mr. Inglis before listening to this set. He actually made me look forward to an hour-long commute.

It consists of all the different races in Middle Earth like the Wise and Majestic Elves; The sturdy dwaves ; the proud and tall men of Gondor; the \\"not-so-hasty-Ents\\" and so on.If you have seen the movies then don't think that you don't need to read the books cause the movies shows only a fraction of what takes place in the books.

R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece, others have done that much better, just read some the remaining reviews. Instead I would like to give my two cents to this specific edition: while it is dubbed as \\"Collector's Edition\\", I had to find out the hard way, that it is not really set in new type but only photo-offset from another edition which leads to an irregular print with lots of flaws in the appearance of the different letters. If you know the book, just compare pages 6 (photo-offset) and 7 (conventionally set) for excellent examples of blurred acharacters vs. clarity and excellent readability. In my personal view, this is not the standard I would expect from a \\"Collector's Edition\\" let alone from the price of this book. - I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Kindle edition","review":"I've been reading and re-reading Tolkien for 45 years and have numerous editions of the trilogy. When I bought the Kindle it was the first book I bought. Sorry, the Kindle version is very poor.

The \\"Millennium Edition,\\" which looks so nice in photographs, is in fact small (each volume is about the size of a trade paperback), badly printed on poor paper, and exceedingly shoddily made (the first time I opened a volume in a bookstore, the binding split right through). The volumes are not even real hardcovers, just paperbacks stuck in thin, skimpy covers of shiny board.I REPEAT: this is a lousy edition, grossly overpriced! Beware of it! You'd be much better off with a set of paperbacks you could replace for $15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trilogy / Movie - Wonderful","review":"I read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy before the movies came out. I definitely disagree with those who say it's not important to read the book since there are spectacular movies on them that follow the book well. First of all, they dont follow the book well. So much is left out. Second of all, if you dont read the books then you miss out on so much detail and depth of the story. You just wouldnt receive the story entirely, and that's pretty sad because of how wonderful the whole thing is. Third of all, the book has so much quality and if you read it you would gain something from it every time you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine","review":"Despite all the hype and hoopla, the fanatical adoration, and silliness attached to it, this book is (or these books are--however you care to look at it or them) pretty good. The incessant questing is tedious, the hero-making gratuitous, and the monsters annoying, but I liked hiking about on foot in the open. I liked the absence of automobiles, trains, planes, and busses. I liked immersing myself in this other world for a considerable stretch of time.The author is very accomplished at manipulating the English language: he's got chops; but this is hardly a literary masterpiece. Enjoy it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUDIO BOOK review. So bad.","review":"I love LOTR and have since I was a child. I also drive a lot for work now, so I listen to a lot of audio books. This LOTR audio book is the worst audio book I've ever listened to. In fact, it is actually painful to listen to. Many of the voice actors are either bad or annoying. The voice actor for Frodo sounds like a bad high school drama student reading a script. The sound effects seem to be made by someones Casio keyboard. Also, the sound level is so low on these discs that you have to crank up the volume then get blasted when you eject them. No matter how much you like LOTR, I cannot recommend this awful recording. I have the Hobbit and Silmarillion on audio book, and they are both much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"Nothing beats the classics. The book came in not a day late and in perfect condition. The pages are made of a paper that thinner than normal printing paper which makes the book lighter and thinner than it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good deal","review":"The whole of JRR Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for one reasonable price. I don't think I need to review the work itself -- some love every word, some find it dull in written form, you make up your own mind. This edition adds an interesting introduction on the history of the various editions of the work. My only slight criticism is that the footnotes are placed all the way at the end of the book, rather than at the ends of the chapters, but otherwise it seems a perfectly good version of this classic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings- the father of Fantasy.","review":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhh, Lord of the rings. A celabrated book by a celabrated author. The 1000+ page, full volume leaves you spellbound, caught up in the mystical world of middle earth.It may be long but don't let that perturb you for every page is bursting at the seams with wonder. To boost my point a relative of mine read the whole thing over 2 days. Lord of the Rings is a brilliant book and I highly recommend it to any good reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"I was about 10 years old when my mom suggested for me to read The Hobbit, the prelude to J.R.R. Tolkiens Trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. After reading The Hobbit, I became upsessed with Tolkien's books. The first \\"book\\" of the trilogy enthrawled me, although some may find it unexiting, (which it's NOT.) The second book and the rest that followed only increased the pace of greatness. I absolutely COULD NOT get enough of the heart-pounding action, mysterious suspence, and amazing characters. In the end, there is no possible way to decribe Tolkien's ingenius, masterpiece. And that's an EXTREME UNDERSTATEMENT!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Definitive World of Fantasy","review":"No fantasy writer or reader alike is unfamiliar with the stories of Middle-Earth and Tolkien's great characters, at least to the extent of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the White/Grey, and the Men of Numenor. Any LOTR fanatic can assure you that if you haven't picked up at least the Hobbit as a child, or the first installment of LOTR; Fellowship of the Ring, you will be surprised how strongly you fall into the world of fantasy and crave to read more. I strongly guarantee that anyone reading this edition will want to read more tales of Middle-Earth, after all, nobody's born a Tolkien fan, and I would definitely bet most got started with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"These books are amazing. If you like fantasy or science fiction in any way, you must at least try these books. Even if you aren't a fantasy fan, you will be sucked into Tolkien's amazingly deep second reality.

The spine is decorated with what looks like a stylized version (possibly) of one of Tolkien's own drawings of a tree, along with engraved and embossed words of the title, author and publisher initials. Gold, blue and green details contrast the deep red cover. This is very beautiful. 440 pages with several appendices and a nice index in the back. Text is not too small. Instead the volume is large to fit all three books into one. (9.5 x 6.5 x 2.5) Heavy and a little hard to read because of that, but worth having and a lovely edition. I love having this as part of my Tolkien collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Volume was convenient, arrived fast and in good condition","review":"This book was purchased for a grandchild for required reading for his high school class.

Therefore, he receives two stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT THE NPR broadcast version from the 1980s!","review":"Quoting Amazon: \\"The original American dramatization as broadcast on National Public Radio\\". Caution: this is not the BBC dramatization broadcast in the USA in the 1980s, with Ian Holm, Michael Hordern, etc., and is completely inferior to the BBC version, in my opinion. Doctor Mabuse in the following comment says this was broadcast on NPR in the 1970s. That may be; I was not aware of that broadcast. If you want the one from the 1980s, look for the BBC Audiobooks America brand, ISBN 978-1-60283-492-7."},{"rating":"1","title":"used is used","review":"Obviously I knew buying used books would have some wear.

It is, without a doubt, my favorite book in the world. It helps me to live! The characters are real, you suffer and rejoice with them. Their travels stay in your mind, and remind you to have courage in your own hard journey through life.It has always been to me a spiritual book, the hard fight of good vs evil. For those who really love this book, it is not that it is too long, but that it is too short. You won't want to leave Middle-Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest Epic and the longest sci-fi story in history","review":"James Tolkien's Lord of the ring is the longest Science fiction in history, and it is the award winning epic ever written by a sci-fi author. In fact, Lord of the rings, is the first longest Sci-fi fantasy ever made. Lord of the rings in 1978 was turned into a Aninmated feature film by Ralph Bakashi, soon New Zealand director Peter Jackson (The Freightners) is making the live action cinema apdaption of Lord of the rings which will star Al Pacino and Eliajha Wood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Edition","review":"This is a simply beautiful edition of the Lord of the Rings.In fact it's so pretty I almost don't want to read from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hobbit stories","review":"I was not taken with the Hobbit stories and have no really good reason why not.

I have the same problem with Dickens that I do with Tolkien; ponderous prose! I guess I've been spoiled by many of the excellent sci-fi/fanatsy authors (i.e. George R R Martin) that write edge of the seat, gripping & fascinating stories.Unfortunately, in LOTR, Tolkien's ability to tell an interesting tale seems to have taken a backseat to his world building."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad one!!!","review":"It took 2 weeks longer to get than they said it would!!

I was pleased with the formatting and the inclusion of several images such as that of the map and the door. The largest disappointment however for the Kindle version were the typographical errata: misspelled or truncated words, employing the wrong case for proper names (poor Eomer) and in at least one case a Greek letter starting an English word.An additional feature which would have enhanced the Kindle version is the text-to-speech accessibility, which was surprisingly missing. Foreign language versions were also not available. These points are however small compared to the obvious mistakes in the text, which make one question how faithful the other content is for the Kindle version compared with the original books. While I love the original text, I cannot recommend this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"All three books in one :-) - Kindle Version","review":"My son wanted to read The Lord of the Rings on his Kindle. When I purchased this version, I was not sure if this Kindle Version of Lord of the Rings had all three books: (1) The Fellowship of the Ring, (2) The Two Towers, and (3) The Return of the King. It does and I'm very happy about it. You don't need to spend $9.99 on each individual book. You get all three for $14.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy rendition.","review":"Despite the fact that this is shown as being published in 2001, the copyright dates first from 1954. There is a reason that other versions have come out since this one: this one isn't good.There are different readers for different characters, and some of the voices are really jarring. Frodo, to my ear, is completely wrong. In addition, it is poorly abridged. One of the most remarkable things about Middle Earth is how wonderfully imagined it is; all of the details are described so lovingly. Not in this version. Here, almost everything is dialog, so you are given little idea of what anything looks like. Some of the most cherished quotations (for me, at least) are mangled. In all, very disappointing. I remember hearing the BBC's dramatization years ago on radio and thinking it was wonderful job on very difficult material. I certainly wouldn't say that of this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Misrepresented","review":"If I hadn't been led to believe by Amazon that this edition was \\"leather bound\\" I might have been satisfied with this volume, but I loathe deception.

This is simply the finest edition of Tolkien's timeless classic I've ever owned. I've examined my copy quite thoroughly and have noticed no defects in workmanship whatsoever. Every minute detail from the red and black text to the gilded pages make this edition worth the asking price and more. The book is kept in a handsome slipcover and fits right at home between the highly regarded \\"No Admittance\\" bookends. This is the edition aficionados of Tolkien's work should not be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"Being a Lord of the Rings fan for 7 years, I decided that it was time to buy an illustrated set of it. I'm so happy that I bought this one!!The dust covers are very beautiful with illustrations by Alan Lee. The box is also illustrated and the books fit in very good. Every book has ,under the dust cover, the actual cover: nice red fabric with in gold the title etc. It looks very 'Tolkien-ish'The books are all illustrated, about .. well I haven't counted them but there are lots and lots of beautiful illustrations. They are all a bit 'watery', but it fits the mood of the book.I read complaints about the glossy pages. Personally, I don't have any trouble reading, even if there's bright light. The pages are smooth, but do not reflect much light.So, I don't really see one negative thing about the box - except that the books are very tight in the box and it is difficult to get them out.If you are a real Lord of the Rings fan, please buy this edition. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for Abbridged 1979 recording","review":"My only complaint is that it's abbridged. The voice actors are quite good and the music fits very well, creating the appropriate mood nicely. Every now and then the sound effects are a little cheesy (Gandalf's magic) but overall quite well done. Excellent for introducing the story to someone who doesn't have the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"You're charging twice the price for the EBOOK than the soft-back version of the book.

Who shot JRR? I hope he's enjoying the creativity of the only One more imaginative than himself--the Creator of the Universe. As for us, still strapped to this mortal bowling bowl and rolling down the lane of history (hopefully, staying out of the gutter), Tolkien's absence is our loss. I'm sulkin' without Tolkien...wishing he'd written more, wishing he'd never written LOTR in the first place. Why? Because it's spoiled me--I can scarcely enjoy the barrage of inferior fantasy. The musty, damp, and gritty reality of Middle Earth reveals uncanny moments of beauty, then strips back the uneasy facade to show us seductive and frightening evil. Only an author familiar with the spiritual reality of such a cosmic battle could use a fictional tool to etch it into our culture with such vividness. And only a man like Tolkien, a man in relationship with the True King in heaven, could show the costly, but victorious battle against the Darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I honestly don't really like it!","review":"I feel that the different voices used to portray the different characters don't fit.. and overall not the best fit for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings--Millennium Edition","review":"First: Amazon's rating method--i.e, that all editions of the same work are included under one rating thread--is useless. This Millennium edition is a rip-off--cheaply bound, printed on cheap paper, small print (paperback-like), no illustrations--DON'T buy it--buy one of the well-establishhed, illustrated hardcover editions.

My excitement died within minutes of placing it in my CD player. The voices, aside from the narrator, do not seem to fit the characters. Espoecially disturbing were when the high elfs had voices that sounded like Alvin, Theodore and Simon, rather than the noble creatures they should sound like, and Tom Bombadil sounding like a tripped out leprechaun. It also bothers me that almost every actor seems to be reading, so much so that you can hear the pause as they come to the end of a line or page, even if it is mid-sentance. And perhaps the worst thing is the way they mispronounce names and places. Tolkien gives a pronunciation guide in the books, they should have used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the BBC audio version is lame","review":"this BBC dramatization of lord of the rings was in my opinion poorly done at best 1 star i listened to a few moments only and the voice for Gandalf was so far removed from what i know of/understand of him that i couldnt bear to listen to listen anymore..now if a truely fine actor read this part( lawerence olivier? sir john gilgud ?liam neeson?

Harry Potter? Star Wars? They ALL have their roots in the LOTR. Tolkien's masterpiece is as fresh today as it was almost 50 years ago.

I picked up Fellowship of the Ring, and I made my way through it, determined to read it. Tolkien has a wonderful imagination, but the plot is a bit redundant and the writing is hard to understand at points. I have read other works far more advanced, so my lack of understanding is not from being uneducated. It just doesn't flow. My two stars were for his imagination, because I respect anyone who takes a chance with the creation of another world.

I just didnt like it.Example:\\" The Company now turned aside from the path and went into the shadow of the deeper woods, westwardalong the mountain stream away from Silverlode.

He could certainly do that - whether he could say anything even remotely interesting with it is another matter. Tolkien appeals to the young and immature because his world is enormous, detailed, and clearly ordered, unlike our own, which is only enormous and detailed. So it's a very pleasant escape from reality, but in the end it's nothing but a padded playground for the childish. I blush to remember that there was a time when I'd learned to write in Elvish. This skill has not served me in later life. This fella wrote one good children's book and a tiresome three-volume novel for delayed adolescents; the flood of derivative and gossamer-thin drivel that has come out since his death is something I hope he would have been ashamed of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings","review":"I bought this set and had it sent to an inmate in a correctional facility in Florida.

It is a wonderful additon to any 'Ringers' collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands off - its crap","review":"This book is a disapointing buy.

Not only are all three volumes of the original included in one well-bound hardcover, but Alan Lee's classic watercolor illustrations add rich dimensions for adults and young readers alike. (Lee is a worthy successor to illustrators like Edmund Dulac and Arthur Rackham, who enriched the so-called Golden Age of illustration.)

I love the books and the movies, but do yourself a favor and buy a different version. Frodo and Bilbo voices sound reasonable, but most of the other characters have weird voices. For example Sam sounds like a little boy (although, maybe his part is read by a woman?), Strider has the voice of an old time radio hero (you know that \\"hear I come to to save the day type voice\\"). Actually, the whole thing sounds like an old radio version, which wouldn't have been bad, if it was done better. Plus the actors aren't really that good, so the mood isn't conveyed properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie, better than the book","review":"The majority of work in creating the movie must have been deciding what to discard. They also had to distort much to fit it to their deletions. Reading the book and getting the full experience of it requires complex visualization and spacial organization. Doing this while reading is a tedious task and makes the book a weary tale. Also, without the deliberate effort of performing the various parts, the dialog falls short and it reads as a book meant for children. This masterful performance hits the mark. It couldn't have been told better by ol' Bilbo himself, which is how I think the book was meant to be enjoyed. This has to be the best performance that will ever be. You can even see that some of those in the movie must be guilty of borrowing some of their performance from this one.

I have the paperback edition and have for years, and it has held up through a lot. I was looking for something to last even longer - this was not the right choice. I was expecting much more from the Millenium edition, but I guess I should have learned not to place so much on the millenium hype.

I was planning to purchase this set for my son and recently observed two box sets at a local book store. Both sets had irregularities in the size of two of the seven volumes in this set. They were noticeably shorter than the companion volumes, that is, as they sat on the shelf, the binding edges were uneven. The clerk broke the plastic seal so we could inspect the books more carefully and confirmed that they were imperfect. We also observed that the bindings appeared to be second rate, the pages were glued, not stitched, to the binding. Essentially paperback bindings in a mis-matched hard cover. We checked the second set the store had in stock and found the exact same problem with the size of the volumes.

The impact of his work on literature is incalculable, and I might venture to say that it created the entire fantasy subculture as a byproduct. No one can be considered an educated person without reading the Lord of the Rings; their influence is that great. But The Lord of the Rings shouldn't be read simply because of it's importance to literature- it's a work of art, beautifully written, and should be appreciated as such.

The Lord of the Rings is a vividly written story with an entangling plot, genuine and original characters, and the bewitching voice of J.R.R. Tolkein. Though at first glance many modern readers find the descriptions and dialogue overwrought, upon closer examination, nothing less could possibly do. Our impatience comes from our way of life, which must be utterly put aside to enjoy this book's breathtaking landscapes, enchanting cultures rich in songs and history, and a cast of both noble and despicable characters. Each development comes in its due time, accompanied by the laughter and tears of the irresistible connection between storyteller and audience.Yet in these pages the reader will also find layers of symbolism, an almost unintentional social conscience, and a story of our world that makes these books frighteningly relevant today.

Then I saw the movie. It was so cool I just had to read the book. I bought a boxed set in August, and before the month was over, I had read it twice. It is the absolute best book I have ever read. It is written very very well, and I love the way all of the races are so different.J.R.R.

No other publication of the story can come close to this one. In other words, if you just want to read the story and throw it away, buy a used \\"regular\\" copy. But if you treasure it and want to read it again, THIS IS THE ONE TO HAVE. I bought it sometime ago and it is a treasure on my shelf next to the Hobbit's similiar book (and to which every thing I said is just as true). Actually you MUST read the Hobbit BEFORE you see the movie if you truly want to understand it, because that is where it all starts, and the movie makes MUCH MORE SENSE if you've read it first, especially since they left almost the entire story out--so your're starting well into the TRUE STORY, and may have trouble making sense of some things that happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkien was an artist who painted pictures with tiny details","review":"Tolkien was so special because he created not only characters who were true to themselves, but also species who were true.

Keeping track of all these things, so he wouldn't be caught in inconsistency, is why Tolkien was a genius who is, so far, unmatched. I have re-read this series many times.

The ring grants the wearer invisibility, but it's also the Dark Lord Sauron's ring, the One Ring which binds all other magic rings and holds the heart of Sauron's power. Corrupting the wearer, it must be destroyed in the fires of Mt. Doom lest it be rediscovered by it's creator and used to conquer all of Middle-earth. Frodo-along with his trusty hobbit friends, the wizard Gandalf and a company of elves, dwarves and men from across the land, sets out on a quest to destroy the ring. Can he alone bear the burden of an all powerfull, all corrupting ring?

However, its roots lie in the oldest of tales like Beowolf, Gilgamesh, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

There you will learn the story of Hobbits and how the One Ring came into their possession. This particular review is for an illustrated version that is all three books in one. The art is great, but including the Appendix (A-F) and the Index, this book has over 1193 pages. At times you feel as though you're getting nowhere. I personally recommend a three book set. But which ever one you choose, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Best Audio of LOTR","review":"This is a good audio dramatization of LOTR but not the best. The production value is not as good and the voice actors are not as convincing in their characters. Also, many voice actors have to perform other character roles which can be confusing to the uninitiated. The Tom Bombadil (sp) story is picked up in this 24-part (12 hour) audio tale but many minor details are sacrificed. This leads to unfortunate references by characters to events which are skipped when the actually happened. All in all not a bad thing (I own it and still listen to it) but the other LOTR audio (done by the BBC I think) is better done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound effects? What sound effects?","review":"There are no sound effects. Yes, Rob Inglis does alter his voice for different characters. And he even sings the songs. (I do wonder where he got the melodies. \\"The Road Goes Ever On\\"? Strange that it isn't in print. . .) But there are no sound effects. Perhaps that review refers to the BBC or other dramatization?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy!","review":"Item arrived as described in shrink wrap. Brand new book. Great collection for anyone interested in an excellent hard-back edition of LotR. It is modeled after the 1974 collector's edition but with upgrades. Slip case is very cool. I found small \\"smudges\\" on random pages (reason for 4 stars instead of 5) but these are obviously a production accident and nothing to do with Amazon or the shipping. Overall I am very pleased. The item was processed and shipped in a very timely manner and was packaged very well. If you are reading this, BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"It is the perfect edition for this classic. The leather is great, the font is not too big or too small. If you are a fan it's a must have. Just be sure to buy the Hardcover, it makes a world of difference. I got it as a birthday gift, and I loved it, just to smell it and know I have an anniversary edition is awesome. One more thing, and a very important one, the price of this book on a bookstore is at least 3 times more than the amazon price, so you are getting a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"The book condition is overwhelming!I'd expect a good book, but the one sent seems like it's been just taken from the shelf.Amazing.Thanks a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there...","review":"Most of the people who are going to buy this book are LOTR fanatics and collectors Is the book good value or is it collectable. Well...Yes. It is probably the nicest single volume set of The Lord of the Rings I have come across and that includes the India paper single volumes.The package is complete with embossed gilt eye and rings of Sauron, full leather gold gilt page block, silk page marker. Full maps. section sewn.The text font is very clear and legible unlike many other editions and you could use this book to read the whole saga. Though my personal preference is the Allen and Unwin editions particularly the 2nd edition.Very nice presentation and considering you would pay almost the same price for the \\"ordinary\\" hardcover volume represents good value. Consider how much you pay for the folio society set.Still I await the ultimate three volume set....maybe the 100th Anniversary edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird!!","review":"Oh!...I'm sorry, did I rate the book '1'? I probably ment:TEN!! Probably not enough words in the English language to describe how good the book is! Trust me, it's worth every tenth of the cent you pay for it. Great Detail, highly entertaing, and well, you just simply can't put it down. Mr.Tolkien has definetly put a lot of effort in to his masterpiece, therfore, we must appreciate this book fully, and beleive me, you'll have no trouble at all doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"I received my copy yesterday and the maps are glued together in the corners. Not realising this as I attempted to open one I damaged one of the maps!! I won't even bother trying to open the second one which makes my beautiful book partly worthless to me. Very unhappy with this situation. First time I've used amazon and this happens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored of the Rings","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the most boring fantasy epics I have ever forced myself to wade through. Perhaps it's popularity is due to the originality of thought it posessed when first published, but compared to the myriad of rich, and engaging works available now, it really is just not worth the effort.Read it if you have a desire to study the history of fantasy writing, or unlimited time to squander."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GREAT","review":"Does anyone share my opinion that, at times, Tolkienm can be so boring, with his endless descriptions of trees, nature, rivers, mountains, west, east, sun, moon, blá, blá, blá...? By the way, I hate the hobbits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOTR Book set","review":"When I first opened the shipment I noticed that the corner of the book set was a little crushed- possibly from poor \\"handling\\" at the warehouse. After opening the shrink-wrap from the book set I noticed that the entire back side of the case was cut- making it a \\"door\\" instead of a solid back... not sure how that happened. I sent it back to Amazon who switched it with a different book set. However- the new book set arrived with a crushed corner. So much for \\"shipping and handling\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it is cracked up to be","review":"While I agree that if Tolkien had not written this series, fantasy would not be what it is today, overall I was bored with the story. I would advise for those that want to study the history of literature, to read these books. But for those that would like action and excitement... move along. It was a difficult journey to make reading \\"The Lord of Rings\\", many fine people and creatures were met and their images and personalities will be remembered. I will even go so far as to say that some friends were made. However...even sometimes we get bored hanging out with our friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORED of the Rings","review":"Its about as exciting as reading the dictionary and just as long. Tolkien was one messed up dude. ITs more like descriptions of places and things more than an actual story. I'd rather read the back of a bottle of shampoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.......","review":"Tired of all the hullaballoo surrounding Tolkien I finally purchased LOtR. I enjoy fantasy and tried to give it a fair shake but put the book down from boredom a quarter of the way through. I found myself rereading pages because my mind wasn't getting into his prose. There are better works out there, IMHO.Everyone sings the praises of him so YOU might enjoy it, but I much prefer George Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn* Why do so many people like this piece of you know?","review":"Everyone reads these books and sings their praises. I did not like it at all. Tolkien's tedious prose is like trying to walk through a swamp. I think people read this to pretend they're smart. I'd give it -20 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"errors in Kindle edition","review":"This is a review for the Kindle edition of this offering, not a review of Tolkien's work, which I've already read in print form (and would rate five stars for a quality edition). I cannot speak of the print edition also offered under this entry, since I haven't purchased it, but the Kindle edition is marred by numerous typographical errors. For example, I've seen more instances of misplaced quotation marks than I can count, and I've seen \\"Éomer\\" misspelled several times. These are just examples, but anyone who cringes at sloppiness in renderings of Tolkien's work will have a hard time with the sloppy editing of this Kindle version.If you just want to buy something that gives you all three volumes of the epic at once for your Kindle, and you can forgive the errors, you'll be perfectly happy, as far as I can tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful book","review":"my husband really enjoyed receiving this for his birthday. The book isn't leather, but the print is beautiful. The illustrations are beautiful, and it does indeed have a red ribbon book mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story and amazing edition too","review":"I love the lord of the rings movies so I decided to read the book, amazing book and also this is one of if not the best edition you can buy of all three books and appendices in one hardcover book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"This is a beautiful set of books. The imagery on the box is fantastic, as well as on the dust jackets. The binding is great, and seems put together quite well.

Excellent adventure, characters of weakness and honor, a wonderfully developed world. It's a classic for good reason, and should appeal to most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is not worth the money!","review":"I do love 'The lord of the rings'. I red it in German first, as this is my mother-language. My cousin gave me this edition as a present. Well, it is not a very good one. The print is sometimes light and sometimes dark, it often looks like 'The neverending story'- there it is ment to be. If you want to have a super-edition, you should rather wait, untill somebody publishes one! For the German readers I hope, that some day, Artemis& Winkler will publish a thin-print-edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on Kindle Fire","review":"I'm returning this version. I don't know if people with other Kindles have had this issue but on the Fire it is impossible to read. When you turn the page sometimes its fine. Sometimes you get the beginning of the previous sentence repeated, sometimes several sentences were repeated which is just annoying since it is confusing and takes you out of the story. Sometime parts of the text between one page and the next are just missing which makes the book impossible to read. I know its convenient to have all 3 books together and works out cheaper than buying them individually but what's the point if you can't actually read it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"every fantasy lovers dream!","review":"i'm eleven years old,so this was a very challenging read for me.but i loved it!the plot is wonderful,the character development amazing,and full of adventure!with a mix of suspence & tragedy.my favorite character would have to be legolas the elf.he's amazing.j.r.r. tolkien really satisfied my fictional needs.this book is for adults,but i'm a very good reader.i would recomend this book to everybody!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, Poor Quality Product","review":"This book is a fantastic read, but if you're looking for a high-quality collector's edition to adorn your library this isn't it. The quality of the printing is very poor, sometimes very light and other times too dark. In my copy the map that is glued inside the back cover is slightly askew and sticks out beyond the edge cover. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The manufacturer and quality control suck","review":"I have attempted to buy this book 3 times from amazon,the two copies sent were both damaged ,so I went to other stores to order it,3 more copies from borders all damaged and I am wondering how poor the book companies employee attention must be to ship out damaged items at almost $100 a pop. I was attempting to give this as a gift and have been on a month journey trying to find just one book not ripped,ink stained,etc. This is pretty sad for a collectors edition LOTR item and totally looks down upon Tolkiens good name.Unless you can personally inspect it dont bother ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astouding literature but unnecisary reviews.","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien is one of my prefered authors being, along with Homer one of the greatest authors of all time! But while the story itself is excellent I have to ask, why do people continue to comment on the binding and illustrations when this is the kindle edition which lacks illustrations and you only have abinding if you bought a case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the right one","review":"While this is a very sincere effort at reducing LOTR into digestible audio episodes, it simply cannot compete with the BBC's version. It might be slightly more appropriate for younger listeners, and features more direct quoting from the novel's descriptive passages, but essentially every voice actor is inferior to the BBC counterpart, and the breaks every half hour (at least on the cassette version) leave the story feeling choppy. Look into this if you're a completist, but if you only want one, go with the BBC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value on a fantasy classic","review":"Like most kindle books, this is a great value for the content. My one lament is that the electronic format makes it difficult or impossible to refer to maps and footnotes as regularly as I would like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Amazon.com made my dream come true.!I was not sure at first if i would get the book in good shape, but now it is my most precious treasure!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition) Leather w/slip cover","review":"This is a beautiful book. If I had to grasp at straws to find a negative, as you read the book it expands slightly, making it harder to fit into the slip cover, and unfolding the maps can be a little tricky because there's not a whole lot of room for them to move. I will be keeping my paperbacks for loaning or travel, but sitting in bed or my easy chair with this book is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, long but good.","review":"I have enjoyed the Lord of the Rings for years. Reading it again as a single volume was really nice. Great price for a nice version of a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great digital version of the best fantasy story ever written","review":"I think this is the fourth copy of LotR I've owned - I've had individual copies of the three volumes, a paperback single volume, the red leather-bound single volume, and now this one. I love the look of the leather one, and for casual reading I still prefer a 'real' book, but for reading in bed, on the go, or in low-light conditions the Kindle app on my Android phone can't be beat. This is also a great deal, as the individual volume Kindle books add up to quite a bit higher cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Awesome book to read. Would suggest to complement this with Silmarillion and Children of Hurin and the Hobbit to get the full story of Middle Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am 13& live in Central PA. This book was,in my oppinion, EXCELLENT! Some might not like it because it gives alot of very lengthy descriptions. The book is a continuation of 'The Hobbit'. In it Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's nephew, becomes the bearer of the ring. Gandalf the Grey finds out this ring is known as THE RING, and that the Dark Lord, who forged it& then lost it, wisshes to have it back. Together with the help of some unlikely companions destroy the ring and set the world right. I reccomend this book to anyone who has read, and liked 'The Hobbit'"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fictional saga ever!","review":"These boks are great. They really make you feel like you're somewhere else. They really deserve six stars they're so great..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard work but worth it","review":"I can understand people not liking this series It is at times too slow and filled with seemingly pointless descriptions, I remember in particular a chapter called \\"The stairs of Cirith Ungol\\" (Or some such) began with several pages of description which I had to make several attempts to battle through. The series has lengthy moderately enjoyable sections interspersed with some high action. If I stopped reading the series halfway through the final book I would have rated it 2 1/2 - 3 stars, but the ending is so powerful and moving that it just makes you glad you read the whole thing and looking back you feel like you were there on the whole journey with them. Unless you are finding this mindwitheringly dull (as some do) persist to the end. It will be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Ring... one volume","review":"I own the individual volumes as well as this single volume in hardcopy.

It is delightful, exciting, full of visual imagery. Tolkien was best at character development and one cannot help but become engrossed with the ultimate fate of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, even Gollum. There is a wide chasm betweeen those good and those evil (unlike in Harry Potter).I always thought this would make a good movie series as well, and it proves to be so. My first experience with the LOTR was in high school. At 45 years of age,I re-read it this year before the movie came out and was smitten all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book period.","review":"Tolkien creates a world and breathes so much life in it. These three books can not be separated. They are a trio. So much of the story is built in its characters and the plot is interesting. The main player Frodo has to take the One Ring and throw it into the pits of Mount Doom. Seems easy enough right. Oh yeah don't forget that Ringwraiths are after it, everyone who comes into contact with the ring wants to use it to control Middle Earth, you get separated from your best friend, a crazy split personality helps guide you along the way, and that Sauraman and Sauron are both trying to find you. A great story that weaves so much action and interesting characters (Gimli, Merry, Aragorn, Pippin, Treebeard, Gollum, Gandalf, Sauraman, Theoden, Samwise, and Legolas) together without missing a beat. These books are just plain awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR","review":"This is a wonderful book, and is advised to readers, as bed times stories, to serious studies. I highly recommend this book to readers who like adventers and fantasy"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book of all books","review":"don't listen to the 2 or 3 people who didn't like this book.

Amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"This edition is horrible because the ink and printing is NOT really well-done. There are hard-to-read words, smears, blotches, etc. The paper quality is grain and has a tint of yellow in it - not recommended for white-white paper book readers. Each book has a \\"Middle-Earth\\" foldout map at the end of the book. These maps are terribly glued on to the back flap and are stuck close to the binding. If you try to take the maps out, which is intended to be taken out to hang on the wall, the brown flap paper will stick and tear along with the folded map"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Printing","review":"This book was purchased as Christmas gift for our children to be read by us to them. Having previously read this book myself I wanted to share Tolkiens world with them. The story is wonderful, the illustration excellent. However,and this is the reason for the rating, the print quality is very poor and some pages are blank. I am a bit taken back by it all considering the price of the book. If you are going to spend money on this wonderful trilogy I wouldn't spend it on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful!","review":"Unfortunately, you must be careful with these reviews. I gave this only four stars because I have never actually listened to it. I'm writing now to make sure that no one mistakes all of these reviews as pertaining to the featured product. I have heard that the Mind's Eye version is worth hearing, yet the first review I saw on this page was from Scott Truesdell villifying a totally different edition. Note the blue notices at the bottom of each review to keep you on the right track. Please do not assume that the Mind's Eye version is bad because Truesdell's review heading declares the disgracefulness of a different item."},{"rating":"2","title":"I choose The Lord of the Rings as theme for english exam","review":"I took the English edition of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by J.R.R.Tolkien as theme of my English class exam.

I thought it will be easier for me to read in English a book that I read before in Hebrew. I have already read all books by tis author that have been published in Hebrew.

Why? Because it's difficult to figure out what kind of product you're getting since they lump reviews of different editions together. I've been an enthusiastic Amazon customer for years, but this just makes me angry.I'm going to make an old-fashioned trip to a number of old-fashioned bookstores and enjoy the process of hand-picking that special edition for myself. Devote a day to it. Because Tolkien is worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Masterpiece......","review":"I love fantasy, so i read all the fantasy books, reading Lord Of the Rings is no exception even if the book took months to finish and maybe too advanced and confusing for me.Still I read it after finishing the hobbit in curiousity who destroys the ring. I could have just flipped over the last page but I started from the beginning which had an intriguing plot because of the ring Sauron made. I could not stop reading it to see what happens in the next chapters.That is what all the book should be like, dramatic and suspenseful, the book was like a movie. A few bad things about the book was that the story was overwhelmingly long, I get tired of the book and also the terms that J.R.R Tolkien used, made the storyline hard to follow especially for an illiterate like me. However, I would recommend it everybody and call it a true masterpiece anyway....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of The Rings - Audio version","review":"This audio version is TERRIBLE. The narrator sounds like a failed game show host. Frodo is flat, lifeless and reminds one of limp lettuce that has been in the fridge for too long. Very dissapointing after hearing the BBC version of \\"The Hobbit\\". This doesn't even come close to quality entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bargain","review":"You know the story.

Be sure to get the matching book of The Hobbit, of same quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impressed","review":"I cannot recommend this product and here's why:1. It is advertised as leatherbound, but I think it's covered in some sort of treated paper made to feel (kind of) like leather. If someone can demonstrate that it is leather, I will be happy to edit this review.2. My copy had the cover artwork way off center.3. The pages began curling almost immediately.I returned it with no problem whatsoever, and my money was refunded promptly so 5 stars to Amazon for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the women?","review":"I read the book (only) twice at the age of 11 and 14, and thought it was the best book ever. But as I don't any longer think of \\"Bluesbrothers\\" as the best movie ever I must admit that even in the LoR there are simply too many things missing: 1) Where are the women? I have a little daughter (4month) and I will not give her the book, because all the heroes are male (see deserves more than beeing a princess) 2) Where is the loss of important people? Dead of people we love is an important part of our lifes. In the LoR all heroes survife: its a fairy tale nothing more. (As Tolkine says, too. 3) Where are the problems between the main charaters? Look at Star Trek TNG: The first episodes are terrible boring, because \\"we all love eachother\\" - Star Trek DS9, which had no such restrictions, is much better - right from the beginning.So it is truely a very good book, but only with respect to a very limmited part of human life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I...can't... read!!","review":"This book! I cannot get through it! I know alot of people love these books, but I couldn't get anything out of it. I felt like I was reading nonsense. \\"And Merry walked forward, 'to ho, Frodo', but the light for they found was neath the ground and then, yay pickled fury from way into the forest with armor and swords engraved with red and hicksey; to hicksey Frodo seeth the little hobbit house, blah blah blah blah blah blah...\\" what the hell! It was harder trying cut my way through this strange, convoluted, purple prose than when I've tried reading an Ann Rice book. I kept wanting the story to advance, but finally I got too tangled in the prose and gave up. I didn't even get to see Gollum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as everyone seems to think","review":"I don't know why so many people like this book so much. I guess it's just because they haven't read any better fantasy books. Personally, I found The Lord of the Rings to be very boring. It started out ok, but it goes on and on with nothing interesting ever happening. There were some interesting moments, but nothing to make the book really worth reading. The overwrought description drags on for way too long, and the way the war is described makes the whole story seem like some kind of weird dream rather than a real war. You don't really get a sense that anything is at stake for the main characters. In my oppinion, Magician and A Game of Thrones are way better than this. Stay away unless you like you fantasy slow and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Kids","review":"The Lord of the Rings are good books I myself liked the Hobbit very much when I was a child. Lots of people think Lord of the Rings are the greatest books in the world and that most start reading these first. I personly think The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are children books I mean come on with the simple plot and there isn't a great deal of action in it. There's no sex or cussing to rate it a adult book not like I'm saying that akes a good book but if you ask me these books are for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings - Unabridged","review":"This was a very difficult book to listen to. The sound effects made it hard to understand anything. I would not recommed this to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolkien had WAY too much time on his hands.","review":"Tolkien had WAY too much time on his hands. Just think about it - spending all that time creating imaginary worlds, peoples, languages and events? With a huge appendix explaining it all? It's insane! Talk about wasting his time! Tolkien would have used his time much better if he had used it to cut the grass for an elderly lady, work as a volunteer in a soup kitchen, or collect money for the blind. Anyone who has the time to make so much time in his imaginary world, let alone write a stack of books about it clearly has WAY too much time on his hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most effective OTC sleep aid.","review":"I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about. I forced myself to read this book because all I had ever heard was how it was one of the best and most influential pieces of modern literature, but eight hours a day of manual labor would be a less tiresome task then trudging through this pile of rubbish.In all honesty, the plot is entertaining, if you can find it. I am sure the Cliffs Notes of the LOTR are interesting and entertaining, but why anyone would want to torture themselves reading this collection is beyond me.I read one chapter a night until I was done, and that was too grueling a task. I constantly found my mind wondering and having to reread every page because it could not hold my attention.You don't have to believe the hype. This collection of books is really, really terrible and boring, and I wouldn't wish the task of reading in on my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingles does a fantastic job","review":"I did not realize what a wonderful job that Ingles had done in this reading until I began listening to other audio books. Ingles manages to give each character a distinct voice and as you proceed, you recognize immediately who it is that is speaking.After many years, Tolkien's work stands alone as the only sci-fi/fantasy story that puts the subtlety of language and culture equal to, if not above, the drama. Ingles interesting voices and care with the language of Tolkien make this a most worthy represenation of the timeless classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I like the book but it is a huge book and its not like you can carry it around where ever you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, moving illustrations","review":"The illustrations are breath-taking! I cannot wait until my children are old enough to experience the story first-hand with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO THAT TO MY PRECIOUS!!!!!","review":"I have been a long time fan of the LOTR. Since the movies were released some of my friends wanted to know more about the books, so I checked this set out of the Library thinking it was a good place to start. Sadly I was mistaken from the very begining this recording is a disappointment. The Actors voices are flat and devoid of expression. As a result, the listener gets the impression that the characters treat their task with the same respect that they would place on a Disney movie.After one disc of waiting for things to get better, I decided to try listening to the battle Of Helms Deep. Here too I found nothing but an endless monotone backed by poor sound effects.If you are a true Tolkien fan or someone who wants to get the full magic of The Lord of the Rings I recommend the BBC production starring Ian Holm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly disappointing...","review":"Overall, I'd say this is a fair audio adaptation of the trilogy. However, there are times when the action portrayed isn't adequately conveyed by what you are hearing. Also, as another reviewer noted, the voices given to the characters are terrible at times. For instance, they give Sam an annoying little boy's voice, and in one scene, for some reason, they give elves screechy fairy-folk voices, like they're supposed to be pixies or something. Did they just misunderstand what elves are supposed to be in the Tolkein mythology? Also, after seeing the movie, you will be disappointed when Gimli doesn't have a Scottish accent, and in general disappointed by the other voices.

The other is the 50th Anniversary edition paperback (which is the cover picture shown here.) So buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Love reading this volume.

All three volumes of the series for the price of one. I am glad it has been made available in digital format so I can take the complete series with me whenever I travel. I also have it in paper, but this format is much more convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings","review":"This is easily the best book I have ever read. If you don't have it buy it.
