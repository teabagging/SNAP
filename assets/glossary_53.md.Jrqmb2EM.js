The script and the story (is there even a story here?) don't make any sense. It's one of those movies that 30 minutes after watching it, you don't even remember what it was about. If one wants to say something good about the movie, at least one can point out that for a while it's fun watching a number of good actors (Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, etc) playing it for laughs.

I enjoyed John Carter, Men In Black 3 and American Reunion far more. Out of the super hero movies connected to this film, Iron Man was really good but had a crappy sequel and The Incredible Hulk was well done, Captain America was Okay and Thor was just there. The only one I saw at the box office before Avengers was the incredible hulk. other then Iron Man I was glad I waited for home viewing.

It is how the movie is being released that I have a problem with. The DVD comes with a lot extra features while the DVD release comes with almost none, not even the deleted scenes. I was looking foreward to seeing the deleted scenes. This is not fair. If I buy the movie I want the full movie, including the scenes that were cut. They are just trying to get more money out of you.

When I first opened the package, I thought I got a bad set because I only saw the 2 blu-ray discs. Turns out Paramount/Disney thought it would be OK to tuck another disc under each blu-ray to save space. And you guessed it, the blu-rays on the top of the stacks are scratched pretty bad. Does it really cost that much more to give us a 4-disc case? I'd rather pay a few bucks more to not get scratched discs. This version is going back and I will probably check out the regular blu-ray edition to see if the packaging is any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, digital copy was useless","review":"The movie was great, this review is based on the 4 disk combo.

A few good actors in Roberty Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo, but a big gigantic, forced mess with nowhere to go plotwise. Aliens? Give me a break. The story wasn't there (it's Marvel though) and the characters are flat out boring. I expected more from a superhero fllm with a lot of people in it yet there is the problem. Too many heroes or villians ruins a film and too many boring so called super heroes here and look at what we have-a mess. No true villians, but the guy from Thor (amazingly not a bad movie). I may be spoiled by The Dark Knight Trilogy, which was a work of art and story and with amazing actorrs so anything after that is junk, but I do remember the first 2 Spiderman films and the first X-Men film being quite good.

The casting was superb, the writing was fluid and artfully infused with humor, and the plot was intriguing and well-developed without being unnecessarily far-fetched or convoluted. The action sequences were in no short supply--and were, coincidentally, spectacular--yet never did they seem to diminish the importance of the story or characters behind and within them. If you like a little fantasy, a little wit, and a generous helping of edge-of-your-seat action, then this movie is 143 minutes very well spent.

I love how the stories from the movies have led up to The Avengers. Each of the main characters were given their fair share of lines & focused upon, which is kind of hard with a smart alec like Tony Stark. The showdown in NY with the alien army is a bit cliche; thank goodness for Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki. Joss Whedon has made a great and fun movie for all to see.

The only thing I thought was missing in this movie was cap saying \\"AVENGERS ASSEMBLE\\". Hope the sequel is just as good which is a no brainer and will be made.

All his characters in everything he's penned have a very strong sense of self. Don't get me wrong I love an 80's action hero style flick as much as the next guy, but occasionally I want well written character interaction. It still maintained the superhero element while showing exactly how human these superhumans are. The boxset is amazing too. It has a 3D Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy along with a code that unlocks an Avengers Comic on Comixology's website as well as the Official Soundtrack and some extra artwork for download on your PC.

That was'nt even a big deal though compared to how stupid everything else about the movie was. The acting sucked, the storyline was absent, not a whole lot happened. It was just a series of attempted jokes and then some crap getting blown up. Way too long also, I was almost falling asleep towards the end. I just kinda sat there staring at the tv for a minute when it was over, pissed at myself for actually watching the whole thing.

HOLLYWOOD stay off that stuff and make good movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME AND A WASTE OF TIME!!","review":"HOLLYWOOD never seems to surprise me lately, with using old run down actors for new actor roles. The action, dialogue, and written material was a waste of time. The movie became a skip to some action movie, real fast. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE. Can't say I didn't warn you!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Expectations but great disappointment","review":"I heard many great reviews about this movie over the summer of 2012. Decided to buy this and expected a fun evening enjoying a great action movie.. Boy.. was I wrong...The problem with this movie is that it's dumb action, not smart action. You can make a smart action movie like the original Terminator or Captain America - the first Avenger... or you can create this junk. Throwing together a bunch of mindless action scenes and hoping that people are overwhelmed.It boggles my mind how this movie did so well in box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Wow, the villains are identical to PowerRanger villains with their puffy, foam costumes that took $5 to make.This is why DC fails over and over. Blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I ever dreamed!!!","review":"I hadn't really liked the movies before it. Hate the two hulk movies, didn't like either Iron Man movies. I liked Thor, but didn't love it. And Captain America just fizzeled after the first time he took off the shirt...But when I read that Joss Whedon wrote and directed it, I was on board totally. but it was too late to see in theaters by then. So I waited impatiently, bought the DVD, and...I've watched it at least twenty times by now. There isn't a part I didn't love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the price","review":"Whedon really took the best of each actor's superhero character and put them together in this film. I would suspect having Robert Downey Jr. in the cast raised the bar for the other actors, and so long as he is in a scene there is no chance it would devolve to kitsch. All the lead characters are stunningly sexy and good looking, which never hurts, and I liked how they changed some of the uniforms to show some more flesh, which definitely made them more believable (and fun to look at). The visual effects and 3D elements are excellent ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomeness+","review":"While the extras leave something to be desired The Avengers looks amazing on Blu-Ray. The detail of every scene jumps off the screen and the sound quality is superb. If you enjoyed the movie in the theater you will absolutely love it at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth buying","review":"This movie delivers on all levels of entertainment. It has a nice balance of heroes where everyone has their own little moment to shine. The villain plays his role perfectly and gets handled as only Marvel Comics could have dished it out. This movie was fun to watch and brings the stories from it's previous stories of these heroes together naturally. This movie is truly worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite all the noise...","review":"...it was still hard to stay awake watching this one.

Joss Whedon has outdone himself.However, the DVD in this 2 Disc Set doesn't play on computers. That means that I can't take it with me on a trip and watch it on my notebook. I understand that Hollywood is trying prevent piracy (impossible challenge), but by limiting my ability to use their product as I see fit within my legal rights, I deem this product defective.I received it as a gift, so I will be having my gift giver return it to Amazon as defective.Hollywood - stop this stupid abuse of your customers. This encourages piracy, it doesn't prevent it.

Our player is able to unscramble some of the lost information when Captain America and Ironman work together to save the ship but we only lose a few seconds twice and we see the main portions. Originally, we weren't able to see this scene at all but now it is a lot better. The company game us a full refund when I first wrote them about the problem so I am happy and it may clear up totally. I might buy a replacement but if it continues to clear up, I won't and then I feel I should return their money. Either way I felt this company was great and the movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like playing with my guys in the sink!","review":"The lascivious nature of my review title is but an illusion.

Great script. Great characters, and great acting. It all came together.

I expected it to be much better than all the superhero films from which it flowed, but it came up short. The storyline was tediously protracted, with sparse heroic actions taking place, and too many scenes being shot in the dark. The characters were okay, but the plot was rather banal. The film's only strength, in my opinion, is when the Hulk picked up one of the villains like a fly swatter and smashed him repeatedly to the ground -- left and right -- in a \\"pissed off\\" response to the villain's arrogant assertion of God-like superiority over the Hulk and insulting the Hulk's intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring movie, terrible plot, slow and plodding, and silly special effects, such as the flying aircraft carrier.

The bonus features come on a separate disc, and I could not get any of them to work except for the digital copy of the movie. When I tried to get the comic from the Marvel website, the site created my account, then kicked me out of the site. When I logged back in, I did not have the comic book and my code for it had been cancelled. I had no better luck getting my copy of the music or the bonus features.

I do not have this issue with any other Blu Ray or DVD in my collection. We had to crank the volume up to 75 just to hear the dialogue and my kids were still asking me to repeat many of the characters' lines (we typically have the volume set between 12 and 20). We constantly turned down the volume during high-action scenes to keep it close to a consistent level. We also have a home theater set up with a newer receiver, and I had to turn the center channel balance all the way up.I don't see this mentioned in other reviews but I don't think I have a defective disc because all other aspects are perfect.

Only Whedon could bring his patented 9 characters in one room conversational expertise to a scene and make it not only clear and informative but funny and poignant all at once. Lots of things blow up and super heroes fly and some of the action stuff annoyed me by being too typical (huge things fly out of the sky by the hundreds to destroy Manhattan and our heroes just stand there staring. Civilians are dumb cattle who hide inside, then go stare out huge glass windows like targets. Etc.) but overall it's great because it's about the characters as flawed, real people who happen to have special skills that make them exceptional. That the skills don't make them less human or less flawed is Whedon's real triumph. That and the cast he got. Fantastic, everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!","review":"If you like superheros, you will LOVE this movie!

I was pleasantly surprised, I think mostly due to the writing and special effects. I'm not going to write a lot, just say it was a great movie, based upon me forgetting the individual super heroes mediocre movies.

Very well cast....very well directed with flashes of sly humor and gentle poking at the superhero genre. Not one of the heroes is perfect and that works because of the conflict it offers.

We have an awesome sound system, and usually at 25% we are blasted out of our seats. We had it at 100% and could still barely hear any of the dialog at all. It was really ridiculous. I regret the $5 for the hd version because we could barely understand it. Do yourself a favor, just buy the disc, because you'll love the movie, but this version will ruin it for you. Especially if it is your first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Dark Knight\\" has been unseated","review":"There was a mountain of hype and expectation for this movie, building at an exponential rate as its release date approached. Many thought it had the brass to perhaps equal or unseat \\"The Dark Knight\\" as the best comic book movie of all time. It succeeded.The level of play between the characters is unprecedented in a super hero film. These guys simply hated each other before finally joining forces, this portion of the film alone makes it the greatest of all time (the CGI and explosive ending is just the icing on the cake)There is not a single bad acting job in the cast that I can recall(although Samuel L Jackson essentially plays the same character he does in all of his movies)It is not the perfect movie, but the script and strong acting were enough to propel this movie into the highest reaches of comic book adaptations.I wont spoil any of it for you, just go ahead and buy or rent this movie already !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Above Average","review":"It was a challenge to introduce all these heroes, some not initially excited about being there, some with no super powers besides their own killing skills. I only have two major gripes: first that a huge aircraft carrier could float on 4 fans, much less 3. Second, that this alien race and blue cube with untapped magic powers are given about 3 minutes explanation when they needed 10. The whole fun of \\"Green Lantern\\" was the backstory.

I love Robert Downey, Jr in anything, and he is just great as the \\"nutty genius\\", whatever costume he puts on. I believe everyone did a stellar job in this movie. I will watch it again when I have the time. I will watch something as many as four times over before I get my \\"fill\\" of it...so I will see how many times before I am done with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed This Movie!","review":"This was a well done SiFi adventure!

This movie will do it for you! Lots of action, good comic moments, and good (not great) 3D.Would definitely recommend this movie for an afternoon diversion. Would be good to show off your surround system and your subwoofer.I'd watch it again, and I have. For me, that's saying a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are movies just getting worse?","review":"This was really a disappointment. After less than half an hour i was ready to turn it off, but instead i chose to see the painful rest of this movie. The acting is mediocre, the characters are not convincing. There wasn't real dialogue, just cheap oneliners and 'jokes'. The storyline was bad, the scenes didn't really have some glue between them, they just jumped from the one cliche to the other... Again, an idea of a movie these days becomes a reality just by focusing on special effects. This reality is sad but 'special effects' are not a movie, just a nice additive to a movie, if it fits in the context."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I am too old for this one.","review":"I guess I am too old to like this movie. Do see how 20 something males would but to me, seemed like script was written to give equal time to various super heroes and to me, plot was silly. I know super hero plot and all but just did hold my attention. Special effects are good and so too action but that not enough for me at 66 years of age. Date movie? If < 30 maybe. 500+ million box office for this?? A lot of < 25 yr old males must have gone 6 times each. Sorry all those that loved it, it was too silly and too many super heroes for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extras","review":"First off I love the movie but the so called extras and bonus stuff was weak.I was expecting a lot more and I was left flat.

Had to reorder on dish network. at least its was True 5.1 audio playback. Folks pay 2 dollar's more and order it on Dish. This is the second time I've been screwed over by Amazon. 5.1 auio means surround sound ( WITH CENTER CHANNEL) plus subwoffer.

Shame on you Walt Disney Video!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Information.","review":"Most people see these movies in the theater before they make it to dvd, so why give a long description of the story which only leaves out the ending.Those who've seen it know the story, those that haven't & wait for the dvd's (Blu-Ray, 3D, or Standard)only need a short taster to know why to get it.What nobody seems to put in these reviews is whether the movie on whatever form of DVD is, the great quality of the picture & sound, what the extras (if any) are, if the dvd is Region Locked or Region Free ect.Those are the reviews that would be helpful from people for me & millions of other readers looking to buy these dvd's.It would also help if Amazon gave more of this info in their descriptions of the releases that they are selling, which in my view is all ways sorely lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!","review":"I was very pleased with everything. The blue-ray of course excellent quality, I don't have a 3D tv yet but when i get one this is the first movie I'm going to watch.

EVERY time I have purchased an HD movie to stream via Amazon, I have had problems with the movie stopping and/or the quality of the stream deteriorating to sub-DVD quality. This doesn't happen when I watch HD movies on Netflix, which is running through the same Roku 2. In fact I don't recall having these problems streaming free Prime content. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing any more HD streams from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped every 5 minutes","review":"There is a problem with prime and it just isnt as good as Netflix.

Earths Mightiest Heroes fend off an interstellar attack by Loci, which after decades of not looking very good in the comic books are finally well rendered on film. In fact almost everything gets a near perfect screen rendering, including giving Captain America a Very Golden Age makeover by building his armor around double breasted SWAT armor,The plot is great, and the action is just the right mix of spy thriller and Hulk Bash. The movie also has the best oneliners of the century and a feeling of we will win because we're the good guys that has been missing for decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Features *only* on Blu-ray disc?? I feel cheated","review":"Okay, I am a HUGE fan of Marvel Comics, the Marvel movie franchise, any of Joss Whedon's work, and of \\"The Avengers\\" in particular. It is a stunning movie. Truly. That said...WARNING: IF YOU ONLY HAVE A DVD PLAYER, *all* of the special features are limited to the **Blu-ray disc only.**I purchased the 2-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo because, unlike the 1-disc DVD, it had all the special features. But apparently I was misled. Yes, that's right, on the DVD in this package (and, I assume, the 4-disc one as well), there are *NO* deleted scenes, no extended scenes, no gag reel, no \\"A Visual Journey\\" featurette, and none of the little easter eggs reputed to be hidden in the blu-ray menu. And thanks to copyright laws, it takes hours to find any of these things online - some you can't find at all.I feel genuinely cheated.If I didn't want special features, I would have bought the 1-disc.

Iron man I&II and Thor were quite good with Thor being a little better probably because of Anthony Hopkins playing Thor's Dad. Anyway, expected more of a story buildup and better interaction between the characters. Expected demonstrational reasoning for most of the super heroes for going from disliking each other to working together but didn't see any of that. One minute they hate each other next they are getting along like life-long pals. Heck the Hulk goes from being uncontrollable to becoming almost intellectual in a split second. Bottom line expected more but got another \\"Transformers\\" style movie of smash and smash some more....should be offered free with Prime membership like Thor and Transformers: dark side of moon. Either a lot of \\"story\\" is lying on the cutting room floor or today's audiences don't need much to be wowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie-Crap Discs","review":"Pre-ordered the movie after seeing it in theaters.

I own about 25ish 3D movies right now and I think this one is probably the best film in 3D so far. There are so many things that pop out of the screen that you feel like you are battling again Loki too! And the scenes that do not have pop-outs look simply beautiful with nearly no ghosting. I am very sensitive to ghosting and I can notice it right away on a movie if it is present. The Avengers, however, do not fall under the category of such movies. I own Avatar in 3D as well and I still think The Avengers has a better 3D experience (I know, shocking).

The action was great. There was also a little bit of comic relief. My only beef with it was that they didn't get Edward Norton to do The Hulk. There have been several different guys that played that past, and Norton was the best. I think I also liked the individual superheros films better than this one. Overall, this movie was a lot of fun.

I've only viewed one other movie on a 3D TV, so my experience is limited, but I thought this looked great. Maybe even a little better than in the theater since I can choose where to sit. I'm only starting to delve into the special features, but so far they've been very entertaining. At this point, I think I'm going to upgrade to the massive set they're releasing next year just to see what other goodies they'll have added.

Also, what was the deal with this tesseract thing? It didn't even resemble a real tesseract -- but what does?

Never saw Thor, but I think I may check it out now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, I expected more extra content","review":"The movie is great quality on my 42\\" Full HD LCD. I have never seen a bluray movie so I cannot compare, but image quality is very acceptable. Spanish audio is just fine.I expected more extra content, like more scenes, bloopers. Just interviews are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"It is The Avengers, what else is there to say. Amazing movie and Amazon VOD delivers yet another great experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was all about the final battle","review":"I had better expectation. The movie was somewhat slow. It lit up at the end with the final battle which was excellent. However before that it was very poor of content."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"It came before christmas even tho I ordered it late. Great condition! My kids were thrilled as am I. will be ordering again in the furture."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awsome movie full of great comic heros","review":"What can i say about this. Its a great movie full of all the comic book heros we love. And respect.dont take my word for it see for yourself. Oh the only little problem i have with it is the guy who plays hulk sucks. They should have stuck with ed norton. Other then that. Everyone pulls there parts off just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie was great. Loved that it came with the 3d DVD, reg DVD, BluRay DVD. Good buy for the rice.","review":"Same as title, wish I had a 3D tv to watch the 3D version. Good purchase to add to collection of other Marvel Movies. I got it on sale for like 26, so no complaints on price for what I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a MARVEL!!","review":"This is a must see for any super hero comic book lover! There is a perfect mix of humor and danger. Everyone of the heroes play their part with extreme finesse and beautiful timing. I have watched the movie perhaps 15 times already with my grand children and still enjoy every bit of it! I would tell you some of my favorite parts, but that would be considered \\"spoilers\\". Can't do that!! It was GENIUS to use all the same actors... well, except the HULK, who was played flawlessly by Mark Ruffalo! The dialog could not have been better. This is a work of art and will remain in my library for as long as Amazon provides service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Love this movie! Saw it twice in the theater and then again several times at home. Will definately be buying this one. It has everything you want in an action movie...awesome stunts, hilarious dialogue, gorgeous actors...the works! If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for??? Watch it TODAY...you won't be sad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shape","review":"Got at a great price and received quickly. Still had free comic book offer inserts inside too. Haven't watched the DVD yet but loved the movie when I saw it in the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed and fun","review":"I thought this was an excellent action movie that is humorous too. The movie, with its star studded cast, is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I wont get long winded about this but I have to say this movie was amazing. All charachters had dimension, due in part to their solo movies, which really added to their interaction. You didnt have to waste time on people's back story and focus on what was at hand. So you had a nice pace of action but also substance. Great balance there. Just makes you look foward to the other Solo and next team Avengers movies! I hope Justice League will manage half as good as this. LOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you haven't already seen it, give it a go!","review":"Definitely my favorite super hero movie of 2012, continuing with the quality that the first Iron Man movie started off with (we are not counting the Hulk as starting this series; either one). Hopefully the individual Avenger story lines that come after this keep up with where this left off. And can only hope the sequal is as good! Totally worth a watch if you're into super hero or sci-fi type action movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvel's The Avengers (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)","review":"Marvel's The Avengers (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging) is a great movie.

All the characters have a great personality and it was interesting seeing how they all interacted together. Some better than others but in the end they all pulled together for the greater good. I really enoyed seeing this movie and hope they continue with this series.Tom"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"The only problem was that it takes 2 months to arrive to my house in Mexico City, besides that, loved the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Comic Book Movie EVER!","review":"Hands down. I loved this movie, had to have the video. For the price, no point not getting the multi-disc set. Blu-Ray is crystal clear HD, movie is fantastic. What more is there to say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy Quality is Terrible","review":"While the movie is great, the digital copy is terrible. The image quality is atrocious, I could probably rip a better copy of the SD disc. Get the movie, even get it on blu-ray, but don't bother paying extra for the digital copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrived Plot, but who cares","review":"The plot in this movie is far too contrived, but given the actors, sets and effects, who cares? It's a great movie for entertainment value, if a bit hard to get the 'Suspension of disbelief'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This was the perfect gift for my husband. Played perfect. Nothing else really to say about it. Normal DVD that we wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivery","review":"This movie and quality for being a comic movie was nothing short of amazing. My one negative is not because of the movie but the delivery. I was excited all day at work anticipating it's arrival but did not show til 830 at night and I am usually in bed by oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avengers","review":"I enjoyed this movie and recommend it for kids 12 years and older.I was only familiar with iron man and the hulk.

The characters interact well and it's action packed but also humerous. I let my 5 & 6 yr old watch it (though skipped over a scene with an eyeball extraction) and they liked it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my husband","review":"He loves this movie and all the movies that led up to its creation. We recently bought a 3DTV so we had to rebuy it as a 3D blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"We were impressed but wished there was more...","review":"The movie had all the glitz, had all the glam, and special effects and CGI any 12 yr. old would flip head over heels for but as far as a story base, it just wasn't there."},{"rating":"2","title":"100%","review":"I ordered this 3D set on 1/30 and received it on 2/2 (four days later) much faster that I anticipated and the package arrived in like new condition as advertised!

The whole family loved watching this. The monsters were way over the top destroying New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geek Heaven","review":"I was a nerd/geek/dork before it was \\"cool\\" to be so. I was one of the only girls my age to have comic books and play superheros with the boys in my neighborhood. I progressed to fantastically nerdy/kitschy stuff like \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" in high school and college. So finding out that A) There was a massive superhero movie that was B) Directed by Joss Whedon... this, my friends, is the equivalent of Nerd Nirvana. Fans of Joss will easily be able to pick up on lines that were clearly penned by him (\\"He's adopted.\\" is just one example). I am so thrilled that all of the actors have signed on for the sequel, AND that Joss will be directing that as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"supper nice!!!!","review":"audio video both were high standard, who enjoy hifi system this is one of you taste.Bass and surround + supperhero fight...wow...!!! perfect!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.","review":"One star better than Sylvester Stallone and The Expendables, I'll say that. But, it's close. Seriously, just don't watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool,","review":"i'm pretty sure that any man would know what to expect out of this movie. you have the combining of some of the most loved comic book figures. although i personally wished that they add Wolverine it is not a big loss. those already in it were played well, even the stand in for the Hulk. All i can say that would not do it justice is that the next Marvel movie won't be out for awhile. i enjoy watching the timeline of their movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great movie, loved the sarcastic humor!! It was great to get to rent the HD version the day it was released and never leave the couch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I rarely say \\"wow!\\" when I see a film, but this did it. I honestly thought this was going to be a bad movie for a number of reasons, so I put off watching it for a long time. Had I known Joss Whedon (my favorite director) was directing it, I would have watched it sooner. The action, the dialog, the acting, the effects; everything was fantastic, and I didn't have a single \\"oh that's stupid\\" moment -- which I thought I was going to have with a big budget movie that was capitalizing on prior blockbusters. Very very cool, and a must see if you're at all a fan of comics and superheroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marvel-ously dissappointing","review":"The film is AMAZING and well worth the wait but the extras on this are a HUGE appointment, the lack of extras is unforgiveable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"Total waste of time.

I don't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SPECIAL FEATURES ON DVD","review":"i for one loved the movie, however i am very disappointed in the dvd release. once again the dvd has no speial features at all and blu ray gets everything. why bother even putting it on dvd. just make this exclusive to blu ray since those who do not have blu ray get ripped off. why waste our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I agree with others that say the movie itself was really boring and dull. I don't understand how so many people LOVED IT!It took a LONG time for the story to get going, and then when it did it was a very repetitious series of explosions and an unlimited number of creatures destroying NYC, for no apparent reason. It seemed to go on and on forever and ever. It was like watching paint dry. Ugh!I really enjoyed Iron Man I and II. Robert Downey junior is an excellent actor and those movies were at least interesting and fun. I thought this one would be along those lines. Nah. Scarlet Johansen is really pretty, and captain america is pretty buff, so they tried to please both the male and female audience, but the plot was dull, dull dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie s***","review":"I excepted more action , it took about 47 mins or so to see any kinda of action, except the small part in the beginning. This movie isn't worth 20 dollars. it falls to my standards to 7.95The Avengers story line is so dry I had to turn off the movie five times before finish it, but that's just my opinion, it up to you to judge this movie.I think in the future I am not going by reviews in purchase a movie. I have not clue how 200 plus people rate this movie a 5. unless they were in the movie or was told too by the studio to rate it high.I would save you money and rent it at the redbox for a 1.29."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, but Hardly any Behind the Scenes content","review":"The Avengers movie- gets 5 Stars.But the Avengers BluRay 3D, BluRay, DVD, Digital Copy- gets 1 Star.Blockbuster movies on BluRay deserve to have awesomeamounts of content, collected during the film's shooting schedule.BEHIND the SCENES interviews, set building, special effects bonanza,stunts, locations, etc...Here are some great BluRay films with TONS of Extras:AVATAR BluRay- TONS of Extras.The ABYSS- not available on BluRay but awesome Extras,LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy BluRay or DVD sets- TONS of extrasDARK KNIGHT BluRay- great Extras & very well documented.THE MATRIX BluRay Trilogy - Awesome Extras.The 3 TRANSFORMER films- Michael Bay loves to share his experience on his sets.Great Movie, but Hardly any Behind the Scenes content"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cup Cake Avengers","review":"This is the most over rated movie ever made.People on Amazon who has rated this movie over 2 stars must think Dancing with the Stars is the best show ever on tv.The Avengers is all about CGi.

So much better than it did at the cinema.The movie is absolutely fantastic, so well done that it performed a miracle - created demand for a new Hulk movie. Indeed it's the big green guy and Tony Stark who shine in this film, but all the Avengers get their time in the sun thanks to Joss Whedon's fanboy dream script, full of his customary intelligence and humour.Visual effects look absolutely stunning on the digital transfer.Only minor carp: Should of been shot in 2.35:1 widescreen!Extras are a bit thin - expect more tricked up editions down the road.A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juggles egos quite well","review":"The Avengers does something quite difficult, not it's not CGI or presenting a compellng story (although it does have those). It manages the egos of several mainstream actors without selling any of them short. Everyone wants their character to be the \\"star\\" and the Avengers does a good job of giving each his/her due. Who would have thought that the Hulk would have actually held a solid place in the show, and not just act as a dumb brute. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and timing","review":"This movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. It's funny, very well made, and remains interesting the whole time.

Each character was given the opportunity to contribute to the story in a significant way and the banter was a lot of fun. I may have given it five stars if not for Loki's horned outfit looking so ridiculous.If you wait for the end of the credits, there's a great last shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"When they said 'Best Comic Book Movie of All Time' they weren't kidding!","review":"When I saw Robert Downey Jr in the original Iron Man movie, I thought 'that's how you should do a comic book movie!' But I've got to say, Iron Man has been upstaged, but fortunately it's by himself.What really made the movie? There are so many great lines, many of them delivered by Robert Downey Jr, but all of the Avengers have their moments.If DC Comics ever gets around to doing their rumored Justice League movie set up, then they will have some big shoes to fill.The only downer of note was the dearth of extras on the DVD, compared to the Blu-Ray versions, but of the movie itself, no question is it worth it, even without those."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT 3D EXPERIENCE","review":"Loved the 3D experience and it was my first on my new 3D HDTV.

There is nothing to indicate that the digital download is SD. When a movie is purchased as a set that includes two HD versions (including 3D), and specifically advertises a digital download as a 4th disc in a 4 disc set, it reasonable to assume that the digital download is HD, unless stated otherwise. Yet when I entered the code through iTunes (one of 2 given options, the other being Windows Media Player), I received the SD version, whether or not I downloaded directly to my iPad or though iTunes. The HD version is available for purchase through iTunes.The movie is great, but I was stuck watching it in SD in a hotel, so this product is not. If I had known the digital copy was SD, I would have just bought the HD digital version through Amazon or iTunes, not the set, as my personal preference is digital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible packaging...","review":"I saw this movie in the theaters and absolutely loved it! One of the must have movies so right after i watched it i preordered it on amazon.When I opened up the packaging I was in disbelief. The discs were stacked one on top of another so that there were 4 disks in 2 slots.

What gives? I don't have a blue-ray and nor do I plan to. This DVD should cost $10 TOPS because that is all you are getting - THE MOVIE. What a rip off!

This is a great movie and dvd users deserve to enjoy the same special features as the blu-ray users. Seriously? The dvd only has one featurette and a commentary? That SUCKS. I don't want to have to buy a blu-ray player, just so I can see the special features. I know this is just entertainment, but I do feel kinda bitter about this. I think both formats should get equal treatment. This is very unfair to a lot of faithful customers. I was waiting on pins and needles for this to come out, partially for the deleted scenes and gag reel. Now, I know I'll still be missing out, after Tuesday.

Thor is horrible, Captain America even worse, Iron Man acceptable, only character worth a crap is Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, and he even struggles, some of these guys are great actor, yet they seem like they are cringing at their own words, as if they can not believe they are being forced to say this awful dialogue.

The one star rating is for the sound. I bought this on instant video. For the price I paid, I expect to get Dolby Digital, just as I would on the DVD had I purchased it (sure wish I had). What I got was lousy stereo sound. I am surprised Amazon treats their instant video customers this way. Needless to say I will not be purchasing any more instant videos from them. You live, you learn. Here is a good slogan for Amazon Instant Video. Expect better, get less. Least they could do is warn you on the order page. Oh well, lesson learned.Update: I checked out Vudu.com. All my movies on there, including Standard Definition ones, are in Dolby Digital 5.1+. Not sure what the plus means but I now know the Vudu.com is the place to buy your digital movies if you want decent sound for your money. No, I do not work for them, nor do I have any interest in their business.

Captain America was well the same guy in the comic books, a strong man with black and white convictions. Iron Man was as good if not better than his solo movies, the Hulk seems to be gaining some of the cross intellect from Bruce that shows up in the later comic books and Thor is well Thor from the legends an immortal who loves Earth and is willing to protect it. Loki is the trickster and again the bad guy, you know the plot and most of the characters and yet knowing what might happen just pulls you into the show. It is a great action adventure with a touch of fantasy the whole family can enjoy, assuming your family has children whom can tell the difference between a movie and the real world.

The Movie \\"The Avengers\\" is amazing, it gets a 5 out of 5, and the movie on blu ray is more then perfect, the movie on blu ray is th main reason that this blu - ray is a must buy. There is not much of special features, which dissapoints me, but it has some and one very good deleted scenes, the awesome one involving Cap., and a very cool short film that I enjoyed. Overall I would give this blu ray as a whole 4.5 out of 5 stars.

The development of the characters, from Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed, growling Nick Fury to Chris Evans idealistic Captain America to Robert Downey's smart-aleck Ironman learning to play well with others, reflects what made Marvel special in the first place. The action scenes are like seeing a big, graphically rich comic page come to life. And it's not just action; there are quite unexpected plot twists. My only caveat is that the bad guys' motivation seems a little thin (apparently they're just bad). Loki seems to suffer from the conventional movie-script father conflict (yawn).

I use a Roku box with AT&T Uverse (the fastest plan available) and I never have problems with Netflix or Hulu. These problems are specific to Amazon Prime. I still keep Amazon Prime because it pays for itself with free shipping on my Amazon orders. It's also nice that Amazon prime has a lot of things available that you can't get on Netflix or Hulu. Of course, anything that is good requires an extra fee on top of what I already pay per month. Amazon Prime instant video is a perk if you are already going to get Prime for free 2-day shipping.

Though there's one major flaw in the story besides it being poorly written. The Hulk is invincible..... I don't know much about Hulk in the comics, but this pretty much makes the Avengers pointless. In the movie it overly depicts Hulk as invincible, everyone is afraid of him, he gets shot with hundreds of lasers and nothing happens, at the end he utterly destroys the bad guy without help from any of the others.

I'm not reviewing the film. There's Metacritic for that. I'm reviewing the product itself. This is the first of two Disney titles (the other being the 4-Disc 3D Blu-ray of Frankenweenie) where the case itself only holds two discs, so the discs are stacked on top of one another.I'm sorry for complaining, but Disney is a billion dollar company. I'm paying more for the version with more discs, and there's been past entries by Disney where they've included a plastic piece to attach more discs to. It's a petty way to cut corners.Rant over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisis On Infinite Earths Is Simply Awesome","review":"Crisis On Infinite Earths is possibly the best comic book I've ever read. There are so many characters and stories that you get thrown into, you can't help but fall in love with something, if not everything. Crisis is also great because it introduces you to the massive DC universe. You could seriously not know anything about DC characters and pick up Crisis, love it, and use it as your platform for every DC book you get afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"So I've been a comics fan for a long time (with a hiatus of a few years while I was in junior high and high school). I've been reading through the history of the DC universe, reading the big stories and about my favorite characters. So naturally I wanted to start with this, as this is where it all supposedly started.This is easily the most boring graphic novel/trade I have read. How many times do we need to be told by reporters or newpapers that the world is in danger. There are some decent fight scenes, but they are few and far in between. As someone else said, read the synopsis on wikipedia or a DC-related site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important to DC, but boring as a novel","review":"For anyone unaware, Crisis on Infinite Earths served to simplify and relaunch the 60-year-old DC Universe. It paved the way for some truly excellent work DC publishes now. Unfortunately, this book itself is quite boring. The plot consists essentially of a Deus Ex Machina (or two of them, to be precise) destroying, and then combining the multiple DC Universes into the single universe seen in DC Comics today.The plot and dialog are almost painfully boring at times. It's just about the most uninteresting way possible to do something that should actually be interesting, given its impact on the DC Universe over the last 15 years.Worth a purchase for curious fans of the current DC titles, but avoid this if you're new to comics, or don't care how the relaunch was pulled off."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing and lengthy","review":"This is the first time I have heard of Crisis on Infinite Earths. I thought I would give it a try. It was so long and wordy I gave up after the 5th chapter. I had a hard time finding it entertaining or follwoing the plot. It seemed all over the place to me with refernces and characters. I would say start with a shorter, less convoluted graphic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe this was decent 25 years ago...","review":"I purchased this as i have been getting back into comics and this is pretty much required reading for the DC universe. I had to force myself through it. It's a whole lot of text for what is at the core, a pretty simple plot. I get it's importance to the DCU, but it's not a great story... Maybe it could have been without all the worthless banter. How many times do you have to defeat the same villian in the same book? My suggestion is to read the synopsis on Wikipedia. I explained the plotline to my girlfriend and she said it sounded interesting. When thinking about what happens that is story related, it is interesting and a great idea, just cut out all the BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, not work the time","review":"I read this because it was a legendary tale. It was a big let down. The plot is very simple and stretched very thin. The significance of the story is big but how it plays out is long and slow. It does have a cool moment here and there but most of it is very hoaky and over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Infite Crisis of Lameness","review":"Without a doubt this is the biggest piece of crap I have ever read. I couldn't get past the 2nd or 3rd chapter. Long, overly involved, overly complex, and just plain old stupid. This is exactly the kind of thing that makes you embarassed to admit you love comic books, and this is exactly the reason DC tanked in the 80s and needed to be revived by Batman and Gaiman's Sandman in the late 80s. Read only if looking for simultaneous cures for insomnia and sanity. This was nothing more than a waste of my time and brain-space."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally awful...","review":"this is one of those comics collections that history holds as so great, then you read it and think wha happened? because it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great artwork, NOT fun to read...","review":"Another reviewer said that Crisis on Infinite Earths is fun to read. Not really, unless you're one of those people who enjoys watching Faces of Death videos. Crisis on Infinite Earths is a nearly 400-page string of countless deaths. My first reaction to it, in fact, was horror... it's much more of a horror story than a \\"fun\\" story.The book is also, as some have said, very confusing. It's definitely not for casual readers who have never heard of Crisis on Infinite Earths, or already read background information on it. For a better DC crossover, I would recommend Kingdom Come by Mark Waid and Alex Ross. For a more fun book, I would recommend Bizarro Comics."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"i bought this book to see how the flash(barry allen) dies.man not only was i disapionted in how the flash dies,the rest of the book was just as disapionting.prety much a book filled with heros no one cares about.plus the action jumps around too much.one min your reading about a group of heros doing battle,then it jumps to the next scene.this book never lived up to the hype!major stinker!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite storyline ever","review":"I have always disliked this story. I enjoyed all the various alternate earths in the DC universe... Earth-1, the current superheroes, Earth-2, the Silver Age heroes, Earth-S, the Fawcett characters (Shazam, etc.). Even Earth-C, with Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew (don't ask, it was a guilty pleasure even then ;)This is the storyline that killed them all. Garbage collection for the DC universe. Of course, I've always tended to dislike \\"revisionist\\" ideas. Give me all the \\"alternate\\" versions you like, just don't mess with the originals.And now, DC has \\"Elseworlds\\" stories, and recently did a re-telling of an old JLA story involving an alternate earth with villainous versions of the JLA (the JLA: Earth-2 graphic novel). So it was all for naught, anyway.I've been a big Marv Wolfman and George Perez fan for a long time, but pass this one by. A lame villain and pointless revisionism make this story not worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRISIS ON INFINITE WHAT???","review":"It started out as a great book. Then it got into the whole multiple earths thing and then to make it more confusing they introduced characters that had nothing to do with the plot. Don't get me wroung, it was a great idea for a book it just needed to stick to the game plan. I did enjoy the multiple characters meeting themselves and the heros of other world fighting eachother. They ruind that idea though by haveing them be brain washed. That was dumb. Overall it was OK. I wouldn't read it again though."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS MANY THINK","review":"I just finished reading this book, and boy am I glad. If it wasn't for George Perez, I never would have bought it. I already know why DC did this book, to clean up their continuity. They also had to kill off a few major characters so it would be \\"eventful.\\" The story is highly overrated, as are most stories now-a-days by \\"acclaimed\\" writers. But, I'm a sucker for George Perez art, so I did not really have a choice. Same goes for Byrne, Zeck, and Bright. No matter who writes the stuff they draw, I'll buy it. Too bad Bright and Zeck don't do more stuff and Byrne doesn't do more than one book. I have almost all their DC and Marvel stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"a hard pill to swallow","review":"Wow, what a read! Lots of info, LOTS of info. (my head hurts). I started reading this almost completly out of obligation (after all it's the big one, the one all the stories to come come from, the grand illustrious potentate of DC comics, ect). Aside from the several sittings it took me to get through, it was, after all the fat is cut away, a good story. It was a needed story, and less of a fun tale but an endurance test. Word of advice, take notes. It does get confusing but by the end Earth 1,2,3,X, and Prime all become realatively understandable (sort of). I wouldn't suggest this to a casual reader. To a hardcore fan, a must (but chances are, they already read it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth it if you are a major DC Fan","review":"Crisis on Infinite Earths is frankly not worth the money unless you have a desperate desire to learn some of the backstory of current DC characters.The plot isnt particularly good, and is hampered by the desperate need to simplify the DC world (which failed in any case, as JLA:Earth 2 conveniently recycles ideas from the pre CoIE era).Even if you think you're up to date on current JLA and Golden Age timelines there will undoubtedly be a lot of backstory you do not understand.The DC universe changes so often that keeping up with it isnt worth it: it's a sucker's market. For a comic or this era that is readable I recommend 'The Return of Superman', which has its detractors but remains one of the few Superman books that doesnt bore me to death. Better still, check out Kingdom Come, Astro City, V for Vendetta or Sandman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, bad termination!","review":"The book idea of ending the carrier of some DC Comics characters and heros is logical and acceptable in a way, giving the chance for future major changings.But the way that idea terminated was so poor, unfortunately.It needed a writer like Alan Moore or Cary bates to write it, and Curt Swan to pencil it.After 30 years of reading the Flash, Barry Allen deserves a better end than the one we read in this book, an ownered death, not a terrified \\"silly\\" dead after weakened by a silly Fear Master.Barry Allen deserved to die in the field.Also, the way Kara, Supergirl died, is so not logical.At least let some Kryptonite radiation appears before killing her, and at leat let the Superman Reaction be more emotional toward it.I dont know what to say, i am disappointed.God Bless Cary Bates, Alan Moore, Curt Swan, and others writers and penicellers, who made our imagination grows up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whirr. Clank. Thud.","review":"Given the commercial difficulties that necessitated the writing of this series of comics (i.e. the need to streamline the DC universe and cure writers of their growing obsession with complicated questions of continuity) it really would have been something if CRISIS had turned out to be even a moderately good story. It isn't, sadly - the whole thing reads like a giant engineering problem. Some nice cover art, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that ruined the DC Universe.","review":"You read it right, apart from having great Perez & Ordway art, this filth ruined a great history of DC characters written by many such as Gardner Fox, Robert Kanigher and trashed Julius Schwartz's concept of alternate Earths.This also paved other EVENTS book hopefully ending with a real... FINAL CRISES."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"my mother said it was ok, the sound was not good had to keep turning volume up and down, overall ok"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"What is the deal with listening to sound effects?

The author dispels misconceptions about BDSM and encourages the reader to use his/her creative imaginations. Highly recommended for the cinical psychologist for his/her practice, members of the legal profession for understanding, or even members of sexual minorities looking for avenues of expression. A must read for anyone interested in BDSM or cultural anthropology/cultural expression. A realistic approach to this topic is what is needed most and this book delivers that much needed realistic approach. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect how to for Beginners","review":"New to the world of BDSM this book was recommended and I consumed it. It is educational, informative and fun. A must have for the newbie or just the curious. For the vanilla crowd that are unsure of the BDSM world, this will answer your questions as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of BDSM topics","review":"I bought this book to complement my previous BDSM knowledge, and also to share with my inexperienced significant other. I am pleased with the detail given to each basic topic, and feel that it offers a very good introduction to those new to the scene. Despite when it was published, I feel most of the information is still relevant, however I'd still recommend reading a few other books in addition to this one if you are new."},{"rating":"2","title":"SM 101","review":"This is an educational book in regards to what S/M is all about. It focuses on teaching safety techniques, the importance of safe words and what the Scene is really all about. I would highly recommend this book for those of you with like minds who truly want to know what the Scene is really about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novices need to read this, the Experted can learn too","review":"I have a spiral bound copy of this book as well as this edition that I'm reviewing. The goal of the book is to make the novice safe -- usually the focus is on teaching the top partner but I think that the bottom partner could learn something too. This book won't make you safe, only practice and experience can do that, but it will give you basic guidelines on a very wide range of subjects so you can try things out slowly and with less risk. The overall feel is toward male top and female bottom (note please that the terms bottom and top or dom and sub are often refering to the same role) but there are sections specifically for other orientations and it written non-threatheningly so you can get value regardless of your role. It is a book I insist all my apprentices purchase and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what you need to know!","review":"Jay Wiseman brings his years of experience to us in this fantastic primer on SM. He covers all the common activities--spanking, flogging, clamps, heat and cold play, bondage, and D/s activity, in a way that will make even the rawest newcomer able to decide what is right for them. His sense of humor helps a lot to demystify what can be a scary world to enter.I can't keep a copy of this book in my house--I'm always loaning it out, and somehow it never seems to come back to me. But two, and give one to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"the place to start and more","review":"great starter from an author actually involved in the scene. covers evrything from safety & legal issues to etiquette & tips on how to please your dominant or your submissive & everything in between. like the '101' title suggests this is the starting point for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, encouraging & honest","review":"I have never read a work on BDSM that was not only easy to read, but easy to \\"digest\\". The book is organized in a logical manner, frequently reminding the reader of vitally important points (safety, consensuality, etc.), and is laced with charming quips he apparently overheard through the years. I found it interesting to read about people who are experiencing these feelings and desires, and how they were able to \\"realize\\" the part of themselves society has so overtly and incorrectly stigmatized. Wiseman has provided a clear, unassuming intro to SM, and while his credibility is primarily based on two decades of personal experience in the SM scene, it is made \\"real\\" and \\"human\\" with the inclusion of his own hesitant beginnings. With any luck, SM101 will help to repair the truly evil reputation SM is currently shackled with (pun intended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Damn fine book","review":"after reading other peoples reviews i wasn't sure if this book could live up to the hype but after reading it in one evening all i can say is yes it does live up to the hype.

Whatever you do, don't start here!As extremely avid readers, we found this book to be the worse written piece we have ever read. The quotes are entertaining, at times, and attempt to keep you awake between the excessive repetitiveness of the author's teachings.There is a bit of informative BDSM material, that is relevant only to the US, and is written from a single dominant male's perspective (reader beware). All of the ideas in this book could have been expressed in 1/4 of the pages.This book was largely a waste of our time especially with the internet at our fingertips. Shame on us for reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lame....seriously lame","review":"Jay Wiseman is unfortunaly a popular writer. Far to many scene people buy this book and quote it like the bible. It is silly, childish and if you actually followed his instructions no play would ever take place. Absolutely not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for newbies and old heads alike.","review":"Jay Wisemans knowledge both medically and personal contribute to this book on a large scale. Mine is highlighted and dog eared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Intentioned But Too Pedantic","review":"The book was written with the best intentions. However, Wiseman details in precise, numbered lists many of the basic techniques to the point of boredom. He includes how many strokes to apply and exactly where. It leaves the reader with a sense that the techniques provided within must adhere to a strict set of rules.If you feel most comfortable with tight guidelines, then this is a fine book. I would suggest taking a look at titles like \\"Screw the Roses\\" or \\"Sensual Magic\\" to gain more creative insights into the realms of BDSM."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for those with a little experience...","review":"This book was an ok read. It is probably better for someone with a little bit of experience but if you have done more than just dabbled in BDSM, then this book is not for you. Not really for submissives either... This book is better for someone who is interested in being a dominant."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"This is a very good book for new commers to read.

I recommend this book to anyone intrested in this Lifestyle we choose to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent beginner intro to BDSM","review":"I bought SM101 after a suggestion from an experienced member of the local scene. Wiseman gives newbies an excellent intro to the social rules, ideas and conventions of BDSM. He also gives great ideas for learning the basic physics and mechanics of BDSM.The only thing I don't like is that Wiseman is a somewhat hard ass of a top. I want to be (and have, I'm a switch) a softer top. But this was still the book I needed to read as a newb.After you read SM101, I recommend Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns next. http://www.amazon.com/Screw-Roses-Send-Thorns-Sadomasochism/dp/0964596008/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1359083781&sr;=8-1&keywords;=screw+the+roses+send+me+the+thorns"},{"rating":"2","title":"Title says it all.","review":"This is the perfect realistic introduction to lifestyle D/s, heavy BDSM, and/or non-heavy bedroom games. He is a very funny, often satiric, and easy to understand writer. Safety is stressed- again and again- but I think that it must be. Jay also has a great knowledge of the medical and physical side of things- which I found not only interesting- but also comforting. I can personally recommend this as a great book to read while on jury duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I first read SM101 when it was a comb-bound volume assembled from photocopied pages. At that time, my own, The Loving Dominant, was \\"in press\\" at the publishers and no other hetrosexual BDSM how-to existed. It impressed me then and it continues to impress me. Jay's grasp of BDSM is comprehensive. However, one of the finest parts of the book is the section on negotiation. This, not knocking over the furniture or wrapping your partner's genitals with a flogger, is where there is the greatest risk of a scene going wrong. Anyone who follows these guidelines greatly reduces the chance that unexpected \\"landmines\\" may crop up."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like a text book only more dry","review":"Wisman provides a wealth of info on BDSM which is great for new people and the books greatest asset. The information provided is dead on, but you have to be somewhat of a masochist to read it all the way through. I think that you can get the same great information that Wiseman provides from \\"Screw The Roses, Send Me The Thorns\\" by Molly Devon and the late Phillip Miller and \\"Come Hither\\" by Gloria Brame in a much more enjoyable form. Both of those books still provide the information needed, but do so with humor and personal stories that makes you want to keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my money and time","review":"This was just a total waste of time in the recording studio. A bunch of politically charged lyrics that had no basis in reality. I was sorry that there was nothing lower on the volume control than mute.

I was shocked and amazed that it kept me interested. I love the fact that Jerome Stern utilizes comedy, so that I'm laughing while I'm learning. The lessons in this book are vital for fiction writers of any level. The information is clearly explained, and at the end of each section the names of other related sections within the book are given.

An intelligent reader will soon learn within the first 50 pages that this is the same \\"nickel and dimed\\" stuff warmed over. Is there no originality? Are all corporations really the bad guys? Is business only about exploitation? Are books of this genre only for copycat professors who have lost all imagination?

I couldn't find a book out there and my pregnancy books barely covered the topic.Now I'm pregnant with my third and know I'll be having another c-section so I am thrilled that there is finally a book to help me. The Essential C-Section Guide is amazing -- it's so easy to read and the authors really explain everything you need to know about c-sections.

I would even recommend any pregnant woman to check this book out just in case she ends up having a c-section. I just had my first baby, my pregnancy was healthy and I had no problems yet I had to have a c-section done at the last minute. Having the information in this book days after my c-section instead of weeks would have been much better. It's informative and lets you realize your not alone. This is a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information","review":"I had an unplanned c-section for my first child. This book gave me the information I needed to understand what happened the first time and why my doctor reccommended a planned c-section for my second child. This book gave me the information to ask the right questions and make an informed decision about my body and the welfare of my child. I think natural child birth classes gloss over this information and if a c-section becomes necessary, many women are ill informed to make the necessary decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information","review":"I had to have a cesarean for medical reasons but couldn't find any information about what happens and what to expect afterwards. All the pregnancy books only had maybe a page about c-sections and wasn't helpful at all. This was a great reference. It made the whole experience easier to deal with and gave me the knowledge I needed to feel comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book must be read","review":"This book is an astonishing eye-opener on how inconsciously agressive we can be to ourselves and to others, and on how considering few basic elements within us may contribute to a better life and a better society. I strongly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Violent Communication","review":"I have just read a few chapters, but it has already been extremely helpful to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BOTHER WITH THIS","review":"I HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A REPETITIOUS WASTE OF TIME.THE ONLY USE OF THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE FOR SOMEONE TRAINING TO NEGOTIATE WITH PROBLEM GROUPS OR WORKING AS SHRINK.

Even if its 26 yrs old! At least its in ENGLISH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for everybody all the time.","review":"A profound critic of our language and the way we use language. Not only is this book a critic it also teachs you how to avoid being violent in you speeh and how to defuse anothers violent speech. Very detailed with practical help and ideas for pactise. Similar to \\"Active Listening\\" or \\"Reflective Listening\\" but much easier to understand and implement in everyday life. Especially useful for teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read for anyone who talks to people","review":"this book has so transformed the way i communicatewith my family members, friends, co-workers, customersand complete strangers! i will be using this book withmy future children. i hope all interested in clear andcompassionate communication will read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're searching for just one book, this is the one...","review":"The compassionate communication model offered in this book by Marshall Rosenberg is core to all of life's communication. The model he presents is quite simple and so rewarding to practice. I've seen nothing sort of miracles happen when I've seen people use this model to truly connect with those around them. Do yourself and the ones you love a favor and get this book. Then treat yourself to seeing one of Marshall's introductory evenings in person held all around the world. You'll be truly glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the first two books of this series and I enjoyed them. Not as well written as Elrod's solo books, but enjoyable and fast paced, nonetheless. This book was just plain silly. And the ending? OK, I get it, you want to end the series. But it was just plain silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Adventure","review":"The final book of Lord Richard Oreleans. You learn more about his relationship with his brothers, and how Richard actually became champion for the family instead of the middle brother. He became a priest. Richard faces many trials to regain his mortality and Cheron is back and not making things easy for our hero.The story goes all over the world and people finally learn what Richard is. They accept him, and help him on his quest. One of the women he (Richard) loves is taken from him in a surprising manner. Various Gods make an appearance, and the return of Sharron compleates it all.Over all I enjoyed the book and couldn't stop reading it. I think it'll join my long list of favroites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple comedy, packed with psychological intrigue","review":"This show is a delightful rendition of the single mother and her super-smart daughter who creates an imaginary friend every time her mother becomes intimate with a man. The themes are real and very pointent, however they are delivered in a way that is light and sweet rather than heavy and demanding. Graham is able to mix the light with the dark, the real with the humerous while getting across a very real story of a mother and her daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds flat-out lazy.","review":"I was expecting so much more from Drudkh. I own all of their previous albums and they are one of my favorite atmospheric black metal bands. So, I heard they were doing an all-acoustic album and was stoked. Well, listening to this music put out that fire. This is a black/metal band doing Ukranian Folk songs, for me it doesn't work. Way too repetitive and boring. The playing is lazy and uninspired. Although, some I know like this, if I was going to buy this, I would definitely want to hear it first.(something I didn't do) I strongly suggest that people listen first, before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and misleading","review":"John Nunn is a wonderful chess writer. His 'Understanding Chess Move by Move' is possibly the most instructive chess book ever written. And his two previous books on his own games are excellent.However this book is a disappointment. For a start it is less than honest as it does not, though the title suggests otherwise, apply 'move by move' analysis to the games. The misleading title is an attempt to cash in on the success of his previous book using that approach. Also, unlike his other game collection books, this book has a tired feel to it and Nunn, on the evidence of this book, seems disenchanted with chess. The book also has quite an amount of 'filler' - studies, compositions, articles on chess publishing (hardly of much interest except to chess authors).In summary this book is misleading in its title and disappointing in its content. Instead read John Nunn's other excellent books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find!","review":"I ordered this CD on a whim. I heard two of the songs during a scene on All My Children and just had to know who sang them. I found out thru another source and just had to get the CD. It is one of my favorites. Hope to hear more of this band. They have a great sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book huh ??!!","review":"\\"yeah what a good book realy\\"thats what we always read in reviews and when you buy the book, you just know the truth.I am wondering who writes this reviews ???Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would-be 2.5...this is an incredibly average album.","review":"First, judging by the photograph on the liner and the cd itself, one might guess this to be some kind of guttural gothic death metal. From the first track one would be grateful (or perhaps disappointed) that it's instead quite harmless and almost upbeat, however once the lyrics end, they go into some kind of dissonant jam that is just plain noisy. The accoustic numbers seem odd following them. Clumsy or forced rhymes, words that seem out of place (i.e. sublime, genufleck?), and sometimes whiny vocals also weigh down the album. This is not to say it's a bad album; it's usually a decent, even pleasant listen. Ultimately, this album's respectable failure is caused by a lack of a target audience. It pushes an empty punk envelope, then pauses for sentimental reflection, often forgetting to tone down the screeching guitars. If they were more than average singers, lyricists, or musicians, we might just have heard of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gayton is Expansively Compassionate","review":"Shrewd and expansively compassionate observations play a steady drumbeat throughout this author's prose and poems, echoing a myriad of cultures, cities, and souls as Gayton pursues a relentless global search for personal integrity, both his and those of his subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for hard core fans","review":"this was somewhat of a disappointment. i ordered through entrepreneur magazine, and the shipped product did not seem like the same thing i read about in their magazine. i was going to photocopy it and return for a refund, but the book was so awful i forgot i had it until after the return expiration date. althoug the book is somewhat helpful, the information (especially the info regarding the type of computer needed for office) was extremely outdates. i bought this in the summer of 1999, and it mentioned something about buying a 386 computer with an 8800 bps modem. i would pass on this, and stick to the more informative and less expensive selections available in the site. many of the pages seem like photocopies or even black and white printouts from an old laser printer, the folder accompaning the information is nothing special either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Intro","review":"Ms Merryman gives a concise, clear, and yet broad intro to music theory of the common practice period (i.e. no atonal works, no Gregorian chant). Illustrated by examples and underscored with keyboard exercises that help to hear what she's writing about, this book explained many things I intuitively understood with a refreshing clarity. Then, for those who want to dig deeper, there are helpful references at the end of each chapter. I read it as a borrowed book from a library - now I'm buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but expensive","review":"I found this book to have a lot of solid, useful information, which was presented in a succinct, economical way. It covers the basics well. However, the book itself is quite pricey. I've actually been torn between keeping it (because it is an excellent book) and returning it (because it was so expensive). It's a pretty slim book, and I'm impressed that the author was able to cram two entire semesters of conservatory-level theory -- plus some exercises -- into such a thin book, but, by the same token......it's hard for me to justify paying so much for such a small volume!So, I'm still on the fence about this. There are more expensive theory books out there, for sure, and the majority of them are no doubt a lot wordier. I do like the book. Just can't decide whether I can afford it or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check this guy out!","review":"Peter Beets has been one of Europe's best jazz pianists for the past 10 years. Hailing from The Netherlands, he's recorded some 8 albums and I find all of them a joy to listen to.I got hooked on his music having attended a couple of his concerts. There - as on his albums - he provided a mix of technical prowess, great musicianship and the kind of playing that gets your feet tapping. His are the cd's that I will always have with me when I have a long car ride ahead. Just click on the songs and you will hear what I mean. Great quality, great fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"lysol cleaner","review":"The clorox bleach in this product is overcoming.....and the smell lasts for many hours afterwards.

Install was easy on my �?1 JK using Smittybilt 7690 brackets. The switch works great & adjustment of the beams was easy & positive with a 14mm wrench for the horizontal & a 13mm socket & extension for the vertical. Antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light. Nice product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Range Light System","review":"With the windshield mount I don't experience the \\"hood glare\\" issues that some get with driving lights. These lights are attractive and VERY bright. I aim them just above/beyond my high beams and they work perfectly. The installation was simple and straightforward. A single instruction sheet was all that was needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Purchased in March 2011 for a 2004 Ford Ranger, 4x4, with a Westin brush guard. Very easy to install on the brush guard. Had a friend wire these up in about an hour. A little too much wire in some areas, a little more needed in others, but not a big problem. Definitely would purchase some plastic conduit to contain the wires and protect them, and to make the installation look professional. Easy to mount, and aim vcertically and horizontally. Price beat any other brick and mortar store and any on web site that I could research. Do your homework; some are slim lights and some are not. Some are for long range and some are for lighting up the side of the road. Some for 4x4 ing and off roading and some not. Be careful in reading the description for use and buy for the reason that you need them. Take your time and you will not be disappointed. Satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super bright and looks great!!!!!!","review":"I purchased these to instal on my 08 Wrangler. Instal was very simple considering I'm not very electronically inclined. The instructions were not very detailed but it wasn't an issue at all, if you can can tell the difference between 3 different colors and know how to work simple hand tools then you should have no problem.

The GBA Micro Sleeve isn't comfortable while playing. The sleeve it self makes it hard to push buttons. The start and select button along with the left and right trigger are not even visable. The only thing I can see useing this for is carrying it, but thats what the cotton bag is used for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeez,can we get anymore bland and predictable?","review":"Seriously,I enjoy all types of music,so it's not a genre thing. It's just a matter of how many \\"college rock\\" bands can a person take? I saw them in Wilmington and it just bored me to death. I hate to be so blunt,but whenever I go to Wilmington(I'm in Jacksonville,NC) everyone talks my ear off about this band. The cd was given to me,and the best thing about it is the production.This is like MTV stuff,and that's not a compliment. I also heard they had some songs on Dawson's Creek. Hello! That is not cool.If they can just get out of the box,and kill that college rock typical sound,they may have less songs on tv,but a little more respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible bargin and invaluable resource","review":"What an incredible bargin! A reasonably priced book that includes the Outlook 98 software and covers topics I couldn't find anywhere else. This book is an excellent reference and has answered all of my questions about using Outlook 98.

This is the only book I've found that tells me explicitly how to use and customize Outlook for my business."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've never used Outlook, you can start with this book.","review":"This book doesn't have enough information for advanced users. If you are familiar with Outlook97, this book will not enhance your knowledge. I wanted a book explaining the \\"Net Folder\\", which is a new feature in Outlook. However, this topic isn't mentioned in this book. I believe the title \\"Mastering Microsoft Outlook 98\\" is overstated. The title should be, \\"Microsoft Outlook 98 for Beginners\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be avoided...","review":"Despite much anticipation this DVD performance is definitely sub-standard. Stefan Vinke as Paul is so bad it is truly pathetic. He yells through most of the performance and does not even come close to an acceptable performance. Solveig Kringelborn just does not have the voice or lyricism to sing Marie. The rest of the singers are hindered by similar problems. Eliahu Inbal gives us his usual indifferent interpretation. The production is just dark and boring with only moments of interest. I particularly like the camera shots where we are looking into the off-stage wings... So unprofessional!

As a person with a long career in the hospitality business in NC, I was already aware of some of Meyer's success. However, it was an unexpected treat for the senses the hear all the scrumptious details that has gone into the creation of USHG. Meyer's story 'reads' like well blended Bordeaux; part Gourmet Magazine, part business how-to, and part New Yorker Magazine. It is a wonderful peak behind the curtain of a not only the famous Union Square Cafe, but also Meyer's other restaurants and ventures where USHG hospitality and customer loyalty is legendary. Few companies have enjoyed the longstanding successes that Meyer's has created and nurtured.

And it is that. But not as much for the nuts and bolts of the business but rather for a look at upscale restaurants and what may work in a location as well as all of the problems that can occur. There are also sections on the economics of restaurants from an investor's perspective. Bottomline: don't go in the business to make quick money.The diversity of the restaurants is extremely fascinating.

It has yet to help me in any way, and I've had it for years. Most of the time, I can't find an entry even close to the word for which I'm looking. The entries that are there make no sense. For example, \\"Single\\" just shows a lot of one of an item -- one button, one pencil, one binder clip, one dog, a girl. I'm pretty sure when someone looks up \\"single\\" they aren't looking for just a bunch of singular items.

If you wish to know the genesis of many of the classic Suede songs, David Barnett provides the information without sounding chatty or gossipy.

Of course, I bought the long play single and I played that vinyl until it was well worn could play no more -- well it still plays, but it has a lot of scratches and hisses in it now.

There are times when the music drowns out the vocalist as one track is recorded to the discs louder than the other.Time-Life has made a mess of what could have been a wonderful collection.

Whoever assembled the album got the original artists to re-record their old hits, or maybe the re-recordings were lying around for some reason. The album listing should make clear that these aren't the original recordings, and it doesn't.I can't comment on most of the tracks because I've heard only the clips Amazon provides. I can comment on one, which I bought: \\"On and On,\\" by Stephen Bishop. I recommend it highly. It's a great performance, mostly solo acoustic and voice, with double-tracked vocals in a couple of spots. The original version,here, is one of the best pop records of the '70s. This version is different but also excellent, and very much worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"cover bands?? again??!!","review":"Where can I find the originals for some of these tracks?I'm tired of download services offering cover versions of songs with an artist's name next to the track.

He had the courage and was brave enought to do what she never could until the end.I could not understand , at first why she was so angry with him until the end when her secret came out.That was something I never expected.Which goes to proves sometimes we have the same issues as men. It's just how we choose to handle them.While I agree this book was a good and I post it 4*I really felt it was between 3.5 and 3.8 , more than 3* but less than 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Choices Men Make","review":"What I like about the story is the way the characters were developed- I saw them grow as the storyline progressed.

Anyway, who could have guessed what was going on with Stacy? I thought she wanted Vic for herself or something! ANYWAY I'm going to stop ranting and raving about this book- I suggest everyone buy a copy-it's good.Heather"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Choices Men Make","review":"The Choices Men Make by Dwayne S. Joseph was an excellent first novel! The complexity of the plot was intriquing, making the reader really care about what happened to the characters. It was an honest depiction of male-female relationships and our struggle to understand one another. If you enjoy authors like E. Lynn Harris and Eric Jerome Dickey, you will appreciate this novel. Like these other brothers, I envision Dwayne Joseph's characters developing a life of their own, the more he writes. The Choices Men Make is a smooth read with passionate characters that you will either love or hate. The title of the book drew me, but it was the plot that held my attention. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"I had to purchase this book after reading Dwayne's story in A Dollar And A Dream(which was off the hook by the way) I picked that book up because I saw that he and I have the same name and I thought that was weird. Anyway, this novel did not disappoint! There was just enough drama to keep the pages turning. I loved his characters. I felt like he was writing about people I knew! I felt really bad for Roy. He didn't deserve what he got. And I'm glad Colin came around. As for Vic, well, it took a big man to do what he did. This was a great debut. I can't wait to read what he has coming next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Choices Men Make","review":"I would recommend this book to everyone.

And no worries about leaving it on when you go home because of the timer. ... The heat is gentle so you don't feel like you've been at a blow dryer.

The new unit is extremely quiet and heats space very quickly. Only time will tell how energy efficient the unit is, but this unit does not dim the lights like the old unit when in use. So it appears it's energy usage is less. So far, I would say that these are great space heaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"no warm enough ....","review":"We chose this model because it seemed an energy-efficient alternative to our previous Holmes spaceheater, which had worn out after several years of use. The one really good aspect of this heater is that it seems very safe -- the moment it is tilted or put against a surface, it stops. However, it does not generate a lot of heat, even on the higher setting. We have a very small bathroom, yet even after running the heater for 30+ minutes, the room is still not what I would consider really warm (admittedly, I'm a person who is easily chilled.) We bought this in November and used it daily, but I was never completely happy with it, and now the heating element is starting to give out and the heater is generating even less warmth. We're definitely shopping around for something with a little more heating power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold and breezy, tripped the circuit","review":"I used this for the first time today because my heater is broken. Well, it pushes air around the room acting like a fan. This made it feel more chilly in here. It did seem to raise the room temperature slightly even though it was breezy. However, after a couple hours the electricity went out and we had to go fix the circuit breaker. The plug was very hot so this will be going in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holmes Energy Saver","review":"This unit heats quite nicely, but the on/off switch only works intermittently.

Easy on the ear, this album can be played at any time of the day when you are in any mood or situation. It speaks to your heart and your spirit as you too realize that God is transforming US ALL. That God is continually working on US ALL. The music, the melody, the words...all combined nicely to make this album a MUST have for your gospel music collection.

But that's really the exception that proves the rule: most great children's books (I suppose like most books in general) do go out of print. It makes you wonder, when you start browsing through all of the lame current offerings, why publishers aren't scouring through existing stock to pluck out the gems. This book definitely falls into that category: it's charming in every way. There's a homespun quality to the whole thing: it's about an everyday world that just happens to be populated by bugs rather than people. The bugs here don't do anything extraordinary: they just clean their houses, go to the store, to the park, to the zoo, and to the parade. But that's what makes it so fun: the bugs here are not creepy or scary, they're just ordinary family folk. This book is a real hit in our house, with our little boy AND his parents.

I was pleased to see that it was machined out of anodized aluminum and the taps were precision. Plus, it was made in the USA by American workers.This afternoon I did 12 holes for the first dowels and they were where I measured and straight into the wood with no wobble or travel in any direction. I did use a self tapping bit and I was very careful with the measurements.

The setup and installation was easy and simple, and the design was sleek. You can save desk space by using the stand to mount the scanner vertically. Under normal and low DPI, the scan takes a few seconds. However, when scanning at 1200 DPI, the highest setting, scanning can take quite a while. I started scanning about 10 minutes ago, and it is still scanning as I type. Fortunately, you rarely have to scan at such a high resolution. Overall, the Canon N1220U is a vast improvement over my old scanner; an Hp SaP ScanJet 5200C, which is about four times as large and ten times as fuzzy.

It's very small and cool looking, and even comes with a stand so you can place it on its side if you want. It's got a nice package of software included. I like the \\"one-touch\\" scanning--you push the button on the scanner then click whether you want to make a copy, e-mail it, fax-it, or save it. I tried making a copy and it came out great.

Sure, it's easy to criticize, a lot of amazing albums are left out, some are included that will make you cringe, but on the whole, this book is probably the best of the \\"best of\\" books out there. Page long reviews are wonderful to have, rather than short one-paragraph reviews, and my favorite feature is how they point you to new music. For example, let's say you like \\"Sea Change\\" by Beck. Well, the book then suggests you try \\"Cold Fact\\" by Rodriguez, an album released in 1970. If you try that and like it, well, then the book says to go next to \\"It's a Shame About Ray\\" by the Lemonheads, and so on and so forth. This is a great feature. Go get this book and spend hours reading and exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has flaws but still worth five stars.","review":"Just got my copy today, and yeah it's hefty. Surprised that a few of my personal favorites made it in here. Like Brad's Shame. It's definatley worth 5 stars, just because Mojo to me is the last good music magazine. Rolling Stone just blows now. My only problem,as with any type of list like this, is some of the choices perplex me. Mainly how can you have Springsteen's Born in usa and tunnel of love and not Born to Run? Or Janes Addiction's Ritual De Lo Habitual, and not Nothing's Shocking? Pretty Hate machine and no Broken or Downward Spiral? But the albums that are in here are good,and I'm definatley looking forward to exploring this book. And it's o.k. if those are missing, I got it to find out about other works, not those I already have. The notes For each album are well written and give you enough information to think about while indisposed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining to read, lacking in too many areas","review":"One of the best albums of 1970 (and arguably a top 100 record from 65-75) was the Grateful Dead's \\"Workingman's Dead\\". Instead of that album/cd - we get 1970 choices of Vashti Bunyan, Honeybus, Rodriguez, Family, The Carpenters, Soft Machine and Emmit Rhodes.Really, that's all you need to know. There are huge holes in every year and I know I could make a better list (and probably you as well if you are reading this review).Now this book is a fun read (particularly if you dig Planxty and Can - cmon you know those great bands and records - right???). This book is far from definitive and there are quite a few REACHES here. Being a Mojo creation, it's weighted very heavily with UK bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy O","review":"My kids who are 2 1/2 and 4 loved this movie and couldn't get enough of it.

More than half of this book is just a primer on basic finish carpentry and what types of woods were used in \\"woodies\\". A total of 4 pages is dedicated to the general project sequence of how to work on a woodie car but nothing about woodies themselves. There is no discussion of how a body is attached to a chassis, no discussion of any disassembly, use or types of fasteners nor is there any detailed discussion of the differences in \\"woodie\\" types. This book has many glossy pictures but it does not in anyway prepare you to build or restore a woodie. It does give a good overview of types of woods and finished but you can get that for less then half the price (and more detail) at your local hardware stores. Go to any Woodie website for more education on woodie restoration.

My son (7 months old) and I play it almost every afternoon and we sing and dance and his little eyes just light up! And sometimes my son just enjoys listening quietly.I debated on whether to get this or another CD collection by one artist and I'm really glad I decided on this one because it provides such a variety of songs, music, and artists and that's one of the things that makes this CD so good. Plus we now have been exposed to several artists we would not have known which opens up new windows of music opportunities.I would definately buy this as a gift for friends and will look for additional CD's produced by the same company as well as some of the artists of our favorite songs on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, accurate, fair Windows coverage.","review":"I purchased this book to assist in integrating Linux authentication with Active Directory.

She was an attractive girl, with great value as a dynastic pawn. Bargained off as part of a peace treaty, she was married to Philip II by proxy at the age of 13 and was sent to Spain at 14, barely able to speak Spanish and her husband, preoccupied, cold and nearly twice her age was uncomfortable with speaking French. Her underlying health problems ( nephritis caused by childhood scarlet fever) made the life of constant pregnancies, and given the limited understanding of her inherent weakness, made the life for which she was destined, certain death. She endured constant illness, importuning from her mother by a barrage of letters, and a distant husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Boys in Hawaii","review":"As far as Beach Boys concerts go, this one won't make anyones top ten.

Ray Charles performs a magical rendition of Sail On Sailor, which is why I bought it in the first place based on my memory of years ago. Other \\"guests\\" are hit and miss depending on your taste.

It's only 1.3 inches thick. The USB power supply is also great for small spaces.The photo editing software is also nice. I took a scenic picture from my last trip to Peru and made it into a nice work of \\"art\\" with the oil painting feature in PhotoStudio 2000.This scanner is incredibly easy to install and use.

With the addition of Jeordie White and James Iha, (did not record on the album though) APC has a new, bolder, dynamic sound. Getting right to the point, it's an amazing album. The brightest moments being 'The Outsider', 'Weak and Powerless', 'Pet', and the single cover, 'The Nurse Who Loved Me'. It's different enough from Mer de Noms to make us wonder what the next original album will sound like."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely amazing","review":"The new A Perfect Circle cd is nothing short of amazing. That being said, this album is very different than Mer de Noms. It also takes a few listens to fully appreciate, but after awhile the melodies really get to you. My favorite tracks are: The Package, Blue, Pet, and Vanishing, but pretty much all of these songs are top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful evolution","review":"This album goes way beyond \\"Mer De Noms,\\" which (somewhat justifiably) was touted by Rolling Stone as \\"forest gnome rock.\\"\\"Thirteenth Step,\\" on second and third listen seems way more personal and disciplined. I think we can thank Executive Producer/Singer/Demigod Maynard James Keenan for that. One star off for an all-around lack of hardcore and experimental sounds, which I was really hoping for in this iteration of APC. This time around RS claimed it sounded akin to The Cure's \\"Disintegration\\" album, and once again, they're on the mark, though the comment was expressed as a compliment. It shouldn't be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"What I got was a case that was cracked in more than one place, a burn mark on it and very scuffed up.

You wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Circle","review":"It's not possible to describe in words how incredible this album is. The more you listen to it the more you get from it.

It seduced me the second I heard it, it is so intense and emotional. I didn't think it was possible for it to be better than MDN but this cd is absolutely amazing and and shows how much they've improved musically and lyrically. It's completely and utterly beautiful and kicks serious ass too, it's a brilliant cd, I recommend this cd to anyone and everyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Album","review":"I bought this cd the day it came out and I can't stop listening to it. \\"The Package\\" is an excellent opening song and \\"Gravity\\" is a great closing song.

I definetly recommend you purchasing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit back, relax and chill","review":"I love this CD I consider it one of the best I own.Better than Merde Noms.The reason why is because you can fall into a trance while listening.Great, powerful,and downright chill.Thanks APC for making a record i can relax to.Favorite songs;every song on this great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"enormous disappointment","review":"I really tried to love this album, but for those that were fans of the brilliant layering and depth of their first album, you will most likely be disappointed. I got past the first song, I thought, \\"That was kinda cool I guess, a little minimalistic and 'toolish' for me, but I can't wait to see what's next.\\" After \\"Weak and powerless,\\" the album returned to the slow rhythmic Nu-Metal type sound. Gradually I became more and more irritated as I listened further. It was obvious to me that Maynard had a huge role in the writing process of this album. They sound like a totally different band. When I describe these songs as \\"slow,\\" I am in no way referring to \\"3 librasesque\\" slow songs that the apc fan may be familiar with, but minimalist to the point that the most common sound to emit from your cd player will be silence. The drumming, the little that there was, and of course Maynard's voice are the only saving graces to this otherwise horrible attempt at an artistic vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!!","review":"After every Tool Cd, and APC's 1st, I have come to expect a more impressive effort from Maynard. The songs are all missing a lot of feeling. Over trying to make a classic,maybe. This CD is just plain EMPTY! No powerful words, sounds or vocals. I like 3 songs on this, and none of those compare to anything else MJK has ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have patience!","review":"Gotta say it took a while for me to realise how beautiful this record is. When I bought the cd I had the highest expectations because of their fine debut Mer de Noms. I got kinda half-disapointed as alot of people according to the reviews. But it turned out the songs had such an imense depth that you can't grasp after the first time you hear them. After that it just got better and better. Even the cover, The Nurse Who Loved Me, seemed to contribute to something perfect. The fillers are in one way a disapointment because I was hoping for 12 songs from APC, but in the context they fulfill a purpose.Alot of people will probably disagree with this, but I found the first record uncomplete. The first part of the record has wonderful songs as The Hollow, Orestes and 3 Libras. But the second part just feels like halfmade songs. Don't get me wrong, it's still one of my favourite records, but The 13th Step is something far better. It's perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Tool","review":"A great CD. If you like Tool, than you'll love this CD considering its the same lead singer. Tool's orginal 'poetry' and vibrant sound carry over to the Thirteenth Step and of course A Perfect Circle. Most of the songs are great.Great Songs:The PackageWeak And PowerlessThe NooseVanishingThe OutsiderSongs to Avoid:The Nurse Who Loved MePetLullabyOverall a great CD beside the filler parts of it. If you don't know who Tool is, that I suggest also buying Lateralus - Tool in conjunction with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sophmore Release","review":"So many bands fall into the sophmore slump. However, A Perfect Circle take the \\"curse of the second record\\" and kick it into oblivion!! This album isn't better than Mer De Noms, it's a perfect progression from it. The band seems tighter, some guitar sounds have become signature (listen to the guitar at the beginning of \\"Crimes\\", then listen to \\"Brena\\" from the 1st one), and the vocals are just....listening to Maynard sing is like butter melting on a bagel...so smooth and absorbing...he really is probably the best singer in modern rock. Anyway, pick this album up, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a taste of maynards range","review":"being a fan of tool and perfect circle i always look forward to the newest albums to see where the creativity waters take them. in APCs newest album they leave the melodic catchy tunes from thier debut and lean towards a more ethereal sound. one of which that sounds as if it were infused with enya.the songs are potent, pensive and have an air of regret in maynards voice. it seems as though where as their debut album was more of a commentary and subjective this one is internal and objective. either way if you like music that offers a moments pause to reflect you will treasure this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like beyond perfect, circle","review":"This has got to be one of the most brilliant cd's ever created. The music on this cd will go deep inside your heart and send chills through your body. Songs like the noose and blue will have you listening to them over and over.

GO BUY IT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"the boogeymen have come!","review":"The flow and beauty of this album continues to suckme in with each listen.

Hopefully APC will continue to caliberate andbring us more pleasurable sounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"addicting","review":"I thought it was crap when i first heard it. I had been waiting for 2 years,hungry for new tracks from this band and this is all they could muster. come on they could do better, but what is this I can't take my ears off, no it can't be. this is alcoholica or whatever you want to call it.it's addicting I can't take my ears off it.granted I only listen from tracks 10 through 4 then all the rest is filler and somehow it fits because I would not mind getting to those tracks and surmising every single second of it to enjoy every quarter note it's that addictging. I was expecting better yet it's not better it's worse I can't seem to let go. It's not allowing me to let go It's somehow refusing me to continue to listen to it and the nooze oh boy! It just begs to be listened to time and time again.what else can I say I'm addicted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw Droppingly Amazing!","review":"I really don't know how you can accurately descirbe something so flawless and do it justice at the same time. from start to finish this c.d. does not fail to keep you sucked in and does not let you go until that annoying couple seconds where you actually have to come back from your mind-trip and press play again. The melodies, harmonies created here are quite possibly the best to be put to a record in the last decade. Absolutely amazing! And yes...the vocals, the vocals are sooooo awe-inspiring. Maynard NEVER ceases to amaze me with his amazingly powerful yet, hauntingly beautiful voice. Just when i think he couldn't do any better, he comes along and outdoes his previous performance, be it TooL or APC. This IS the Album of the Year! But, dont take my word for it, find out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this album NOW!!","review":"Rather than attempt to change their sound, A Perfect Circle manages to make \`Thirteenth Step' more of a continuation to their debut album instead of a completely separate entity. However, the underlying concept to the new album as a whole as well as each musician that assisted and contributed in the creation of this album, make each track unique and individual. Maynard's vocal capabilities are much more prominent on the new album especially with the addition of the hauntingly beautiful harmony throughout many of the tracks. \`Thirteenth Step' is a masterpiece in music. A must have for any music fan that enjoys an audibly mental roller coaster. The only downside is that it's only 50 minutes long but that's okay, because b the end of the last song, you'll want to start all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I am excited to see bands cover songs written by Failure. If anyone likes \\"The nurse who loved me\\" check out the original version on Failures Cd titled , \\"fantastic Planet\\" .

Mer De Noms is quite simply a brilliant album.

However, this was mainly because certain of the songs are really awesome, while others are forgettable. The great ones: The Package, Weak and Powerless, Blue, The Outsider, and maybe Pet. Overall, a good album, worth owning, but no legend in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good album.","review":"I don't think it quite stacks up to Mer De Noms, hence 4 instead of 5 stars, but well worth the money.As to the review that stated something like art and politics don't mix....ever hear of a band called Rage Against The Machine? They may not be together any more, but they released some of the best music for that time period that they were together.Anyway, if you liked the last Perfect Circle, try this one out as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"APC Thirteenth Step is a must have.","review":"I saw APC play at the Lollapalooza show (Auburn Wa.

It meets and exceeds my expectations and when I thought they couldn't possibly be any better.....they proved me wrong!!! I LOVE APC!!! :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"The second album from A Perfect Circle begins right where Mer de Noms left off. Although not as musically heavy as the first album, this album is heavy with mood. It's obvious on tracks such as \\"Blue\\" and \\"Vanishing\\" how strong The Cure influenced Billy Howerdel, creator/composer/lead guitarist of the band. The album flows beautifully from track to track, with a great take on \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me,\\" a song by former member Troy van Leeuwen's old band, Failure. After \\"Nurse\\" comes the reason why A Perfect Circle is a band unlike any other. That reason is \\"Pet.\\" Enjoy another album from one of rock's most essential bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and powerless record","review":"I am very dissapointed in this cd. The songs seem repetitive and not as full as Mer De Noms. Mer De Noms just has so much more atmosphere. Maynard tried too hard to come up with deep lyrics but only ends up sounding corny on almost every track. His singing is also pretty weak. \\"Help me if you can...\\" \\"Help me understand...\\" Never heard such deep lyrics in my life. There is no comparison between the lyrics as Mer De Noms which sound totally original while these seem more like they were written to attract whiny goth kids. This cd reminds me of how great of a record Mer De Noms is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply one of the greatest albums of all time","review":"Having been a long time Maynard fan from Tool, I didn't know what to think when I heard he was breaking off from the band to do his own side project. When I heard who would be joining him, including the Smashing Pumpkin's James Iha, I became extremely excited. However, with much excitement usually comes great dissapointment.. usually, but not in this case.Thirteenth Step is quite simply one of the greatest albums of all time period. And I'm not exaggerating. Each song in the album is like a wonderfull psychidellic trip. The music is perfect, the lyrics are hypnotic, and how it all comes together is just unbelievable.Just when I thought rock music was dying with so many flaky, untalented bands filling our air waves, out comes APC to resurrect the genre. I'll be counting down the days to their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cd's EVER","review":"The Thirteenth step is AWSOME!, i got it the second it hit the shelf and listened to it on my way to the doctors, when i got in the office all my nerves were at ease. it was great.With Stong instruments from the start of the first track to the end of the last and lyrics that could touch a dead mans heart Thirteenth Step is a masterpiece more deserving of a frame than a cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"APC Delivers Again","review":"Once again Maynard and APC deliver a jolt of of musical excitement. Even though this albums guitars tend to sound more like Adam Jones from Tool (which doesn't suck because Tool is the best band in the world), i like the direction the band is going. This album is more melodic than the first, and slower perhaps, but still focuses on Maynards singing ability- which is second to none.I especially like \\"The Noose\\". Even though my beliefs are grossly different from the lyrics of this song, I must say that I can look past it. This song is a perfect 10.Buy the album, love the album. Just dont complain to me if your feelings are hurt because this album is not heavy. APC is not TOOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"again, simply amazing","review":"I didn't know what to think of this album at first, but then I listened to the entire album while reading the lyrics, and It simply reaches out, grabs you and then you are off on a mystical journey. This piece of art is beyond words, as is all of Maynards work. This cd talks to you kind of like that voice in your head, not your ego, but that voice of truth, a concious voice, it opens you up to feel vulnerabe, then pulls you in and comforts you. Listening to this CD makes the hair on the back of my neck stand, it is truly an incredible experience every time I listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Noose\\" and \\"Blue\\"","review":"An all around great CD that really highlights Maynard's vocals. This is a CD you will listen to from beginning to end but it also has three, count them, three of my all-time favorite songs \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Noose\\" and \\"Blue\\". Three of the most powerful songs you will ever hear. One of the greatest three song stretches in album history.Honestly the whole CD is amazing and I hate highlighting three songs in particular but they are so good I had to. If you are not inclined to buy the whole CD, but you should, then you definitely have to download \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Noose\\" and \\"Blue\\". Highly recommended for any music fan and I mean any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected at all, it's amazing....","review":"When I heard Weak and Powerless on the radio I was worried it was a new sound and I wasnt so sure this cd would be all that Mer de noms was, and I was right, this is different! and oh so good. Mellow, haunting, these songs are awesome. In my mind the first APC album was mellow and calm so this fits right in with it, but they are nothing alike. Maynard is seriously a musical master most ppl are lucky to get one awesome band, he has 2. This cd is definitly worth a few bucks.... It'll pay for itself with an emotional ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thirteenth Step","review":"A musical genuis' known as A Perfect Circle have created a new masterpiece titled \\"Thirteenth Step\\". Includes James Iha, Maynard James Keenan, John Freese, Billy Howerdl, and James Osbron. It is the cd of the year. The 5 have created the most beautiful musical experience about the human emotion. Five stars and a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good i cried.","review":"i saw a perfect circle live and knew i was in for a ride when i bought the cd. it was just so beautiful. i like to describe it as picturesque and grotesque. the song as so pretty and imaginitive while the lyrics are alittle suspicious. i love the balance of the two extremes. a very beautifully done album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The circle has a strong force of gravity","review":"Sure this cd is a great journey. You all know that. But for those who do not know --- Listen to Gravity and you'll be hooked. This song is worth the price of admission into a room where the song is playing on repeat. I want this song played in my coffin for all eternity. That is all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Circle is back","review":"A perfect circle is back with a whole new twist. If you thought this was going to be anything like Mer De Noms, you are mistaken. This whole cd is much more layered and darker than mer de noms. Its not as heavy though, not saying mer de noms is really all that heavy but this one isnt. Maynards vocals are absolutley angelic, he really is great. The music is very atmospheric, creating a real mood for each song. Buy this cd, its great, go see A Perfect Circle live and support a great band. In times like these where 9/10 of the stuff on radio is crap, atleast there is one band out there that are really creating real music, and that band is A Perfect Circle.Best Songs on this Cd are : Blue, Gravity, Weak and Powerless, and The Noose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"If your review goes something like this: I sick of being promised. Maybe you shouldn't be buying apc. No intelligent human being would give this cd one star. Is it different than a Mer du Noms? Yeah, of course. Those it have that same quality and lyric perfection? Hell yes. So do yourself a favor and buy this cd (dont download it, support good music :D)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic that never stopped.","review":"It's just like I said in the title. This album never quit. It was just one amazing song after another. This album FAR surpasses Mer de Noms. It shows much growth within the music and themselves as artists. It's just such a beautiful put together album. Songs like, \\"The Package\\" and \\"Lullbay\\" are just so majestically made into one amazing track. But you can also see the old roots showing through in the song Pet. Which has to be my favourite track. The album's music point of view is so much more different and just so, perfect(for lack of a better word). I highly recommend this album for anyone who enjoys TALENT within their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"hardly worth the wait..","review":"Considering that Maynard is a musical genius, I expected more from this album than it delivered.A quick review of the tracks will give you the same impression I got - it was produced in a day.The lyrics on this album hardly compare to the masterpiece that was Mer De Noms. Every song seems to be a replica of the last with the exception of \\"Weak and Powerless.\\"\\"Weak and Powerless\\" follows the style of Tool right down to the music video, thus making it hard to believe it comes from A Perfect Circle.The rest of the album is a slow, spiraling circle to doom, definitely not music to drive by.Listen to it only if you have insomnia.Even with this said, it's not a bad album, just poorly produced. I'm sure that if they had given more attention their lyrics and music, it could have been better.Songs worth listening to: Weak and Powerless, The Noose, and Pet."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"i absolutely love this album,its different than the first which i also love .. this group of musicians is amazing.

Some standout tracks from my view would be \\"Blue,\\" \\"The Outsider,\\" \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me,\\" and \\"Pet.\\" Those tracks drew me in immediately, they are just well astounding. Other tracks that I would place a little lower than those four would be \\"The Noose,\\" and the closer \\"Gravity.\\" The twelve tracks together just flow nicely into each other creating an enjoyable listen that is \\"The Thirteenth Step.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's better than the first one","review":"This cd falls in line with the first Perfect Circle cd for me. I have been hoping that Maynard would duplicate the raw energy that quantify the early Tool albums, yet Perfect Circle (and the two recent Tool cd's) are huge departures from the early style. If you are looking for tight, early-Tool type music, this is not going to work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected....","review":"This album is nothing like Mer de Noms. Others may not mind that so much but if you are like me and loved \\"Judith\\" and the other rockers from Mer de Noms, you will more than likely be dissapointed. This album is very slow and somewhat depressing. The vocals of Keenan and Howerdel are nothing compared to those on Mer de Noms. They just seem so boring here.There is no standout on this album. All songs are slow and boring. I have listened to it five times to make sure I do not love it since I loved Mer de Noms and have loved everything by Tool but I still must say that I do not like it at all. I certainly respect the members of A Perfect Circle in their decision to make an album so different from the previous, I just do not like the direction they took.It will probably still be in the rotation for the simple fact that I love Keenan's voice but it will never be played as much as Mer de Noms."},{"rating":"1","title":"understandable","review":"Dont get me wrong i love maynard and what he's doing with TooL but as i listened to the album i could only point out a few songs that caught my attention. im a musician, and i know all the members of the band are very talented but what was produced on this album was not expected, if you're a diehard APC fan or crazy about maynard buy the album, but coming from a song writers point of view they gave it a shot and we can at least give them that. i still belive maynard is still one of the greatest vocalist of all time. i titled this review \\"understandable\\" because it is. maynard is frontman for two unique bands and it is hard enough being an important part of both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"The new APC cd was amazing. The songs were more softer then the previous album and more melodic where as the first was more heavy and full of angst. I thought this cd was well done, and much different from the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"new invention","review":"the band created a new c.d. altogether, and not only created a different sound, but created each new song to affect me in so many ways. you can still hear the melodic tunes of keenan's voice, and you know you are listening to a perfect circle, but it's so unique and different, and the ability to do that in their next c.d. makes them one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"take your thirteenth step","review":"Its a great album as well as the first one as soon as you put in the cd your taken to a new level of mystery and fixed emotions listen to the bazzar lyrics of maynard and the odd timing beats of josh and the rest of the members take action this cd should be in your collection as well as it is in mine"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I feel like every song, without exception, on this album falls short somehow. They are all missing the climax associated with Maynard's previous endeavors (the endings of Orestes or Thomas come to mind, not to mention any of tool's epic opuses).Don't get the wrong imprsesion from my rating, this album isnt THAT bad. I gave 1 star to perhaps better lower the total average rating because I know there are too many people who would give 5 star ratings to anything with Maynard's name on it. This album has potential but nothing stands out.That being said, the most tolerable tracks are: The Noose, Blue, and Pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is in this band!? Tell us Amazon!","review":"Remember when there was CD now? THere you could read all about the band, Like whos in it etc. Now that we have Amazon, there is no such information! Amazon sucks!!!

So, after a great debut album, all i expected from \\"a perfect circle\\" was equal greatness...And they didn't disappoint me...the moment i heard \\"weak and powerless\\" i was hooked, and when it finally came out, (today, it is) i was so happy to have it in my hands, even though i have already heard it on the internet... but it's 100 percent woth it to buy the record... I did....and the art is amazing, as well as the lyrics, the music, maynard's voice... amazing...BUY IT now, or you will burn in hell!! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surpasses Mers de Noms","review":"\\"Mers de Noms\\" was a very good CD. That being said, I will say that \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is even better. Whereas \\"Mers de Noms\\" established the unique sound of the band, \\"Thirteenth Step\\" fortifies it and takes it even a step further. The songs on this CD seem even more mellow than those on their previous release, but at the same time, they are more focused and somewhat darker sounding. Its obvious that, with the addition of Jeordie White, the bass plays a more prominent role in many songs, and while I normally am indifferent to bass, it clearly adds more to the songs on this CD than I thought possible.If you liked \\"Mers de Noms\\" then you will definately like \\"Thirteenth Step\\". Some reviewer called this CD more mature that their 1st effort, which I initially dismissed. However, that description is really right on the mark. One of the year's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect in every way","review":"With \\"Thirteenth Step\\" the guys in APC have managed to surpass all that's ever been created in the realm of progressive metal. The album sends you on a dimly lit journey within yourself, forcing you deeper into your subconscious. Each song aids you along an emotional quest that leaves you needing more.Keep an eye out for their tour this fall. Highest possible recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant sophomore effort","review":"A Perfect Circle delivers the good, as expected, once again. While there style of music may not cater to those who are programmed to generic Rock music, it truly stands out by taking Rock to a higher level. Best alt. Rock album, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Naysayers only criticize this album because they know the unbelievable music Maynard James Keenan and friends have put out and hold them to the highest possible standard. This album is more musical than most anything you'd hear on the radio today. It is vastly different from Mer de Noms, which is another reason people say bad things about it. A lot of people don't like their bands to change. But I love evolution. I think its a truly fantastic album. I've listened to it over and over again and still love it. The emotional intensity of Noose is palpable, and songs like Vanishing and Gravity give me chills every time I hear them, much like Orestes from Mer de Noms. Not many of the songs I would call \\"single\\" material. Most of them are winding journeys of beautiful music but they aren't tight little packages that the radio likes, with the exception of Weak and Powerless and maybe Pet.This album reassures me that A Perfect Circle is second only to Tool in modern artistic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"your halo's slipping down...","review":"This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. It is a little different than A Perfect Circle's first release \\"Mer De Noms\\", but don't let that dissuade you from checking out this Cd. The music on this album is exceptional and Maynard's voice has definitely grown over the years. The best songs on the Cd are \\"The Noose\\", \\"Vanishing\\" (great bass), \\"The Package\\", \\"Pet\\" (nice and heavy, with a good message), and \\"Gravity\\". The songs \\"Blue\\", \\"The Outsider\\", \\"Weak and Powerless\\", and \\"A Stranger\\" are solid tracks, but not quite as good as the others mentioned afore. \\"Crimes\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" are little more than filler, and the song \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\", while still good, just seems a little out of place. Overall, though, this Cd is a keeper, and I recommend it to anyone who likes high-quality music that makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS ALBUM","review":"I'm guessing you all have been waiting for a new cd from APC, me too. Now its in stores and online, so go and buy it. Compared to the last album it is more mellow, but still as good, if not better. So all I have to say to all the die-hard APC fans: If you dont have the album, buy it, you wont regret it; and if you dont have the first, get that too. I'd say you cant have one without the other. Live hard and Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully disturbing","review":"This album is a bit of a contrast on Mer de Noms, but it is a very good thing. The musics' complexity and depth makes this a great album without Maynard. However, with Maynard it is simply amazing. His voice is entrancing and the lyrics are very thought provoking. If you enjoyed Mer de Noms, get this album, you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speachless","review":"This album is fantastic. It's the coolest thing I've ever heared. It takes a bit of getting used to for a novice APC/TOOL fan as I've noticed with all my friends who now each bought a copy after I let them (forced them to) hear it a few times, but I loved it the second I put it into the CD player. It is incredible. The off-beats, Billy's guitar has a voice of it's own. Iggy's bass is awesome, Maynard of course is God, and James Iha is now in 2 of my favorite bands. I highly recommend this album to anybody who has some patience. Some advice, put this album into a CD player, isolate yourself, turn off the lights. That's the only way to hear what this album is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and haunting","review":"A bottle of red from Maynard's wine cellar, some fromage and\\"the noose\\" either a great way to die or just a way to complete \\"a perfect cirle.\\" Far from understanding the \\"art\\" but on my way. Highly recommend this CD and really hope that many saw the concert. Lingering \\"your halo's slipping down\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Step","review":"Perfect Circle is the side projcet of Maynard, the lead singer from the rock band Tool. This is his seccond album with Perfect Circle, and beleive me it does not dissapoint. From the opening cords and expiremental use of his vocal range on The Package to the closing bars of Gravity, the band takes you on an exciting musical journey. The vocal and musical accompaniment are masterfuly mixed. Give this album a listen; you won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A much anticipated and cd","review":"A perfect Circle is one of the best bands ever and this cd is an awesome follow up to Mer De Noms far better than the first cd. Lots of love too the band and Maynard. Can't wait to see the concert!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so perfect circle","review":"This CD is sort of boring. I was expecting a lot more from such a talented group of musicians. This album lacks the passion, energy and drive of the first One. I suppose if you're looking for a good CD to fall asleep to, buy it, but if you like your albums to rockout a little, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took Maynards word and fell back asleep","review":"This is one of the most dissapointing albums i have ever bought, and it scares me to say this about Maynard James Keenan's band. I never cared much for Mer de Noms though it was decent, but this is a sheer disappointment. I do not enjoy the popularity of this album because that may draw attention to Tool and hurt their music as it did this. This album is WEAK & POWERLESS. I swaer I had to turn my stereo to the highest level of volume to hear this. Good songs are: ,end of #1, #2, can't think of much else. And to RIAA, like to let you know I sold this Cd & burnt it. Yeah, I made a copy of this & it works. I would tell you how to do it but it is insignificant to this review. I recommend you BURN this CD and don't buy it, for you will be in total disgust of your waste of well earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maynard's talent more evident as the sound matures","review":"Maynard had a lot more influence on this album over their previous release (most of the songs were written before he joined the band). For a huge Tool fan such as myself this is a great thing. The energy swings around, building to crescendos and coming down with a crash in classic Tool style, while maintaining A Perfect Circle's unique and more subdued sound. There is greater variance between songs and more creative orchestration.For me the real magic of this album begins at track 9 with 'The Nurse That Loved Me' and 'Pet'. It will be interesting to see how that evolves with more listening.Although I will keep my preference for Tool, this album makes a good alternative when I need something less offensive (i.e. parents around for dinner!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maynard is still god","review":"More of a relaxing album than anything. Something you smoke some greens to and just sit back and relax to maynards voice and billy's ambient guitars and the winding drums with the bass to make the band a complete sound. I still think tool is a way more talented band than APC but anything maynard is involved in is great and therefore this cd is up there. But all in all if u want a complete calm album this is it. I listen to heavier rock usually but i can simmer down for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step Above Mer de Noms","review":"A Perfect Circle's second album is definitely worth your time. It's well composed and performed, and takes you through a journey with waves of hard and soft music.\\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is a great cover, but other harder songs like \\"Pet\\" and \\"Package\\" will make you want to hit repeat even before you realize you're doing it. In general, the album is a bit mellower than Mer de Noms, but it's still a nice compliment to the previous album. It's not the same old material, but it's still A Perfect Circle.Take the time to buy this cd - it's well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres the brilliance we keep hearing about?","review":"ANTICLIMATIC is the word..this album takes you on a ride to nowhere... where is this brilliance i keep hearing about? i dont see it on this album, albiet the drummer is excellent however.Im sick of hearing 'you gotta look behind the music' and all things similar.. i know music and this CD is plain boring.. its like they took too much acid and forgot to play songs that go anywhere... im sick of hearing about the genius of perfect circle.. how about listening to opeth's 'damnation' thats brilliance showing that in fact, 7-8 minute song CAN go places... --i wish tool would make a revival... maynard seemed to suite it to a tee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, Anathema is better and original","review":"This is pretty nice laid back, enchanted music. I like all the songs but still enjoyed the music of tool better. Though I was always trying to find a more laid back version of tool with a darker, more melancholy mood. To me a very unknown english band more than fills in that void, a band called Anathena. I so happened to come by the album by a refrence from 10 years review. I cannot believe the album isn't very popular in the states, it amazing, layred, melody's flow from it and you become obsorbed in the etheral state it puts you in. If you like this 13th step, check out Anathemas judgement, or any other album, it smokes maynards side project, but is right up there with tool, just more laid back."},{"rating":"2","title":"APC ORGASMIC","review":"THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE HEARD YET.

Great album, lryics are deep, thought provoking, inspiring. Music sounds good, sounds alot like Tool.

After listining to a lot of clips and songs from it, I decided to get it. Here's what I think:The forst song, The Package, really grows on you. It's the best description of an addiction I've ever seen. Maynard actually SOUNDS like he can't control himself and that he NEEDS this thing to survive. The slow buildup puts this into effect, too.The Outsider, I think, is genious. I agree with MOST of the lyrics in the song and I enjoy the \\"in your face\\" style in which it's sung.Other standout tracks are: Weak and Powerless, Blue, A Stranger, and Pet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Circle at it's best!","review":"Just when I rhought they couldn't get better, they did... I can say that I've never been wowed by any other band as much as I've been wowed by them APC. This album is pretty melow with one song that has a harder beat and feeling but still realy awsome! I just like the way the album flows... it seems like all the songs tie into one another! It really isn't describable... you'd have to buy it to feel the depth of this album, you really can't take my words for it... just go before it's too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw them live, WOW","review":"I love the CD, but for some reason the live versions of the 13th Step songs have a different character live, it's almost like the songs truly come alive out on the road.

If you have any questions about the APC live experience or this CD, feel free to email me at dbermudez@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best... a perfect circle... ever","review":"Wow, where to start? This is a very good cd. It's definitely a cd everybody can enjoy, it's very mellow. Maynard's smooth vocals really flow well with everything else. I have been listening to his music since Opiate, and this is one of his best works. I would REALLY recomend this for someone who either likes Tool, Pigmy Love Circus, Smashing Pumpkins, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Nine Inch Nails, or old Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's one of my favorite cds and it hasn't left the stereo since i put it in. Buy it. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Puzzling Thirteenth Step","review":"This album puzzles me from start to finish. The opening track \\"The Package\\" is a good one but doesn't seem to be right track for the opener to the album. Perhaps the 10th track \\"Pet\\" which is the most powerful track on the album belongs in it's place.\\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" seems completely out of place on this album and is simply annoying, and while the closer \\"Gravity\\" is great song, it belongs more towards the middle of the album.\\"Thirteenth Step\\" is an album that is a bit unaccessible and as a result requires two or three spins, and while it at times is heavier than its predecessor \\"Mer De Noms\\" fillers like \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\", and \\"The Noose\\" bring it down a bit. Nonetheless, this album is still worth purchasing if you like a perfect circle...

The entire album is very repetitive and lacks any emotion or musical qualities that the first album offered. I can't believe the same musicians made this????Yes, it's soft. I have no issues with that. But all the songs lack any qualities that grab your attention. It's like they were zombies while making the music. Going through motions. The woman from the first album isn't in the band any longer. Maybe she had artistic input that is sorely lacking now? Either way, this is awful.

For the money I paid, I expected there to be at least 1 or 2 tracks that I would find to be really cool but obviously these songs were written with the absolute purists in mind (those who think ANYTHING Maynard does is great). I'm not impressed by this latest offering and I have been a huge tool and perfect circle fan for a long time now. I guess I'll go back to \\"stealing\\" the music on the download sites first before wasting anymore of my money.

THey also have a new line up with Twiggy Ramirez formerly from manson, who replaced PAz Lenchantin. Troy van Leeuwen also left the group and was replaced with James Iha (smashing Pumpkins) THis cd isn't as hard as Mer de noms, but is definitely more soulful.

It will definitely get you thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, on par with last one","review":"So far, although i cant say that the entire cd has \\"sunk\\" in yet. I've found that this cd is about what i would expect from a great band such as A Perfect Circle, and from a great vocalist such as Maynard James Keenan.Maynard's voice of course is spectacular, an the rythems are dramatic an very beautiful. Its definitly as good as the last one, possibly better(once i get a real chance to look at all the lyrics). Overall, i would say this CD wont disapoint any Perfect Circle fans, or Tool fans for that matter :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrills and Chills Galore!","review":"You don't have to be young and angst-full to love A Perfect Circle. I'm 33 with three kids and the melodies they weave, the haunting richness, Maynard's soaring, suspenseful, perfect vocals-it pulls and tugs at you in ways you don't expect. This album came out on my birthday which let me know it was a gift that would give me another enduring source of musical release and comfort. The first APC album I bought for my boyfriend, but it never left my possesion after I heard it. (Have you ever heard the word 'temporarily' so beautiful as Maynard can make it?) Sometimes a glimpse of the dark side can also let you know how much light has come in since then...This album will grow on you as soon as you sit down to really listen to it-how the music is not just a background to the lyrics, but how the synergize into a whole, complimenting the tension, anger, confusion of the the emotions behind the words. This is a rare talent and not to be missed.

It's very different from anything I've heard before, but it still captures me. Weak and Powerless is the first single, and is the most mainstream sound on the disc. The Noose is probably the best, and I love Vanish.If you have the first CD, or are a Maynard fan, know this - nothing on this disc is in the vein of Judith or Tool as far as harshness, it is all a focus on the beauty of music, much like \\"3 Libras.\\"Overall, a solid piece of work, peaceful, deep, serene, and powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Yeah!","review":"A Perfect Cirlce, not visible that much on the radio, but fully visible in the rock/goth world. I'm not joking this record is awsome, but don't just take my word on it. Go and listen to it buy it, I know you will any way. A Perfect is one of my personal favorite bands. Just check it out, and if u don't like it. Who cares! At least you gave the band some recognition.don't forget to rate it! Keep shopping at amazon.com where I get all of my CD's!!Signed, Satisfied customer, Joshua Pujol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic and Entrancing","review":"I was told not to have my expectations up about the new APC album Thirteenth Step.

IT is an amazing album. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Different... But Still Awesome!","review":"I just have to say first, that Mer de Noms was one of my favorite albums, and it still gets regular play in my stereo. Thirteenth Step is a definite evolution from Mer de Noms. I hadn't heard Weak and Powerless before purchasing this cd, and when I played it for the first time, it literally took my breath away. Every track has something to offer. If you're a fan of Tool, APC, or Maynard... BUY THIS CD! You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thirteenth Step is an improvement on perfection","review":"A Perfect Circle's first album was a musical masterpiece which stood out among rock albums of it's time with riffs and lyrics spanning music of all ages. Thirteenth Step took this element, added a darkness to the amazing guitar parts and Keenan's incredible talent for writing songs to make what I personally feel is THE BEST album I have listened to in my life. Definately worth the price, plus some."},{"rating":"2","title":"No shallow rock here","review":"This album is equal if not better than the freshman album Mer de Noms. It seems like they are constantly wanting to take their talent and music deeper. The lyrics and music are not shallow like most of rock today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"This is an absolutely amazing album. If you liked the first APC album you can't go wrong with this one. There are a couple metaphorical themes going on, from The Noose which continues on with Blue and then Vanishing/A Stranger/The Outsider. The transition between Pet and Lullaby has to be heard to be believed. Pet is metaphorical of the madness of terrorism and the mess in Iraq. Maynard really brings the album to life like he does with all his work. That is not to say that the other members deserve just as much credit... you _must_ listen to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"fails to grab my attention","review":"This cd lacks anything outstanding.

After hearding it for the first time I didn't have a clue if I will like it or not. Fortunantly \\"Thirteenth Step\\" did grow on me I have started to like it quite a lot, but I think it can be a quite a shock for some people, at least in the beginning. (tip: listen it with headphones for few times) The sound is slightly different (extremely dynamic), tempo overall is slower and there isn't that many \\"hit\\" songs. I have now listened the album about 4 days and it has grown from 3 stars to 5. I don't think it is an album for everyone (I, personally am a huge Tool and APC fan), but it shouldn't be judged before you have really listened to for quite a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy.","review":"I have to start off by saying that I loved Mers de Noms. I thought it was brilliant. That is why I had such high expectations for Thirteenth Step. Each song is quite good, but when you put them all together on a cd the overall tone of the songs make the cd seem slow, and dare I say it? Boring. Like I said, each song is good, but overall it's not too exciting. I still love A Perfect Circle though, and hopefully they come out with a dvd soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow..","review":"...

I thought that Maynard and his \\"Perfct Circle\\" would turn out to be a one-album-wonder sideproject but WOW! Their sound has evolved dramatically since their previous album... they don't sound too much like Tool on this one and their songcraft is simply brilliant. Maynards vocals are just as great as they've always been and the guitarist is incredible.

I love the scitzophrenic moods offered in the album; one second your on the verge of tears with Maynards voice, and the next second you feel like blowing something away with Josh's heavy and timely beats. Billy and Maynard did a wonderful job on composition and lyrical structer. My only question is, whats next?"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...","review":"I must admit I was not a big fan of Mer de Noms but my friend let me listen to a few songs off of this album and immediately I decided to go out and buy the album. All of the songs on this cd are great. At first, many people may turned off by the song \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" and I didn't really like it at first either, but the more I listened the more I liked it.

What a Baroque jewel to add to your collection !Wonderful and delicate attention to this production produces a musical work of art by all involved. The violin is perfect and heartfelt with earnest sincerity ! Scintilating, sprightly, and effervescent is this cd !Locatelli was a great composer with few works compared to many others. He was born in Bergamo, Italy. A child prodigy on the violin, he was sent to study in Rome under the direction of Arcangelo Corelli. Locatelli also wrote violin sonatas, a cello sonata, trio sonatas, concerti grossi and a set of flute sonatas (his opus 2). His early works show the influence of Arcangelo Corelli, while later pieces are closer to Antonio Vivaldi in style.Good Day Friends !"},{"rating":"2","title":"American non-spanish speakers review","review":"This album is Pablo Montero's best! I have his other 2 CD's and I do not even speak Spanish! I am American and I found out about Pablo because my husband is from Mexico and watches the Spanish TV. The music on this CD is the best, especially the title song! I love Pablo's voice, it is the voice of the Angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a good CD !","review":"I have a video tape of Pablo singing in a show from '99, and it's lovely to watch, as he's a fine looking man, and a marvelous performer, but it falls short vocally. Well, he's come a long way since then, and though there are moments where his voice sounds a little strained, he's become a singer.The first track is a beautiful vals by Manuel Monterrosas, \\"Quando no me Quieras\\", which sets the pace for this well produced and arranged collection of ranchera songs. Other excellent tracks are \\"El Amor de Mis Amores\\" where he does some traditional falsetto singing, and a great bolero by Kike Santander, \\"Corazón a Corazón\\".The booklet contains easy to read lyrics, and five photos the ladies will love. I'm giving this CD 5 stars for being so surprisingly tasteful and enjoyable, and also for the incredible improvement this young man has achieved...I'm sure there will be a lot more good music coming from him in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice","review":"Pablo Montero has an incredible voice. I especially enjoy his slower, more romantic songs. It is not necessary to understand Spanish to enjoy the quality of Pablo's voice, although the lyrics are excellent, also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very pleased","review":"I purchased this CD along with \\"Sirens of Song\\".

It fits extremely tight and is very uncomfortable. I returned them immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunkings  - Soul Sleeping","review":"The Sunkings dropped SOUL SLEEPING as trance was steadily becoming the genre du jour of techno. Blue Room, in particular, was a label well-known for trance, and the traces of this are immediately evident in the drone and beats of \\"Tongues of Fungus,\\" but with the sonically dense, atmospheric \\"Flesh Canvas,\\" there's nary a cheesy trance riff to be found. This wears off quickly, however, as \\"Isle of the Departed\\" wanders a bit too much with its prog-rock guitar and sub-Lisa Gerrard vocal (\\"Eden Reprised\\" loses the guitar, but retains the vocals, unfortunately). \\"Tang\\" delivers prototypical psy-trance, and the other tracks seem to meld together in a indistinguishable drone. The breaks on \\"Talisman\\" break things up, but it's a little too late. Might be better to sleep on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tales","review":"Having basic knowledge of Norse mythology, I found this book to be an abysmal excercise in disinformation. Not only it provides an overly simplified view of a very complex religion, it also censores many myths, not providing the full picture of characteristics of the gods.

Better is available for free here","review":"Fairly well written, but I didn't even have to read all the way through to find this to be inaccurate. If you want something factual, there are many other accounts of actual historical events and many legitimate sagas. This also goes for mythology. This is NOT the only book - and by far not the best - that talks about Norse history/mythology.Anyone interested can find free Kindle editions of \\"Children Of Odin\\" and the Volsunga Saga. I am yet to find anything free on Harald Fair-Hair unfortunately, for this is one of my favorite sagas that should be included in the Heimskringla.If you care to do some translating yourself, the Fagrskinna and Flateyjarbok (I am too lazy to find the accent marks in the actual titles). Look some of these up. They're all in a very simple style and very easy to understand.Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I have enjoyed this book thus far.

One can only hope however, that he would develop a more forward looking perspective that embraced contemporary flute music and extended techniques. It would be wonderful if he could spend some time with Pierre-Yves Artaud in Paris or perhaps Anne LaBerge in Amsterdam to study what has happened to flute technique in the last 100 years or so!

Pleasant and easy to read","review":"This testing book is NOT just about targeting boundary conditions, although I can see how people with no insight can perceive it as such... Testing is about knowing the environment; knowing the system. This book as opposed to most of the software testing books out there, focuses on this model.Usually to achieve this goal, a writer would need over 500 pages, yet Whittaker does it in 200 and most important in a fast and hands-on fashion.This book is a perfect introduction to any software tester. Its a jump start to better code coverage. Whittaker doesn't go deep into subjects; he just gives you enough info so that you can go and explore by yourself.I've successfully applied these techniques for both Windows and Unix systems.

His next one, Paradise Alley, may have been even better. No one writes about New York City as well as Baker does -- no novelist, no historian, no one. This new book is a novel about Harlem in the era of jazz greats and secret cults, the era of war and hope. I think it's his most ambitious work yet -- it tells the sotry of young Malcolm X, in the days before he was famous, and -- better than anything I know of about the man -- it gets at the heart of a great American engima. There are other great characters, too --- The Reverend Jonah Dove, who may be a real life figure, as well (I don't know) -- but the story itself is so riveting, I was totally into the book from page one.Anyway, I really recomend it. The dude can write."},{"rating":"2","title":"White on Black","review":"Very few white American writers can deal with the black experience in America without being patronizing, mawkish or subtly racist. This writer does Malcolm X with sympathy, empathy, admiration and originality.

Other great characters are Elijah Muhammed and a light skinned preacher of a black church who finds his privileged bourgeois upbringing a real handicap.

So before you buy or upgrade, download the trial and check for yourself, if Money 2006 is for you.BTW if you upgrade from a previous version, keep a backup-copy of your old file, because once you convert your file to Money 2006, an older version of Money won't be able to read it. For the same reason, consider parallel installations (and double data-maintenance) of the Money 2006 trial and your older version for a while, until you've determined to upgrade to M2006 or ditch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not believe MS Money 2006","review":"Reviewed all other reviews re MS money but since I'm Microsoft certified for 8 years and live with their software daily etc... have ignored bad reviews.

I also like that the home page can be customized to show different views of your accounts - very nice.My only complaint and, ultimately the reason that I won't use the software, is that it wants to connect to the Internet every time I open it. You are able to turn off the preference to connect to the Internet but the program still requires you to enter your .NET username and password when you begin. I also had to select \\"Work offline\\" each time you opened the program and I became uncomfortable that I would forget one day.I used the product for a week and decided that the risk was too high that I might forget to keep the program offline and have my banking information uploaded to a \\"secure\\" Microsoft site."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad license","review":"Did these other users not get the same license agreement I got? How could anyone not mind?The license agreement gives MS an open-ended legal right to make unnamed/unspecified alterations to your software/computer WITHOUT NOTIFICATION.In other words, by clicking \\"I Agree\\", the end user is agreeing to allow Microsoft to come in and make whatever changes it sees fit - the language specifically refused to limit what MS could and could not do - and you will not be notified when alterations are made to your computer, your software, etc.What sort of crazy person is okay with a deal like this?

It was very hard to get a straight answer from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree - try BEFORE you buy","review":"I downloaded the trial version of this product to try it out. First off my early entries of bills for the current month duplicated themselves. Then when I tried an update from the web for my credit cards they were consistently mismatched, even though the 2005 version I have kept running matched correctly.The 2005 version still has many problems even after the fixes and 2006 seems to build on the problems. Unfortunately it was too late last year to go back while I was working with technical support for weeks. If you can, stay with editions prior to 2005. They worked well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Solid Product","review":"I liked the product a lot, it is a major improvement from the 2000 version I had previously. The online service is very nice.

Don't buy this.","review":"I had Money 2004, and loved its \\"Money Express\\" feature.

Very handy for letting you know when bills were coming due.I upgraded to Money 2006 Deluxe recently, and found out that Microsoft did away with this feature.

Both times ended in frustration and my reinstallation of Money 2004. The interface isn't nearly as intuitive as 2004. When I set up my mortgage, the ammoratization schedule was completely wrong. The catagories are not nearly as nice or extensive as 2004. I really tried to like Money 2006, but between the bugs and the frustration it is a step backwards from Money 2004. I strongly reccomend trying before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems updating investment prices","review":"Microsoft has been experiencing problems updating the prices of most non-US Funds, and these have not been resolved despite lengthy discussions on microsoft newsgroups. At the time of writing, pretty much all non-US Funds are not being recognised by Microsoft Money and are therefore being ascribed a nil value in portfolios. This leads to very misleading results and makes the product of very limited use if you wanted to use it to track your investments and you would do better to look for a different product than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Money ever","review":"I've used MS Money for five years now, and have faithfully upgraded each year--only because of the great deal I've gotten each year with the purchase of tax software. I expect that with each upgrade there will be some minor transition issues as the updated software interfaces with my on-line banks. However, this upgrade is by far the worst ever. Last weekend I spent an hour redoing about 3 months worth of bank statements, as Money would import the same transactions three or four times each time it connected to the bank. Thinking I had finally gotten everything correctly synched, I closed and restarted, only to find that the same problem has occurred yet again.In short, DO NOT UPGRADE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some features expire in 2 years","review":"Decent interface, nice product overall, if you can stand the in your face advertising they have in the program for 3rd party advertisers. I can't believe I PAID to see spam. The downloads from credit cards are nice, but Microsoft announced that the downloads expire after 2 years. This has been happening since Money 2003. Money 2002 is the only one that doesn't have the credit card / bank statement downloads expire after 2 years. Google Money 2006 (in groups) to get other opinions.Oh, and if you're on the paranoid side, don't use passport. A friend was on tech support at MS and they had him turn on passport and they were able to see all of his account information over the net. I don't know how that works but its a little scary if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice software could be more","review":"I recently upgraded from Money 2003. I was pleasantly suprised with the ability of downloading transactions for all credit card , bank and investment accounts. So all you have to do is check the info downloaded daily weekly whenever you want. Had a little trouble with one investment account but overall was easy to setup. This is real nice for those of us who are not very fast on the keyboard.Was hoping to get a product to help with retirement planning but after reviewing found it to be real weak in this area."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backward","review":"Don't buy this one. It is time to change to Quicken. I have been using Money for almost 5 years now and I am feed up with it. This version fixes nothing, enchances nothing, added more web pages which I don't care about, and expires the download capability in 2 years. When I installed the software half of my existing online setups were broken and I had to resolve the problem myself. (Useless Microsoft support)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many features lost from Money standard earlier versions","review":"I recently tried to project what would happen to my mortgage if I added some to the principal each month - a thing that was easy to do in the last version of Money I had. In this version, the only way to do it is to add your mortgage to your debt reduction planner. After doing that, I adding an amount to the monthly mortgage to see how much it would be shortened - the answer came back that the mortgage would be paid off next month, no matter the amount I entered. I'm so disppointed in this version that I will now have to look into Quicken to see if they have the features I used to have. If nothing else, I'll go back to the prior version if I can.

There is some \\"bleeding\\" of colors when scanning an image with high contrasts. For example a picture of a red rose with a lush green foliage background. Your image might turn out with a red rose with a hint of green or green foliage with a hint of red.I do admit for (the price) you can't ask for anything more.

I love the set up of the hole tower and air flow is amazing, a little tricky to hid eye wires but after your done it is so AWESOME LOOKING in any room you park it. I was disapointed it didn't come as shown with the little 7 inch monitour i think that is a great ripp off to show one thing and get another. So maybe you should change the pic to what it really looks like cause i didn't see any where were it didn't come with it. Yeah i was saddened by that. But other than that low underhanded selling tatic the case is awesome! Not a newb case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the adventure begin","review":"I'm not usually a science fiction fan, and the 500 page book seemed daunting. But a friend raved about the novel, so I decided to give it a try.It didn't take long for Ekeke to win me over. There are some solid characters here, that though alien, seem familiar and complex enough to pull you into the story, no matter what solar system it takes place in.No matter what you think of the science fiction genre, pick up this book because there are some people worth meeting in these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plano - very nice!","review":"great box for most musky lures.

They are durable, pretty lightweight, and last a good long time. i personally think they are a little pricy,i mean basically your paying 75-100$ for a molded piece of plastic,that probably costs like 8$ to make, kinda seems like a rip off, that's why i only gave it 4 stars,but overall i think they work perfectly for my use!Mike Farmer"},{"rating":"2","title":"barbie cali girl horses.","review":"my daughter alison has had lots of fun with this toy.she says that it is really neat and that other girls will also have lots of fun with one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This album is incredible.

It is one of the best for individual bible study. However, the heart of the survey are his charts. They cannot be read in the ebook and there is no way to enlarge them.

Part of the recipe is missing. When do you add the eggs, vanilla and sugar listed in the ingredients?I am surprised that someone didn't notice this since the first printing which appears to have been in 2002, but perhaps the error did not appear in those issues.I just bought this book and it makes me hesitant to try the recipes -- just wondering if there are other mistakes (this one was obvious).Note also -- there are only 117 pages in this book with 77 recipes listed (77 recipes if you include the recipe for the double chocolate brownies on page 17 which isn't complete).

He really liked it (color, light weight, comfort, etc). He is a bigger guy and always felt unsafe using the bag lawn chairs. From all the reviews I felt this would be a great buy and I was not disappointed. As stated it is light weight for carrying, but strong and comfortable. The only thing I might suggest for improvement is a strap for carrying...but that is pretty minor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spacers Breaking -- Poor Warranty","review":"I was given two of these chairs for a Xmas gift. The white spacers that are part of the frame/supports are cracking and falling out. I called Alps and they offered to replace the chairs if I paid for shipping both ways -- probably $50 in cost. Alps said that the broken spacers don't affect the chair and that this was a known problem with some of these chairs. But I don't know how the spacers falling out can't affect the operation and safety of the chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"seat cover","review":"when reviewing the item online, it stated there was one cover in the package - there is actually two. I purchased 2 packages thinking I would get 2 seat covers. Instead each package contains 2 seat covers, now I have 4 and only needed 2. The edge color appeared to be alot less brown. The actual color of the edge is brown not tan. The type of fabric should also be stated. I was expecting microfiber as the photo appeared to be but it was not. It was more of a heavy linen type fabric with a diagonal pattern on it that did not show in the picture online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braxton Seat Cover","review":"Great looking seat covers in my opinion but they don't last! I installed them to protect the leather seats on one my cars (which is not a daily driver) and the driver's side seat cover had a run in the fabric after only four drives!

Definitely a good purchase, though, if you are looking for an introduction to the vital and amazingly varied sounds of North Africa. A little less emphasis on those artists who are more accessible to western ears, on account of the incorporation of western musical styles and rhythms into their own music, may have made this compilation a bit more desirable; nevertheless, it is enjoyable for what it is, and definitely leaves you with wanting to hear what more North African music has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GUIDE !","review":"What a mess this guide is! Text is muddy and on newsprint style paper. Where previous guides had Color Maps, all these are poor black & white copies. Maps of old regions are one-sixth page and totally useless.

The author does not write from his own personal prejudices; he writes with an open mind and a balanced analysis of the opposite results that can be produced from portrayals of violence in different contexts.The book outlines practical helps for establishing sensible boundaries that reflect your personal world view. The author gives a critical analysis of current films and proves conclusively that film portrayals of violence can be either destructive or redemptive. In other words, all violence in films is not necessarily harmful. The strength of the book is that it will never be outdated; the principles can be applied to every future film. I highly recommend this book for everyone who watches movies on film or TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood Worldviews","review":"Hollywood Worldviews is a very thoughtful, intelligent and challenging approach to film criticism and film understanding for all those interested in engaging the Arts and Pop Culture through a Bliblical Worldview.I found myself thoroughly engaged and interested in everything he had to say. The author's comprehensive use of examples, His emphasis on \\"storytelling\\" and the ideas of \\"redemption\\" as a key component to every film is a must read.If you are as much a lover of film as I am, you will want to pick this up and begin using this book as great source of reference from general conversations to more academic points of discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opening read.","review":"I'm a great fan of movies and for years have been watching them with my brain turned off. Brian's book has helped me to look for and discover the director's world view and how Hollywood uses film as a vehicle to promote a post modern world view. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's a movie fan but doesn't want to be just a passive consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"confessions of internet junkie","review":"I love this book and I am still reading it. I have learned alot from it. The only problem is I am very new to conputers and ebay so a lot of the terms I did not undestand.

The cd was great I now can put up a great html auction and when I emailed the author he was kind enough to reply . I am not sorry i bought this book and will refer to it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed resource for spiritual warfare","review":"This book deals with spiritual warfare in a biblical way.

I didn't grow attached to the characters, and the technology they used wasn't presented in a credible way; this was a major problem considering the nature of military techno thrillers. The author had some interesting ideas, but the novel written around them felt too forced."},{"rating":"2","title":"stealth war","review":"I am a 12 years old reader who before this book has never read anything more than 180 pages but I semmed not to be able to put this book down. I highly recomend this book although it slows down a bit during the middle. Anyway it is about a senator gets poisoned and the only person who was investigating the case is thought to commits suicide then a group of millitary elite decides to investigate. I highly recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTE GREAT READING","review":"John L. Plaster hits it perfect. This book and his other books are the very best reading about the Vietnam war. When I read this book I was there, I was in Vietnam with the SOG teams. These men of SOG were the amongst the bravest and greatest soldiers ever to go to war. This is a very tough book to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no idea","review":"I am not old enough to remember the tail end of Vietnam. Most of what I know came from history class or the movies. But this book allowed me to read about a part of the Vietnam war, I did not know existed. In fact, I believe a lot of people had no idea what was taking place in Cambodia and in Laos during this time period. Special forces, secret missions, thousands of North Vietnamese in \\"de-militarized\\" areas and only the Green Berets to keep them in check. Experience the first hand accounts of american special forces units as they are dropped deep behind enemy territory only to be hunted and attacked by forces who outnumber them significantly. Overall, the book is extemly interesting and a different kind of read. Real soldiers in real situtations, where any mistep means death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I read as much as I can about Vietnam, SF and SOG. Plaster tells a great story in vivid detail. In reading this book I came across certain engages that I have read about in other books and the details match which gives credence to his telling of accounts. I just received his first book \\"SOG: The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in Vietnam\\" and am looking forward to reading it. I'm glad I found John through my email with AM on-line."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOG","review":"This is a great book. it gets very specific in what went on deep behing enemy lines. he also talked about the social lives of the soldiers. the details of the mission planing and the roles of the soldiers in the field to me was interesting. John Plaster didnt write this book to glorify himself he simply informs the reader about what went on during his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"88 Reasons, 23 years later","review":"I came to the page while researching a blog post (southernmanblog.com) on the May 21, 2011 rapture. When \\"88 Reasons\\" came out I was a first-year professor at a small, fundamentalist, profoundly conservative, Bible-thumping college. Not one professor or administrator there believed a word of this book, and the main effect was that we were all called into a meeting and given pointers by one of the psychology profs on how to effectively work with concerned students and parents. And one of the physics profs teamed with a religion prof and did a panel discussion in which they fairly convincingly dismantled most of the author's arguments from both scientific and Biblical views. Good times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"I found this book in a Salvation Army hostel in 2005 or so, where I used to work, believe it or not just by chance. I thought it was so interesting that I took it home and began reading it. It was laughable for the most part, to see how he was tying up all the various prophetic interpretations of that time into one cohesive explanation of why Christ's return was just around the corner. Of course, know there are new interpretations of those prophecies and they are all tied up with Islam now rather than Communism.I believe His return is imminent, but to try to set a date, even a year is ridiculous. If I remember his argument he said that Jesus said no one knew the day or the hour, but he didn't say we wouldn't know the year!Anyway, I don't know what I did with the book since. Seeing how much it's going for I wish I had kept it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good study in the fundy mindset","review":"I was one of the (idiots) that bought into this back in 1988. At the moment, there is one seller for $50.00. I'd kinda like to have it for posterity, though, I might want to find it for cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, quick, clear","review":"I am what could be defined as a PKD scholar, and I think this small book is very useful as a reference. While writing my articles and essays I often use it. And I recommend it to those who have just read 1-2 novels by Phil Dick and wish to know more, and would like some advice about what should be read next by the same author. Andy's reviews are fair and the plot summaries won't spoil your reading. And there is a wealth of useful info to boot. Very high price/quality ration, in my humble opinion. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Stingray Bike","review":"This is a great bike for getting around town! And for my son to get to work. We love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great idea!","review":"I was looking for a bike with some sort of help when climbing hills and imagine my delight on finding this Schwinn electric bike posted on Amazon. I read the reviews which seemed excellent but nothing prepared me when I received the shipment that this bike was strictly a young boy's bike - I should have known that 20\\" wheels were not for my size but it sounded such a great deal, if I had been a midget it would have been!! Also, who would ever think of giving a young kid an electric bike. The worse thing is that it would cost me as much to ship it back to the makers for what I paid for it so I am stuck with it. I told the manufacturers they should make an adult version which I think would sell like hot cakes in this gas guzzling society.ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good motorbike if it works!","review":"Cons:Very Heavy (100 lbs),feels like a small motorcycle, so return shipping would be really troublesome!In storage for long time, so batteries might arrive deadNO SPARE PARTS availablePros:Looks goodFast shippingAlso, this is not a bicycle as some have suggested. If the electric power doesn't work, you can't paddle it for long. Be aware!I ordered the bicycle after reading the reviews here. Bike arrived on time but assembly was problematic unlike some have said. It took a long time to assemble as there were no instructions in the attached booklet. Finally got everything together, charged it overnight and in the morning...NOTHING. Battries arrived dead on mine and then they didn't have spare batteries!!!Had to call up everyday for about a month to even get a free return shipping. Then had real bad time packing it back for return. All in all, a hassle not worth it. Buy a normal bicycle and you would be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book never showed up and I haven't been reimbursed!","review":"I ordered the book around Nov. 29. It never showed up. I received two apologetic letters but have yet to be reimbursed. I'm furious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Married to a Bedouin","review":"I love reading books about people living in other countries. This was a good read and I enjoyed hearing about the life she led and shared with a \\"true\\" bedouin. How she adapted to this life is amazing with none of the conveniences she was used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring and no passion or emotion!","review":"I am still trying to trudge through this book. It makes an interesting title as this woman definitely chose an alternate lifestyle. However, the book is full of dull minutiae that is just not interesting. She writes with virtually no passion or emotion so it has been very difficult for me to pick the book up and read it for any length of time. Not sure I'll be able to finish it. So painful just to try to get through a few pages at a time. I have read many books about the Middle East and real life accounts of people experiencing the culture in this part of the world ( I am a westerner who has lived and worked in Qatar for 5 years now) and this book just doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, I had higher expectations","review":"I've only heard rave reviews of this book and was strongly encouraged to read it since I would be spending an extended period in Jordan. I think my expectations were too great. I had hoped to learn more about Bedouin traditions and culture and how a Westerner became a part of the society. I'm not a scholar of the Middle East, Arab, or Bedouin historty/tradition, but there was little information that was new for me. I found the book to be poorly organized, lacking of structure, and repetitive. Except for a few \\"chapters\\" when the author truly opened up to the reader, I felt as if I were reading a list of items from a day planner. From the anecdotes, it's clear Ms. Van Geldermalsen (Umm Salwa wa Umm Raami) led a rich life and experienced much that most of us will never know. I simply wish she had a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a literary piece","review":"Interesting topic, especially since we had just visited Petra, but the writing so uninspiring that I lost interest very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Informative, just not to the point.","review":"Mr. Boulter's research as described in this book is one of the most interesting and encompassing I have ever encountered. The findings relating to biological evolution (rate of evolution and self organized system characteristics) are very important and intriguing findings. However the book is not to the point in my opinion. It is too descriptive of things that are not relevant to the topic. In fact you can easily eliminate 80 pages from this book and still leave the main argument unchanged and understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man","review":"Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man, Is a well-written book by Michael Boulter. The Columbia University Press published it in 2002. This book takes you on an exciting journey through some of the Earth's most fascinating extinctions. Boulter spends the majority of the book showing similarities and differences between the Earth during these extinctions, as well as the present day. He asks the question; are humans sending our World down a deadly path that it will be unable to rebound from? I would recommend this book to anyone who is open to new ideas, and won't get depressed over the idea that we may be extremely close to our own extinction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp, even, breathtakingly beautiful - a monumental accomplishment","review":"The CD cover has a succinct quote from Gramophone: \\"As close to how I would choose to hear [the music] as I have yet had the pleasure of doing.\\" This about says it all. Here you will find no intolerable Romantic-style embellishments or wavering tempos, just Bach as he was meant to be played. A crisp and even performance, breathtaking in its unadorned beauty. I will add all of Angela Hewitt's other Baroque recordings to my wish list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed Playing, Not My Favorite Bach","review":"There is a deeply spiritual quality in Bach's music, that brings me closer to heaven every time I listen. This quality is present with such abundance in the Bach of the elderly Arrau and Kempff, that the music reached deeply into my soul and put me into tears at time.IMHO, it takes a very refined sense of control to balance the multiple voices in Bach's polyphonic keyboard music. On one hand, each line needs to be given its due independence and prominence, and yet, at the same time, together they should sound \\"at peace\\" with one another harmonically. Hewitt's playing is usually muddy in the bass lines (as compared to the clarity achieved by Glenn Gould, Arrau or Kempff, the latter two even did it on unmodified pianos). Hewitt's playing also lacks the fore-mentioned finesse control, that caused the louder passages to sound \\"noisy\\" and \\"nervous\\". Also, while her phrasing is usually very good, her shaping may be considered overdone for Baroque keyboard music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light music Bach","review":"Refinement and elegance of her playing is pretty impressive at first hearing, but this is not the kind of performance I want to come back repeatedly. It's matter of personal taste, but for me Bach should be played with much depth and sense of awe. Maybe I'm too old fashioned, but whatever she plays sounds like light music and as if something is missing despite all the praises heaped upon by critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars +.","review":"Happy that you carry several CD offerings of Angela Hewitt - a worthy successor to Glen Gould in interpreting Bach."},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to review","review":"I never received the items in this order. Post office refused to deliver. I'd love to review these CD's because I needed them for my business. This is difficult to do when the post office refuses to deliver. I signed the delivery receipt requesting the package be redelivered and it was never delivered to my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I love the idea of this book.

I am Syrian, and it is by far the best and most authentic book ever written on the subject of Syrian food. I suggest you get in touch with Helen Corey or her family in Worcester, Massachusetts (St. George's Orthodox Cathedral can help you locate her- they are on Anna Street) to tell her about your site and how she can benefit from publishing her book again. I am sure she has no idea of the potential, let alone understanding computers. Her book is an important historical record that should be preserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for taking me with you!--I felt like I was there.","review":"Great service on the book.

Wonderful experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standers is a good universal bed rail","review":"I put two of these on my Leggett & Platt adjustable bed which has only gliders under the frame. One on the Head riser and the other on the foot riser. My mattress was only 10 inches off the floor so the rail would contact the floor before folding down. I raised the pivot point 4 inches and moved the cross bar under the mattress closer to the pivot point to avoid the vibrator pads. since I located them so one of the L shapped tube was over the vibrator pad, I cut 4-1/4 inches off the end. They work fine now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help at Last!","review":"We ordered this adjustable rail just in time! My mother fell the next week and fractured her back. This rail is well made, sturdy--neat in appearance,fits well on a craftmatic-type adjustable bed, and can be dropped below the side for easy reach to the patient or loved one. Also, elderly people often have little strength in their hands and mother has no difficulty in pushing the buttons to extend the rail for added safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standers EZ Adjust Bed Rail","review":"This is a great rail for in-home elder care if you don't have or need a hospital bed. The product description does not indicate the minimum height of the box spring, in order for the rail to clear the floor when folded down. Our low-profile box spring is 13\\" off the floor, which is not high enough to be able to fold it down completely. Luckily, we were able to use it without that function, by moving the rail as close as possible to the head of the bed. You should have at least 14\\" to the top of the box spring to use that function. Other than that, the retractability of the rail is just what we needed, to allow our elder to get in and out of bed. I would rate this 5 stars if the rail had been a bit lower in height. Not everyone has super thick box springs and mattresses. Of course, bed risers would solve this if you didn't want the rollers on the bed frame to function. We just didn't want a higher bed, hence the lower box spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few \\"but you must's\\" ...","review":"...for this product, you must have a box spring under the mattress. It is not secure when held by a platform only.Also, you must have sufficient upper body or/and arm strength to pull yourself up to a sitting position. My mother's arthritis prevented her from using the product; she just didn't have enough strength in her arms.Finally, YOU CANNOT RETURN this product once it is opened according to Amazon unless it is defective. If you aren't sure it's going to meet your needs, think twice. We can't use it and can't return it. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bed Rail OK","review":"The package was missing a key piece that had to be sent separately. The directions were incorrect which made it confusing to assembly especially since I didn't know I was missing a part. Works as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okie Dokie Bed Rail","review":"This bed rail is okay. I ordered it and expected to see it within 10 days, and to my surprise, it arrived the next day. I like the product. It was fairly easy to install...however you do need two able bodied individuals to put it in place. I wish it had was engineered so that it could be let down in a horizontal manner (parallel to the bed) instead of in a vertical up and downward manner. Folding it downward disables the use of the pouch that came with it because the pouch has no zippers or snapped closed flaps to keep items in the pockets...therefore when you fold the bedrail downward...everything falls out. Otherwise, it serves it purpose adequately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bed cane","review":"I got this to help after knee replacement surgery. I don't know how I would have gotten by without it. It helps with turning over, getting in bed, out of bed. I will probably keep it in place even after I'm healed. A great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standers EZ Adjustable Bed Rail","review":"Although It took 2 days to put together the bedrail is a wonderful addition to my mothers bed. The instructions were not the easiest to follow as it assume you know where washers and joints come together in the correct order. Lucky with a mechanical back ground I was able to figure it out. Also one of the welded female threaded attachments was slightly off causing alignment problems when trying to secure with a screw as a result it cross treaded a little which prevented the joint from being fully attached.

And, since she had a king size bed, I also needed a rail that could cover enough of the bed, so that she wouldn't slip past the railing (or that the rail wouldn't easily slide away from the bed). Thankfully, this is the bed rail that I purchased on the first try. While even at it's shortest setting the rail is wide enough to cover quite a bit of the bed, I can still extend it if I need to. Plus, the bars that slide between the mattress were quite stable even without the use of the strap--the king size mattress was too heavy for me to maneuver. (Don't worry, I tested the rail before I allowed my mom anywhere near it, if it can sustain my pulling, it will definitely not budge when she uses it). This item was easy for me to assemble, and worked like a charm. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install","review":"My Mother-In-Law's physical therapist recommended this item.

I do recommend anyone needing this type of device to purchase one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I made it work anyway","review":"If the rails went together as the directions show, this thing would be OK. However, the strap that is supposed to reach between the box spring and the mattress is fabricated in a way making it impossible to actually assemble that part of the product. You will just give up and make a knot around the bed frame and feel really mystified by the \\"easy\\" videos or the printed instructions. Don't worry, its not you..... its a design flaw of the first order. If someone in Quality Control had tried to put this thing together he/she would have seen the error. The Y belt around the rail's frame has a misplaced and permanently sewn plastic connector so you can't use it to adjust or connect to the other plastic connector. Best guess is the factory in China had the drawings sent from a broken fax machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this!","review":"I bought this for my mother who Is in a hospital bed.

It is pretty stable, but it does move just a little as you might expect being secured with the weight of the mattress and the individual on the mattress.

When my mother tested it by lying in bed and grabbing the rail to pull herself to an upright position, the entire bedrail system shifted toward her. It is unstable, moves forward, backward, and shifts around easily. The strap system going under the bed simply provides no proper anchoring at all. If you can figure out how to attach it with stability to the bedframe, it will probably work, but I don't want to spend 5 hours and countless trips to the hardware store to resolve what is, essentially, a poor design idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Sturdy Bed Rail","review":"The Standers EZ Adjust Bed Rail is very sturdy and easy to install on the bed.

It has a bit of give (slightly wobbly) but it is firm. I'd say as long as there is no way for the person using it to flip over the entire mattress (for instance a frail old woman and a heavy queen mattress) then there's no problems with it. The little side pouch that it comes with works great for glasses, phones, TV clickers, and small books. It makes the bed skirt and comforter look a little funky (due to straps and the comforter/skirt not laying properly) but some quick alterations will make them look fine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit","review":"Could not attach this to a sleep number bed.

I tried these hoping they would be OK at a lower price point. These did not fit that well, the toe was horrible, and the heel construction stunk. These are uncomfortable old-school dress socks.

Frankly, this is what ruined the film for me and brought it down to only 2 stars.-choice of lead actress. While I thought Ali Larter did a graat job on Heroes, she just wasn't great here.-there was no chemistry between the lead actor/actress.

It's what I call a happy movie. It's clean, it's colorful and completely and totally enjoyable. It's romantic, funny, dramatic and good sentimental, clean and safe to watch with the whole family.

Little did he know that years down the road, in an effort to promote a match with HHH, Hunter would violate a mannikin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, breezy read","review":"This is a lot different that most of the WWE books, but different in a good way. I've always liked the fact that WWE has always treated Kane differently than others in that they never really tried to go beyond the character. Most of their current wrestlers have no character. They are just regular people in wrestling tights, and that can get kind of boring. But one of the things most fans always liked about wrestling is the fact these \\"characters\\" are different than you or me.Kane is one of the last of a dying breed, and that's why I looked forward to reading more about his character in a fictional book. If you have enjoyed the mystery of the Kane character, you will enjoy this book, which goes into most of the questions I always wondered about.The writing is pretty good and for the most part does a good job of filling in the holes. In some ways it felt like reading a real biography until you get to the end, when Kane and Undertaker meet for the first time since the fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this guy thinking when he wrote this book?","review":"As a wrestling fan and a fan of Kane, I was disappointed by Chiappetta's biography. He should have called his book The Overdramatized History of Kane. The first part, which chronicles Kane's childhood and high school years, reads like a Lifetime movie, completely overdramatic. The second part was laughable because Chiappetta's portrait of the \\"real\\" Kane, (the man outside the ring) was so unreal. This book, I presume, was supposed to shows us the inner depths of this WWE superstar's mind and learn why he is the way he is, but all this book shows is that the author doesnt really know anything about his subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I've read most of WWE's biographies, and decided to give this one a try. I think most fans who enjoy Raw and Smackdown for the storylines will enjoy this book for the same reasons. It gives insight into the big red monster and makes him a more sympathetic character."},{"rating":"2","title":"we're STILL dancing!","review":"Tonight I was washing the dishes and my daughter suddenly started chanting \\"chin chin jara jara\\"; it made me want to grab a box of coins and start to dance!

They came with easy to follow instructions that I felt comfortable following. I am a do-it-yourself kind of guy and this was a fun install for me. Everything was included in the kit for a proper mount on my Cherokee. The only problem I have with the lights is the hardware on the hinge of the light housing could be a bit more heavy duty. I felt as if I could have stripped out the bolts if I tightened them too much. They will still tilt up or down with not too much pressure which is what I was trying to eliminate. Overall for the price and the functionality of these lights I am pleased and they look great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted out in 6 years","review":"I purchased these to mount on my 2003 TJ windshield, the first 2 years they worked great but started to rust. My jeep is always hand washed and I even waxed the lights when I waxed my jeep. Within 3 years I noticed rust in the same area on both lights, at 5 years they stopped working (but I kept them installed because I liked the look), and at 6 years I removed them because they split apart from all the rust, also I was tired of scrubbing the rust streaks off my jeep.There was a significant amount of power drain when these lights are running. I am switching to LED for a large reduction in power usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin Lights","review":"Once installed these lights perform amazing. They are bright as hell and reall work well when installed on the windshield of a jeep. I point the, slightly to the sides so they light up the periphery.

It has no restraints or pockets inside for bottles, diapers or wipes. Everything was so jumbled up when I carried it and the bottles would fall over and leak. How hard is it to just put in some elastic to hold the bottles upright? I had to wash the bag out countless times. I finally gave up on it when the end came off the zipper and ruined it for good.If you do buy this please consider buying the travel pod along with it even though it more than doubles the price and still does not guarantee the bottles will stay upright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roomy, durable, and convenient","review":"This is a nice, roomy and good quailty bag. The main pocket is just one big pocket, with no inside pockets. It is great for throwing stuff in, and I can fit a change of clothes and diaper/wipes for both kids. Plus snacks and drinks. My only complaint is that if I do want to bring water bottles or sippy cups, there are not pockets inside or out that will keep them from turning sideways. Still worth the buy though."},{"rating":"2","title":"(No title).","review":"This disc is among the finest, if not the finest, of Hyperion's Romantic Piano Concerto series. (Most) all credit, of course, is due to the pianist, Marc Andre Hamelin, who, in his phenomenal technical abilities and superb musicianship, delivers astonishingly dexterous, breathtaking, highly persuasive, commited performances of each of these compositions staggeringly unforgiving and formidable difficulties, written to be so well concealed that they become almost transparent to the ear...

Who cares, I kept saying page after page. It seemed to me that Gordon may've had a good idea, but the subject failed to come to life. Instead of giving up on a foundering narrative, she forced it. Perhaps she had a hefty advance? Still, it stunned me that an editor didn't hack away at least half of the book, or ask Gordon who she really wanted to write about, her father or her mother. (The mother by the way was a lot more interesting, perhaps because when Gordon writes about her she has a narrative tone - angle. Comparatively, when she wries about her father, the prose is flat.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a non-Catholic FL reader","review":"I think Mary Gordon could benefit from a few sessions with a psychiatrist.

The title of the book is quite appropriate.Angela's Ashes, in contrast, which is a memoir about the life and times of the author is a lush journey through dark and passionate times. While his life could be construed as pitiful he does not beg for pity.

I also think that the measurement scale for the brand is off. The straps are not wide enough too prevent the constant movement that normally happens with women who have large breasts. I will never buy this brand again. The bra was also too stretchy; bras should have a fit that 'molds' to you in a way before and after wearing them. Keep fooling people with the long body, thin models who, I believe, have help to make the bra look like it will 'behave' when someone like me buys the bra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service","review":"I placed an order with this seller for 2 items. The seller went a week without any communications, before sending me an email to tell me they were out of stock on the items and they were canceling my order. It just so happens that this ridiculous delay has caused a major inconvenience. I was depending on these items to be here by now, and I not only am out of the items, but am out of time to order them elsewhere. The seller should have contacted me long ago to notify me that 1) they were out of stock and 2) giving me an option of waiting for the items to be in stock, or to cancel my order. 1 week is far too long to contact me considering Amazon requires sellers to ship items within 2 business days.

After purchasing this cookbook based on numerous positive reviews, I got it for me and my daughter. This is the \\"bland leading the bland.\\" I made a half-dozen of the best-sounding dishes, and nothing had much flavor. Even after doubling the spices (or even raiding my cabinet to see what I could add before it hit the plate) nothing stands out as a recipe I enjoy enough to ever make again, let alone serve to friends. The best thing about this cookbook is that the small portions give you less to have to throw down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what i was looking for","review":"The book offers a lot of good, reasonable recipes.

I only cook for two, but I've found that this cookbook just doesn't do it for me. I think that most of the recipes are *too* healthy for the average person - they just don't sound good. Additionally, I find that the ingredients are often expensive and sometimes unknown to me. The \\"for two\\" option isn't helpful for me either, as it often calls for uncommon ingredient portions anyway, so I'd be just as well off converting an existing recipe to serve fewer people.The book offers a handful of pleasing recipes and some good healthy cooking tips, but I don't think it's worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 400-600 calorie meals at the back are perfect.","review":"I'm so excited to have this book.

Most of them keep quite well if you really are cooking for just one, and they're calorie, salt, and fat restricted, so they're great for my diet. So far, my favorites are the chicken and seafood recipes, they are varied and have added some color and spice (and less fat) to my old favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love to cook, don't get this book.","review":"The recipes in this book are not very appetizing.

The book offers recipes for 2 or 1 person. Great.Healthy: Not even close. Most recipes call for butter, all-purpose flours, eggs, sugar, etc... Don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with those ingredients, I was just expecting a better emphasis on healthier alternatives and also actual recipes that maximize good balance.Recipes: Most sound not so appetizing.In summary, it seems that this book was written without any inspiration or any type of real base for health. Was probably an adaptation of various recipes find in other books, rewritten and calculated to accommodate for 2 people servings. Slap a \\"Healthy\\" in the title, call it low-fat (I can call anything low fat if serving is small enough) and add a little \\"R.D.\\" after the author's name and I too can get a \\"best seller\\".Sorry for the negativity, but I needed to warn others that this book is far from healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Not so Healthy Cooking for Two\\"","review":"I want my money back...first of all the book that is received is not the book that is shown.

Yes, the dishes may be low-fat but there is more to healthy than just eating things lower in fat. Being a single full-time college senior, plus working five days a week, I do not have time to make most of the meals in here. I see a nutritionist a couple times a month and work in a diet office in a hospital so I was SHOCKED to see how high the calories are for these recipes. You will be hard-pressed to find a \\"good\\" recipe for less than 300 calories and the cholesterol and carbohydrate values are ridiculous. You may not have high fat, but you will have heart disease and diabetes if you get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I ordered this book because, having graduated college and tired of Ramen, I needed to know how to cut, mix and heat real food. The produce and ingredient recommendations are not for the novice cooker.

Other healthy cookbooks deliver much better recipes. For example, one spinach dish called for steamed spinach, throw on some sesame seeds, and drizzle with soy sauce. This is something anyone can do, but the results are not very good and you wouldn't want to make it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BBB - Boring, Basic & for Beginners","review":"Considering that the title itself implies the simplicity of the recipes, I feel a little bad about complaining about the quality of this book, but hey, I will anyway.If you are a beginning cook and have never made tuna salad and/or have thought to add something other than mayonnaise to it, if you have never made a meatloaf (low fat?) or boiled a noodle, then this would be a good book for you, otherwise, the boringness of the majority of the recipes will make for a very dusty book on your shelf.The sample recipes featured on the Amazon \\"Look Inside\\" function seemed interesting but have turned out to be the rare exception that stand out from the dull, simplistic everyday recipes that any good cook could throw together without thinking.The crappiness and lack of inspiration in this book would make even Rachel Ray laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Great recipes.

The first thing you notice is how large it is. It nearly covers a dollar bill folded in half. It will hold quite a lot of bills and with its large size, you don't get those nasty wrinkled and chewed-up edges on your bills. It is well made and should last a long time. Using magnets instead of a spring clip means you never have to worry about losing spring tension and ending up with a pocket full of loose bills. It is a very \\"manly\\" money clip too, if you worry about that kind of thing!

James Ulmer is an amazing talent - he could have been the next Ornette Coleman or Jimi Hendrix - his 2 chief influences. Pity then that nearly 30 years after this stunning debut he remains a relative unknown.His subsequent efforts have only repeated what this album started out. Recent years have seen some spirited blues recordings - impressive but a lot more on the beaten track than his beginnings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice psychedelia","review":"I was not too impressed about two first songs on this album. They are okay but nothing more. I got captivated at third song \\" The theatre and its double\\" wow! Nice haunted bass line with kind of electric guitar flamenco at the end. The more I was going in this album, the more I was loving it. With cool \\"Telepath\\" and \\"See your lights\\". Then came \\"Lay low\\" my favorite. The rest of the album caught my attention a lot.These guy are still making excellent album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead and U2 wish they could create music this exciting.","review":"This criminally underrated Australian rock group is my all-time favorite band. Since 1981 they've released one great album after another, and Forget yourself is one of their best. Steve Kilbey's cool vocals, his interesting stream-of-consciousness lyrics, two exhilarating guitarists - Marty Willson-Piper, Peter Koppes - and Tim Powles, a drummer with great production skills, make for an all-round class act.However, this may not be the place to start as Forget Yourself is not one of their more accesible recordings. If you're new to The Church, I would suggest \\"After Everything Now This\\".But mark my words: sometime in the future Forget Yourself is going to be regarded as a MASTERPIECE. Of course, to some of us it already is!Also highly recommended: Gold Afternoon Fix, Hologram Of Ball, Uninvited Like The Clouds and Untitled # 23.THE CHURCH - the best band that ever existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This album is quite a change from its brilliant predecessor, but it is nevertheless another sensational success in what is getting to be a pretty long string of successes for the Church. If you only know of the Church from \\"Under the Milky Way\\", well, you don't know the Church. And you've missed their best work, over a decade's worth of brilliant albums. (This is not to knock the pre-Starfish catalog either, which is quite solid.) FY is the rawest album they've done in years, maybe ever, and has more bite and noise than we've seen from them lately. It isn't the downbeat jewel that we got with AENT, but it quickly becomes highly addictive. I find that the album works better with a slight reordering of the tracks, though obviously Sealine must remain the opening cut. But that's just my preference. If you're not already a Church fan, you should be. These guys are essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power in Simplicity","review":"One of the spacier bands to have survived the 80's, the Church continues to grow and experiment twenty years into their career. For all their atmospheric affectations, they really dig deep into some primitive material on Forget Yourself. After the beautifully progressive After Everything Now This, the biggest surprise of Forget Yourself is how much power they find in simplicity. Standouts are many, particularly \\"Song in Space\\", which always keeps its rocking feet on the ground, and their best song in ages, \\"Telepath\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"lapsed then re-dedicated churchy","review":"i gave up on this band after i heard priest=aura. the church were one of my very very fav bands in the 80s, but i missed the poppy-jangly vibe of the early albums. i bought \\"after everything\\" used on a whim and was blown away. since then i got all the stuff they put out in the past 10 years (and even came to LOVE priest=aura). with the black watch (another literate, catchy guitar band), the church are now again my favorite band (and like the black watch WAY UNDERRATED). Forget Yourself is a triumph of melded melodies and haunting, if obscure, lyrics. it makes me all mushy just to think how the world is a better place because of this music. i dislike most bands these days (i try to like a lot of them) but the church is different. go for this record!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"erm","review":"so here's the situation.

Do you know why?1) They have huge feet that come off. When they go shoe shopping, they're probably like \\"Oh my gosh, Jade! Look at these feet! should I buy them?\\" That's literally what they have to do, because they have no feet. They're shoes are their feet. Ewwww!2) They have huge lips. When they put on their make-up they probably have to use a whole stick of lipstick every time they put it on.3) They don't have a nose. They probably can't breathe through their nose so they probably have to open their mouth and breathe out of that. Who knows? maybe they were born with one, but they had plastic surgeries to get it off just like Michael Jackson.4) Their head is huge! They wouldn't even be able to walk because their head is too heavy. They would fall once they got right side up.Those are just SOME of the reasons I don't like bratz. I used to LOVE them, but not anymore because I got a reality check and noticed that Bratz are snotty."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"I am afraid i do not have this doll, but she looks great!

In \\"The Facts, a Novelist's Autobiography\\", Roth reveals that Lucy is modeled after his psychotic first wife, who is much more interestingly rendered in \\"My Life as a Man\\".

Jilly's business is vintage clothes. Rory's is software, the Senate, and a legendary acting family. His ward is someone Jilly desperately wants to get close to. Meeting Rory throws her for a loop though. Meeting Jilly ('sexcandy') at a time when he is trying to keep his reputation spotless really flusters Rory. There is also a wonderful secondary romance. Rory's ward is a delight too. All these elements come together to form a very special book.

I really wanted to like it, but.... it just didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Boring and banal are the words to describe this third-rate romantic \\"Comedy\\". The characters are unconvincing and one-dimensional; Jilly the heroine is a 25(or 26?) year-old virgin, who still believes that stopping at a certain level of arousal will hurt a guy. Laughable. Rory the hero is a typical macho fool with breast issues and almost no redeeming qualities. Iris, the little girl, bears no resemblance to any four-year-old girl I know. She is behaves more like a belligerent teenager with a very limited vocabulary. The other two major characters are too excruciatingly dull to mention.

You can also just saw a notch in a board the right size if you're doing repeat measurements.But this little plastic tool is handy, takes up no space and is quick to set to any dimension. Example, I rip boards to support steps and deck planking and have to set these back the thickness of the 5/4 board that will sit on it. Ripping long boards often results in a curved piece that you have to screw in place and measure at each screw for accuracy.

My first purchase of the vinyl album was under this repackaging. I had gone after the first 4 albums shortly after I discovered that Pieces of Eight was not their first album!.

My only gripe is why did One Way used the ugly RCA re-issue cover instead of the original LP artwork?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good begining to an excellent carrer, a must for stygians","review":"The album has the begining touches of tallent seeping from every song.

The first cut, \\"Movement for the Common Man\\" sets up the concept albums that would come later. However, the songs are generally weak with the exception of \\"Best Thing\\" which was supposed to be Styx's big break song. Also, when one listens to Styx I or any of Styx's other Wooden Nickel releases, it becomes painfully obvious why the bulk of the lead singing duties were taken away from James Young. He is a great guitarist, and sang well on a few songs later on, but his wail on the bulk of the early recordings is almost unlistenable. And he sings all but 2 of the songs on Styx I, making the record very hard to get through. Longtime fans have been waiting patiently for someone to re-release Styx I on CD. So they must be happy to finally complete the CD collection, but the casual Styx listener should move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST OF STARTS","review":"Skip this cd, buy THE BEST OF STYX, or LADY.

The reason I am posting today is because our $1600 Samsung LCD TV just went black on us today. Luckily it came back on after unplugging it and then plugging it back in but I'm afraid this will be a problem just like the monitor.

She would also choke on the strings if they broke off while chewing on it. Finally, it had three handles on it where she was pulling the center apart. Mind you, she only weighs 10 lbs.

She killed the toy before I even got to their house which is about an hour and a half drive. She managed to undo every one of the knots on the rope legs and they were all frayed. She also ripped into some of the fabric legs and ate the stuffing. This was an expensive toy for her to only be able to use it for an hour. She was only sitting in the car so it's not like she was running around wrestling with it.

This album came out in mid 1998, and it is just as hard core as any Cali early to mid 90's album. He rhymes great as he spits hard knockin' lyrics over hard-core G-Funk beats. He has a hard voice, so it sounds appropriate when he spits G'd up rhymes. If you love music to lowride and hit switches to, this is good rider music. in my opinion, this is his best work, even better than \\"Killa Kali\\" ('95), and that was a really tight album too! The best track is \\"You Neva Know,\\" where he discusses the unpredictability of hood life, or the loss thereof, over a smooth G-Funk beat laced with a faint background whiny synth.

When you feel the emotions experienced by the characters, you know it's good. For those who think that all dubbed anime is terrible, you couldn't be more wrong. VIZ, the production company, has completely redid each episode so the characters actually appear to be speaking English--this is not some crappy dub-over.

Superman.If that name brings a smile of recognition to your face, then this book is for you! Rather than being a vessel to explore the character of Superman, \\"True Brit\\" is aimed squarely at Great Britain, its culture and foibles. The land of the stiff upper lip, cricket, and Page Three girls is shown to be a very silly place, indeed.There are also plentiful references to characters and events from the Monty Python canon, some of them positively subtle, others....not so subtle. Highly reccommended for fans of Python in particular, and British humor in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swing and a miss...","review":"What a great premise unfortunately squandered by trying (and failing) to turn the story of Superman into a comedy. The boy that would become Superman crash lands in Great Britain rather than America and grows up to be a bumbling idiot even when he's trying to help the country. It's as if he acted like Clark Kent even after the glasses were off. On top of that, the press has turned on him, and it seems like everyone doesn't like him. This is the source of most of the book's gags, and they're really not funny; they're just sad (a running joke has his parents trying to abandon him because they don't think he should be using his powers).Basically, if you like Superman, then you should definitely avoid this book. It's not even worth wasting the short time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"Wow, I cannot believe how boring I found this book.

The story on the other hand was very disappointing. I don't know if it was just too \\"British\\" for me but I just didn't find it entertaining. The approach that was taken with Superman as a British citizen was not very flattering to the British people as a whole and the type of hero the British Superman became was insulting to the American version. I realize this is an \\"Else Worlds\\" tale and does not \\"count\\" from a continuity perspective but I did expect a more Superman-like story. Unless you really enjoy British perspectives on American heroes, I wouldn't waste your money on this one.

Plus the abductor shows up at the house at the end making it even more stupid.

If you want to read about rabbit behavior, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK","review":"I had high expectations for this book having lived with bunnies in our home for 17 years. The only people interested in this book would bepeople who already had rabbits and knew all about them. But the bookwas written for the novice - for someone who knew nothing. Anyway,the cover was lovely but the book itself - well, I skimmed it and putit away. Everything the authors said could have been said on pretty much a couple pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots and LOTS of discrepancies!","review":"Thought I had bought a good reference book, but am totally dismayed with the discrepancies and downright misinformation on the rabbit industries. Passing off an unrelated personal web site and public chats as the PRMA web site and chats is inexcusable and irresponsible reporting and that's just for starters. Way too much misinformation contained in this book to be able to give more than a one star rating. Does not give a true picture of the rabbit industries. Quoting from old 1920's books is a poor excuse for describing the industries of today. For shame! I definitely will not be recommending this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthropomorphism does lagomorphs no favors","review":"Unfortunately, the authors attempted to use their very limited experience with rabbits to write a definitive text on multiple areas of rabbit keeping.They exhort their theory on dietary needs, presenting it as fact when there actually are no studies available to support their views.They mis-quoted anecdotes that were written on an internet list, about raising meat rabbits.They had typos when describing a processing plant which created misleading impressions.With little understanding of group dynamics of rabbits, they force herd behaviors on them and insist that this is what rabbits prefer. In that area, they seem to think that rabbits are small furry people.The book may have amusement value, but as a guide to keeping rabbits or as a look at rabbits as other than house pets, it's useless. As a guide to keeping rabbits as house pets, it's inhumane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many parts inaccurate","review":"I really didn't like the book & found many inaccuracies. The authors admit to being opposed to using rabbits as meat so I can't see how they could have done an objective investigation on raising rabbits for meat. I've talked to some who breed commercially and was told some of that information is incorrect. I picked up several other inaccuracies as well. For example it said meat breeders wean at 4 weeks then the authors say it's too early, it's suppose to be 8 weeks. They really missed the mark, it's 8 weeks for pet rabbits but rabbits can be safely weaned at 4 weeks and some of the commercial breeds are selected so young can be weaned at 4 weeks. Alot fo stuff like that which will give people not involved in breeding a very distorted view of the commercial industries. Some conclusions about rabbit behavior seemed to contradict the authors observations as well. This book seemed more like some sort of animal rights propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bashes Breeders","review":"This book has good intentions, to reveal the truth about rabbits. But in the breeders section, this book goes horribly wrong. Breeders love their rabbits, maybe more that pet rabbit owners. They spend time, money and love on their rabbits. Not all breeders make money off of rabbits, and that is the choice they make.If this book had not been some anti-breeder, radical animal rights book it would have done much better in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book for any rabbit lover!","review":"Really interesting, historially accurate book about rabbits and the different roles they play in our culture.

I was mostly interested in learning about rabbit lore,as it's always been a pain to find the one sentence or paragraph in an art history or archaeology book about it. Although there was not a ton about rabbit symbolism, there was a wealth of information about the rabbit breeding industry, rabbits used in vernacular language and also information about the lack of protection in rabbit farms. There was so much about rabbits I wasn't entirely aware of. Not all of it was pretty, such as humane and less humane methods of killing a rabbit, but all of it was interesting.I am very glad I was given this book and thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Review of a Detailed Book on a Complicated Topic","review":"I quite enjoyed the first two sections of the book, which were filled with much historical and societal information on rabbits. The last section detailed too much of the disturbing facts about those rabbits who live only for experimental testing, meat, or breeding.

But soon, I found myself gaining a deeper perspective on my beloved bunny-friends and learned a lot about them and how they are perceived in our society.

It is a book for pet rabbit lovers by pet rabbit lovers. Those who make profit off of rabbits might be offended by this book. Both of the authors are deeply involved with the House Rabbit Society, a rabbit rescue and education organization.If you love rabbits as pets and want to learn about wild and domestic behavior, this book is for you.

This chapter was detailed and distrubing, but at the same time, it's something that I (as a rabbit owner/lover) would want to know.Overall, this is a great book for any bunny owner.

Some are familiar from their later, engraved versions which appeared in the atlas for the Official Records (although the originals shown here are always more vivid and immediate), while others have not been seen their original wartime use. Many are quite simply works of art, transforming the three-dimensional world into an exquisite two-dimensional rendition.But superbly reproduced maps are not the only treasures in McElfresh's book. The introductory chapters about the work and importance of topographical engineers to the Civil War is perhaps the best account of them yet published. And one-page biographies are provided for many of them, some famous for other, post-war careers (Ambrose Bierce and George Armstrong Custer, for example).This is a book which belongs in any collection of Civil War material."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the greatest dance albums of all time","review":"when this album was released, it caused a stir in the dance world. a most impressive release to include \\"dance to dance\\", \\"there's a woman\\", and the ever popular \\"dancer\\" & \\"the visitors\\". for those dance completists, this release is definitely a \\"must buy\\". if i had a top ten greatest dance albums of all time, \\"outline\\" would definitely make the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gino Soccio's Legendary Disco Classic's","review":"This is one of the artists that made those late 70's and early 80's such a rememberable time.

Most series where you read the books out of order its a minor miss step but here it was a huge mistake. While Hall's books, for the most part, can stand on its own you don't truly understand the Thorn character until you've read Daylight.Under Cover of Daylight is not just a story of murder and revenge but a scathing biopsy of the everchanging culture of Southern Florida. As we cut through the layers of this shifting society we take an uncomfortable look two people who relationship give a whole new meaning to love-hate. While the literal suprises are few the emotional surprises are many."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTRODUCING THORN","review":"I am really just getting into James W. Hall and living in Florida, shame on me. UNDER THE COVER OF DAYLIGHT is the first of Hall's Thorn books. Thorn is his Key's antihero.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keys People: READ THIS BOOK","review":"I haunt the bookstores for good novels pertaining to the Keys and only recently did this important work of Hall's become available. Although this is where it all starts with Thorn - great character background and motivational set up - it is also a fine read. Would you believe, greedy developers willing to bend the law and squeeze the little guys out for obscene profit: a lack of concern for the character and individualism of Keys communities, condos at any costs? Somehow the book seems relevant today, and when the characters repeatedly stress they are not against progress but somewhere we must draw a line we hear the same complex emotions that are at the heart of every development discussion today, twenty years after the original publication. All this and a great Thorn style plot. Perfect for those rainy/windy days when the bonefish are shying away or the lobsters are not in season."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THRILLER?

It doesn't dribble even topped off above it's 17oz capacity (with the basket removed and to the rim almost). The enameling inside of the spout seems pretty much perfect though, and this is the only area I can't hit with a towel after use so I'm glad to see that.UPDATE: I took the pot back. The enamel started flaking off really bad. I had read other reviews about this and assumed that they didn't know how to properly use a teapot (maybe they were using it as a kettle too? idk).... but using it exclusively as a pot, no washings (only a quick rinse with water).... the enamel flaked off really bad into my tea.

That isn't true. The reason why is that the fansubs he is talking about are, what I like to called, literally translated. Basically, a word that was used to mean dang in the original fansubs was probably translated as damn in every situation, since damn is it's most literal translation.

As mentioned in another review - the main character was rude and inconsiderate to his family and friends and only tried to be nice to the heroine. There wasn't any reason for me to root for him.

I'm no judge of anyone's playing of medtner, but i think hamelin should probably leave busoni alone, unless he takes a fancy to one or other bach arrangement (which i can imagine hamelin DOESN'T fancy). The strange thing is that hamelin's studio recordings of other alkan (i have his op 39 concerto and symphony) come off dead to me (fast, blurry...unconcerned and even unaware), and so i wonder if this has to do with the venue: hamelin needs to be recorder live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing!","review":"I have listened this recital, because of praises which written in this page.

For those who don't know, the movie is about a report who is trying to track down a serial killer that's going after children. At first he's doing it to further his career, but he gets sucked in to it and of course there are a ton of surprises and lost trusts. It's one of the best movies I've seen all year, everything from the plot to the cenimatography is stunning and gritty.

A reporter is sent to a small Ecuadorian town where a serial killer has already murdered several children. If you're a curious movie lover, CRONICAS is a film for you. To choose to handle the serial killer genre in a setting as original as an impoverished part of Ecuador allows the director to say two or three important things about journalism, ethics and the crowd's psychology.

I have several of his books/DVDs and must say that in most respects he exceeds Koch, Wyatt, Soklow, Mitchell and the rest.I took this DVD out of the library and am now ordering it because the attention to detail is just extraordinary. If you want to truly sound like Zep and Clapton, and Berry, on these hits and moreover absorb their styles to some extent, this is your DVD.

Really, it's hard to narrow down to any one selection -- from the setting of Psalm 27, to the gorgeous Magnificat & Nunc Dimitis and setting of Psalm 122 by Sowerby, not to mention the beautiful and little known excerpts from Christus by Mendelssohn, and the effective organ prelude, improvisation, and postlude -- it all adds-up to, in my humble opinion, a \\"must-have\\" for anyone who appreciates the finist of sacred choral literature.

Apparently, others looked to the Loggins' marriage as a path for their own stability. Alas, the marriage ended in 2004 so, like so many others, it is great to give advice to others but they don't follow it themselves. Just another example for readers to look to their own souls to determine the right path and don't rely on anyone else. The only saving grace is that my wife and I married almost ten years before the Loggins marriage did and, after almost 23 years, we still are together (not perfect..at least I am not).

It would be difficult for the non-Gullah-speaking child to follow this telling (\\"Yent oonuh fuh knows how fuh tote kek?\\") -- and frankly rather tedious for any child at all.

It is, as the title suggests, just Blood's guitar with a string quartet to back him, although the quartet plays more than just a rhythm section role in the music. On Odyssey (possibly Blood's best-- I actually prefer it to Tales of Captain Black, so pick it up if you can find it), Ulmer proved that a guitar and a violin can not only peacefully coexist, but work oddly well together. This album is far different from Odyssey, though, in that there is no distortion of the sound of the string quartet. It actually sounds in several places like a classical album, but every time it begins to do so, Blood's guitar comes in like in an old call-and-response blues piece, echoing what the quartet has played, but in harmolodics. It is weird, but strangely, it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The design is cute, but the thread is cheap and knots easily.

I am an adult and this says it's for kids, well I even found it very hard. The instructions were very confusing to me. Also the needle that is included is very tiny and it took me 2 hours to thread it. If you buy this kit may I suggest going to Walmart, or some place that sells crafts and buy a bigger needle eye. The holes are very tiny and not easy to see. I had a hard time trying to figure out where the colors go, though there is a color chart included. This kit maybe fine for someone that really knows what they are doing, but not for the beginner, not in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Angle Techniques","review":"This DVD gave me the techniques I needed for keeping my return shots away from my opponents.

I had to spend about 30 minutes just to bend the metal to get the two pieces to fit. After putting some bottles on, the top fell off. Decided to super glue it together and that seems to have fixed it.

It ticked me off when I saw how poorly it was constructed. The product is a great idea, but it leaked and the connecting metal piece between the two main pieces was woefully short.

If globalization to you means Mitsubishi cutting down rain forests or Nike exploiting workers, this book may not be for you. It is, as has been pointed out, a textbook and it is one that will challenge your view of globalization. Having come to the book as an opponent of globalization, this book awakened me to the complexity of the problems raised by a rapidly globalizing economy. As a result, I was forced to re-examine my opposition and hone my arguments against globalization. This unbiased, empirical approach makes the book highly recommended for those interested in putting forth the best possible argmuments about the global economy. It is, however, highly academic and not necessarily for most activists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Performances But Falls Flat in the Packaging","review":"The problem with this series of guitar instructional material is the lack of accurate tab. In the case of this particularly DVD, there is no tab; just a little useless booklet that gives a guide to notation and lists the chords used in the songs. Also, it is advertised as giving a complete breakdown on playing the songs. This is true except for the last one, Sen-sa-shun which is played straight through with the closing credits.On the positive side, Duke Robillard's performance of the songs is superb and very inspiring, particularly The Stumble. I recommend this to die-hard Freddie King fans and advanced guitar players but the lack of tablature will probably be a source of frustration to beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Instructional DVD","review":"Don't waste your money on this DVD. There is no tab and the \\"closeups\\" of Duke Robillaird's hands are shot from a poor angle so you can't tell what strings he's fretting. Suffice to say I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat blend of form and function","review":"The microwave has both function and form. I love the automated sensor heat function, that also accompanies the built-in cook times for veggies, beverages etc. The power levels really work well. For example, you set at P3 level for 1 minute, and you can soften (not melt!!) the butter straight out of the fridge. Looks cool too.Only thing I'd like to add is that if you intend it to be a counter-top model, don't take a 2.2 cu ft model. This one is ideal ideal for a mid-large sized kitchen. For a smaller kitchen space, go with a smaller sized Panasonic with similar features."},{"rating":"2","title":"new and hot","review":"if u want some refreshing new hip-hop peep this cd u will definitely love it this is hot and Relm will be heard"},{"rating":"1","title":"AAARRRGGHHH!!","review":"Avoid this one!Too much misinformation, misbeliefs, wrong spelled names and \\"sics\\".Has mr.

But he turns Clarice Starling into some absurd, undisciplined character and then creates an ending which is amongst the worst endings of the decade! I loved \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", and there were parts of this book which had the same wonderful feeling of anticipation and dread. But it was nowhere near Silence for reasonably believeable characters. And the ending...! Too stupid for words...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal disappointment","review":"Hannibal Lecter was a very interesting supporting character in \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\" Unfortunately, Harris fell in love with the character, and distorted Lecter badly in this sequel. Previously, Lecter was an unmitigated villain, a monster who, though witty, well-educated and having good taste, was a murderous cannibal who killed people because it amused him to do so.Now he kills only people who deserve to die. Hannibal the Cannibal has been forcibly transmogrified into Hannibal the Hero, and the author into Harris the Hack. The ending of \\"Hannibal\\" is absolutely horrendous, a brutal attack on the sensibilities of the reader and on the character of Clarice. It's snide, arrogant and heartless; in my experience as a reader, this is the most sadistic attack on the readers of the book I have ever encountered, and by very far, the worst ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow decline downwards...","review":"This series becomes so awful that it is laughable. The characters soon become flat and bland. Elk practically beings to whines every episode and has to learn to \\"accept\\" things. This quickly leads to every episode having poor animation.The fights stop around the middle of the series. I am not joking. Tosh gets to chop up maybe 3 guys at most. The problem doesn't only lie in the animation and characters, but the story becomes down-right stupid. By the end you won't care as the creators lost interest. Clive is a horrible badguy. The last few episodes are the worst. Everyone shakes because of everything. Everyone is shocked because of everything. In DBZ, Krillin shakes when someone throws a punch. This series is worse than that.If you want a great series try \\"Samurai Deeper Kyo\\". It is so much better. The creators actually make it better as they go along. This series quickly falls apart. Save your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deserve such a high price","review":"This was my first lap top and had to throw it in garbage in one year after facing many problems. I bought it considering Sony brand , but now realized that Sony is worst when it comes to laptops.- Lap top base gets so hot that it can burn your skin and you can not work while keeping in your lap.- Battery back up is less than 90 minutes even when laptop is new- Key board is flat , not comfortable and very fragile (can break very easily)- Over all the laptop is not at all sturdy and different parts (such as side panel in my case) can come out very easily.I would advise not to spend $1500-$2000 for this as there are various other good laptops available in this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I have had the misfortune of purchasing this laptop.

The laptop is on the bottom, and the air bags are all on the top. There is no protection for the laptop at all. I think amazon need to learn how to pack.Call amazon customer serivces, they don't serve you. They keep asking you to call back later.

I ask myself would I replace this book if I should lose it. The answer to this book is a definite yes. I currently own 3 books on the London System and find this one to be the most informative. In their book the authors treat the London much like the Colle except white has the problem of his queens bishop solved. The second player really has nothing to fear from this system unless he allows white to completely dominate the diagonal from f4 to b7 uncontested. Once black has eliminated the troublesome bishop blacks game is pretty much straight forward. Whites game plan usually involves getting a quick kingside attack going before black can counter on the queenside. Its a good opening for white but does incur the risk of leaving the queenside vulnerable. I recommend this book highly, mostly for the class c player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly slanted","review":"The book has some good explanatory text, but for a book that seems to purport to be \\"the\\" book, or something approaching it, it is remarkably unobjective. There are around 30 games in this book - ALL of them wins for White! Give me a break, the London System is a marginal opening at best, and Black's results are not at all bad. \\"The main danger for Black\\", as John Cox so justifiably states in \\"Dealing With d4 Deviations\\" (A MUCH better book), \\"is not equalizing, but trying too hard.\\".I cannot recommend this book; if you want a good d4 deviations book, try the Cox book. Certainly the London System doesn't merit nearly 200 pages..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners.","review":"This book is wonderful for beginner doll makers. It is easy and has a lot of doll patterns that are very easy to make. It starts from the very easy and progresses to more complicated-but not hard-dolls.

No matter how carefully I tried to make the hole into the concrete block, it was always too large. The screw was not tightly placed into the concrete. I avoided using a hammer setting, hoping the holes would be smaller.What was the TAPCON manufacturer thinking? Holes drilled into concrete are not exactly precision rounds.These screws are EXPENSIVE. Now I have to go shopping for a set of tiny masonry bits?update (2 weeks later):My final solution was to use two drill bits. I use an 1/8 bit to make the full-depth hole, and then I use the 5/32 bit but only to a depth of about a 1/2 inch. This works, but requires the use of two drills. Tapcon was supposed to avoid that hassle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good screws","review":"Good solid screws.

The results are exactly like what you'd find in a fine Viennese konditerei. GF flour is typically used to dust pans. And, if you're tired of eating rubbery baked goods, there's no xantham/guar gum in these recipes. I've made about 12 recipes and they are clearly written and easy to follow. Not too many weird/hard to obtain ingredients.

Try one of these and you'll think you were in heaven. I prepare these recipes for company and special events and everyone has enjoyed them. They are truly fine examples of the best European desserts! * Hints* The author calls for grinding the nuts in a hand mill. These are expensive and hard to find. I use a coffee grinder instead and have had no problems. * For celiacs- beware of the instruction to dust the pans with spelt flour--use another GF flour instead. Please yourself and your guests with flavor and style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for low carb dieters, too","review":"I bought this book hoping that I could adjust some of the recipes to use splenda or stevia to substitute for some of the sugar in the recipes, since otherwise, the recipes usually are low enough in total carbohydrate grams to be do-able on even the more restrtictive low-carbohydrate diets. The best luck in terms of lowering the sugar content while still keeping a good flavor and texture involved switching out half the sugar for splenda, and not using stevia at all except in the darkest chocolate of the recipes, where the herbal note of stevia doesn't compete with the other flavors. The sugar is still there, but there's less, and a low-carber can feel like they're not being _completely_ bad, as well as not _completely_ deprived of desserts.Some of the recipes involve higher-carb fruits like bananas, but in general, the use of the nut flours brings most of the recipes (using your food counts book) to within the realm of possibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dairy Free","review":"I am allergic to wheat and choose a vegan diet. I purchased this book due to the summary and fabulous reviews only to find that the title of this book is completely innaccurate. It is NOT dairy free, but instead it is lactose free. Most of the recipies call for at least 4 eggs and often they're separated, which makes it difficult to use egg replacer. The use of nuts is an excellent alternative to flour and I feel that this book is suited to persons with a wheat allergy. However, this book is not suited for those that choose to live dairy free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Reservation","review":"For those who are truly wheat and dairy intolerant, this book is rather a taunt than a solution. It is of little solace for anyone who is allergic to eggs, and many people who are allergic to wheat are also likely to be allergic to nuts. It is a parade of all the delicious things one cannot have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph of the Trouveres. Buy It!","review":"'Songs of the Trouveres' in the 'The Spirits of England and France' series by the Gothic Voices, directed by Christopher Page is one of the better 'early music' recordings I have bought and heard.The Trouveres were wandering performers in France who wrote and performed 'grand chant' songs in the vernacular. In contrast to liturgical and other devotional music, this was the 'soap opera' entertainment of the day, as this genre was all about 'a protracted meditation on the fortunes of loving'.This group features one of the very few 'stars' of early music performances, the soprano Emma Kirkby who only appears on two tracks, accompanied by either percussion or medieval lute.This recording does justice to this series, Gothic Voices, and Hyperion."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Classic!","review":"A true classic by South African pianist Abdullah Ibrahim, who was also known by the name of \\"Dollar Brand\\". This was recorded in New Jersey in 1991 and released on this rather obscure label. Especially notable is the opening track, \\"The Praise Song\\" (subtitled \\"Welcome Home\\").

While this is a difficult novel to read, the story of Latro, an amnesiac mercenary, alternately directed by a series of slaves, masters, prostitutes and kings, is definitely a worthy one. Despite his memory loss, the things that Latro takes for granted are ones that are wholly out of place to the reader, for despite the triteness of sacrifice in Greek times, I imagine we must flinch a little at each, and at the harshness of living conditions.Wolfe doesn't let the reader off the hook either, choosing to translate place names in many cases so that the reader has to think back to ancient history to figure out where he is and where he's going. He uses many alternative names for the gods, so this too can't be taken for granted, but must be considered, so that instead of each god being only a name, you come to see the significance and the history behind each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rendez-View or this review?","review":"Bjork likes them, and that's great.

I have read almost every single one of her books and I have to say that this one could have been better. I felt that the hero did not respect the heroine. He acted like a jerk most of the time and did not deserve her loyalty. I have, however, read this book three times, because it is so very well written. I can just see the castle and hear the wind blowing. I can even forgive her the hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was so dissapointed. I have read one or two Teresa Medeiros books before and found them entertaining. This book was so poorly written that there were times I didn't know who was speaking or whose thoughts I was reading. If I was new to reading I may think it was me. I stopped caring about any of them by chapter 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I have to admit that I was left totally confused after finishing this book. The premise of the plot was promising, unfortunately the characters were not. Gareth was supposed to be this dark and brooding medieval knight with a tortured background to justify his dark character, unfortunately he came off as simply mean and selfish. The things he did to Rowena in the name of revenge was horrible. Rowena was also a confusing character, one minute she was fiesty, then she turned into whimpering girl consumed with lust after a touch, a kiss, or a look from Gareth. I simply don't get the attraction Rowena felt for Gareth. Worst of all, there's not one word of regret from Gareth's mouth to Rowena for all the humiliation and degradation he did to her. Marlys was creepy. All in all, not her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Medeiros' best!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Teresa Medeiros fan. I am constantly on the look out for her books but I'm sorry Teresa, Shadows and Lace did not do it for me. I was actually reading a book where I didn't like the main characters! The heroine was wimpy and the hero was mean. Sigh. If you are reading Teresa Medeiros for the first time, do not start with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"She really writes wonderfully but, she lost me with this novel. The plot is fine and the main characters are well but too much plot twisters that you become dizzy reading it. Simplicity was needed for this story not twists and turns.

You think that after running twice and being caught by Sir Gareth she would try something different for a change.For a main character, she definitely needs more work or brains... Even the supporting characters seem to have more life.Get the book for the other characters and or (if you don't have it already), purchase \\"Heather and Velvet\\" (same Author) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog grooming Body restraint","review":"It is easy to use and easy to set up.

I enjoyed how she put together the Alaska State Trooper and the RCMP for this one. I especially liked that her good guys really felt that the initital \\"bad guy\\" really wasn't bad at all.

Three times I have visited Alaska, and on two of those occasions, I hit the Yukon Territory. This book is especially meaningful for anyone who has been to Dawson City. She has caputured the spirit of that small isolated town so rich in history. And no one writes as well about the dangers of an Arctic winter. This book led me to all her other novels, and I enjoyed them equally as much. I never thought I would find anyone to equal Robert Service in conveying the feel for the frozen North, but Henry has come very close. Perhaps this work will make more of us in the lower forty-eight realize that the Yukon is a place apart from Alaska, with exciting tales and rich culture all its own. Certainly it demonstrates that crime knows no national boundaries, and Henry writes about it equally well on both sides of the line. Mush on Sue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me Away!","review":"I couldnt put this book down. 2nd in Sue Henry's series set in Alaska. A canoeist finds a journal set 100 years in the past of a journey to find gold. He is set upon by the bad guys and the book takes off from there. Alex Jensen and a Canadian Mountie are called in to investigate and work hand in hand to solve this intricate but fascinating plot.Sue Henry writes one good mystery with a little romance thrown in to the mix.

It's classic Second Book Syndrome (throw together a sequel to cash in on the success of the first one). I'm so uninterested in it that I'm only about 2/3 of the way through it, even though I've owned it for months. Most of it is just ruminations about her life (not terribly interesting) and a lot of recipes for things that I have no desire to make (frog's legs, rabbit, sorrel, chestnuts, etc.). The book desperately needed some illustrations, which might've made the recipes seem appealing -- and certainly would have made the scarf-tying directions more worthwhile. What a letdown.

As I had read the first book, this was just more of the same.

It is the equivalent of a BBC epic: Good direction, action, photography, accurate costumes and production values, and at the current Amazon price (under $12), a steal! Grab it, quick. You won't regret it. The story itself, coming from true historic events is much too convoluted to distill here; there are so many characters, it is sometimes difficult to follow.

If you are new to formZ, chances are you won't know enough to work past the errors and get back on track. If you're an experienced user, you won't find anything new in this book. Don't be fooled by the title. There is nothing in the book that covers the new features of version 5.0. There are also files missing from the cd that are needed to complete the project. I contacted STEM to see if I could download the files and it took two weeks to here back from anyone. When they did reply, they assured me that they would send me a disk with the missing files. This was four months ago and I have twice reminded them but received absolutely no response.

It's taken me awhile to write this review because I didn't want to be too completely biased, but if you haven't picked up this album, you should get with the program. From the instant JL asks you to \\"come on and go\\" with him, it's obvious that he means business. This CD is a wake-up call to R&B artists who would rather regurgitate old beats and bad cliches than create original music. When you get the CD, definitely listen to Let's Get Lifted, it's so joyous and uplifting. After that, make sure to checkout Alright, Let's Get Lifted Again, So High and of course both of the singles. I really wanted to give this album 5 stars, but I can NOT STAND Number One with Kanye. It doesn't fit the rest of the album at all!! Skip it and spare yourself if at all possible.

Kanye West is gonna drain his talent like he drains 1980's soul samples, plus from the flow of the album you can tell that legend didn't have any creative control over the project it sounded like two completely different albums 1-7 then 8-14 (the latter would get 4 stars by its self). With the exception of \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"So High\\" you can hang it up. Bland over discussed song topic, bluejeans and an sportscoat shouldn't get you compared to the neo-soul artist who where doing it before it became trendy. Besides I'm sick of wishing someone was like Marvin Gaye or Harlod Melvin, Isaac Hayes etc... They were great but this retro phase has taken its toll lets start loving the artist who come out today for what they contribute not who they remind you of.

Yeah there are songs that liven things up a bit, but the slow ballads and serene piano melodies really take center stage. \\"She Don't Have To Know\\" is a nice highlight track, and \\"Ordinary People\\" shows his vocal dexterity (complete with what sounds like a REAL PIANO). \\"Live It Up\\" has a smooth bass line that sets your soul at ease, while the lead single has been topping charts for the past 2 months or so. (If you don't know the title of this song it's time to come out of that bomb shelter and join the rest of the world...Y2K has come and gone).If you're a fan of true R&B;, and long for the days where missing the forward and back buttons on your CD player didn't matter, then this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEPA knew, now the world knows!

Please support some real talent for once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Legend\\" In The Making","review":"This is truly a stunning debut from the immensely talented John Legend. When I heard his first single \\"Used To Love U\\" I was immediately impressed and took a chance of buying his album after only hearing that song. I was completely blown away by not only his great music, but his very distinctive vocal delivery. He has production form Kanye West (of course), will.i.am (from the Black Eyed Peas), and John himself. Yes, his influences are apparent in the songs, whoever it doesn't come off as him imitating anyone else. His perfect blend of classic soul, hip-hop, Gospel, and r&b is a refreshing change in the scope of today's r&b music. He has sure to be classic songs such as, \\"Ordinary People\\", \\"Stay With You\\", and Refuge (When It's Cold Outside).\\" If you are looking for feel good music with a variety of topics from impefect love to love of family this the cd to buy. Actually regardless of the type of music you like, if you are a lover of great music this is a MUST HAVE CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Lifted by John Legend","review":"After listening to this CD I understand why it got such rave reviews, It posesses all the things a excellent CD has, it talks about real life situtations that most people can relate to, it has phenomonal music, powerful lyrics, and last but not least a powerful and brillant voice behind it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Legend?","review":"This is the first cd of his I bought, and I was disappointed some of the lyrics seemed more mean-spirited and harsh than I expected/they needed to be. One of my favorite r&b (Stevie the Wonder) never utters a harsh word, but can state a negative opinion w/out offending. Maybe it's a maturity issue, either his or mine, I'm not sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Lift\\" Wasn't Working","review":"I read such wonderful reviews, and saw the man on tv but the \\"Lift\\" wasn't working after I purchased it. As another reviewer stated, 'maybe it's just me'. I played it over and over. At home, in my car, at work, and I am not feeling this at all. Guess it's time for me to let it rest an revisit it later on...."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome CD","review":"John brings back the life in music.

And to prove that all you need is a funcky beat, or in this case smooth piano and grooving melody, the American public will buy anything! Its a wolf in sheep's clothing. Posing as neo-soul!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE AT FIRST LISTEN","review":"I haven't not finished the cd as of yet matter of fact I am still listening to it as I type off of windows media player. I must disagree with those who say they dont like the cd because I am really enjoying myself maybe its because he has a unique voice and the beats seem to compliment his voice but whatever the case may be I would have to give this cd 5 stars. If you want to preview it before going to the store to buy it go to your windows media player and type in \\"john legend\\" into the search box and click on \\"john legend artist profile\\" and there should be a like that reads \\"hear cd\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, crap, crap","review":"The only thing that was lifted was this damn CD out of my player. All the hype about John Legend was a waste of pure time. I mean don't get me wrong, Kanye did an excellent job producing (as usual) but this time with the wrong person. Honestly, he has no voice, and the lyrics are whack. If a person feels the need to hear good music of the sort, spend a few dimes on Anthony Hamilton's CD \\"Comin From Where I'm From\\". Now this is a genuine piece of art, but once again in the music game it's who you know and not what you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"another artist playing the piano, THATS GREAT CAUSE HIP HOP & RAP IS TOTALLY CRAP","review":"I'd say this is the male version of Alica Keys. John Legends voice is not all that bad he sounds really nice. One of his songs is a message talking about the problems families go through I saw his music video husband and wife fighting over the kid. I didn't think John Legends cd would have a (Parential Adversiory: Explicit Lyrics) logo on cause his music doesn't sound like he would say a lot of cursing not that I'm complaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great...until the rappers kick in","review":"I may be a bit biased here, because I never really liked rap very much...although I do like it in certain songs. But Kanye West and Snoop Dogg kinda ruin the tracks they're on on \\"Get Lifted.\\" It's not just the fact that it's rap for me, though...it's the fact that the lyrics are just plain stupid. Both songs would sound great without those parts in them; especially \\"I Can Change.\\" I saw John Legend in concert with Alicia Keys, and \\"I Can Change\\" sounded awesome without all that. I think Snoop's lines actually lowered my IQ when I listened to that song on the CD. I dunno, it just breaks up the feeling of the songs, too...the rap parts don't even seem like they fit. They interrupt the mood of the songs and bring the quality of them down a level. But, other than those two things, the album is GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"initially, i was hesitant, as a lot of people are when purchasing a new CD. now that i say that, it seems a little weird. anyways...i truly enjoyed his singles, 'ordinary people' and 'used to love you' so I felt comfortable purchasing his CD. i havent stopped playing it. yes, of course, kanye west is involved in the production of the tracks, and has certainly proven himself in the collaboration with mariah carey in 'stay the night' off her new album. either way, john legend is possession of three things that make an artist: talent(vocal and prolific abilities), confidence, and appeal.some of my favorites are:lets get liftedshe dont have to knowlive it upstay with you(the live version is beautiful but not available on the CD)but to be honest, out of 14 songs, i only skipped two.so in my book, this CD is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! How Awesome Is This?","review":"John Legend is scary talented. He really is a legend. His voice is so jazzy and smooth, especially in Ordinary People (which is amazing.) I look forward to hearing more of his music :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love John's voice","review":"I bought the MP3 album because I love John's voice. Much like the late Marvin Gaye, he really knows how to use his instrument. So of course I love the slower tracks, I like hearing those pipes. Ordinary People is such a beautiful song it moves me to tears. It sounds like a live track, because his voice is rich but you can hear the scratchiness too. His accompanying skills are incredible, the phrasing is perfect, its obvious he's done his homework and studied music for years. Its rare when you have a singer that is so special but there is also a strong technique behind what they're doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Disappointing","review":"I expected more because of all the hype surrounding the CD. OK, the last seven songs are decent, with Ordinary People being exceptional, but that's about it. Vocally, John Legend is kinda weak. Definitely not the best voice I've heard. The first seven songs are pretty shallow and superficial - like much of what's out there in the R & B music world today with very little exception. Maybe he included them to appeal to a broader audience. Too bad. If you like spending your hard-earned money to listen to only half a CD, then buy it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Were just Ordinary People who need to buy this!","review":"John Legend got me attention with Used to Love you but slow jam Ordinary People made me cop this (for 9$ at Walmart) quickly. I have to say I was blown away by this man's talent. Many people have slept on this album. It does have a Neo soul groove to it but its sexy, soulful, and inspiring what R&B; cats have been failing to realize you dont have to have club bangers to sell records.Alright, Used to love you, She dont have to know, Ordinary People, I can change, and Stay with you are joints you should listen to.Lets get lifted again is pure love making at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"small town music lover","review":"I listened to a few of John Legend's songs on Pandora internet radio. I thought about downloading some to I tunes but decided to order the whole album. I live in a small town with only a Wal-Mart and a grocery store, so limited exposure to other types of music, not just country. Country is ok, but sometimes you want to hear about good things, not broken relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius, At Last!!!","review":"There is finally someone willing to step up and help fill the R&B; void that has only been half filled by Alicia Keys. Thank you John Legend. Anyone who thinks that this is \\"wanna-be gangsta?\\" music has to be completely out of their mind. This is R&B.; This album is genius. John Legend goes beyond anything his peers have done. He stands alone as one of the true R&B; creators of his time. His music is like magic and his voice is bold and elegant. Some of these people writing reviews either don't want to hear good music, or just don't want John Legend to be successful. Either way, they should be embarrassed to type in a single word.Standout Tracks:Let's Get LiftedI Can ChangeOrdinary PeopleStay With YouSo HighLive It Up"},{"rating":"2","title":"I chose well","review":"I haven't purchased a CD since the Black Album, and before that, probably not since the year before that...All I can say is I chose a good one to go out and buy.

And I heard a interview with john legend and he is talking about doing acting and I'am like why is he going to mess up a movie like that. I wonder what is a real producer these days and where is the music because this is a perfect reason why the industry is all sold out with some lame hook or song.

What a great purchase! The creativity and musicianship on this album are stellar. Legend has created an album that crosses over the normal boundaries of Soul R&B, reminding me a lot of Hill's MISEDUCATION in terms of originality, quality, and overall mood. Certainly an album worth buying and I look forward to his upcoming sophomore release."},{"rating":"2","title":"john legend","review":"the last time i got this excited about a new artist was hearing norah jones for the first time while sitting in barnes and nobles...maybe even more excited this time around.this guy is SO talented. what a fresh new sound, r&b; w/jazz w/classic w/gospel- & his voice is amazing...understatedly talented in such a casual manner. i love it!the only thing sad is that it took until his grammy nomination to find out about him. i hope he'll take home the grammy's this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Lifted By a TaLented Pianst//Singer","review":"Not only a Pianist, but John Legend has a beautiful voice!

He's the male version of Alicia Keys and you just gotta love that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to cd collection","review":"This has been one of my best CD purchases this year. Some of the topics he sings about aren't anything I can relate to (e.g.cheating), but nevertheless, it sounds good. The \\"Used to love U\\" song is my favorite. It's fun and angry at the same time. Overall there are many good songs on one CD. John Legend has a distinctive voice. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying","review":"When I first heard \\"Used to Love U\\", I liked the song, but it wasn't enough to make me run out and buy the CD. Then \\"Ordinary People\\" came out. That was it! That one song compelled me to buy the CD. I wasn't disappointed. I love the production work on most of the songs and the fact he plays the piano. My favorites in addition to the Ordinary People and Used to Love U are Number One, Stay with You, She Don't Have To Know and Let's Get Lifted Again. He mixes the hip-hop beats, old classics sound in his music. He includes songs that are about infidelity and but also about relationships and staying together. I didn't give it 5 stars because of Alright and I Can Change are my least favorites. I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg and he's featured on I Can Change. But the song just doesn't flow right to me. The CD is good and I'll be looking for his second CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This product came way before sheduled time. I got it used but you would never know that it was used.

(sorry! just stating my opinion) i can tell by the reviews a lot of people don't agree with me. i bought this cd when it first came out for regular price, i originally bought it strictly for the track \\"ordinary people\\" then i took a listen to the rest of the cd, and i must say i was very disspointed. a few months later this same cd went on sale for $9.99 and i can't even say that i would pay that price.for a good listen i think you should invest in anthony hamilton or dwele. thanks guys!!! don't hate me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you very much","review":"I've been looking for an artist like this many years.

Beth's story turned out to be even more touching.I may be a long way off from finding second love since I haven't even found first love but all the same, I related to the fear and at the same time, exhilaration, felt by both Beth and Todd at finding each other.

And perhaps more importantly, why not.The book also gave me the confidence to experiment with some of the basic recipes.

(I cannot understand how other reviewers can give these books 5 out of 5 stars. What in the world would they rate really good literature? And WHY do they feel compelled to tell the entire plot?) I got a little tired of hearing about the selfless sacrifices of these three women by the end of the last book. Let's face it, when they come from one of the wealthiest families in the country, how sorry can we feel for them if they have to sell their clothes or work two part-time jobs in order to pay the house staff? But all in all, enjoyable books and likeable characters. Unless you have a lot of free time, I would suggest checking out the audio versions from your local library. These are good books to listen to while commuting, cleaning house, etc., because there are few characters and the plots are very simple to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational","review":"I must have read almost every Roberts and each one is more captivating than the next. In this concluding trilogy, Laura teaches you a lot about being a good daughter, friend, mother and of course a Woman. The last is taught to her by Micheal, who is a wonderful, worldly man but yet from the inside, insecure. He has had so many letdowns in life and Laura teaches him to love. A meeting of two desperate souls looking for an everlasting love.

However, when the jacket arrived the sleeves were too long, the shoulders drooped, and the overall fit was too large. After trying it on only twice, we noticed that the wool around the collar was balling up which made it look old and frumpy. Also, the weight of the jacket was too heavy and bulky for regular use. I contacted the company via e-mail and was informed that the return would be at my expense (which was over $13.00) and I was to be charged a 15% restocking fee. Needless to say, I will never do business with this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Compliments, No Problems","review":"I got exactly what I was expecting (hoping for).

Before opening the shrinkwrap I surmised that I had received a CD version, but was surprised to find a very thin, very spartan publication.

After contacting Amazon, I was told that I would need to contact the seller but what they could do is give feedback to the catalog department. Why would I contact the seller when Amazon is the one with the wrong photo on the website. Not to mention, I ordered 50.00 worth of pinata fillers and I can't even get 1/4 of the bag in the backpack of the pinata.

Fans of modernism may rejoice, but the average reader may not like Cela's distinctive style. The book succeeds only in disgusting its readers. I read this in an International Novel course and can honestly say, it was the least favorite book among the majority of students. The guys seemed to like it, but that could be because of the explicit sex or the perverse sense of humor. Many female readers felt that Cela was being extremely negative towards the female characters in the book. (The major female characters include a prostitute and a mentally unstable woman).

Until, that is, Shane and Greta's mothers hatched a matchmaking scheme that landed the two together in bed!

My personal favorites this time around are \\"I Don't Mind\\"(the most radio-friendly cut) and the scorching fast number \\"Don't Touch Me\\". But it's almost impossible to single out individual songs over the others because this whole record is so good! And to top it all off, seeing the band live is an amazing experience as well. This band is really at the top of their game, and we in South Carolina(CLETUS' home state) really hope this record brings them all the attention they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid, great construction, lots of room, though a smaller case may be a better choice....","review":"This case is very well made, lots of room and compartments to carry batteries, filters, etc. However, the case is not \\"Micro\\" as the name would suggest. It's quite hefty and a little over-sized to carry just a power zoom camera, such as the Canon SX10 which I own. This case is big enough to fit the SX10 and an external flash unit, for example, though this bag is really not quite big enough for a full size DSLR. As for ease of use, this case has a kind of flap on the inside of the lid that needs to be wiggled into position every time in order to close the zipper -- not so well-designed (great weather-proofing, but clunky to use). So, if you need to carry just the camera, and extra batteries and card, I highly recommend the Case Logic DCB-66, which I also own. That thing is just the right size and has a much more practical design (see my review for that product)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting out","review":"What can I add that hasn't already been said earlier?If you can get the book and the dvd.

When she sticks to her turf of big city crime, there are few in her league, though her novels have been pretty much an on again, off again proposition.But in Garden of Evil, Buchanan decides she wants to join the James W. Hall and Carl Hiassen school of whacked out Florida Palm Noir crime novels, and falls flat. The story is ludicrous, and the killer is stupid, yet manages to outsmart-- not to mention outshoot and out drive the whole of Florida law enforcement. Especially irritating is Buchanan's awful cracker dialect she gives any character with a Southern accent.She also turns Brit Montero into a passive, whimpering wimp this time out, making her almost inconsequencial to the capture of the killer. Buchanan is a good writer, but this is a complete failure, despite the occasional insighful paragraph or anecdote here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme disappointment after reading this one.","review":"As an Edna Buchanan and Britt Montero fan I was filled with immense disappointment after reading this one. \\"Garden of Evil\\" required more suspension of disbelief than I am capable of. And, Britt's photographer friend at \\"The News\\" has become one very annoying character. James Lee Burke and Clive Cussler have proven that a continuing character can get stale and become a parody of itself. It may be time for Edna Buchanan to give Britt a rest and during the pause give us a new protagonist. Then Britt can return refreshed, much like James Robicheaux and Dirk Pitt have after interludes by their authors. Michale Connelly has broken up his Harry Bosch series three times, and that certainly looks like the right way to keep a character vibrant. Edna Buchanan has given us much much better about Miami (and Britt) and is capable of so much more.

We are led to belive throughout the novel that Charles truly adored his first \\"wife\\" and she was cast aside because of politics. The contents of the book have been denounced as historically inaccurate, however, that is insignifigant to the wonderful story-telling talents of Elizabeth Goudge. As an avid reader of historical facts and historical fiction, \\"The Child from the Sea\\" is the most well written account of a time long gone by. Truly, 'The Child From the Sea\\" is a novel that moves your heart while giving the reader a full account of life in 17th century London. You cannot afford to miss this one if you can find it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One the best novels I ever read, hands down","review":"It is diffcult for a book to bring tears to my eyes, but this one did. It's extremely moving & powerful - the love story of a young Charles II of England and Lucy Walter. I recommend it highly for those who want a tender love story (without smut) and to those who just want to read an excellent historical novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great!","review":"This worked really well, cutting the dough like it was butter (which it mostly was, ha ha!) I barely had to push down at all, so the comfort grip wasn't even as necessary as it would have been on a cutter that didn't cut very well. The comfort grip was a great feature, though, making it a very pleasant cutter to use. This cutter is tough, too, as it survived abduction by my Play-Dough playin' preschoolers. I only wish the cutter had been about an inch smaller, as I didn't get the yield I needed from two batches and had to make a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's this?

Even the piece of cardboard it was wired to wasn't that big. What's the problem? Is someone is China trying to convert from 2.54cm to one inch? Is conversion too hard?

It's definitely not as \\"rocking\\" as the Cult, but there are plenty of guitar riffs and heavy rythms to satisfy most Cult fans and rock fans in general. In short, this CD is great, as long as you aren't expecting to hear the classic Cult style. Actually, I would say this CD is to Cult releases as Alice in Chains' \\"Jar of Flies\\" was to \\"Dirt\\".

It is billed as that and it is far from that. It reminded me of the movie clue with everyone's secrets and in the end there is someone that are dead. This is more like a soap opera with all of the \\"stories\\" that people are holding. It is a very odd movie.

Because of Wubbzy we have been hearing about bird watching slumber parties. She takes the binoculars outside and begs us to allow her to have a slumber party with her friends so she can tell them all about the birds.What my kids love the most about Wubbzy is the colors and cute characters. What I love most is the life lessons they receive in a fun, educational way.

If the intent was to show that Asian parental expectations are high this movie provided no thoughtful insight and if suicide is the result of expectation pressure then the movie leaves me with \\"who cares\\".The acting was bland and the directing/cinematography was basically stand 5 meters away and just film.Two hours afterwards, little is remembered.

Although there are only three tracks \\"from the vaults\\" (a fuzzily recorded alternate take of \\"Nubian Sundance\\", an alternate version of the Miles Davis staple \\"Directions\\" and a remix of the funky \\"125th Street Congress\\"), this box set still serves as an excellent overview of an important band. Tracks from all Weather Report albums are represented here except for the weak 1986 album \\"THIS IS THIS\\" (good move).

This is one of the best - accurate, well researched and documented, well-written, interesting, and factual. This book is a good balance of some of the worst and best history of that time period. Slavery was one of the worst practices of our history. Many cultures have practiced slavery, including enslaving some of their own members; nothing makes it right. This book documents some of Lincoln's struggles as he strived to end slavery in America. As we know, his efforts cost him his life.

Today he would be known as a war criminal. The Emancipation Proclamation was a effort to cause more misfortune to the south. It is unfortunate today that Lincoln is known as the great statesman that freed the slaves through his Emancipation Proclamation speech. He was a known segregationalist and stated that the two races equally free can not and will not live under the same form of a so-called representative government. He is widely known for his belief that extraditing the negroes back to Africa or the Caribbean was an agenda he would implement. The million dollar question is was he saying these things to garner votes, being the politician he was- or was he stating something he really felt in his soul and wished to act upon! The Emancipation proclamation should be visited with the same caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I bought this CD on speculation.

She is a very flexible girl but with her family having little money, she had to give up ballet, and her grandmother not liking her, I would go crazy.She really should have stood up for herself.The book seemed to be better because Robin had three very good friends and her parents did everything they could do for her.

Same players, vocalists, and producers. It is also closely related to the group Southern Exposure-- only the vocalists differ. This album was originally released in 1978 and features the Duncan Sisters on vocals. Despite the cheesy cover photo (a trademark of the projects coming out of Three Hats Productions), this album is the strongest of all of these acts. The songwriting is more polished, the arrangements more sophisticated, the singing more soulful. The sisters Duncan acquit themselves very well, with choral-style vocal arrangements. The project feels remarkably like soulful New York disco. Although the Rose Royce-esque \\"Party Song\\" was the track that made a small dent on the Disco Top 40 charts, \\"Wastin' My Love\\" and \\"Takin' A Chance\\" are even better, bringing to mind the group Change with a bit more attitude.

The first song, \\"Bay Area,\\" is coo Bcuz it's a spin off of Tupac's song, \\"Ambitions of a Rider.\\" But almost ever subsequent song had weak beats. That is bizzare Bcuz Killa Tay can produce, check out the album \\"Dosia,\\" (w/ Lunasick & KJ) on AWOL records, now that is Gangsta.

There are plenty of B&W; photos, line drawings and explainations of the varients.There are plenty of statistics about sizes of the different models, numbers manufactured and some of the pro's/con's of each vehicle.

The setup is fairly easy and the operation is easy for all the information it gives. I would be more user friendly to only have to step on the scale, but I think it's worthwhile to have it store your information.

Messiaen, Fuleihan, Varese, among others, have writen pieces using this instrument, either solo in groups of other instruments, or several in orchestral groups, great though these compositions be, the solo Rockmore with her sister, Nadia Reisenstein performances still are the 'bench marks' of what can be done on and with a theremin and should be heard more. The 1940s Rockmore performance of the Fuleihan 'Concerto for Theremin', with Stokowski, and also the premiere recording of the Varese 'Ionisation', conducted by it dedicatee, Nicolas Slonymski in 1933 are great recordings of historical importance on the same cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandaughter Loves the Shoes","review":"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandaughter, she loves them.

He emphasizes the differences between media coverage of WWII and WWI, and outlines the roles of all the major media titans of the day, including the Office of War Information, FDR, and Hollywood to name a few. How did the government address social issues of the day through the pictures it distributed of WWII? Was the Office of War Information filled with pencil-pushing bureaucrats or socially conscious liberals with an envelope-pushing agenda? Roeder answers these questions and more in a style that is accessible for academics and amateurs alike. Each chapter is followed by a photo essay with censored and uncensored pics with descriptions. The effect... captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Success","review":"I was disappointed that the Titanium Discs did not work for me.

THE WORLD NEEDS IT! Umm... yes. The Sonata is far above that of Reach, Smith, or even Lewenthal, and the Sonatina, more crisp than I have ever encountered. Hameiln's playing is also more energetic than that of his debut Alkan recording, the Concerto, and the sound quality is MUCH better. His playing of 'Festin' is great.

And ''Yard Sale'' is about the most heartbreaking story song I've ever heard. I see he's written even more songs.

They had much thicker padding and perhaps in comparison, these fall short. However, these do look great...and are washable. They claim the leather won't shrink in the dryer either, lets hope not. There is a tag on the inside which irritates the wrist at times. Pulling it off would probably destroy the stiching and diminish the integrity of the glove, so i'll just leave it.

Yes, the gloves are small and do pinch at first, but after about a week's worth of wear at the gym they fit perfectly. There's no reason to order one size too big, because if you do you run the risk of them being too loose, which would cause them to rub and cause blisters, which is the whole point of buying them in the first place!Buy these gloves in the right size, and if you have more patience than a preschooler you'll love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"had to return them","review":"I've used Harbinger gloves in the past, and recently got these.

I have average hands and ordered size L - yet they were very tight still - difficult to put on and even more pain to take off later (had to pull off each finger separately).

Nevertheless the price was right on Amazon so I took the plunge only to find out that the size wasn't ideal. I'm somewhere between a L and an XL, but the way these gloves were made I don't think either would have fit me quite right. The gloves look ok, but there was some strange sewing/fabric near the fingers that just irritated me enough to not want to wear them when lifting. Ever since my wife made me start lifting with gloves to avoid those manly callouses I can't lift without them, but I much prefer the Nike strength gloves which are made of a much thinner fabric and have a zipper to close as opposed to irritating velcro."},{"rating":"1","title":"tight","review":"I wanted an xx large as i had tried an x large that was too tight.

Coming from a crappier Harbinger glove as my last pair, these are a much nicer improvement. They feel solid and well padded, yet flexible enough to not be annoying.I'm giving them 4 stars out of 5 for two reasons:1. They are a bit tight in the fingers, despite being a good fit for the rest of my hand. They shouldn't be making gloves for pansy fingers.2.

The author apparently isn't too familiar with slang because the main word that is used is just \\"yo\\", and it is used beyond the point of annoyance. Not to mention that any other slang used by the characters was poorly written. Also, the author tried to incorporate some climactic changes in the plot, but there were just way too many and not enough explanation as to the outcome/acceptance of each by the main characters.

The author definitely seemed to be trying too hard to portray a \\"ghetto\\" that he obviously never lived in or visited. The slang was corny.

THE ART OF MURDER fails this test, as it trots out a hoary adultery/ murder set-up and then drags its feet through every convention associated with such melodramas.I bought THE ART OF MURDER because Michael Moriarity has appeared in so few products after he walked off LAW AND ORDER. His voice in this more recent effort suggests perhaps a bout of throat surgery.

It is based upon the Buddhist Scriptures found in Tun Huang, a part of the silk road path. Inoue tells the story of how these scriptures were placed there in the first place. The story has very little to do with Buddhism or religion. It is more of an adventure novel with a scholar as its hero. Well written and evenly paced, it takes the reader back to a time when there were magnificent battles in Asia. After you read this book, rent the video. Unfortunately, the American version of the video is chopped up so that the story is not really comprehensible. However, if you've read the book, you may be able to appreciate the movie a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating work of historical fiction","review":"A deep, moving work about an area of history unknown to me. An 11th century Chinese academic risks life and limb on the borders of the Chinese Empire out of curiousity about an enemy's language. His adventures as a soldier, scholar and lover of a Uighur princess are all a prelude to his acceptance of Buddhism.His gift to history (the historic basis for the novel) is hiding thousands of rare Buddhist Sutras in the caves at Tun-Huang, where they were to reside for more than 9 centuries. Their discovery helped scholars to understand not only early Buddhism but also language and history from a forgotten era.The translation is a bit stilted (a normal feature with Asian translations, I find) but the story comes through.

Even the trial proceedings are so counter to what a real trial is like -- thanks to modern legal drama and jury duty, I have some familiarity with what lawyers really do in a courtroom -- that it doesn't add any balance to the film.If you're nostalgic for the fashions and the hairstyles and the wooden writing of the 80s, this film is for you.

It was far too long and when I enquired locally as to how much it would cost to have it made smaller it was almost as much as the cost of the belt. I suppose I should have realised from the orignial cost that the quality wouldn't be very good but it was very cheap and nasty.

I thought it was just the rash until the next diaper change proved to make the rash WORSE! My poor lil girl had the worst red rash and screamed until I realized that it was the cream.

My 2 year old niece on the other hand is able to verbally communicate pain and I felt horrible when I realized that this cream made her immediately cry out in pain and start yelling \\"Ow\\" like I've never heard before.

It also is ok to use with cloth diapers and is all natural.

This album is the reason I now listen to the music i do (FATA, Atreyu, Poison The Well, Suicide File, Unearth, The Crown, Converge, I Could go on all day with this but i won't). If you are thinking of buying a hardcore punk album this should be one of the top choices because it opens you up to so many other bands. Tracks such as \\"Youth and Its Burden\\", \\"Fragile\\", and \\"Liars Parde\\" are what make you want to jump against the walls and headbang till there's no tommorow. I would recommend this album, a materpiece, to anyone who likes the following: Converge, Unearth, The Suicide File, From Autumn To Ashes, Good Riddance, Atreyu, Bane, American Nightmare, A Static Lullaby, Avenged Sevenfold, Cave In, Poison The Well, Strike Anywhere, Killswitch Engage, Kid Dynamite, Kill Your Idols, Over My Dead Body, The Unseen, A global threat, and many other diverse hardcore bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"All I know is I am really offended someone just compared Hope Con to Atreyu and From Autumn To Ashes.

But while the environments are up to par, the opposition is very unimpressive. On each level, all the baddies look, fight, and die the same.

The sad a part is there is not that much variety in what bad guys you can shoot, Ocassionally you had to get stuff and push a button, but mostly you shoot the bad guy.

I just want to finish it.After playing through the single-player game, I'll be trying out the multiplayer games. The only new one I see is Demolition.

Herbert is one of those authors who likes to keep the scary things not fully seen, which is great for enhancing the reader response to the scare, but a bit out of place in this book where the point is wanting to see what's in the fog. I felt frustrated while I was reading. The reader desperately wants glimpses into the fog, but Herbert really doesn't deliver.Not a bad book. This is a decently enjoyable horror read, but probably not as frightening as it could be. I give it 3 stars in terms of scariness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop reading","review":"I'm no huge fan of horror (yet...) but I really enjoyed this book.

I read the most recent version of this story, which the writer admitted to needing touched up. Although the raw story was powerful enough when initially published to create a storm of controversy over its excessive use of violence, it is no worse now than the evening news. The true horror lies not in the gore that permeates the book from cover to cover, but in the idea that the story is not entirely unrealistic. James Herbert could teach a few of his contemporaries across the Atlantic just how to build tension within a few hundred pages. This book bites from the word go, and doesn't let go. I would advise anybody with some spare time to read this book, just make sure that you don't have anything else to do for the next few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of retro bloody fun!","review":"More like a 3.5 though. After the Rats trilogy this was a great follow up. Herbert does a great job setting up the story and throwing his characters into very creepy dark places.I'm really glad I discovered Herbert, decades after watching Deadly Eyes, I find out that it was based on a pretty popular book. No, a whole trilogy! So if you dug The Rats I definitely recommend The Fog. (Also if you really enjoy early Stephen King.)Not much I can complain about. The story shows it's age but not badly and sure there is kind of a formula to the setups but I'm not complaining.

You get everything you need to set grommets, and the quality of the materials is not bad at all. The set includes 48 brass grommets, a punch, block of wood (to use the punch on) and a setting tool (similar to a dap). It takes only a couple of minutes to punch and set, and they are nicely finished when done.The punch leaves a bit to be desired, leaving holes not entirely punched, or a bit jagged, but those imperfections are covered by the grommet, so it is not a very big deal. The one other issue I had was removing the grommet from the setting tool. I needed to pry it off with a butter knife as it was pretty well stuck after hammering. It did come off, but the process was a little less than elegant. The setting tool and block are both solid and look like they will last quite a while.

Merry's character, a Sconset police detective is different than the usual hard edged policewomen that I read about. She has a feminine side, makes mistakes, and has a life (at least on weekends) aside from her police work. The other characters in this story, her father, grandfather, boyfriend Peter, the townspeople, victims, suspects and FBI agents are also well written and provide just the right mix for a great book. My only problem was that it was easy to guess who perpetrated the crime. I like to be surprised and I wasn't. I did run right out though, when I finished it, and purchased Death In A Cold Heard Light. I also tried to find her two earlier books that are alluded to in the story, but found that they are out of print-I ordered them anyway and am crossing my fingers that I eventually get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner from Mathews","review":"This series is set on Nantucket Island and the author is skilled at capturing the ambience of island life so much so that you may find yourself thinking about packing your bags. In this outing, a skeleton is found buried on the beach. Detective Merry Folger takes this as a personal affront since it's her territory and dead bodies, even if they are old, shouldn't be turning up on her beaches. The only thing the crime lab can tell Merry is that the skeleton is a woman who was strangled between two and ten years earlier. Not much to go on, but something. This series is as cozy as they come and deserves a wide audience of cozy readers. Suprisingly, non-cozy lovers can enjoy this series because it is also an excellent procedural - especially since Merry doesn't have access to many experts like city cops do, and must solve the crimes on her island with brains and deduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite toys!","review":"I have this plane and I can say that it is G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S!!!

I didn't need the workbook. There are excellent components of the workbook also - some of the thought-provoking questions were helpful in deepening my understanding. I read the workbook and did the exercises, reviewing some in an NVC group. I feel disapointed because the book was more of a review than I expected it to be. I would like to see another workbook that has more exercises to develop greater skill in the NVC techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empowering","review":"Interesting methods for group cooperation.

The ball is so light weight my child had a tendency to be able to throw the ball down the alley instead of roll it and she is only 5 years old. The worst part is that the ball return did not work at all. I exchanged the toy 3 times and the ball return never worked consistently or properly. I would not recommend purchasing this toy at all.

I bought this game 2 years ago and it has been used ONE time! The set up wasn't too bad(although it took some time). My then 13 year old nephew did it! However, our house just isn't big enough to keep it set up. When I purchased it I wrongly assumed that the manufacturer would make a SEVEN FOOT game storeable! Boy was I wrong! With a 7 and 4 year old, who have an attention span of roughly 10 minutes, it never seemed worth it to re-assemble.So, if you have a lot of space to fill this really is a fun game.

Finally, nine years later and I've replaced it. Upon rereading portions of it, some of the essays seem dated, if not altogether strained. Be that as it may, this is still a marvelous collection of thoughts and images that attempts to cast new light on some modernity's favored children and dust off a few of it's more neglected relations.

However, I think $16.99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice.

After letting it air dry, I got rid of the condensation. Knowing that I had just voided the dodgy warranty on a cheap watch by opening the case back, I used this as my tinkering watch to learn how to adjust automatic movements.

With their delightful melodies and emotionally expressive harmonies of the piano accompaniments grafted to texts by Shakespeare, Jonson,Shelley,Tennyson,Stevenson, and others, these songs are true comfort music -- all the more so as sung by the warm and sensitive lyric tenor of John Mark Ainsley. Just when you think Quilter couldn't possibly write a more beautiful and affecting song, wonders continue to follow wonders with each successive selection. The beauty of this music is truly addictive, and I never seem to tire of this CD. The more I listen, the more enchanted I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way Liszt lives","review":"Marc-André Hamelin once again shows us how Liszt should be tackled with his superhuman piano technique. This is the technique that enables Liszt's music to be respected among the people of classical music world. He plays so gently, but relentlessly at the same time that allows him to give the piano what it really deserves.Look carefully at his interpretation of \\"13th Hungarian Rhapsody\\", the way he divides the piece into two completely different parts. \\"Un Sospiro\\", then. Having given a Liszt recital early this year (playing this piece), I almost cried when I first heard him play it. The beauty, the \\"sigh\\" effect.

I must say that even though they are uncomparably fantastic live, this album demonstrates the range and diversity of Eddie from Ohio. \\"Oh My Brother\\" is a particular favorite with Julie Murphy Wells displaying her amazing range and beautiful voice, and Robbie Schaffer's talent for emoting the absolute best of a heartwrenching situation. If this song doesn't touch your heart, you have no appreciation for music.

No luck on either account. I found the songwriting... insipid. (Sorry!) They had the quality of a couple of relatively good college-age dudes hacking around on guitar and writing songs. They were \\"good\\", but that's all. Not great. \\"Mistress Snow and Mary Jane Green\\" successfully incorporates a number of different drug references, but it sounds like it was written by someone who never actually \\"did\\" drugs, they just heard about it secondhand. (As if I wrote a rap about keepin in real in da hood - NOT!) \\"Jupiter\\" was similar... sounded like the best effort of a hipster at SUNY-Plattsburg.

I spent about a week studying pretty much non stop and I passed the exam with no problems the first time I took it. The CD is a great asset many of the questions are VERY similar to the questions on the actual exam. There are some errors with the practice questions for example some of the images were not the ones referenced in the questions but over all this is a great study aid.

Other than that, this is a good speaker value for the price if you don't require any customer service. I would have rated these speakers 4 stars if not for the apparant incompetance of Sima. I have a problem with one of these speakers which may or may not be a defect, but SIMA CUSTOMER SERVICE DOES NOT APPEAR TO EXIST. Repeated e-mails and phone calls have gone unanswered and unreturned. As much as I felt these speakers are a decent value, I can not purchase any more products from Sima since they seem to be a company which runs and hides from customers who call for service.

Born in 1895, he was not recorded until 1960, after which he cut a number of albums for Arhoolie. He was a great guitarist with an enormous repertoire, from childrens' songs through popular dance tunes to hard Texas blues numbers, and his recordings should be in the collection of any blues fan.However, this 1964 album should be avoided. The main drawback is the dire sound quality - an excessively echoey acoustic (which makes the album sound as if it was recorded inside a grain silo) plus a harshness alien to Lipscomb's style.All these tracks were recorded by Lipscomb elsewhere, and any of the Arhoolie albums are far preferable to this CD.

The pocket at the bottom is a fantastic idea, often preventing a juice/soup/cereal spill from running into her pants or onto the floor. They come in a variety of styles, and we have found the sleeveless cut to be the most versatile over a variety of ages, from 6 months to roughly 24 months.

I get lost in his world when I read his stories, and I have read every single one he has written. Harry Bosch (his battered, worldly cop, who is the main character of this book and many of his others) is more fascinating because of his imperfections and the secondary characters are equally captivating. The action is so clearly a result of the personalities involved, making the plot organic and plot twists both surprising and logical.

His first day back, Harry and Kiz, get a DNA hit on one of their cases involving the murder of a 16-year- old bi-racial girl. The DNA belongs to a man formerly involved in a white supremacy group and things start to look as if this might have been a hate crime. Harry's nemesis, Irvin Irving, is just hoping and praying that Harry will make a mistake. Although Bosch discovers his skills are a little rusty, he manages to wipe off the dust and find the girl's killer. The Bosch with a badge that Connelly fans know and love is back and is as good as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT READ!","review":"I found The Closers to be one of Michael Connelly's finest writings.

Yet I can't help but think that Connelly fears the same criticism from his readers. Bosch successfully redeems himself by book's end, but I'm not sure that Connelly does.The Closers is something of a retread. It covers old familiar ground. Bosch is paired up with Kiz Rider - again. He has a less than forthright relationship with her - again. He works on a case with high jingo - again. The case keeps reminding him of his daughter - again. Half the book's a red herring - again.

He used to be the master of the unexpected plot twist(s) at the end. His books have, unfortunatley, gone progressively downhill. His latest, \\"The Closers,\\" shows that he finally has lost his touch. It clunks along with thin characters and stiff writing. The dialog usually is pathetic- if he didn't label who was speaking, you couldn't tell them apart, as all of the dialog is stiff and uninteresting. He seems to think that all cops talk like Jack Webb - and all the rest of us do, too. The plot is, at best, so-so. None of the characters is remotely likable. Harry Bosch comes off as gloomy and guilty about everything - just neurotic, not very interesting. If I wasn't a fan from his earlier books, I couldn't have finished this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle age doldrums?","review":"Maybe Harry is just mellowing in middle age, but I really didn't care much for this at all.

As they delve into the case, placed on the front burner by new D.N.A. evidence, lots of details are uncovered. Harry finds himself waist deep in a conspiracy that reaches the upper regions of the L.A.P.D.While delighted that Harry is back on the force, I found the first part of the book to drag. It eventually rallies, but I have hopes that the next book finds it pace earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Bosch novel","review":"I've read all of Connelley's novels and have greatly enjoyed almost all of them. The Narrows is an excellent police procedural and one of the better written mysteries I've read in some time. The case in question is engaging and interesting and unfolds at a good pace.

This novel had me mesmerized from the beginning and I found it hard to put down. Connelly does not waste words, pages or sentences. Everything he writes matters. One of the things I really enjoyed about this book is that the main character, Harry Bosch, is in every scene. There is no flashing back and forth from chapter to chapter (killer to cop and back, etc.) I found this really helped with the pacing of the book and kept me enthralled the entire time. If you have read Connelly before this is a must read. If you have never read him, this is a great place to start. Connelly is poetic in a non-literary way and after this novel is now classified as one of my favorite authors.

First up is a 17 year old murder that was never solved, but DNA evidence has moved the case to the top of the pile. But nothing is as easy as it first seems, and this case is no different. I guess I hold Connelly to a higher standard than most because I know how tremendously talented he is, but while this is a very good book and an enjoyable read, it's just not his best.

Most readers will probably figure out who the villain is within the first hundred pages. After that, they'll be stuck slogging through another 300-plus pages in this half-baked mystery. A few novels ago, both Harry Bosch and author Michael Connelly were at the top of their games. In THE CLOSERS though, Bosch seems senile and Connelly seems to have lost his edge. However, do not abandon all hope ye who enter here. Even though THE CLOSERS was a major disappointment, I'm confident that Connelly can get back on track with his next Bosch novel. In the next one, hopefully he'll jettison Kiz Rider from the storyline. She is, was, and will always be ballast in these tales.

When it does mention specific classes, it rarely lists all of their methods in a convenient and easy to read format. Instead, you have to look at the example code and hope there is some type of matching method that may be useful.It is also missing very important and useful classes such as the DateTime class.If you strictly want a book that maps basic C++ operations to C#, then this may be for you.

Good guys were Good, badguys were very Bad. The idea of a villain being primarily a censor was a good idea but the author didn't have to throw in incest, felony, cruelty and evil into his figure; that way he becomes just another cardboard villain. Most censors are decent but slightly narrow-minded citizens who see a legitimate danger but go the wrong way or too far in trying to curb it.

I was unpleasently surprised when I discovered it had very few exercises for the beginner. This book seems to be geared for the person that has a few art classes under their belt, and would like to improve their artwork. This book seems too advanced for the beginner who has trouble drawing simple items, like myself. It has very few pointers, and techniques. It does not break down the sketches to show how to achieve them, it is simply a book of finished sketches, with minimal teaching (such as the vanishing point)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY UNINSPIRING AND DULL","review":"The sketches given as examples are of very poor quality, the selection of themes is random and unorganized, nothing is explained to the fullest, instruction is vague, + there is no tips on composition.In short: another of these books that go step 1), step 2) and poof the drawing is finished without the instructor spelling out steps 3,4,5,6.The selection of drawing subjects is extremely restrictive or the author just lacked inspiration; it's just draw a little of this, than a little of that, with no finishing techniques and no idea on how to group the objects.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEYThere are plenty of better books, such as from Ernest Watson, Ferdinand Petrie, Wendon Blake and more (even if those guys are oldies; they remain goodies)"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute but uncomfortable","review":"this item serves it's purpose as a toe ring, but the edges are bit sharp and pinch my toe when i walk no matter which way i try to wear it or fit it. i'm used to the pinching by now, so i wear it anyhow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is truly a very good book.

It is difficult to definitively describe his music: perhaps a bit of Rachmaninov and Debussy, a dash of Ravel and a hit of Chopin and Beethoven. At any rate, these are the composers that came to mind as I listened. But there also is the missing ingredient of York Bowen himself, for although his music may recall other composers his own way of writing is present.Bowen was a fabulous pianist and it shows in these pieces covering various periods in his career and forms. The disc holds a selection of Preludes, a Ballade, a Toccata, a Moto Perpetuo and a Sonata. Stephan Hough plays beautifully and the recorded is balanced and clear. The notes are excellent in providing a look at the life of York Bowen and the background of the pieces on this disc. I knew about this CD but had not gotten around to buying it until recently. My advice is not to wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little-known, exquisite music performed flawlessly.","review":"Few people have ever heard of the British composer York Bowen (1884-1961). His music has a rare grace and charm, somewhat reminiscent of Chopin, but with more modern harmonies, reminding one of Rachmaninov and sometimes even of the French impressionists. His 'feel-good' music is really a pleasure to listen to, and Bowen deserves to be much better known. It is hard to thank Stephen Hough enough for putting together this beautiful album, bringing to life a succession of short gems played with unforgettable charm and simplicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story continues and so does the intrigue","review":"I have had the opportunity to read the first edition in this trilogy and have continued with the story until this point. I have to say that this is by far the most enjoyable piece of literature I have read in a long time.

My cat who, at the time, was not overweight could not use it without it tipping over which rendered this item useless. I just broke down and spent major bucks on a Drs.

My cat has no interest in it at all. When play hide and seek with a toy next to it (to get him to try it) my cat will rap his arms around it and knock it over, so it is too light. He has pulled the top carpet off the corner.

That isn't even worth the effort because the fabric covering it is flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"cat post","review":"I was pleased with the posts I had been searching for since buying them at Wal Mart for half the price of this purchase (several years ago).

Most GeForce cards are around 250-300 dollars, and they support 32bit color, T&L support, OpenGL and D3D (forget Glide, according to most software devolpers this is on way out, because only one chipset supports it), and as far as overclock ability, you dont need to this card has a 256 bit processor, not a 128 like the voodoo cards.

I remember the first time I tried this out just looking at Windows OS and I wondered to myself \\"It looks the exact same\\" (its doesn't work miracles or something =) ). I decided to see how the 3D card would handle Unreal and Unreal Tourney. As soon as I turned on the game I began to drool. To think that my computers was smoothing out the graphics this sleek, and keeping the frame rate perfect! Along with the awesome 3D card comes the option to hook your cable to your computer and watch from the ease of your monitor. Not only that but there is video capture and you can hook your VCR to your comp and watch some movies. As I said before, if you are looking in this price range......give it a shot, you'll love me for it.

And in this price range this is as good as it gets.Oh one more thing the captureing devices are not reconized by microsofts netmeeting so you are unable to hold netmeetings useing your camcorder with this card.Thats a real dissapiontment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This","review":"I'm sure someone has made this comment before in these reviews. .... There are so many better graphics cards that are cheaper like a lower end Radeon or lower end geforce. Not only that but 3dfx went out of business, so there is not support for this product anymore. I owned a voodoo3, and now I own a voodoo5 5500. The voodoo5 [isn't good] (except if you want to play games that are supported with glide). I had a choice between that and the Geforce2, and I made the wrong decision. In summary, while this was a good card 2 years ago, it is in the computer stone age now, and the company that makes it no longer exists. I rest my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, while it lasted...","review":"I was initially quite impressed with this card - though the unique voodoo to vga cable adaptor was a bit odd. The card performed well, and actually still is. However, the special cable that came with the card (the only one that will allow your monitor to view the signal) is having problems now. If this was any other card I could easily buy a new VGA cable.

It is a granted fact that the 3DFX chipsets started losing to NVidia in the speed category long ago, however the Voodoo3 drivers are solid and stable. I run mine with a Tyan motherboard and it has worked wonderfully. Even today, my brand new GeForce4 and not-quite-as-new GeForce3 have problems with simple things like DVD playback. Granted, this might be fixable with minor tweaking, but the point is that the Voodoo3 3500 did everything it claimed it could and did it flawlessly right out of the box. In the category of computer hardware, that is simply amazing. Even though 3DFX is out of business, if you find that you don't need to play new games or run Windows XP, I would still recommend using this card."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best video card I have ever owned!!!!!","review":"I used this video card up until 2 years ago in my system running windows 98 until the market forced me to change and up-convert to windows XP, and thus having to convert over to a new video card. This was the best video card on the market at the time I bought it back in 1999/2000 and this thing rocked. I played need for speed, doom, ect...with this beast with flawless graphic details. Plus, I had radio and TV with my cable connected to the system for internet. Granted now, it looks small (16mb on board), and slow (clocked at 183mhz), but this did it all.

As with the first volume, the author is far more sympathetic with this complex man than most of his recent biographers. It is my personal feeling, that Caro's work is better, but it is a good thing to read these two volumes by Dallek to get a more ballanced view. This was a difficult time in our history and Johnson and his contemporaries were difficult men (and women) to understand and judge. As with any story, we owe it to ourselves to examine all issues from as many angles as possible. Mr. Dallek has given us just one more of those angles. The book is well written and appears to have been well researched.

Hackett's performance is impeccable.Para una completa vision de la obra de Hackett en DVD, seria importante agregar la produccion que unicamente salió en video laser (japon) denominada STEVE HACKETT LIVE (en CD se llamó TIME LAPSE).La importancia es que en esta produccion se ofrece mas de la musica de HACKETT SOLISTA, a diferencia de las que han salido en DVD como TOKIO TAPES, IN SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA, donde hay muchas canciones de la epoca de GENESIS y pocas canciones de Hackett solista."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven but absorbing","review":"The first half or so of Benfey's account of the influence of Japanese culture on American arts and letters is very fine, particularly his chapters on Melville and Manjiro and on Edward Sylvester Morse. This is academic writing at its very best. Ultimately, as the Japanese influence on American taste becomes more pervasive, the book begins to sink under the sheer volume of information that must be conveyed in order to cover the ground. I found the last half informative, but that's because I have an interest in this particular period in American history and literature.

They do this because they're too cheap to pay the royalties for the original music.I can see how the Japanese at Sony don't get it, but for American companies to remove the iconic themes from these TV shows is a crime.

When it arrived, the headboard attachments points were fairly twisted up--so much so that one of the slots for attachment bolts was widened. It's important for theses points to be straight, and I was very surprised that there is no protection for the ends (styrofoam, bubble wrap, etc.) in the shipping box.

I read sweet valley high aswell, and people say that I'm mature for my age, but I'm not even going to deny that I still believe in Santa! I think that you measure maturity on how they react in different situations, not if they have faith in make believe. but back to the book, I think it is a good, honest book about Claudia.

The motion sensors in this unit are weak at best and when they do activate, the head very loudly and very mechanically clicks in the direction of the movement. The audible hoot can be silenced but if you leave it activated and have neighbors closer than 500 feet, you'll probably find the owl in pieces or missing one day. Factor in a very cheap build, a battery compartment that probably isn't water proof and the fact that you will have to continually buy batteries for it and I'd say move on and go with another model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product...","review":"The main problem with this owl is that the sensors do NOT work as intended. The birds just flew and walked up to it, AND THE THING NEVER MOVED OR HOOTED as advertised. Because it remained stationary, the birds were not even remotely frightened or repelled. They just went about their business of defecating and tearing up my yard. This product is awful, and the sensors need to be far more sensitive. I had to put my hand directly in front of them to make it work, which totally defeats the purpose of this product. This was a severe disappointment and I would advise you to think twice or FOUR times before considering this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I should have paid attention to the other reviews.

Nothing seems to faze them. We put up reflecting tape, mirror tiles, an ultrasonic pest repeller, nothing worked. So I bought the owl and put it out there in a little roof overlooking the well. First of all, the motion detector is not very effective, I hear the owl hoot only if I vigorously wave my hand within a foot of it. Also, it keeps turning its head backwards, no matter how many times I turn it forward. And the pigeons come and sing love songs to it only two feet away, and leave their droppings as tokens of their love for it. It does look impressive to us humans as well, though, so I'll just keep it out there as ornamentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a great lawn decoration","review":"I'm not sure its scaring the birds at all from the high tree over my driveway. The motion detector seems to stop working after a couple minutes of first turning it on. Its also very light so it falls down with the slightest gust of wind and the head falls off.

And the head does indeed tend to turn toward the source of detected motion. Unfortunately, the unit that we received does not respond reliably to the birds (mostly starlings and robins) that frequent our back yard.We installed the owl on a post at one corner of a small garden, about ten feet square, and then waited for results. After about half an hour, the birds became accustomed to the owl and paid no further attention to it, other than occasionally using it as s temporary perch before invading the garden.An interesting conversation piece, but (ours at least) did not provide much protection for our poor tomatoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looking bad electronics","review":"Why pay more for this owl that should scare birds when the electronics are not worth the extra cost.

I didn't see that mentioned anywhere, and I'm not sure how effective this could be against some critters that are nocturnal.

I sincerely kept finding myself re-reading sections to see if perhaps I was misinterpreting some of Mr. Rodin's statements. But after studying it and speaking with former and current employees, I believe it wasn't me. This company if stiffled by people that have worked for Marshall for 12+ years and have never worked for any other companies. And if that is what they want to do, fine.

This excellent book tracks his saga and discusses general principles and how-to tips leaders can apply to create effective change. This isn't just another leadership book. Rodin involves you in his personal story. He candidly outlines the difficulties he faced in his company when he tried to get everyone involved in his transformation mission.

I guess you get what you pay for.Do yourself a favor and check out Dazzle's website bulletin page and troubleshooting to get an idea of other problems (most of which I also encountered)."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't be Dazzled!","review":"I purchased the Dazzle Video Creator in hope of transfering my analog vhs tapes into a digital format. It was a neat idea, a plug and play option that I could install without opening the computer case. Great idea, right?Well, this is where everything goes wrong. After istalling the software bundle and getting the Dazzle up and running I ran into severe problems. Mainly being the computer just wouldn't recognize the audio or sound files. Hey, no problem I'll just call tech support to get this ironed out. Much to my dissatisfaction I found out thier tech support was almost nonextistant. They never and let me repeat never helped me at all ever to get this problem ironed out.So save your dough and buy a real video capture card and save your money or you could end up let me with a totally worthless piece of junk that don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased with product or seller","review":"I wanted to return the jelly bean headset and have repeatedly emailed the seller and as yet have never gotten a response. Set is heavy, and mouthpiece is large and annoying as it is in the line of sight. Pay a bit more and get a better unit, but not from this setter."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't write columns like this anymore","review":"This is a collection of columns by Red Smith, one of the greatest sports reporters who ever lived. He wrote in an unusual style, telling a story in his colorful way, rather than reporting the highlights of the game and throwing in some quotes from the players. You need to pay closer attention to his columns than to the average sports story you'll see in a newspaper today, but you'll not only find out what happened the previous day, you'll also be entertained by his writing.I've been a huge fan of Red Smith's ever since I heard his classic line about the horrible Packers team that finished a season with one win, ten losses and a tie. He wrote that they overwhelmed one team, underwhelmed 10 and whelmed one. If you got a kick out of that line, you'll enjoy this collection of baseball columns.It also gives you a good glimpse of New York baseball in the 40's and 50's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A baseball treasure","review":"Except for Ken Smith's National Baseball Hall of Fame (1947), this work rates at the top of the baseball list. It is so good that I have given copies to the various Frick & Spink awardees with whom I have corresponded.Best described as shorties: selected daily writings by the dean of baseball writers. Get to know the players as they really existed, not as today's fables want you to believe.You can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a baseball fan from any generation","review":"Even though most of these collected columns are from over 30 years ago, they are not at all dated. You may not know the names, you may not have even been born when the events happened. But Red Smith's writing is so interesting, free of cliches, and downright enjoyable that even a casual reader will be drawn into Smith's columns. One of my favorites is Smith's account of the 1970 All-Star Game, Richard Nixon, and Morganna, a well-endowed stripper famous for running onto baseball fields and kissing ballplayers such as Pete Rose and Clete Boyer. Read it! It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Smith really knew Baseball!","review":"Great book ... and long overdue! This man knew more about the game of baseball than many modern day players, coaches and writers will ever know.

It should last forever. The only thing I did not like is that the mounting holes on the flange are very close to the hood itself, which made it difficult to nail or screw without risking denting the hood.

I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about the early history of Canada, the Hudson's Bay Company, and the fur trade.The book is well-written and as a teacher, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource","review":"I flipped through a couple different editions of this book recently and I must get one for myself. I have books that focus on men's suits and tailoring, but this one addresses sportswear and casual wear, as well as some ethnic styles, like African and Middle Eastern. It focuses more on the design angle than construction, which is desparately needed since commercial pattern companies only carry about 5 different patterns in the men's wear category. At the moment there are more men's costume patterns, but when was the last time you saw Henry the VIII or the Music Man walking down the street?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great guide!","review":"It gives you a run down of all of the patternmaking basics for menswear.

It covers all the bases of the subtle science and exact art that is taildragger flying. There's no \\"seat of your pants\\" instinct preaching involved here, and mechanics as well as physics of flight are clearly and thoroughly rendered in this excellent instructional. It's a must have for any pilot interested in how the beloved Taildraggers function."},{"rating":"2","title":"a unique inside view of kingship.","review":"In this book we read the thoughts of a man who lived more than 400 years ago and was the founder of one of the great empires of the world. It is remarkable that he found the time to write in so much detail about his experiences yet being so busy defending and building an empire all his life starting from the time he became a king at the age of tweleve. Never before or since do we get such an intimate glimpse at what it means to be a king. It is refreshing to read it today as it must have been then."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True King","review":"Babur was a king in the true sense of the word. His autobiography outlines his feirceness as a warrior as well as his compassion toward the people in his court. Although he lived in a time where one would think there would be little time for introspection, this is exactely what his narrative is: and introspective look at his own life, his shortcomings, his downfalls, his triumphs and tragedies. One is touched by Babur's humbleness, his sensitivity towards some of the most simple of things, and at his sense of awe and appreciation of beauty in the world around him. Although in some ways I prefered the AS Beveridge translation, this is also a wonderful translation with beautiful pictures and notes in the margins to help explain things. Even if you are not normally interested in this type of book, Babur leads you into his world and you are compelled to read on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"The book itself is excellent.I had problems with Salman Rushdie's preface, however. It is not a bad introduction, but some of his comments seem to be flawed. The writer explains the contradictory aspect of Babur's psychology (both ruthless/aggressive and soft/cultured) as the outcome of two conflicting \\"aspects\\" within Islam. Mr Rushdie does not explain how he arrives at this conclusion, however, and he fails to mention the possibility that Babur's aggression might have naturally stemmed from his Mongol background & warrior instincts. In addition, in the 2nd last paragraph, Rushdie seems to contradict himself when he compares Babur to Machiavelli: \\"In both men, a cold appreciation of the necessities of power, of what today would be called realpolitik, is combined with deeply cultured and literary nature, not to mention the love, of excess, of wine and women.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Big nerdy book for big nerds","review":"It's hard to understand what audience a book like this is aimed toward. Yes, it's from a university press, so one assumes an academic audience of some kind. But the level of writing is much too light, fun, and enjoyable to be aimed at only people earning credit toward degrees or trying to make tenure. I'm doing neither of those actions but enjoyed the hell out of this book. But I wonder whether the authors were being mischievous or dismissive when they write something like, \\"In addition to standard indexes, the book also contains two word lists: a Proto-Indo-European English list and a list of the Proto-Indo-European vocabulary arranged by its English meaning (which should at least facilitate those who delight in such tasks as translating Hamlet into Klingon).\\" Eh, anyway, it's a fun book if you embrace your love of learning and shut away the voices of anti-intellectualism."},{"rating":"2","title":"salt and pepper grinders","review":"My wife and I have another set of these grinders.

I was surprised when I watched it that it has a sad, but compelling story. Two sisters are sold into slavery and forced to become sex slaves.

I am, and have been a Slum Village fan since the rare \\"Fantastic Vol. 1\\" and have enjoyed every release thus far. My only complaint about \\"SV\\" is that it is too short. I was left wanting to hear more tracks(4 more wouldn't have hurt). 8 tracks with an into and a skit aren't enough. Stand out tracks are \\"05\\" with the live horns and drums, and \\"Multiply\\" with its layed back feel.I know it may be a long shot but I look forward to having a Slum album with all four members throughout. Having T3, Elzhi, Baatin, and Jay-Dee going hard on Jay-Dee produced tracks would be the ultimate. Until that day comes, this will have to do.

As a historical fiction writer, writing about this time period, this book gave me many insights. Byock uses some well-know and lesser-known saga characters to illustrate the power alliances, which I found fascinating. With no royalty, Iceland deveoped a unique democracy, which Byock explains in much detail. The maps and diagrams are very helpful. While it is an academic read, it is certainly not difficult. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Iceland."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a fan of this group so they can't do much wrong","review":"This West Virginia Bluegrass band is worth a listen if you haven't heard of them before.

These cost less than some other wicking hiker socks, but they're fine. Very comfortable, not too bulky, will fit into a running shoe as well as a boot. Look good and feel good. They do seem to keep your feet from sweating up too much even after all-day wear in warm weather.You could pay twice as much for a similar sock, but the only reason I can think of to do so would be if you needed a serious thick, thermal insulation sock for winter trekking or mountaineering. This mid-weight sock is probably not designed for extreme cold conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for comfort.","review":"I needed an extra large sock for a 14 size foot. This sock is way to small to fit comfortably. People with little feet might feel just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not X-Large","review":"I bought three pair of these socks using a gift certificate because the ad read X-Large for men with shoe sizes 12 to 15. And they sported a hefty price tag. At any rate, I wanted socks that were bigger than the size 9 to 12 I can find in department stores. I wear a size 11 shoe. I like loose-fitting socks because I prefer to walk around the house without shoes or slippers. I knew I had wasted the gift certificate as soon as I tried to pull the first sock on. I could barely pull it over my heel. These socks are so tight that they cut off the circulation to my ankles. If I wear them for any length of time, they leave an imprint of the woven pattern on my feet and ankle area. I gave the other two pair away as Christmas gifts to a relative with a shoe size much smaller than mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Socks","review":"I bought a pair of these socks to try for riding with my motorcycle boots.

And yet, I was (occasionally) riveted. The reason? Sue Price's magnificently muscled body. Her tremendous muscular development is showcased often and at every conceivable angle and sexual situation, making this, to me, possibly the sexiest movie ever made. The camera is truly shameless in drinking in her powerful physique. (I didn't mind!) If you love female muscle, WOW! here you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nemesis 4: Not what was expected","review":"As a fan of Sci-Fi flicks, I decided to check this one out since it what shot by a great director, Albert Pyun. I was quite dissapointed with the story line (mind you I haven't seen Nemesis 2 or 3) because I didn't know what the story was.Plus the flow was weird and had no focus. Regardless, I was in awe of the star of this movie Sue Price. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE HER. Her body is absolutely amazing. This girl is buff. She's not Gwenyth Paltrow in body or skill but she is quite riveting. Unfortunately, she seems to be walking around naked for about half the movie. Too gratuitous.

She is a bounty hunter for hire who goes after one last kill. Things go poorly and she soon learns she has been set up and is the target of every bounty hunter in the world. She spends a lot of time naked and shows off her super-muscular physique but not much else happens. Most of the characters spend their time talking and talking and talking. This is by far the least action packed film in the Nemesis franchise. Its just plain boring. The special effects are just plain embarrassing. This film obviously had a very low budget and it shows. Avoid this snoozefest unless you like watching naked female bodybuilders."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN ANGELS CRY","review":"I have professionally worked as a film critic, so I know film, and let me tell you freinds: NEMESIS 4: CRY OF ANGELS is no film.

People have fallen into comas over less than the effect of watching this wretched display of total incompetence. I would provide an overview of the plot and characters, but for the mental health and well-being of the reader I will refrain. Besides, exposure to such poison could cause more heads to explode than all of the SCANNERS films combined. Coincidentally, SCANNERS comes across as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY when compared to this movie.

I now need a new one and this one was like $50 which isnt come by lightly so I'm a little ticked over the quality of it.

Nice Chris Ware cover too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, it's too fast","review":"Anyone who believes that Nielsen is not playing \\"too fast\\" needs to listen to Lamb himself on Smithsonian Folkways. This latter recording, made in 1959 when Lamb was 72 years old, exposes Neilson as a honky tonk tinkler. Nielsen comes close to getting it right on a couple of tunes (Ethiopia, Topliner Rag) but his excessive speed and heavy-handedness is no more apparent than on American Beauty Rag, a beautiful and subtle piece that is made frivolous and grating. If you want to hear Lamb's rags played correctly, go to Perfessor Bill Edward's website, where you can hear them in their entirety for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough of an 'expert\\" to judge the speed","review":"But I found this CD infectious.

Unfortunately, the foot pump was flimsy and hence easier to pump by hand than by foot. In addition, the ball quickly lost its inflation, making it soft and offering too little support for my back during abs exercises and too weak a platform for my glutes during SI joint exercises. In short, after only three-four weeks of owning it, I have discovered that this ball is unusable, and I already need to replace it. Trying to refill the ball has not fixed the problem--maybe there is a leak. I recommend buying aTKO Anti Burst Fitness Ball Set 75cminstead!

It is a heavy guage plastic and fairly rugged. It's a very nice ball for core excercise. The downside is that the foot pump is not great but servicable. It's just a cheap type so it's not a bad idea to have another pump like a bicycle pump. It works but takes time.

Be aware that the pump that comes with it is not what you would think. It is a plastic accordian style pump that you step on, and squeals horribly. If you can deal with the squealing, then yes it does get the job done. Air plug to hold the air in does work, but it sticks out of the bosu ball about 1.5 cm. Overall, not a bad product.

Therefore, achieving the 90 degree angle between my hips and legs is *very* important. I bought the 75 cm ball because I am relatively tall. I inflated it, using a level and a hashmark on the wall to ensure that it was inflated to the proper size. At 65 cm., I was frightened to keep inflating for fear that I might over-inflate and injure myself. I took it inside and when I sat on it (at 140 pounds) it barely makes a dimple. Thus, I know I am at about max capacity. The angle is a little shy of 90 degrees so I guess I'll keep the ball until I can find a better one. Just note, if you are looking for a 75cm ball, this is not it (and just FYI - the box *does* say 75cm)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an anti burst","review":"My husband, who is NOT a large man sat on it and was kind of rolling around on the ball and it popped! i don't think it was over filled and it was on carpet nothing sharp around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby rocking whisperer","review":"Yes, thats why i bought it, and it works better on calming my newborn than any other baby product i own.

My only regret may be not getting a larger one because I find that I can use this card for so many different electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"didn't work with my Samsung T809; Samsung technical support had tried but didn't figure out if it was the phone or the memory card.

I eventually got a replacement from Kingston but only after a grilling from there tech folks because they said they did not support the use or their 2GB cards in the Garmin GPSMAP 60CSx unit I was using... I however was going on the advice of the Garmin website. I got the replacement and it has worked fine out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not lucky","review":"I purchased one of this for my nokia e71, it worked fine for 3 months but after that one day it was not working anymore.

Major PIA. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading info","review":"I searched for \\"mini\\" SD and when I got the product, I realized it was a \\"micro\\" SD.

It works great so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great w/3 formats","review":"I needed the hard to find mini SD, so I got this version with the SD, mini and micro. Best of all worlds.

I eventually got a made in Japan one from some other place. While both are fast (18.xMB/s MIT vs. 19.xMB/s MIJ) transfer speeds, this minor speed difference does make a difference for my purpose. If you know what I mean, then you're probably buying this for the same purpose. Newegg has the made in Japan ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product and fast","review":"this works for my blackberry curve just fine, price was decent and got it fast. i would recomend this seller for sure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Price","review":"Prices have gone down significantly for micro sd. I use to only buy sandisk flash memory but find that the kingston brand is much cheaper and work just as well. Now I buy based on value and quality...not just the brand. My wife uses this card on her LG Voyager. Since picture quality for mobile phones have increased, thereby the need for more storage, its nice to have a 2gb card to store music and photographs on her phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Phone Card","review":"I bought this card to increase the storage on my Windows Mobile smartphone. Despite the fact that the phone operates at a horrendously slow speed these days, there is no noticeable delay when transferring data to and from the card vs. opening files stored directly on the phone. I use it to store all the media on my phone as well as archive text messages. The card ships with an adapter so you can pop it out of your phone or camera and read it with a standard SD card reader. Or, if you'd like, keep it in the adapter and you have a 2GB SD card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Thigpen","review":"I would like to thank you for given me the opportunity to make this great purchase at such a valuable price. I enjoy the music that I downloaded on this disk. It really highlights my day when I can just set back and listen to my best songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of hardware","review":"Got it at a great price here on amazon for my LG EnV. It comes in a plastic case that houses both parts (MicroSD and adapter sheath). Right out of the packaging it was simple to use; I popped it right in my phone, which created the appropriate folders on it, and of course with the adapter sheath this card can be used in any SD card reader. I have not had any problems with it thus far. This is plenty of space for some of my favorite music and to store any pictures or videos taken on the phone. If you want to use music on your phone and don't need all kinds of fancy features, this is a much easier solution than buying a special link cable and trying to locate software for your phone to sync it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough","review":"I think it's works good as what I wanted. Not too bad. So it should be a good choice for u, because its price is the lowest when I compare with the other 2GB microSD cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complains","review":"Got this memory card about 2 months ago and it's still working smoothly.

I did not receive a MiniSD card adapter with my purchase, but, I was not going to use it, and many people don't. Still, don't deter from the product, it is great with Cell Phones, or a MP3 player. It also works as a data stick.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kingston","review":"I ordered this product for my phone and love the fact it can also be used in my computer as well. it's easier to transfer songs and data without having to use the data transfer cord and software too.

The delivery was fast got it a few days after I ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingston 2 GB","review":"This is fully functional just make sure you do your research to make sure that its compatible with your phone/computer.

I can now hold hundreds of songs and pictures on my phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Just wanted to report that this product is the Japanese made Micro sd.Some places recommend the Japanese over the ones made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game... too bad","review":"This is an otherwise excellent game that unfortunately uses the intrusive copy protection software known as Starforce. Normally I don't care a whit about copy protection, but Starforce installs itself as a hidden hardware driver and sits between your IDE / SATA hardware and the operating system. This causes all kinds of system glitches, crashes, slowdowns and on occasions requires a complete reinstall of Windows. Much of this comes from careless and poor programming - but the truth is, as long as the game is protected, the publishers don't care at all what happens to your system. This attitude makes little sense, really since it only takes about a month for the latest protection schemes to be broken anyway.Oh, and as an added bonus, the Starforce garbage remains on your system even after you uninstall the game. And the Starforce folks won't tell you how to remove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't use on Vista","review":"I couldn't find any specs on this product about if it would run on Vista before purchasing it, but for the price, it was worth a try. After installing, my pc crashed. I had to do a restore to get everything back to normal. I'll be willing to bet it's the protection software that caused the problem. Some PC's w/Vista will take it, some won't. I might have been able to eventually make it work but didn't want to mess with it. Gave it to my friend who uses XP, it worked perfect. I couldn't give it a rating only because I couldn't run it.

It is definitely not what I had expected. You can also find this item on several other sites, showing a picture of it next to a shirt pocket, but the shirt pocket must be HUGE to make this pepper mill look small.

On a room service breakfast before the caffeine kicks in, or in an airport where flavor is hard to find, Black Pepper Dust is one more reminder that you are away from the comforts of home.For me, the Last Black Pepper Dust was on an otherwise excellent Southwestern Omelet at the San Pedro (CA) Crowne Plaza. While I am sure that one of the helpful servers would have found a pepper mill, I was not sufficiently caffeinated to make the request.September 16, 2010 - Problem Solved: I am now the proud owner of a Peugeot Reims 4-inch Pocket Stainless Steel Pepper Mill.

I own several watches that were more expensive than this one. But this watch is great. Good weight, look, and feel. I have owned the watch for about three months. I have worn it diving, boating, swimming, and snorkeling and it certainly has lived up to its billing. Very nice screw down crown and impressive automatic movement. Watch is often mistaken for a Rolex Submariner witch costs $5000+ more. The only draw back is that the band seems to scratch easy (maybe I am just tough on the watch?).

There are lots of lists of what to consider, and what should be done, but very little in the way of practical case studies. Much of it is the sort of blinding obvious stuff that isn't worth the time. A random example--page 272: \\"For example, if you wanted to present the status of all operational areas as to schedule, you could simply list them on the slide in various colors such as: Green--ahead of schedule Yellow--on schedule Red--behind schedule.\\" Much of the book is repetitive.
