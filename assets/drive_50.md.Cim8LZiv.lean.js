The film is sexy and sensual all the way through. The back-story is a bit flimsy, but let's face it-- we're not watching this movie for the character's past, but for their present.

It's nice to see actors from the prior movies in new roles, but the film falls flat. The concept is silly but could have been saved by dynamic writing and direction. Unfortunately, the execution is bland, the writing weak (Poor Ash wandering around talking to spices, which works the first few times, but not beyond), and there is absolutely no chemistry between the main romantic leads. Dylan McDermott is miscast, his role is poorly conceived, and he needs a shave. The creators of the film seem to have said: what aout this? what about this? what about adding that to explain that? But they never came up with a good package. One is painfully aware that one is watching a bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistress of the Spiceless","review":"This movie had the potential to be good but failed on so many levels that I want my two hours back. I watched and loved Bride and Prejudice and thought this movie would be along the same lines. It was compared to Bell, Book and Candle, the only similarity was her talking to the spices instead of a cat. Watch the original it is a joy to watch.The acting in this film is dull, the script is mindless and what's with the red chili peppers? The only redeeming thing in this film is the beauty of the spice shop and Aishwarya Rai. Give me the joy of Bollywood that leaves me wanting to dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I just watched it now... and for devotees of \\"bodice-ripper\\" novels... this is PERFECTION!

This is Janis at her very dramatic best. Her voice is perfect, and there is also a very rare performance of the Japanese only hit \\"You Are Love\\". \\"Silly Habits\\" exhibits a wonderful band showcase, and \\"Here Comes the Night\\", \\"Will You Dance\\" and \\"Fly Too High\\", Janis' first disco hit, are very memorable and flawless.

We both grew weary of the emotional disconnect between the characters and the violence - as though killing was simply something else they had to do and it really didn't have any emotional impact on them. If that is the message of the series, it is lost in the relentless mayhem. The animation is great, but the series is unmoving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, George why? Or should I say \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\"","review":"I guess it's George Lucas's right to destroy what he created, but I just don't understand why.In over twelve hours over 6 episodes of LIVE ACTION films there was never a need for curse words (clone wars clone troopers) or gratuitous murder (clone wars bounty hunters).What is worse, is that the violence and language occur not in the pursuance of something uniquely Star Wars, but in the conveyance of film cliches (we get it, clone troops are army men and bounty hunters are cowboys, great).My kid will watch it because it has the letters S T A R W A R S on the package.

It looks really good on my PS3. I immediately noticed a difference from the TV version, aside from the sharper image; there's letterboxing (2.4:1) that was removed from the Cartoon Network presentation of the show. It now has a more cinematic feel on the Blu-ray (as well as a bit more image on the left and the right). The packaging is similar to the first season, though the book can now be removed from a sleeve. Strangely, the cover of the book reads: \\"le GUERRE dei CLONI\\". I thought for a moment that I had the Italian version of the book, but the cover art and the artist's note inside the front cover made it clear that it was an homage to the spaghetti western. Thankfully, there are no games among the extras. There are several different language options, but no commentaries that I could find.

What a dissappointment!My problem - the child dinosaur makes his own decision regarding who he lives with and the adult dinos are wishy-washy in their guidance and have no authority. Kids need love and encouragment, but also need adults to provide structure and directions and set appropriate boundaries.Last time I checked my kids are my responsibility as their parent. I need to act like a parent and make tough decisions for them. Input from children is good, but they are children and should not make life-changing decisions on their own.I do not like that this movie teaches that children should make their own major decisions.

And obviously, it's great for travel within America too, without using a wall adapter. Compact, easy, solid construction, I love it.

The main problem is that the cord is TOO SHORT. I expected the cord to expand beyond the 5 inches you see on the surface.

The short power cable simply wraps around the outlets and plugs into one of them. Perfect to carry around in my laptop backpack. A better solution than carrying around a small power strip (which is what a friend does). It only cost about $15 when I bought it from Amazon, which is a fair price for something like this from Monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for France; now using everywhere","review":"We had a multi-week tour over a good chunk of France and of course we brought a plethora of electronic equipment.

However, for my needs, it didn't work because I have a set of 4 outlets that are side-by-side and I need to use a series of three of these in a row.

It is also nice to use when you want to share a plug at the airport."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR OVERSEAS USE. GOOD FOR USA ONLY","review":"This is only good to use by itself within USA. The product is clearly marked \\" Electrical Rating 125VAC 60HZ\\". For you to be able to safely use this overseas, it has to be plugged to power converter/transformer that has an output of 110-120V. It is risky to plug this directly into 220-240V as it is not rated to handle such voltage. Monster Co. did not even bother to mention this. I will be cautious in buying Monster products in the future as they can be monsterously dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not international!","review":"I bought this since it looked as though it was designed for international use. Sadly, it is NOT rated for 220v. It would be dangerous to use this in most countries in the world as a result. Uggg! NOT what I wanted or needed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice form, but the light is very bright and it does not work as a surge protector","review":"This is a very pretty powerstrip, but the bright blue light can keep you up at night. If you plan to use this hotel rooms, this could be a huge drawback. As it offers no surge protection, the only reason you'd be buying this is to get an additional outlet.I really can't justify taking this device on any of my trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for What it is!","review":"Monster has created an excellent power strip here. You just need to know what it was designed for. It's designed to be an extremely portable powerstrip with a short cord.I'm currently studying for my GMAT exams right now, so I carry this Monster OTG400 in my backpack's side pocket and it's so small and light, you would never know it's there. I bring it out when I'm at the library or local cafe and there are a limited number of outlets. It has come in handy so many times, I've lost count. If you think you're in a similar situation as I am, this is a must-have in your laptop bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"compact, but too compact","review":"I really liked this charger but my only two downsides are that: the cord is only about a foot or so long, and that the plug lights up, so you would need to cover or unplug it if using in a bedroom, it is pretty bright."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for business travel","review":"This is a great little accessory for travelers. There is great space between the outlets so I can use them all at once with multiple differnt types of AC plugs. The only downside is the blue LED light on the wall plug where it says \\"Monster Power\\". If you put it in the right location, it would be a useful night light. However, it is a glaring light and very disruptive to sleep if you put it within eyesight such as plugged into the lampstand common in many hotel rooms. I find myself propping some type of notepad or other opaque material in front of the plug to block the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it.","review":"They work great. Nice and portable. However, I wish the cable were just a little longer, as some wall ports at hotels are higher up the wall. This strip just hangs instead of resting securely on the floor. Also, the plug glows bright blue when it's plugged in, which I really don't like. I think they tout that as a positive feature but I like total darkness when I'm trying to sleep.I got two, and I leave one in two different pieces of luggage so I don't forget to pack them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave home without it","review":"Great little travel sized outlet multiplier. Hotels rarely have enough free outlets for me to power up everything I have at one time. Now I just need to find one free outlet and then I can charge up to 4 devices... usually a laptop, mobile phone and a camera battery or two. Couple this with an international plug adapter and you're ready to go just about anywhere.It has also come in handy at the airport. Outlet being used? No problem, just ask the person if you can plug this in and you can share the outlet... make a new friend or two or three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy!","review":"Arrived on time, exactly as described, packaged well, no complaints. Made by Monster, so it's no surprise that it's well made and feels durable. And this little guy is handy! The tiny 6\\" (approx, I didn't measure) footprint makes it easy to throw in your carry-on, laptop case, backpack, or even jacket pocket, and in today's electronic device world everybody in the Fam has something(s) to plug in. No more hunting for sockets, unplugging lamps, and rearranging furniture for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great item for a traveler","review":"I travel alot and one of the worst parts is that there are never enough outlets for all of my electronics --- computer, phone, blue tooth, kindle --- you get the picture. Usually there is one outlet which holds two products. With this power strip, I can charge everything on one plug. I actually use one in my bedroom as the main outlet is behind the bed. I can plug in my kindle and phone and still have a separate outlet for the lamp. I bought one of these years ago from Sharper Image for ALOT more money. Excellent purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Accessory","review":"I think this is a great travel accessory. When I travel, I always have that dilemma of the one plug on the desk for my PC but then trying to find that accessible wall plug for my cell phone (this is critical since I use my phone as my alarm). This accessory eliminates this issue. It also has a light on it that ensures that the plug has power so it eliminates the Jim Furyk issue (no power to the plug that caused him to miss an event since his phone is his alarm and it died!). It packs very easily and it is a must have now for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"We bought this Belkin power strip for our trip to Ireland. We bought it since we only planned on carrying two converters and between our iphones and ipads and computer we knew we would need more than 1 power strip.

If I had one caveat, it would be that I wished the cord itself was longer, but that would probably make it less compact for travel. We used this with our laptops, Apple products, and accessories during a month of traveling and staying in different types of lodgings (various hotels and hospital)Pros:+small, plenty of outlets+reliable, worked perfectly throughout a month long trip overseasCons:-cord is a little short"},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient","review":"Who wants to pack an 6' power strip to handle their electronic devices on a trip? The monster power strip has four outlets and packs neatly into itself to fit easily into a computer bag. A great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dual Voltage travel adapter","review":"Bought this device for travelling to Europe. Very impressed with build quality, size and price.I was surprised how difficult it was to find a US multi-plug that could hand dual voltage (110V or 220V).Has a blue LED on the end that plugs into the wall which is supposed to show when its powered and charging. Useful for those hotels that kill the power when you remove the key card.I actually found the light to be too bright when trying to sleep with it in the same room so had to cover it with blue tack but this device is awesome.Notes:This does not convert between Voltages so make sure the device you plug in support 240/230V if travelling in Europe.The end that plugs into the wall is a US type with ground pin. You will need a travel converter to plug this into a European outlet. Make sure the travel converter you buy accepts the ground pin! Not all of them do."},{"rating":"2","title":"good travel power strip","review":"Although this is rated only for 120 volts, when used with an adaptor plug, it works fine also with 220-240 in Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product","review":"When I read about it, it described it as a converter for US power cords to British outlets. It is purely for American outlets."},{"rating":"1","title":"MADE IN CHINA -- not for my grandbaby!","review":"Due to the ongoing problems with products manufactured in China over the past few years, I was so disappointed to get these beautiful Kushies Zolo Links and discover that they were actually made in China. I do not think it is appropriate to import items from that locale for babies who will be putting these things in their mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never really fun","review":"He wasn't into these at all, the linking things was sort of interesting but just not that great. So he'd play for about 30 secs then run off, waste of money for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but..","review":"I bought these because I'm a big fan of good design and with groovy creatures and fun colors, this toy called to me even though they were pricey. It does not however call to my 10 month old daughter all that much. The little creatures which I thought were so cute are probably her least favorite thing to play with. The linking shapes are more fun to her with their crazy colors and textures but she mostly chews on them. A teething toy would have been much cheaper! I still bring them with us when we go out because they do link to high chairs and grocery carts, but if she pulls on them too much, they come off and then go straight to the floor. I think my money would have been better spent on just a pack of linking rings since these were so expensive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolls meet block","review":"My 4 and 2 year old girls love this toy. My 2 year old gets to play dolls while my 4 year old builds all sorts of towers with them and helps the little men scale the refrigerator door.I like the toys quality in the build. No complaints whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I was so excited to get this toy. I love the idea but this has been an expensive toy that has barely been played with. You can create a few different configurations but with the lack of pieces, there are only a couple ways to get it to work and be balanced. If I get it out and \\"force\\" it on my two and four year old they may play with it for a couple minutes but mostly it is collecting dust on our shelf. Wish I could have this purchase back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but also not a kid favorite","review":"I like the design too, but also think that our daughter doesn't really play with it- and she's had it for over a year... probably appeals to adults more than kids. I recommend getting magnetic toys that have multiple purposes for a range of ages... magnatiles?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey - but Awesome","review":"I bought these for my grandson and sent them to my niece for her new baby. I initially bought them because I just liked the way they looked. I liked them even more when they arrived. They're cute. They're brightly colored, interestingly shaped and full of texture - for touching and chewing. They attach to the car seat, stroller, etc. easily and we haven't lost any yet!I am going to buy them again for our latest grandchildren (twins!).The only negative is that they're not cheap - but they also don't look or feel cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a treasury of patterns from the past.","review":"150 Favorite Crochet Designs edited by Mary Carolyn Waldrep, is a treasure-trove of patterns gleaned from the past. All the patterns are made from thread and date bake to the 30's, 40's, and 50's. Many of the patterns can be easily adapted by today's modern crocheter. The charted \\"Eagle and Motto\\" runner with its' patriotic E PLURIBUS UNUM detail could be the basis for a great 4th of July afghan done in 4ply yarn. Pick out a motif from one of the bedspread patterns and do it up in yarn. Tack it to a tired old pillow for some instant decor pick-me-up. Worked in thread, many individual motifs can be used for snowflakes for a Christmas tree. There are also edgings that can be used to trim baskets and caning jars. Intermediate to advanced crocheters would find this book useful and beginners can easily grow into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crochet Designs","review":"Book was very good at showing the patterns and how to make the patterns, but was little dissapointed that some of the older crochet patterns were not in the book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who like old-fashioned crochet","review":"The synopsis is right on the mark. This book is very old-fashioned - from the patterns right down to the print. I dare to say, even boring. The designs are (as mentioned) from decades ago, so if you're looking for young, fun designs you won't get it here. The pictures are in black and white and the print is old, typewriter style. Out of the claimed 150 designs (I didn't check to see if there are really 150), only about 5 really interested me. Even my 67 year old mother remarked that none of the designs 'jumped out at her'. On the positive side though, the book is easy to follow with charts and abbreviation guides, crochet hook conversions and 17 basic crochet stitches. I will recommend the book for a beginner who wants simple designs, but for a seasoned pro who has done it all, something newer and more challenging is needed - unless of course you lost all your mother's old books and want one with old favorites for your home library :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"The product was shipped quickly and arrived just in time for my Mom's Birthday.

It starts off really exciting, but gets borning and corny VERY fast. With that being said, true horror addicts may not enjoy this movie, but fans of cheesey B movies will love it. The plot was original, at least I think it was. I mean really, homeless people turning into monsters, can it get any better? Buy this movie or you are not worthy or calling yourself a movie lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok monster movie for the faint hearted.","review":"Good start for a horror movie, but some cheesy parts.

Try it out you might like it, hardcore horror fans probably won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"D.U.D.","review":"Egads! This is an awful movie. Even by 80s standards it's possibly one of the worst, slow moving, jaw yapping so called horror films I have ever seen and I've seen some doozies.The movie is nothing but one long scene of inane boring dialogue after another with perhaps a split second of monster \\"scares\\" thrown in between. An entire hour and fifteen minutes goes by before any kind of excitement happens and it's pretty mediocre when it does. There isn't a single scare throughout, not a moment of suspense and subplots that go nowhere. Who cares that the photographer's girlfriend is pregnant, it had nothing to do with the story at all.And the extended shower scene that shows up if you click on the C.H.U.D.'s glowing eyes during the menu is identical to the scene in the movie, the only difference is you get to see the T&A; that was cut out of the theatrical release.Stay away, stay far far away from this awful movie or watch it on high speed fast forward like I did.C.H.U.D is a D.U.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the horribly awesome movie I expected!","review":"Secret government cover ups, mutant killing machines, actors that some how saved their careers.

Go right out and buy this movie -- you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Played on 42nd Street Forever In It's Day","review":"This filmed hung around 42nd street I think over a year when it was out.

If you really like horror films set in NYC then give it an extra star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker...","review":"I like craptastic movies as much as the next guy, but this was a turd pure and simple. They barely show the \\"Dwellers\\" throughout the movie. It's a pantheon of actors who were braking there way in at the time. I give it two stars because I hear the commentary is supposed to be really funny, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

The author is quite charming and his outlook on food is inspiring and practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO MANY COATS","review":"I really cant add to much to the reviews here. Its one bad flick.Seagal sits in this movie alot, he mumbles in this movie alot and he wears very heavy leather coats one on top of the other even though thier in the Bahamas. I thick the Vodka bottle and hot dog tray were always close at hand. He looks so bad in his scenes,like the director beat him up before going on set! There was alot of dubbing in this flick and poor segall swings his arms around like a big bloated baloon. I think in his next movie he will lay on his side the whole time. The girl was a beauty though. But worst of all is in the beginning of the movie a little spy plane is flying across a dam. It was soooo fake! I thought I would see a hand holding it in the air. thumbs way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steven Seagal is to Martial Arts what Millie Vanillie was to Music","review":"The only reason I gave this movie a star was because there is no Zero star option. Where does Seagal continue to get backing for his movies - the last 8 (or 10?) have all been awful. His last good release was Under Seige. I only wish my 401K grew as fast as his waistline. Submeged is bad - no suprise there, it will be the last movie of his I watch, I just can't take it any more. Submerged? Must be a reference to his movie career which went under about a decade ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is NOT Seagal's best.","review":"My wife LOVES Seagal so this was added to her collection.

Our education is one of the bests of the Americas, and there 's no country other than Uruguay and Argentina, with more general knowledge in all the Americas.We don 't drop bombs and are a very peaceful country.This movie shows the world a bad and unreal image of our country.First of all, Steven Seagal should have gotten real information, before doing this fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time 2 retire Steven","review":"I am really disappointed by the last 3 outings of the once exciting, but now old,overweight and hairpiece wearing Steven Seagal that it makes me actually laugh watching him destroying his past legend over an over again.This movie is pure garbage, please have some dignity and retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought \\"The Life Aquatic Was Bad\\"!","review":"I am a film buff in my late 50s and have been collecting videos and DVDs ever since they were first released. Only twice have I ever thought about throwing a newly-purchased $20 tape or disk into the trash, the first being the aforementioned Steve Zissou (Billy Murray) flick. (I successfully resisted that impulse and can now boast having what I believe is the worst movie ever made in my library.)

How does this guy even find work? He's already being sued by Nu Image for showing up late and leaving early, causing his next two movies Today You Die and Mercenary to be filled with missing scenes, voice dubbing, and once again many stunt people.

Don't support this loser anymore!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Dissatisfied","review":"Although I have not seen all of Steven's movies, I have seen most, and this is the worst, of the most, I've seen. There is too much shooting and betrayals, non stop, from begining to end. It was too hard to keep on top of the plots and scenarios, and it seemed that the only ones loyal to each other was Cody's (Steven's) team. And Steven was completely out of character, at several different points in the movie, I think someone was voicing over Steven, especially when he had to say bad words, most of Steven's movies he rarely swears, but this movie is full of swearing, even by him, and alot of times it didn't sound like Steven's voice. The movie has lots of action, and if you want to see Steven out of his usual character, lots of betraying, killing galore and if you think you can keep up with the non stop 'betraying scenarios' then this movie is probably for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"I was in the mood for some mindless action entertainment, a la 'Under Seige 2' and all I got was the mindless part. A shockingly bloated and mostly unintelligible Seagal does his best Will Sasso impression here and comes up way short. Sasso should do all future Seagal movies, in fact. The many, many shortcomings of this waterlogged waste of film have already been enumerated here, so no point in rehashing them. This one begs for the full 'Mystery Science Theater' treatment.Now THAT would make for some worthwhile viewing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Awful can't even describe this DVD Video. A waste of money, if you must see it, rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Excrement!","review":"As a Seagal fan I have to say that this direct-to-toilet DVD ranks high on my all-time worst film list. Seagal started getting pretty bad when he released The Patriot. Between that horrible film and Submerged Seagal has released a few decent direct-to-video films. Submerged is not one of them. The sound quality on Submerged was awful. It's bad enough trying to understand what Seagal says with his mumbling (or the dubbing), but my wife and I found ourselves turning the volume up and down depending on the scene. While you don't really buy these films for the plot, you expect at least a minimal storyline...not with Submerged! We gave up on Submerged less than 15 minutes into the film. Unless your a Seagal fan and feel the overwhelming compulsion to add to your collection, do not buy this DVD!!! If you're not a fan, don't even bother renting (or borrowing from a friend)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter disgrace","review":"I can imagine that one could sell himself out for the money, everybody does so these days, but it is blatantly obvious that money is the only thing Seagal cares about. He doesn't really care what crap you end up when you buy this DVD, as long as money end up in his pockets. However, as 7th Dan Shihan that has thousands of Aikido practiotioners all over the world looking up to him, it appears that he has no shame as well. Forget about all that bs about inner self, japan, martial arts etc, this guy sold his soul to the devil. Vinnie Jones playing bad ass guy and acting on top of that? Yeah righ, my grandma doing pottery scene with Patrick Swayze would look more convincing. What have you learned in Japan Steven for all those years?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi Hollywood, how does it feel to have Seagal rule you?","review":"Because he does. Submerged picks you up, looks you in the eye, and says, \\"You want action, you're looking at it.\\" And look at it you do, in sheer disbelief as Seagal pulls off one amazing action sequence after another. The movie blasts off with a powerful opener: Seagal flashes a badge, pulls a guy out of a car, and takes off - and as the car drives away you can clearly see that Seagal is actually driving the car himself! At the middle point, the film takes a noir turn where the main bad dude meets Seagal in a bar and says, \\"Frederico, must we continue this fued?\\" And Seagal says, \\"Word on the street's Jackie Tan's tryin' to hussle his groove back,\\" and just looks away - and that look says everything. It gets to a point where you just can't get the appointed thing going without trying to switch it off, and that makes a faulty man a bit of a loner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Seagal Since Under Siege","review":"I have read all the other reviews so far about this movie which I have just watched with my family and we believe that this was by far the best movie that Stevn Seagal has been involved with since Under Siege.

Uruguay is definitely not an island in the Caribbean or anything like that, it is a country between two lovely neighbors, Argentina and Brazil (people, pick up a map!!!). We have probably the best education in the world, and the highest literacy rate in the world, but does the cast and crew of this film think we're stupid??

The book tripped me out with the great style of writing and the ending. Surprised me again. I thought I knew who the killer was but I was wrong.

You will not only track down the serial killer(s), you will peek into the dark closets of their minds. Nothing is off limits, the detective, too, M Gantry, the hoochie mama cop, will reveal all about her sordid past. You will love her, pity her, you will understand her. By the time the story spins to its heady conclusion, you will be cheering both style and content. It is unusual for a writer, an artist really, of this calibre to pull off a book like this, in which the story is as good as the writing. I hope he can sustain the magic for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise Surprise","review":"Excellent! This is a top-notch read. I really enjoyed the book all the way from the unusual title to the exciting end. I'm glad my girlfriend made me read it. Usually when you read a book and the killer appears on the first page you figure the book is gonna be just some kind of chase/thrill. This book is more than that, it really makes you feel for the characters who are so interesting. I swear the ending will surprise you. Preston Allen's writing is so good it is hard to put down. You're sorry the book ended, you want to spend more time in it. I hope he writes a sequel. How about it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make her a serial character, please!!!!!","review":"I loved this book. Mr. Allen is a wonderful writer. My only complaint, and I told him so, was that I was left wishing for more development and background on M. I expressed to him my hope that perhaps she could be a serial character.Growing up in Miami and traveling through the neighborhoods he portrayed in the book, I could literally picture the scenes unfolding in my mind.I was fortunate to have Mr. Allen as my professor a few years back. His love of the written word is infectious, and he was a joy from whom to learn.W. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wisdom of a Lifetime","review":"Norris Clarke, in this remarkable little book, sums up many years of intense philosophical exploration into the meaning of personhood. He writes of deep things without a trace of affectation, never burying the light of his message beneath a bushel-basket of jargon and cant. With gentle but insistent urgency, he challenges readers to appropriate their personhood--with all the infinite longing and immeasurable richness that implies. How many contemporary philosophical books have the power to change lives? This one does. Read it and find out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Princesses","review":"absolutely fascinating story of Nanny Crawford which brings to life how the Royal Family live.

The story of Princess Elizabeth's and Princess Margaret's early childhood, and on up to Princess Elizabeth's marriage is fascinating to read about. 'Crawfie,' the author was ostracised for writing this book, but I think it did the monarchy a world of good. The average person can see what sweet, little, normal girl's the princesses were, and how Elizabeth was such a good candidate for Queen. I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just those interested in the British Monarchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Royal Nanny","review":"I bought this book for a friend's daughter.

HOWEVER, I will tell you that there are a number of instances in this book where I feel that Hurwitz is trying to make direct literary comparisons and/or character associations to Lilith without sufficient evidence.

So regardless of which distributor's version appears the same reviews are shown to the viewer. Be sure to check the distributor data to make sure you are ordering the version you want.In the case of this title Amazon does not identify the distributor so it is impossible to heed the advice the other reviewer posted as whether the item being displayed is the superior or inferior version.It would be helpful if Amazon would link the reviews to the actual item being sold in those cases where there are multiple versions of an item available.

So many funny characters including the great Alan Hale who will always be remembered as Little John to Errol Flynn\`s Robin Hood. Elsa Lancaster as the Mayors wife, Gene Raymond ( with a wonderful hair style ) as the Mayor and of course Walter Slezak as phony medicine man who enlists the simple minded Danny for his wicked ways.Danny Kaye was always at his best playing characters who were certainly not the sharpest tools in the box.

I refused to watch it after a minute or two, and now have to return it and look for a decent copy. This rubbish should never have been offered.

Perhaps my expectations were just too high, after reading \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" (a masterful work, in my opinion) and \\"Name of the Rose\\" (my wonderful introduction to Eco). Although \\"Island of the Day Before\\" has some interesting portions, it seems to lack cohesiveness in the novel form, and what little plot there is seems to drag on incessantly. Perhaps it would have been better told in an essay format (or as a series of short stories)? I thoroughly enjoyed the other Umberto Eco novels that I've read (\\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" and \\"Name of the Rose\\"), and I've liked reading some of his non-fictional works in semiotics/philosophy ... but, for me, \\"Island of the Day Before\\" was a great disappointment. I'm so glad that this wasn't my first exposure to Eco ... I would probably have never wanted to read his other wonderful novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Island\\" a mix of \\"Name of the Rose\\" and \\"Pendulum\\"","review":"With \\"The Island of the Day Before,\\" Eco almost redeems himself for \\"Foucault's Pendulum.\\" This time around, Eco seems more intent on playing narrative games than blundering through a morass of Templar intrigues. As Roberto wanders through the mysterious ship, he wanders through past episodes of his life. We follow him through chambers filled with exotic flora and fauna and from his childhood home, to a city under siege, to the courts of Paris where an encounter with the Cardinal Mazarin sets him on his fateful voyage.While \\"Island is not nearly as enjoyable as \\"Name of the Rose,\\" it far surpasses \\"Foucault's Pendulum,\\" interesting for its attempt to re-create the medieval mindset (an endeavor of which Eco seems incredibly fond) and for Eco's ability to veer from Roberto's past to present while interspersing bits of the medieval weltanschauung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring (yawn)","review":"This is the first book by Eco I've read and it will be a long time before someone can convince me to pick up another.

It revolves around a marooned man (marooned on a ship--while looking at an unreachable island) who confuses his own imaginings with reality--and confuses us a bit along with him. It seems to me that Eco took every little sophist philosophical musing he ever had and tucked it somewhere in this book. Clever wordplay, clever ideas--marooned on a ship, e.g. Christ trapped on the Island and waiting to be freed, e.g., all are thrown in as if in a blender. In the end we're left with a bloated dead body of a book. Unfortunate, if better edited and with 150 pages taken out, it might have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco's Philosophical Bantering","review":"This book is by far the most terrible of all of Eco's productions yet. The book is flooded, no grotesquely bursting with tangents and the usual philosophical rubbish. The reminisces of Roberto's childhood are entertaining and even the time on the ship, but few, if any readers I venture, will have patience for his constant philosophical bickering over first the Meridian and then irrelevantly the meridian line. Roberto's twin Ferrante as an alternate fantasy might be amusing except that it overall detracts from a part of the book that should be reaching its climax. I do not deny that even after 400 pages of this anthole after one chapter I could want to put it down and pick up something more interesting and more thought provoking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"self-indulgent and boring.","review":"I bought this book because I was so impressed with Name of the Rose, with its fascinating account of medieval times. With \\"The Island..\\" I thought I'd be for a 17th Century treat, but I was mistaken. Eloquent writing and poetic description are great when they're accompanied with a STORY (read anything by Peter Matthiessen and you'll see what I mean). But this book bogged down after 50 pages and deteriorated into an irritating maze of self-indulgent language games and esoteria. Unlike some other reviewers here, I don't believe that one should have to be familiar with an author's scholarly interests to access his writing, as if it was some secret code. Obviously, Eco is brilliant, but I want a story, not a wandering display of \\"here's what I know.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A long essay, not a novel","review":"I have read three other books by Eco and enjoyed them all. This one left me flat. I got halfway through and had to give up out of boredom. It is a narrative that seeks to personify the way people in the 1500s thought.

The lead protagonist is as wet as dishwater. And there is absolutely no pay back from this book. If you want to know about telling the time at sea then read Longitude and give this book a miss.

If you want to read an engaging novel, stay away from this book. Sure it is well written and scholarly, but the one reason I could see for someone enjoying it is vanity.

I was studying a box of 500 vocabulary flashcards in preparation for the GRE, and I swear Eco used that same box as he was writing this book.

This is only the second book I've read by Eco (the first being The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana), but I'm pretty sure it will be my last by him.

I'm such a big fan it bothers me and I can't help but wonder if it's Eco's fault or his English translator.My advice is to read anything else by Umberto Eco, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away!","review":"The title, artwork and jacket of this book intrigued me enough to make me buy it. The premise of a man being shipwrecked on an actual ship is interesting--but the story falls apart after a description of how the hero got to be in his predicament. I expected a story and got a lot of history-babble that subtracted from the premise. I'm in the habit of finishing every book I start--and I found myself calculating the number of pages I would have to tolerate each day to get through it and on to some John Updike."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Mixture","review":"This book is definitely too wordy and technical to curl up with for some \\"light and fluffy reading.\\" I had to work at it, but came to respect how Eco incorporated a great mixture of storytelling, physics, philosophy, humor and history intothis work. Despite some parts that grew too technical for a math phobic like me, I very much enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled plot","review":"After reading the Foucault's pendulum I was scaredto read another book of Eco.

However, I was sadly disappointed. Having read other books by Eco, many of the philosophical meanderings contained in the text were not unexpected. But unlike his previous works, many of the long-winded descriptions of philosophy, scientific thought and theology in this text felt out of place. Rather than contributing to the plot, as they did in Eco's previous novels, they simply served to slow down the pace of the novel and leave the reader trying to remember what the book was about in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enormous disappointment","review":"I generally enjoy Eco's work. Name of the Rose was one of the best novels I've yet had the pleasure of reading. Focault's Pendulum was a little overdone, somewhat meandering, and ended poorly, but was nonetheless an extraordinary blend of the fanciful, the factual, and the metaphysical that left the reader uncertain where one ended and the others began. This book, to be frank, sucks. The parody carries the book for about 50 pages, the remainder is an exercise in boredom, meaningless (if occasionally amusing)ancillary tales, and a conclusion that is even more pointless than the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco fails - Not up to his other novels","review":"The tale is confused and bloated. The Island of the Day before comes across as self-indulgent and would have been better left in manuscript form.I am ardent fan of The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum, yet if this had been my introduction to Eco I would never had read those books.This book is I am afraid to say uncaptivating and frankly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and winding, needs some sound editing!","review":"Gets worse with each page despite a promising beginning.

And so on, page after page, same big impersonal building on the left (in black and white), exact same building on the right (in color). If anything, it's a testament to the consistency of stone and marble.To be fair, there are a handful of interesting (if standard) images: the swamps around the Lincoln Memorial, the early Capitol building, the White House with sheep, the old stone house at 17th & Constitution. But really, I've seen these before and they certainly aren't enough to justify the book.At least it's a nice looking, well printed book. I'll leave it on the coffee-table for now.

If you are not familiar with the concept, old photographs of particular street corners or buildings are contrasted with corresponding current images. The author displays his detailed knowledge of the area as he recounts stories that accompany each set of photos.Due to the consistency of some of the buildings in Washington, D. C., the main difference between pictures of a certain structure from 100+ years ago and today is only that one is black and white while the newer one is in color. But some locations have been dramatically transformed over time.Any student of history and especially people interested in Washington, D.

I enjoy Lorna's focus on ecology, health, culinary history . . . as well as gadgets. I'm more or less an everyday cook, who is more interested in putting dinner on the table than spending time in the kitchen. When I saw \\"The Pressured Cook\\" published, I began to use the pressure cooker to cook meat as well.

However, after skimming through and looking at many of the recipes, I did not want to try any of them. In addition, I did not want to have to figure out how to convert the recipes from this book that used older pressure cookers to my more modern one.

Maybe more avid pressure cookers will like this but as a \\"newbie\\", I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This didn't work for me","review":"I am not experienced with a pressure cooker, let me say that upfront. I made several of these recipes. They were largely complicated, took a long time to put together, and required ingredients that I had to spend some time looking for at the store. To me, this defeats the purpose of a pressure cooker. For the time it took to make some of these, I might as well have done it in the oven or the stovetop. I am interested in fast, tasty meals from the pressure cooker, not gourmet pressure cooker recipes. If I want a gourmet meal, I know how to fix one the regular way. Unfortunately, the dishes, after all the effort, were very bland.

If you're at all curious about Indian cooking, pick it up... it's why I bought a pressure cooker in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful cookbook!","review":"Discovery of the pressure cooker has been one of the best things that ever happened to me as a cook. I regularly serve these dishes to guests and they almost all universally love them. The Chipolte chili, Andoille w/ Collards, and the gumbo are all staples in my household!!! The Lamb Vindaloo with some modifications to really make it more like Korma is restaurant quality and regularly makes it to my table.Beans cook in no time flat, rice in less, veggies in less than that.

This CD finds the great pianist Rudolf Firkusny with Laszlo Somogyi conducting the Vienna State Opera Orchestra in Dvorak's Concerto in G Minor, op. 33. Firkusny had unique insight into this work, having been a pupil of Janacek's who was in turn a good friend of Dvorak's. Firkusny has made several recordings of the Dvorak Piano Concerto (see my reviews), but this stereo performance from 1963 sounds the best by far. Somogyi's recordings of the two Overtures and Rhapsody from 1964 are also wonderful and compare nicely to Kubelik's legendary accounts.

I didn't particularly like the shape. It made it harder to get to some parts of the nail. It was a little large. It didn't work any better or worse than any buffer I've ever used before. I was under the wrong impression of a buffer before I received it. I'd had a soft nail buffer, which made my nails shiny without sanding the ridges. This made my nails dull. Supposedly the polish goes on better with smooth nails. But the polish I applied didn't stay on any longer than normal. It was nice to have different sides, with different levels of roughness. But I wouldn't recommend this to friends and family. It didn't really impress me over any other nail buffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I received this product, my nails were ...","review":"When I received this product, my nails were in need of some attention due to extra work I'd done around my new home. I found the buffer very easy to use, and the block shape makes it easy to hold. It worked very well at smoothing ridges and spots on my nails.

He chronicles his travels and his inner journey of initiation into an ancient Tibetan Buddhist ritual of purging negative tendencies.

But it is a little bit to large for a 15.4\\" laptop. I have my Dell Studio XPS 16 in it and it still has a good inch and half of play in the top. The sipper pocket on the fron is great to store things in and it seems to keep everything nice and safe. I wish it had some sort of handle on it though, but then I guess it wouldn't be called a sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for travelling","review":"This case is great for carrying my laptop in a backpack and I like the front pocket for storing the power cord and a mouse.

Though we are both happy with the red color and the smooth material, and the thoughtful zipper protection pad inside against any scratch, it is a bit weighty and feels like a wet cloth, not keeping rigidity around the opening-zippers. And, the lady will have to get used to inserting the laptop with two hands carefully.I also have 15.4\\" HP laptop and mine(other brand name) was a snug fit and it doesn't move around once it is zipped, but, with this case Logic sleeve, I am slightly worried if her new laptop would get scratched shaken inside.The outer pocket with two zippers on both ends is big enough to store the adapter and the mouse securely."},{"rating":"1","title":"screen cracked on second day","review":"i have a briefcase iwth internal padding & have used it succesfully with my laptop now for 3 years. on my first use with the caselogice however my screen cracked badly. whatever others say, & it is certainly cheaper than many, this is not the best protection available by a long stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this case","review":"This case was an excellent buy.

Very bad service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, BIG laptop sleeve","review":"Ordered it for the extra storage area (with it's own zipper) and I love that part about it. Could basically use it as a daily laptop case if you stick the power adapter in there.It's not as thick/tough as maybe some other sleeves, but in my case this is just for rare use or to cover my laptop if I need to throw it in a backpack/suitcase.It is a lot bigger than I thought, though. I saw the measurements and figured my 15.4\\" T61p with the 9cell battery would pretty much fill it up, but there is almost 1.5-2\\" of room in there length wise. It's not such a bad thing because it allows more stuff to fit in there, but if you want a firm/tight sleeve, make sure you take a close look at the measurements."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little-known comedic gem.","review":"Clifton Webb launched his famous \\"Mr. Belvedere\\" character in this film, which, in turn, launched a highly successful series of movies in the early 50's and a semi-successful sitcom in the early 90's. Webb's Belvedere is uptight, prissy, unflappable, and decidedly unamused in even the most farsical situations which, of course, adds to the fun. One can imagine Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock recreating the role. It's an early look at the new-fangled (at that time)concept of baby sitting, brought about by women's new freedom to explore options outside the home. Richard Hyden (the voice of the Caterpillar in Disney's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\") and Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West in the \\"Wizard of Oz\\") are wonderful in supporting roles as nosy neighbors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can children really love a man like Mr. Belvedere?","review":"The jack of all trades and self-proclaimed genius Mr. Belvedere is appealing enough, but can a stiff man with admitted contempt for children be truly loveable? None of his unconventional methods of child discipline would account for the doting behavior of the three boys, and that's mainly why I can't recommend this movie. Every character has their appeal, but as a group, it's difficult to believe they interact as well as they do. And the problems that do crop up are equally unbelievable: How could Robert Young be jealous of a rigid fop like Mr. Belvedere? The fantasy of an uber-nanny appearing mysteriously to enrich our lives and control our household is worthy of a suburban comedy like this, but the story here just doesn't use the possibly delightful premise as well as it could. The ending is much too pat without the absurdity that a Preston Sturges would make of it (like the dual marriage at the end of Palm Beach Story)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this on DVD yet??","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies and would LOVE to have it on DVD. It is Clifton Webb at his best in comedic form.The man had a way of making any role that he played a unique experience that makes a quality re-make of his role impossible. His approach in this movie that at times seems to be the only sane person in the household that he has rented a room in is classic comedy of a style that is slowly being lost in the modern movies of today.As the numbers of people that have a VHS player grows smalled, the chances of missing such a funny and well acted comedy will be lost if they don't get it on DVD soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy mood","review":"Did not purchase this move, although I do want it.It is a movie which I grew up with and still enjoy.Clifton Webbs' performance, as in many other movies of this kind, puts you in HAPPY mood.A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love old B&W movies","review":"and this one is a true classic,great acting,script everything!Clifton Webb is genius!!Maureen Ohara so beautiful and Robert Young make up a great cast and a true comedy classic,one the entire family can watch and will enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sitting Pretty","review":"Could not watch \\"Sitting Pretty\\"Sitting Prettyin the correct screen ratio (4x3)due to the fact that Amazon Instant Video streamed an incorrectly formatted version which stretched the image and cropped it to fit our widescreen plasma.

It has not aged well as I can understand why its reputation has grown through the years as it was not available, but it can now be seen and to watch it intoxicated as audiences probably were expected to in 1970 may dull the senses enough to find it to be more enjoyable than it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent product, bad seller","review":"I ordered this gas mask for my husband, who wanted to use it for a costume.

Nonetheless, while he's trying to fix her up so he can stop paying alimony and put up his share to buy the old neighborhood bowling alley, Rita, Gus' new girl; Dominic; Lee's new guy; Gus' friends and family all realize that Gus & Lee still care about each other and ultimately are still in love. Despite William Hurt's professore' performance you knew he was a heel and despite D'Onofrio being the really sweet pharmacist he is, you know that Gus & Lee only argue because of the passion they don't want to unleash due to the hurt they felt, still feel. They've known each other since childhood, for God's sake! I don't know if you have to be Italian or Catholic to get this movie, but it might help.

I found the protagonists unlikeable and cringed every time they started shrieking at each other. Dillon plays a commitment-phobic (wow, we've never seen that in a man before) ConEd worker whose main hobbies are banging his much-too-nice-for-him nurse girlfriend and yelling at his ex-wife, the lovely Annabella Sciorra.Solid supporting cast, though, with the ever-excellent Vincent D'Onofrio as a pharmacist most any woman would fall for and Dan Hedaya as a ConEd co-worker. Both make the most of the thin material they're given to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casting Error, Big Mistake!","review":"This is an utter failure as a romantic comedy. It is not romantic, nor is it a comedy. The fact that anyone would choose a sullen Matt Dillon over the obviously desirable Vincent D'Onofrio is not to be believed. It is only because of Vincent that I gave it 2 stars for the 6 or 8 minutes he appears in the movie and brings it to life. Vince is always excellent and compelling. He could have made something of the title role, but it was not to be. The audience's loss, I fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful \\"feel good\\" movie!","review":"The characters in this movie grow up and grow apart.

It was 1971 and Ella has recorded it live in 1972 in her Jazz the Philharmonica concert at the Santa Monica Civic.

(I first got into the game via Hell on Earth.) Well, this book will give you some background on Faraway from the folks who were actually there. That's it's main value to me. Beyond that, it's the standard Deadlands class book. Quite useful, new edges, hinderances, and abilities. And, of course, the special adventure just for that class at the end.

Very easy to understand, cool production, good special effects and pretty bloody gory with some nudity!!!!I think this movie is a mix of Evil Dead and Night of the Living Dead, but this story is WAY MUCH BETTER than Evil Dead and of course with better acting, cast, quality and special effects. The suspense is very look alike to Night of the Living Dead but of course the make-up is BETTER, no black and white picture and this time the zombies are UGLY demons that are harder to kill.P.S: The best of all is that the intro is the same as the tv series!!!Adios."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern day classic","review":"Any fan of the series can appreciate this movie. This isn't just a 90 minute episode though, a lot of thought went into the plot.

I'm almost positive they are exactly the same and I thought it was a interesting touch to add to the piece since the requiem mass is one of my favorite Mozart pieces and is very emotional and dramatic.

Fallen was amazing, touching, and inspirational. I listened to many of the songs on that album 100s of times. I searched and found every other song Evanescence ever released and listened to those too. I went to two of their concerts. More than one of their songs has brought me to tears. In many of those songs it seems as though Amy was compelled to expose her deepest feelings through song under pain of death. She sang her heart out, you could hear it in her voice, you could hear the feeling. No song on \\"The Open Door\\" asks to be listened to more than once. There is no energy, there is no emotion, there is only a bland, predictable, and absolutely \\"perfect studio\\" Evanescence sound. AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow-up, but needs time to grow.","review":"Everyone and their mother wants to compare this album to Fallen, and rightfully so. Fallen was amazing in every way. As another review said, Linkin Park-ish and dark.TOD is different however. Shedding their Linkin Park ripoff label, Evanescence seems to have returned to their darker roots - their older stuff. This album sounds more like \\"Even in Death\\" or \\"Away from Me\\" rather than \\"Bring me to Life\\".Not to say that this is a bad thing. Unfortunately, those, like myself, who were expecting a hard hitting Fallen part 2 will find that this album will take some time to grow on them.The music from this album really grabs you when/if you get to see them live. My appreciation for the album didn't hit until I heard \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" and \\"Lithium\\" from the stage. Pure gold.4 out of 5 stars for the departure from the norm/expected yet still making great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben, why didn't you leave the band sooner?","review":"I'm shocked, I mean, for years I loved \\"Fallen\\" because I really though it was the best Evanescence would come out with, great vocals, great guitar solos, awesome lyrics... Everything was great then, but now my eyes are open. \\"The Open Door\\" is a masterpiece and no matter what some so called \\"Fallen\\" fans say, this album takes Evanescence into another level, where you find bands like Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and Within Temptation. All I have to say, thanks Evanescence! Ben, believe me, we won't miss you.Masterpieces:- \\"Lithium\\" - \\"My Immortal\\" seems so ridiculous now.- \\"Lacrymosa\\" - Mozart, you would cry now, wouldn't you?- \\"Lose Control\\" - An \\"avant-garde\\" song, unique and diferent.- \\"The Only One\\" - More melodic than any song on \\"Fallen\\".- \\"Your Star\\" - Evanescence became finally huge!\\"Fallen\\" seems a total garbage now, \\"The Open Door\\" is here to stay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album!!","review":"This is the best album I have ever listened to.

In this album, Amy Lee and company have shown a much greater emotional and musical range, and this is much better than the merely above-mediocre outing in Fallen. Also, it seems that this album is missing some of the artistic conflict of the last album. I'm glad they've finally chosen whether they want to be a hard alternative rock band or a Christian alternative band. I really don't know what to say other than that which has been said better by others, but for my money, this should win Album of the Year."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GOOD STUFF!","review":"Lots and lots of positive and negative reviews about this record in a comparison sense to their previous work it seems. Honestly, I didn't know of any personnel changes to and/or from the band prior to listening to it three times through. Evanescence is the real deal. Enjoy! Five Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Open Door","review":"Evanescence's sophmore release, The Open Door, shows the band going into a more mature direction. It seems that the band was given liberty to experiment with some new elements and sounds to give the album more depth than the debut, Fallen. With that said, the songs aren't as \\"catchy\\" as their songs from previous albums. Hopefully, people will be able to look past this in order to get what the songs are all about. In conclusion, for those reviewers below comparing this release to bubble gum, pop stars, they might want to take a listen to what this album actually sounds like. In other words, you're making yourself look like a fool in front of other reviewers by saying such misguided things! Your comments make you sound as if you've never listened to The Open Door to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment..","review":"The result is musically dull melodrama with nothing to give it worth other than Amy's fabulous voice. Considering how good \\"Fallen\\" was and how long fans had to wait for the second release, this is a huge disappointment. Because, bad songs, bad sound and bad product. That's not OK.I suspect the change in line-up has a lot to do with this; the real musician/songwriter obviously left the band. I suspect that this is the last we will ever hear from Evanesence. Hopefully, Amy Lee will do better with her next project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Second (Third) Album","review":"I loved Evanescence's first album Fallen and their previously unreleased album Origin. My biggest fear since being a fan in the early days was that their fame would have them churning out sub standard music. And now that's happened. This album is ok. It's not terrible but it's lacking the soul that they used to have. This feels like a mass produced album to make money rather than a heart felt musical expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanescense tries, but doesn't deliver","review":"\\"The Open Door\\" is one of those albums that you really try to like, but I obviously can't take it. Amy Lee's vocals are deeply personal, but sometimes a little too personal. It seems like this album mostly showcases her break-up. Also, there aren't enough rocking tracks. The only two I noticed are \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" (which I am getting sick to death of hearing on the radio), and \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\". If you want an awesome female goth band, I definitely suggest Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, or Queenadreena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escencially bland","review":"Upon receiving this CD in the mail I was anxiously awaiting to hear this long awaited sequel to \\"Fallen.\\" The first two tracks were good! \\"Call Me If You're Sober\\" is definitely one of the best from this band. Unfortunately, the tracks after it are not so good. \\"Fallen\\" had a very smooth flow to all of the tracks, yet each song had its own distinct sound. Not true with this CD. Tracks 3 through 13 sound all too much alike. It is about an hour of the same guitar riffs and Amy Lee's screeching. It wasn't long before I got a headache and had to take a break at track 10 or so. This glass-shattering CD lacked the cool theme and distinctness of their original album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on Earth Happened?","review":"This album lacks all of the heart-wrenching emotion of the first one. The whole thing seems forced and unnatural; I am truly disappointed; my apologies, Amy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a genius!","review":"Amy Lee is fantastic--far from overrated! What a great album--not only is she a prodigy in terms of musical composition, but her lyrics are poetic. She puts on a great live show, too--real stuff. Any rock guitarist, like myself, would be lucky to be in her band. She's a feminist--get over it. ;) Everybody should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Who could forget about their debut album?Smash hits like \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Bring Me To Life\\" were brought to the light by the Daredevil movie. From then on, the hits kepts on coming with the likes of Going Under and Holding My Last Breath... in short, \\"Fallen\\" was excellent.\\"The Open Door\\" doesn't even compare. Long gone are the power melodies and soul touching lyrics. The songs are just plain and bland. The only songs that I thought were fairly decent were \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Like You\\". If I had to rate the other songs out of 10, none would score over a 5.It strikes me deep to say that \\"The Open Door\\" was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, did the song just end?","review":"During the first spin, when I finally noticed I was on track 5, I literally said to myself \\"Oh, I thought that was a damn long song.\\"The point is, there are some points in this album where the songs just blend together. Considering that 2/3 of the writing team is gone, the lyrics are quite \\"simpler.\\"BUT, Evanescence haven't lost their kick-derriere musicality. It's just lyrically speaking that I'm whining about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Alanis does the woman scorned bit better. Songs are all on the same keel; no variety. Lost power and originality this time around.Anyone want a slightly used CD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off.","review":"The opening riff of \\"Even in Death\\" is a direct rip-off of the riff in Rob Zombie's song on the Beavis and Butthead movie soundtrack (you know, the music to Beavis' trip in the desert). I don't mean it sounds kind of like it, I mean it IS it. Shame on you, Amy. Quit trying to sound like a cheap imitation of all the great female fronted bands from Europe and quit ripping other people off. If Evanescence is your introduction to this kind of music do yourself a favor and check out The Gathering, Within Temptation, After Forever, Beseech (incidentally, Evanescence's logo looks suspiciously similar to theirs), Amaran, Epica, Nightwish, Asrai, To-Mera, Theatre of Tragedy, Leaves' Eyes, Elis, Edenbridge, Drain STH, Collide, Tapping the Vein, Draconian, Stream of Passion, Ambeon, Ayreon... and that's just a start. Once you've heard all these bands I think you'll agree that Evanescence is only the tip of a much better iceberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cacaphony of Crap","review":"Only one star because 0 is not an option. Hmmm, Lets see here! An Over-emotional, whining, drama queen front person backed by a tragically unimaginative NU-Metal band. Why is everything she sings sound like whining. I actually owned Fallen and there were a few choice tracks on it, but it was the long winded, drawn out, sanity peircing vocals that forced me to throw it away, couldn't even give it away. The same goes for The open Door. The direction may be a little bit different but its just as bad, only now she sings multiple tracks over herself which kinda gives the impression that if she was any more full of herself, there would be 100 of her. Not to mention the fact that just one vocal track was annoying enough. So, as the cover suggests, Magical Mysterious Commercial Goth Queen enters a huge magical smokey doorway to Narnia, Someone should close and lock the door behind her! Enough already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Evanescence still!","review":"I can't say enough about this album that hasn't already been said and when I saw the band it was on this tour in Atlanta at the Lakewood Amphitheater. I was totally blown away by Amy Lee's performance having at that time no knowledge that she was an accomplished pianist. This is the Evanescence I will always remember for the rest of my life. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"mp3","review":"This was an MP3 download and it was great to review the songs prior to purchasing the album. Good one to listen too. The download was fast easy and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Door is a pleasant surprise","review":"No, this is not \\"Fallen\\", but somtimes I like to listen to music when I don't feel like crying my eyes out. It is still Evancscence, but not quite as deep and dark. However, Amy's beautiful voice still comes thru, and for all you darkside lovers, there is track #8."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Open Door - Evanescence","review":"I will keep it short and to the point.1. This is a very good album2. No, it is not as good as Fallen3. It seems to be a little more focused on Amy Lee's voice and just doesn't seem to be the same quality music or lyrics as Fallen4. This is still a very good album and is worth the purchase, just do not get your hopes up too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monochromatic Goth","review":"First, let me say that this is a very good album. So good, in fact, that it's easily better than 3/4 of the cookie-cutter rock that's out today. Amy Lee's haunting, ethereal voice punctuates the roaring guitars and thundering drums perfectly (\\"Snow White Queen\\" and \\"Cloud Nine\\" are excellent examples) -- but she's also capable of putting together a much softer, more intimate cut like the exceptional \\"Good Enough.\\"Having said that, however, there's a disturbing lack of variety when you listen to the album as a whole. Each cut is very good on its own, but they start to sound very similar to each other on a complete listen. Unlike \\"Fallen\\" with its tremendous peaks and valleys of unique sounds, this Evanescence album is the foothills that never quite reach the same heights or valleys of originality.Still, a very good album and a solid follow-up to something truly exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome..A must have!!!","review":"The OPEN DOOR is AMAZING! Lithium is purely brilliant and I can sense a hint of influence from Danny Elfman. The melancholy melodies and beautiful voice of Amy Lee is mesmerizing. It is truly the best album in 2006!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't hear Amy","review":"Fallen is IMO one of the best albums ever -- a rare one where I find all the tracks enjoyable. I'm still far from fully understanding why I don't like The Open Door nearly as much, but there's one thing I noticed, and that's that I have to strain to understand what Amy Lee is singing. This is probably a major part of it. In Fallen I could enjoy the words, and I could enjoy her voice. In The Open Door it's all somehow drowned, by either the music or the effects, or at times it just seems she's whispering. In Fallen her voice was also overlayed with stuff, but at least she seemed to make an effort to rise above it, or perhaps whoever edited it seemed to realise that her voice should be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A twist in the music","review":"I admit that the style is different than Fallen but I believe that Fallen was more of Ben's CD, than a little bit of everyone in the band (i dunno i might be wrong) but if you are a true EvaneScence fan then you will accept the change, change is what makes us grow.SoEvery single song on this album is GOOD! this album deserves so much more than five lousy stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"When I first heard this album, I was disappointed. But this album has grown on me. I was disappointed because many of the lyrics seem very childish and stereotypically goth. I consider stereotypical goth lyrics to be very narrowminded, a \\"it will never get better\\" mentality, and your problems are everyone else's fault. On Fallen, many of the songs had a optimistic tone. There was a sense that she was going through a rough time, but that it will get better. This album seems to completely abandon that positive mentality.It is worth it to spend the money to buy this album, but don't expect anything billiant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Trash!","review":"This cd is nothing like Fallen, with the exception of maybe 2 songs. The rest of it just feels like it drags on and is just one extremely long song. If you liked Fallen, don't get this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Triumph of Mediocrity","review":"I don't like it. I try hard to digest how this group sells a lot. The tone of her heavy filtered voice is unacceptable and the compositions are totally uninspired. The repetition of nothing.Some people think that this Evanescene thing is some special kind of music, when in real there are other groups out there far superior in this genre.Try Listening to \\"The Gathering\\" from Holland. You will love Anneke's haunting voice.If you have normal hearing abilities and some taste in music or even better some adequate musical education you will see what I mean.Give out your money to the best and not to the commercial super market forgetable nonsense that has been promoted by the companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible album","review":"Sadly I was really looking forward to this album, how one group could go from \\"Fallen\\" to this heap of manure is really suprising. First of all this isn't a gothic album, heck its not even a rock album. You could easily place Christina Aguilera's picture on the front of this CD and sell it as her latest work without any problems.If youre a fan of pop (Britney Spears, Aguilera, Ashley Simpson etc) then try listening to a sample of it, otherwise if you have a decent taste in music steer clear of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence...back and better than ever!","review":"I have been an Evanescence fan ever since \\"Fallen\\" came out. Amy Lee is a beautiful and talented singer. At first, after hearing \\"Call Me When Your Sober\\", I thought the CD might be good, but was it worth buying? Well, it totally was and I listen to it like once a week! Great job, Evanescence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect CD!","review":"This CD is the perfect blend of cultural, classical, soft rock, hard rock, and bluesy music I have ever come across. It exceeded my expectations, and I am a tough critic. I generally do not like every song on any album or every song by the same recording artist; but even on my first listen, I love every song on this album! I cannot describe how beautiful it is--you just have to buy it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Door is wide open by the end","review":"I must agree with the other reviews that comment on Evanescence's FIRST album, Origin; this is very much like that album. Origin is still by far the best Evanescence album....sadly it will never be available to the masses. If you want it, you're gonna have to DL it. Anyway on to \\"The Open Door\\" I got the bootleg about 3 weeks ago and listened to it off and on, stopping the album at track 7. After buying the album on release day, it's been playing non-stop. My personal favorite is 'Snow White Queen\\". The album takes some time to build up, and this where the door swings wide open. Every song after track 6 is everything I'd want Amy to sound like. I'm not saying go on a DL'ing spree, but if you have not heard Origin, try to find it now as it's a perfect compliment to The Open Door."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little old and a little new","review":"I didn't read all of the reviews yet, but I have to say I'm happy with \\"The Open Door\\". Being a long time Evanescence fan and actually owning almost all of the albums I am able to buy (for under $200 that is), and having access to some of their most early demos I give it my stamp of approval.It's not Fallen, but why should it be? So many fans complain of bands releasing the same old thing over and over again. This has a few of the usual themes, but for the most part it's fairly fresh. Call Me When You're Sober is a good song and makes a great single, a little different.I'm not sure what's up with the price right now but it's under $10 so grab it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album keeps getting better","review":"I've been a huge Ev fan since the beginning. Amy's voice is the best in the business and one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard in my life. I think this album proves that without a doubt. This album is better musically I think, especially the guitars. That has to be in part because of the addition of Terry. Then add the other band members contributions and it's magic. This album is much different than Fallen and I think that's a great thing. Every time I listen to it, I love it more and more. It does grow on you. I hope they get the recognition they truly deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost about to hear it...","review":"Well, I can only assume that the cd is great. Since receiving the cd, my wife has not taken it out of her car. I guess one day I will get to hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Just...no","review":"Why Ben, why? With Moody gone, well, Evanescence just isn't good. Fallen was an absolutely incredible, 5/5 album with it's melodic, beautiful, and haunting sounds. Amy Lee is an incredible vocalist, but she sounds the same through this whole CD, as does most of the music. Exceptions being Sweet Sacrifice (Possibly my favorite Evanescence chorus), and Call me When You're Sober. Those two songs are great, hence the 2/5. Without them this album would be a 1, or about .5 if it were possible here. It is not the same without Ben helping writing. For people expecting an album as good as or better than Fallen, well, I'm really sorry. Just go download Sweet Sacrifice and Call Me When You're Sober onto your ipod or MP3 player or whatever, just dont shell out the money to buy this whole CD. Just keep listening to Fallen and pray that Ben Moody comes back (though I doubt that will happen)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing..","review":"My title for this review pretty much says it all. The Open Door was a disappointing showing for Evanescence. Fallen was one of my absolute favorite cds, and I was expecting nothing less from this one. The songs were average, and the ones that were good, seemed like they came right off of Fallen. Over all, its an ok listen, but I'd just rather listen to my old one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment.","review":"Let me first say that I am an Evanescence fan. So it truly pains me to write this review.I can't believe this album took 3 years to make. I also cannot believe Evanescence actually wrote this album. All the songs are generic and bland. Listen, I have all the bootleg albums. I have their demo tracks. I know that even at their worst, they can do a billion times better than what we're presented with here. I get the distinct impression that this is nothing but a blob of corporate sputum branded with a name we love just to fulfil some inane contractual obligation. There is no soul. It is hollow. An abomination. I highly suggest you save your money. But, hey, if you like bland and generic, then you'll probably love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Door - CD","review":"When I first bought this item, I selected to have it delivered to my house in 2 days (for a little extra charge). It didn't arrive in time for me to give it to my sister on her birthday. It came 7 days LATE!! What's worse, they still charged me the extra fee even though it didn't show up the day they said it would. Poor service, poor delivery. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence - The Open Door","review":"Love this album- They had a hard time beating \\"Fallen\\" - Im not sure they accomplished beating the last album, but this one is really good too. Definitely recommend purchasing if you are an Evanescence fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This album is okay compared to Fallen. I really liked their songs which people I guess refer to as soft. I feel that the only hit they really have on this album is the sober song which has a lot of radio play now days. I would have given their Fallen album 5 stars. This one is just two, not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amy Lee Fans Only!!!","review":"It does not even come close to Fallen!! True, Amy Lee's voice is excellent, but the band itself is lost in the background. The music is so slow, lyrics good, but could use more fast music. I like only three songs on this CD and I am afraid I will not play it like Fallen. I wore out three copies of Fallen and to this day it is still one of my favorite cd's. True, Amy Lee is beautiful and so is her voice, but what happen to the music!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence rocks again!","review":"My favorite Evanescence CD is still \\"Fallen\\", but this is a worthy follow-up to that debut album. Amy Lee is amazing as always, and the songs are powerful. Not quite as many sing-along-type songs (for some reason the lyrics don't stick in my head as well as the Fallen songs), but still definitely a good production.Favorites? Lithium & Snow White Queen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it more everyday!","review":"The first time I listened to this CD it sounded all the same and did not inspire me as much as previous work from them. The more I listen to it the more I love this band. It sounds fantastic in my car and the bass really gets a good thump at high sound levels. Everything is top notch and I can't wait for them to come around or produce another CD. The added pictures and lyrics is a nice touch. Not many bands now put this much effort or talent into what they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This cd is one of the best follow up cd's i have ever heard!

READ FIRST!!!","review":"This album is lame, bland, and the production is horrible. First off this isn't Evanescence. It's a whole new band with Amy singing. This is like a David Lee Roth solo album after Van Halen. Or worse a Scott Stap solo album without Creed. Yeah it's that bad. Every single melody is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stretched out. So boring. New guitar player was in Limp Bisket, that should tell you how much he sucks. The band blows, songs are horrible,and its' just a waste of money. Why else is it selling for $9 ? lol. THEY ARE DONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the opera?","review":"Evanescence has become like listening to the opera. The piano can be used in rock music, but not in every song on the damn album.

If you want something that rocks, try Hinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please dont come back again never !","review":"This crap leaked 1 month before its release and it is worse than their first CD.

Along with \\"Fallen\\", probably the best thing to happen musically in decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I really loved 'Fallen', but this CD was a bit of a disappointment. The song writing was not as good as Fallen. I think it was nice to hear the orchestral instruments fused into the music, but the major thing I noted was that Amy Lee was dropping her voice lower than it was capable of going and it sounded horrible. On several occasions, she even attempted the range of an opera singer soprano and that did not sound too good either. The first album was flawless and Amy's vocals were right on target, but the fact that she pushed her vocal ability either higher or lower then what she is capable of ruined the album (for me anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Lee has a great voice, but this band is not my thing.","review":"I respect Amy Lee as a great rock vocalist. There aren't many females in the hard rock genre that I enjoy listening to. Her voice is just hypnotizing. That said, this is not a bad cd, but it is a bit too mainstream for my taste. To me, Lacuna Coil, Flyleaf, and Otep are all better female-fronted hard-rock bands. So check them out. I give 4 stars for Amy's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another musical masterpiece","review":"Evanescence has delivered another compelling set of songs. I know the band has gone through some member changes and I was afraid that it would hurt the music. This album may even be better than the first one--if that is possible.Musically, this one is tight and theatrical in composition. I love the arrangements and on one song in particular--Weight of the World--It starts out with heavy guitars and Amy Lee's singing adds beautiful melodies to the song. Then in the middle of the song, the rest of the music drops out except for acoustic guitar and Amy Lee--so powerful. I love all of the songs on this c.d., which is rare for me. Lithium is another one that stands out to me with the piano in the beginning and then the rest of the band kicks in--really dramatic. Lyrically, the songs are deep and meaningful.Heavy music and enchanting vocals--it doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell Binding","review":"I love this CD.

It turns out that Evanescence impressed me again. Both Fallen and The Open Door are good, but The Open Door is even better, in my opinion. Most of the songs are more classical and complex, but there are still some catchy songs such as Call Me When You're Sober and Sweet Sacrifice. The songs are less suicidal than Fallen, and ends with Good Enough, a happy song. Call Me When You're Sober is about Amy Lee getting over her boyfriend. Amy Lee's singing also improved on this album, and she sings more soprano. I haven't heard The Last Song I'm Wasting on You, but I bet it's also good. If you like Fallen, then buy this album too."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've still got it!","review":"So much has been written already about this album, and many people have posted excellent, thorough reviews, so I'll be brief and to the point. If you like the work of Evanescence from their early demos to Fallen, you will be very pleased with this album. I thought they might 'mellow out' some, boy was I wrong. Just as \\"Fallen\\" grabbed me from the very first track, the same happened with \\"The Open Door\\". Powerful and consistent. A++ !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless.

He becomes friends with him and Andy tried to stop him but he wont listen. Now Chucky has a new victim....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a very good film","review":"At the end of the first movie, Chucky is killed. At the beginning of the second movie, you see Chucky being rebuilt. At the end, he is killed again. At the beginning of the third movie, you of course, see him being built again. Andy is now years older and has joined the military. Well, Chucky has tracked him down again. He begins to do his killings again. From the beginning to the middle, the movie was good, but the end was great. The end was the best of the three movies. It takes place behind the scenes of an amusement park, located just a few blocks from the military. The acting could have been slightly better, but still good for this type of movie. I have seen this movie many times and very much enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this movie was a big bore","review":"this had to be without a doubt the worst chucky film since the first child's play came out. i love chucky, but this sequal should have been thrown out the window. i mean the characters are kind of dull and chucky's attempt at black humor is sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst in the series, but that still doesn't let it down","review":"One of the most ridiculous plots I have ever seen, the way they resurrected Chucky was a complete joke.

This time around, Andy (now played by Justin Whalin) is grown up and in military school, and of course Chucky is once again re-built, and soon tracks down Andy in hopes of revenge and transfering his soul. The doll effects and gore are nice, but the acting is beyond lame, the killings aren't as imaginitive, and the story is beyond predictable. Brad Dourif is on board again as the voice of Chucky, but even his menacing growl can't save this installment from mediocrity. Followed seven years later with the more imaginitive Bride of Chucky, and the recently released (and beyond bad) Seed of Chucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chucky sucks in this sequel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie digraces Child's Play and Child's Play 2.

However, a young African American boy is now Chucky's new apparent target. This movie is another boring sequel in the already very tired series involving the killer \\"good guy\\" doll, but I did find the mock war scene amusing when Chucky substituted live rounds for the blanks they were supposed to be shooting...unfortunately, that's the highlight of this movie. This movie is again dominated by the recurring theme of Chucky trying to find a young boy so that he can live again in a human body...the acting is poor and the movie is boring. Unless you are a diehard Chucky fan, avoid this one along with the rest of the series which gets significantly and progressively worse from this one forward, unless you enjoy watching silly and downright stupid movies, not that I am saying anything is wrong with that. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does everyone hate this one?","review":"CP3 is the best of the original Child's plays.

So once I found out that my DVD player is PAL compatible I had to buy it so that I will have all of the Child's Play DVDs (I only have to get Child's Play 2 and The Bride Of Chucky). Child's Play 3 is only available on DVD in countries like the United Kingdom, Scotland and Austraila.I first got my DVD player because I couldn't find Child's Play One on VHS in any store (to buy). All I could find it on was DVD. So I got a DVD player and my first DVD was Child's Play One.If you haven't seen the Child's Play series I suggest renting the series from your local video.

The one saving grace is the Deep Dish Gladiator Remix, which manages to show some talent in remixing. The two Lost Witness remixes (a radio edit and a full-length), the DJ Tiesto remix, and the Space Between Us Mix are all pretty commercial.Because the Deep Dish remix was beautifully used by Sander Kleinenberg on his Global Underground Nubreed mix and Deep Dish's own YOSHIESQUE II mix, I would suggest getting it from either of those. There's no need to buy this single which carries mostly commercial nonsense. Take the DJ Tiesto mix. Would you trust a man who still plays trance years after it's gone out of style to remix any contemporary track? Other DJ's such as Sasha and Nick Warren have moved on, first to progressive, and now on to a new style with tech-house and breaks influences, but Tiesto continues to flog his dead horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPOFF!","review":"Being that im joining the Corps in a month, I figured that I would absorb as much information via dvd and books as I could.

If I plugged the usb with gps running in while the laptop was running, it crashed the operating system or tried to reload the driver. Never could get it to download or upload waypoints with Delorme applications (Streets and Topo), so it was useless to me and I returned it.

But then the very next song is a emo/pop rock song. Then it jumps into a hard metalcore song. I mean if you only listen to odd # songs the CD isnt bad. But through out the entire disc, it jumps back and forth everyother song. I mean i feel like i'm listing to CDs here. I mean the emo crap is just about as bad as Eighteen Visions \\"Obessesion\\". For a bad that put out a amazing album in TBYB, and a pretty good album TFWL. They threw everything away and completly lost there minds.

I love the fiction we live and to bad your bueatiful but i cant stand the new album. Its not because the \\"style has changed\\" its good when bands change, otherwise thier sound gets stale, however FATA did not do thier \\"new style\\" good. Every song starts out with a cool riff but as soon as the vocals start it goes to a cheesy half-assed riff with no creativity. Aside from horribl lyrics, lack of enegry and prety much the end of dual vocals for FATA, the general sound of the guitar and bass in this album was cheep at best.

They play wonderful and you can see them working hard to achieve these result. Many of them put all their bodies into their playing. Some of them, especially the oboist and a woman playing the clarinet make pretty funny faces while playing - yet this is not unusual, but normally you dont see it because in a concert you sit in front of the orchestra too far away to see such details. In this recording they show the soloists or the sections of the orchestra that play the dominant parts from nearby. So the camera too works following the composition, knowing precisely who plays what in a certain moment. When it comes to the solo part of a horn player you can see him play from nearby, when the timpani plays you see the player (mostly in his chair) doing his rolls. And it is the best audio recording of Mahlers 5th I ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks for the cd of bang tango","review":"i listen to it everday i can i play it at work in my car in my house and i like it i mite get 3 more so i can havee ttttttthe colectionof it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"This was advertised as 0 gauge and it turned out to be HO gauge.

Poor design is my best guess for the cracks and I sadly had to return it. Because of that defect and other quality issues that other reviewers seems to have written, I decided not to risk another problem and get a refund.

Now I understand The part is on back order until October. I'll be out of operation for 5 months. Doesn't that seem unreasonable to you? My only option is to buy another machine, (not Delta) wait for the part then sell the Delta.By the way, I did get a coupler, but not from Delta. I got it from Grizzly.

I do a lot of furniture making as a hobby and as a result was looking for something to make mortise and tennon joints quicker. This product worked very well and the bits seem at least adequate. I have not cut enough mortises to determine how long they will last, but I have cut at least 60 into hardwood with no dulling noted.The unit ships with an extension to allow thicker material to be used. This requires removing the machine from the base and installing the extension. Not something you would want to do on a whim. The handle is easily repositioned for optimal use and the overall assembly is very stable and comfortable to use.I'm not a big Delta fan, but I have been very happy with this product. During my first project, I cut 48 mortises into Cherry in about 2 hours. Every one was perfect and dry assembly proved the cuts were consistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent machine","review":"Assembly is straightforward, though compressing the hydraulic cylinder to mount it is not mentioned in the instructions. It takes some force, but you can do it by hand.You do have to keep an eye on the depth of the drill relative to the chisel. If the drill bit isn't in REALLY tight, it can back out a bit when mortising dense hardwood. Then you'll get the chisel making premature contact, and that will probably shorten its life.The instructions that come with the device could be better. I think Delta assumes that pros are buying these things, and underestimate the \\"New Yankee\\" factor.Even given these relatively minor complaints, this tool rocks. It makes a difficult and time-consuming manual operation a simple and fast power operation. Well done. As long as the chisels hold up, I'll be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipping Damage","review":"Cons:Waited over six weeks after placing the order for delivery. Longshoreman strike in CA.Upon unpacking, I found the cast iron support column was broken in half at the base. Delta shipped a replacement for the broken part. It was the wrong one. Delta then shipped a new mortiser.Upon assmebly and first use, the threads in the suppot column stripped out when the depth stop set screw was tightened. I have since had a friend rtap the stripped screw hole and place a threaded insert where the set screw should go.Pros:Surprizingly accurate rack and pinion fence system. Minimum set up required to achieve accurate mortises.Drills clean mortises in hard woods such as pecan and oak. More than adaquate power.Mimimal clean up with a chisel after mortises are drilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time saver","review":"I bought this thing about 12 years ago from the Tool Crib before they became part of Amazon. Like any dedicated tool that I own, I've learned how to cut a mortise the old fashioned way, with marker and a hand held chisel and mallet. After I bought my mortiser, the difference was like daytime and nightime. What a time saver it is, not counting the clean cut that it make's. I don't use that thing that often since carpentry is only a hobby to me, but I'm always glad to have it when a project call's for it. Used it again last fall to build a tv stand/cabinet.For the money, this mortiser is well built, come's with 4 chisels and bits, doesn't take that much space since it's not really a tool that you need very often, unless you were to run a production line, and in that case you would probably need to invest a lot more money for maybe a Powermatic or top of the line. Just a good tool to have around when the time call's for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bench Mortising Machine","review":"I have had my Delta Mortiser for about three years and I am sorry that I bought it almost from day one. The on/off switch went bad then the handle broke at the hub assembly and the quarter inch bits snap almost imediately. Delta wants fifty two dollars for replacement the quarter inch bits each. They will not sell just the bit itself, you have to buy the chisel too. Ever since Black and Decker bought Delta their quality and ethics have turn me completely off.

(UPS). The operators manual is very straight forward, assembly was a breeze. It took longer to remove the cosmoline than to assemble the mortiser. The operation of the mortiser is very good, drills good square holes Handle is long enough to apply the proper amount of pressure. Fence operation is very nice (rack and pinion), excellent clearance to change the bits. I'm very pleased with the mortiser so far and would highly recomend it. Also amazon is a very good company to do with. In the past when I've needed customer service they went above and beyond. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same Old UPS Issues","review":"The box arrived mostly intact. When I opened it though I could see the styrofoam had taken a beating. The machine appeared to be undamaged so i completed the simple assembly and tested the machine. The following day I noticed a crack in the base of the Column. I will see if Delta will just ship a replacement column.One other issue is the mortise depth with the smaller chisels. It seems that with a 1/4\\" bit (only one tested), due to the length, a mortise cannot be cut to a depth of more than 1\\" off the base. So in 2\\" stock you would be able to go no more than 1\\" deep. This is an issue with stock that may be 6/4, or for through-mortises. I guess a nice square, parallel backing block between the workpiece and the base would take care of the problem. Since the instruction mention through-mortises I assume they are possible with the larger chisels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not shippable by UPS or FedEx","review":"Since I am 2 for 2 on recieving broken units I would not recomend purchasing unless shipped byt truck.

I was NOT rewarded - the third shipment had pieces of cracked housig and was worse then the prior 2 shipments.

The box was broken on the corner, so I was afraid that I too would suffer the shipping disaster that has plagued too many who have purchased this machine. I guess I'm lucky, because the mortiser had no damage.Set up took less than 30 minutes, and it cuts nice, clean, straight mortises. A little tweaking to get it fine tuned, and it's ready to go. Easy to use, good manual, and heavy duty (by modern standards) construction. Overall, it's a great buy for the $200 price. Best machine for the money I've seen, especially after looking at the Shop Fox and others with wooden bases.If you have the patience to wait out the long shipping times, the guts to take a chance on it not being destroyed, and the need for a good mortiser at a great price, buy this thing. It will make a great addition to your shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited and waited...only to get a broken tool","review":"Like others who have posted here, I received a broken mortiser in the mail. It did not appear that the box was damaged, so I thought all was well. However, upon opening the box, I saw that the casting had snapped in one location. Judging by the material exposed by the crack, the casting looked as if it was of poor quality. I returned it for a refund and will be looking around locally for one that I can be sure is in good shape when I take it home. Don't be fooled...this is a common and serious issue. No one likes to waste time shipping broken tools back and forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another damaged shipment","review":"I ordered this item dispite the previous reviews about damaged shipments thinking that they were the minority and I would get lucky. Well...the machine arrived in a box that was in great shape and I was optimistic until I opened it. The housing was cracked at the dovetail joint just as described in the other reviews. It is either a defect in the manufacture or the method of packing by the manufacturer. I don't feel that Amazon or UPS was at fault for this. I returned it for a refund.Do yourself a favor. Find a reputable retail store that sells the mortiser either assembled or in a box that you can check immediately.

Unable to raise or lower the head with the handle, I removed the head from the stand. Upon examination of the gear mechanism I discovered that the pin that holds the gear to the handle had sheared off. I had not really stressed the machine at all so the failure was inexplicable. I've never been a fan of Delta tools and this experience proved my worst fears. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"cast iron column broken in two in shipment","review":"Delta, if you are reading this, the problem of cast iron breakage is in your packing...there are two reasonable and economic ways to fix your problem.ONE..use a minimum of six inces of molded styrofoam at the edge of the base. A coulpe inches of styrofoam at the base edge is not going to dampen the shock on a unit this heavy in the event it is dropped. Even if it is only a foot or so....and or,TWO..disconnect the column from the base. You seperate the column and motor from the base during shipping and I think your problem is solved. Now if the unit is dropped during shipping you will not have the kinetic energy transfering to the column and motor which is brittle and top heavy. Newton's 4th law of motion still applies today...just remove the weak linkDelta, why do you take so long to address this issue???P.S. Sorry Norm"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap","review":"How anyone could give this sorry excuse for a woodworking machine a good review is beyond me. I suppose there are a couple of precision parts somewhere, but they are few and far between. If you are looking for a mortiser that will give you precision mortises after careful setup keep on looking. You will probably need to spend twice the money, but it will be money well spent not thrown away. The chisels are cheap, the mortiser has so much play in the column that you would be much better off cutting mortises by hand. I can't believe this thing says Delta on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality machine","review":"I don't have much to add to the other reviews.

I've made several pieces of Arts & Crafts furniture using a Harbor Freight machine and it did a fine job but I'm far from expert on this machine. All I can say is this is like going from a bicycle to a Cadillac and my trial runs were a pleasure. I played around with some scrap hardwoods and the mortises came out perfect. The only gripe is the manual was written for someone considerably less than my age with a whole lot better eye sight but I guess that's what they make glasses for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked on arrival","review":"As with others here it was cracked on arrival. in the same place where the motor part meets the column.

I have had to replace these twist claps with bolts from the hardware store just to keep working. The machine is underpowered at 1/2 hp and stops easily clogging on wood chips.

Some parts were just sitting on top of the box, as if they were rolling around in the back of the UPS truck. Screw were strewn about and nothing was even inventoriable. UPS shredded the whole shipment. However, I see that this is a recurrent problem. I believe that Delta needs to package the item in something that will stay together.

I picked mine up from a woodworking store 5 or 6 years ago and had no issues with packaging and assembling per everyone elses problems. My issues were the lever would bind half way down while trying to drill through and once I started drilling it was rather tough going. After many mortises the piece where the lever connected to the motor broke into pieces and it did take quite a while to get a replacement.

Like, how to uninstall the chisel and bit to remove the wood chips jammed in them. Of course, removing the chisel and bit ruins all your squaring efforts and you have to square everything again. And I learned to put a gorilla twist on the chuck in order to keep the bit from falling out of the chuck whilst you mortise away. I learned how to swing on a handle in order to get enough force to cut into the wood (Oh, yes, the chisels are honed and very sharp). I learned to cut my fingers when changing out the chisels or having to bang on the top of the drill auger bit to get it out of the chisel when it jams with wood chips, or more often wood CHIP.I don't have any problem with the actual quality of this albatross. It is heavy, roughly finished, and everything squares...again and again.

Sweatin 1 is too short and I don't like the floor exercises in Sweatin 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"I alternate this with the \\"Sweating to the Oldies 2\\" video. This one takes about 45 minutes and is mostly aerobic with emphasis on lower body (I really feel it in my calves!). This tape has excellent warm-up and cool-down. In comparison, the \\"STO 2\\" video takes about an hour and includes a resistive upper body workout and floor abdominal routine along with aerobic. I am a beginner, and these tapes seem just right. I SWEAT, but I can do it. If you are overweight or have a fairly sedentary lifestyle, Richard is a good way to start! He has a way of motivating you to keep with it. Both have the feel of dance routines, which I have found to be enjoyable. But he doesn't give a lot of instruction on the steps or warnings before changes...so it takes a while to get it down. But, even if I don't stay with the steps exactly, at least I'm moving & sweating - you will be, too! I always feel better after doing these videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff","review":"This is an aerobic video like the Sweatin' to the Oldies videos but with 80's music. The opening song is Celebration which I find really motivating. I'm still learning the steps but it's so much fun that I want to keep doing it. I'm a child of the 80's and I especially enjoy exercising to songs like Call Me and All Night Long. If you're like me and you hate the perky spandex clad instructors and the lousy elevator music on most exercise videos then you might want to give this a try. It's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Stunned","review":"This workout was really fantastic. At first it went pretty fast; I had never done a Richard Simmons tape before. First time, I was a little slow to catch and perfect all the moves, but by the second time I had it almost had all of (the 50 minutes) down. Now, I'm stuck and can't stop doing this tape. The music is paced fairly consistantly, but I never got to tired and was always looking forward to the next song. The scenery also changed every few songs from a park, to some shops, a club, etc. All the people were alive and I wasn't exhausted by the end and had to do the tape again.

Danielle Girard does an excellent job of building the story and the characters. This villain made the hair stand up on my neck and had me looking over my shoulder. SAVAGE ART is fast-paced, as the race is on to stop the murders. I missed my bus stop reading this book and give it a high recommendation for those that enjoy intense thrillers. I can't wait for more from Girard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girard really knows how to build suspense","review":"I will admit that this is NOT usually the kind of book I read; for one thing, it's a serial killer novel, and for another, it deals with the murder and mutilation of children. However, a friend gave me a copy and I plunged into this dark, dark tale. I think FBI profiler Casey is a wonderful character, and the book is so suspenseful that I could barely put it down until the chilling climax. But \\"Savage Art\\" is definitely not for the squeamish. It's pretty graphic and violent. Still, if you're a fan of Patricia Cornwell and Thomas Harris, I'd have to say it's a do-not-miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first effort","review":"Savage Art is a great first effort by a writer who will go on my list of authors to watch. Although the book's premise is complicated and the characters likewise, the book is a very fast read and almost impossible to put down. As a physically disabled person, I could relate to the heroine's internal conflicts about the injuries sustained at the hand of a serial killer. My guess is that the emotions she displayed as a FBI agent were realistic as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIA - Missing In Action","review":"It's been a whole month, and still no Jodeci CD.

Now!","review":"Their best album, amazing. (Forever My Lady is a fairly close second, and their 3rd album a very distant third) If any of the first 6 (all ballads) tracks came out as singles today they'd all (still) be hits, that's how well this album has aged. The second, faster half, some will pass on. It's not bad stuff at all, but you really have to be in the mood for it, it's very very dark and bassy. Interestingly, Timbaland, Missy Elliott and Playa all can trace their roots back to this album, so it's no wonder it's great. I ought to only give it four stars, I don't think this album is *perfect* but I like the first half so much I gave it an extra star. Like some of the other people who reviewed this album, I wanted \\"Lately\\" to be on here, but it's probably a more consistant album without it so I don't mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever My Lady II","review":"Forever My Lady was Jodeci's best album. Period. This one was a close second... VERY close, though. There are some classic Jodeci cuts here, which aid in defining the group's sound. This album solidified their ability to make infectious hits... and set Devante apart as a producer. Cry for you, Jodecidal Hotline and Feenin, What About Us, My Heart Belongs To You and Alone' were the best. The rest..are passable, but listen-able... but very sexed up.Still, Jodeci is second only to Guy in my book from that era of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album defined \\"Slow Jam\\" for the 90's","review":"Although their first album, Forever My Lady, contains the more radio-friendly classics \\"Come and Talk to Me\\" and \\"Stay\\", Diary of a Mad Band clearly set the standard for penetrating r&b drum tracks throughout the 90's. Seeing his disciple Timbaland going on to continue the legacy in 1999, it becomes evident that DeVante Swing's production skills were about 5 years ahead of their time. The beats on every single track still make me bob my head. And that's not even to mention the great vocals by K-ci and JoJo... But be prepared: unlike the Hailey brothers' pop hit, \\"All My Life\\", Diary of a Mad Band is strictly for those who love pure r&b jams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of a Mad Band !","review":"this album is absolutely GREAT! and is my favourite Jodeci album!! all the tracks are great and if you are looking for somethin' early 90's!? then this is a must have! and to them new fans of R&B;, you all need to check out Jodeci and get this!My Favourite Tracks are \\"My Heart Belongs To U\\" \\"Cry For You\\" \\"Feenin'\\" \\"What About Us\\" \\"Ride & Slide\\" \\"Alone\\" \\"In The Meanwhile\\" and \\"Gimme All You Got\\". there voices and the beats are like meant for eachother!! and i see not one reason not to purchase this, its definetly a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting sounds","review":"I had never heard this group's sound before a friend told me about them and I was pleasantly surprised at how talented they are and what a great sound they produce.

I thought this would be quite a controversial read, bringing to the table the intriguing issue of the trade off between majority rule and the total collapse of every African country that gained it. At the least I thought there would be more about the life of the last whites in Southern Africa. Instead the book's a collection of vignettes of various characters and seemed to be lacking any central theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right for the money","review":"This shop dust collector is just right for a small shop where it will be \\"working\\" on one machine at a time.

But with one machine working it has plent of pull.For the price I don't think you'll find a better dust collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogging issues with planers","review":"Out of the box, the unit would clod very quickly when attached to a planer taking 1/16 of a 4\\" board (something a 650 CFM dust collector should not have a problem with). The problem is caused by a crossbar in the 4\\" inlet which appears to have been added to prevent someone from sticking there hand up into the impellers. Longer shavings from the planer get caught on the bar and then in turn help catch later pieces. I could probably be sued for suggesting people fix the problem the way that I did, so instead I would suggest the slightly more pricy JET which does not have a crossbar. Another reviewer went up in size instead and I think that is probably overkill for most small, single operator, shops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy for the home wood shop","review":"I am pleased with the quality and value of this item.

God Bless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Do The Math","review":"I purchased this unit about a year ago and I love it. I run a professional woodshop and use it every day. I have it hooked to 6 different tools. All you have to do is when you run your hose place a blast gate before every tool. It has plenty of power to run two tools at a time. Which means I close 4 of them when not in use. Usually on the average day i use my table saw and compond miter the most so they are usually open. I also bought a flour attachment that i mounted in the middle of my wook table and it works like a down draft.Besides you could buy two of these to equal the price of one of the next size up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for a small shop","review":"This DC does a good job for the money. It's probably best suited for a shop under 300-350sf. I did find assembly a bit of a pain. Poor choice of hardware. Side supports are a bit flimsy until the brace goes on, almost mandating a 2 person setup. I added a particle separator from Woodcraft which collects the large chips and only the dust goes on to the bag. A clear collection bag would make it easier to see how full it is as opposed to the cloth one provided. Overall, it does a pretty good job for the money. Definately need this over a shop vac for a planer or other heavy chip producers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"30 micron bags this product uses makes it worthless for saws. It lets too much dust get through. Buy a collector with 5 micron or less bags or canister filter. The AP400 lets a lot of fine dust through the standard bags and blows it all around your workshop. I think this is a big health risk.If you get this collector due to limited space or power requirements, throw out the original 30 micron bags. Replace them with Delta's 5 micron bags, Penn State Industries (PSI) 1 micron bags, PSI canister, or Grizzly's 5 micron bags or canister. Any 14.5 inch diameter dust collector bag or canister will work.Works fine for a planers and jointers. They don't generate fine dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for tools running on 220V power","review":"This 1HP collector was barely okay when I was running a contractor saw, DeWalt planer and Rigid 6\\" jointer. (one machine at a time) Since I upgraded to 220V planing, jointing and sawing power, the collector has proved itself useless. Constant clogging of the intake port (at the cross-hairs underneath the impeller) and not enough airflow to extract certain heavy shavings (poplar, mahogany, etc) from ejection ports of the specific machines (planer, jointer). This leads to constant shutdown for manual extraction. You will be severly disapointed if you try to run heavier duty equipment on this machine. It is possible that my ducting runs were too long, but I doubt it. (See some of the Fine Woodworking's reviews on collectors to confirm my situation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor problems!!!","review":"The motor started smoking on initial start-up. We're not talking about a little bit of smoke - we're talking enough smoke to fill my workshop with a thin fog! Thinking maybe it just had something to do with the break-in I plugged it back in and tried to start it up and the motor was seized. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement right away (had it in 2 days to be exact).I set the replacement up and the same thing happened to the new machine!!! I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money and paid for the return shipment. They said they would contact their distribution center and stop shipping the units. They also allowed me to substitute to the JET model as well. 5 Stars for Amazon, 1 star for the Delta AP400."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"This product has exceeded my expectations, however, this is my first dust collector so I don't have anything to compare it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanx to Delta","review":"Tnaks to Delta for stopping further distribution of this machine. Like some of the other owners who complained of seized motors, mine did the same. But I use my only very seldom so the machine was out of warranty when the motor burned up but it had less that 1 hour of use time on it. When I checked about replacing the motor I found it costs over $200. The machine didn't cost that much. This was my first (and last) piece of Delta Equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dust collector!","review":"This is a good dust collector, and is a must if you are using a planer or table saw. It is relatively quiet and efficient. The only downside is the 30 micron bags which tend to leach a bit of fine dust into the air. But for the price of this unit, it can't be beat. It comes with a good quality 5' hose, which is adequate for most operations. The stand is very solid and mobile. Since it is on castors, you can position it next to your work. This is the perfect DC to run one machine at a time, and I would not hesitate to buy it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta Dust Collector","review":"I've had this about a month and think it is great. My major piece of equipment is a radial arm saw and it beats the shop vac I was using hands down. I have plans of hooking it up to several small machines with blast gates. I'll only be using one at a time and don't think there will be any problems. The only negative I really have is the same as some other reviewers. The shipping stinks. If I had been home when the package arrived I would have refused it. To my surprise nothing was missing from the broken open box and other than a little scuffed paint there was no damage. While I like to scuff my own paint on a new item it wasn't that bad. Although it isn't Amazon's fault that the box was torn up in transit it will make me think twice about ordering such a large item from them again.So far I really like the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I tried using this unit on a jointer and planer and it could not handle either of them without clogging.

Don't get me wrong, Scott Weiland came from the grunge era and I love that music, but this is straight rock n' roll from guys who simply know how to do it well. From the first song with sirens that you love to hear and expect, to the last song on the album, this is phenomenal rock for those who are tired of commercialized anger (staind, linkin', hoobastank) and are ready for the ride once again. With the exception of three solid, yet unexceptional ballads, every song piles on the guitar riffs and Slash solos that you've been missing since the Use Your Illusion albums. As opposed to the Audioslave grouping that I was disappointed with because it was more a dramatic change for Rage, this is a great melding of what made STP and GNR great bands...surpasses expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock albums in a long time.","review":"This is actually a great album. Every song is consistently strong. Scott's vocals are solid. Slash's ability seems a little held back by the band. His killer blues style is restrained and overpowered by very heavy guitar riffs. Some soulful solos would add nicely to the mix. However, from what I read, a heavy sounding record was their goal. So congratulations; you've succeeded. The rock riffs are solid, and a breathe of fresh air from what's on the scene today. For such different backgrounds, their sounds mesh together well for something new. ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure rock, n' pure roll","review":"You want your fix of true rock n' roll and not this pansy Nickelback crap on rock radio now, this is the best 'new' CD around for that fix.

But when i bought the cd, I decided it was old rock legends making excellent music for a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"Although the music is ok, the CD is not worth buying. This CD prevents you from having control over the music that you paid for. It will only play in a CD player. You cannot easily play the music on your computer. Playing the cd on your computer requires an internet connection to a server which is likely to be unavailable or to busy to connect. There is plenty of music that is equally good or better that will not cause you this much hastle. I suggest that you buy that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I guess nothing could live up to the hype- great musicians from great rock bands pulling together to ROCK! But it feels forced. Slash sounds like he's trying to remember the opening to \\"Sweet Child O Mine\\" at the beginning of several of these songs. Overall, the record lacks any dynamics. From the get go, it's in your face riffin'. That's cool, up to a point. Even AC/DC new how to mix it up when the gettin' was good. Scott is also missing the great melody making of STP. His ability to both melodicize and rage has been lost in the mix. The result is kind of like Alice in Chains on a hangover.Better luck next time. Yes, I do hope there is a next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Play - Suncomm Copy Protection","review":"This CD does not play in my car, nor can I copy it onto my iPod.

There is really nothing memorable about it, I can't really explain why. It feels empty. Whenever I listen to a good rock album, I get a great feeling with every good riff. But with this, it's like elevator music or something, just playing in the background.Plus the CD is all copy protected, which is just a nuisance since you can get it onto your computer anyway.

However, Velvet Revolver is a disaster... floating to survival on the basis of record company promotional hype. At first, I was excited by the prospect of this new band due to its heritage. Unfortunately, the reality is a botched surgery with no inspiration.I think purchasers of this album might be a bit brainwased by MTV and their local craptacular rock station.

What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WILL NOT play on your computer","review":"The band is great I'll give them that, but the software on the CD prevents it from being copied to your computer. You cannot even play it without being asked to answer an agreement that invades your privacy (meaning everytime you play the track they'll monitor what you do with the track). The only way you can hear the music is through a normal CD player. Food for thought: if WE as the consumer but the CD legally we should at least be able to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as GnR or STP, but still good","review":"I really like this album. I don't get what all the hating is about. Granted, it is very loud and all the members are fighting for \\"center stage\\" that it makes it sound like pure chaos, but i really like that for some reason. I think Axl Rose has a great voice and was an amazing live performer....when he was there to perform. Slash is overrated, but still better than Hetfeild. Matt Sorum is one of the best hard/heavy drummers i have ever heard. and Duff \\"Rose\\"McKegan is without compare. Scott Wieland wrote better lyrics in STP, but his vocals on this album are amazing. And dave kushner really play's his guitar like it's his last day to live and all he want's to do is play.One word of advice...skip Fall To Peices when you're listening to it. Go straight to Set Me Free. Slither is truely the best track on the album. It's hard, heavy hitting and it's got a great riff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!","review":"Every bad review I have seen has come from someone comparing the album to previous G N' R and/or STP stuff. Why do that? This is a whole different animal and it's one hell of a snarling beast! This band has a lot going against them and their music comes out fighting. Buy this album & you won't be disappointed. If you get the chance to see them live, take it. They rock so hard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"As a hard rock fan since the 70s I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately I lost interest after about the 4th tune. This is corporate rock at it's most boring. It reminds me of bands like Boston or Journey- just a bit harder. It seems that these guys need to recharge their bank accounts after not doing much since their respective glory days. Try Opeth or Clutch if you're looking for kick-butt rock with a creative touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Great to finally hear ROCK again","review":"This, in my opinion, is one of the best rock CD's to hit the shelfs in the past decade, which is what you would expect when you put together STP's Weiland with members of GNR. The songs that really caught my attention were Big Machine, Fall to Pieces, and Headspace. Big Machine is just a great rock song with a catchy guitar riff. Fall to pieces is one of the greatest ballads ive heard in a long time, and Headspace is just another case of old fashioned rock, the way its meant to be played. I love this CD so much because it has the sound of STP, with the unique and great voice of Weiland, while still incorporanting the great instruments from GNR. Slash has multiple guitar solos that are unforgettable, and you just dont hear that anymore. I would definately recommend this CD to anyone who even remotely likes rock of any kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Could Use A Remix","review":"Overall, I like this album; good songs and good music. I noticed quite a bit of vibrato in most of the music, which gives it a sort of a shred sounding feel. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but I personally feel it takes away from what could have been a \\"Back In Black\\" debut experience for Velvet Revolver. Maybe a remix could tone down the vibrato to smooth out that grating, fluctuating quality in the music. Other than my minor gripe, it's a good album ... I just think it could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contraband Rocks","review":"The best of G'N'R and STP have one of the best debuts in Rock and Roll in a long, long time. Scott Weiland is in fine form, and Slash is the master shredder of hard rock, pealing off killer solo after killer solo, without the the fickle Axl to bring the proceedings to a crawl. Anxiously awaiting chapter 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"why revisit the 80s","review":"I thought the CD was okay, but after seeing this band live I realize it is just regurgitated 80s rock. G n R were okay, as was STP. but the seperation of those bands should have ended all there careers. what made these people good in there time was a combanation of more than a just few things with their original bands, Both Wieland and Slash dont seem to be very capatibal with one another. its almost as if they are running on some hogwash script for 12 year old and little girls. a dire shame to see these people sink to this level"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets 2 and a half.","review":"You think would'nt you with Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots) and the lads from Guns n roses could make a record a bit better than this.It has its moments and is worth a listen, but after all the radio plays its got, its just darn annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I heard the song, saw the video but damn if I havent been suckered. Slither is the only song on the CD worth listening to. The rest of the album is crap-no good riffs, rythms or harmonies.

Metal has changed and there's no place for fossils."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Rock 'N Roll Swindle","review":"This album is nothing more than rehashed STP and GNR cliches. Looking for innovative, groundbreaking rock? You won't find it here. Rather than moving forward, Velvet Revolver are merely living in the past, and it sucks. Guys, 1987 called; they're sick of you. Feel free to join us in the year 2005 anytime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR DAMN MONEY!!!","review":"This is the worst CD I have ever owned. Id rather listen to Hanson.

Originality maybe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"so sad","review":"Stone Temple Pilots Scott Weiland=GOODVelvet Revolver Scott Weiland=BADIf you want to hear some awesome Scott vocals stick to STP, it's your best bet.

I miss the old school, grunge vocals of Scott Weiland. It just breaks my heart, man :( *sniff sniff* I suggest STP's \\"Thank You.\\" It's a great collection of their hits.

This program will make the tracks into Mp3's for you. As for the album. It is literally camped out in my diskman. It may not be the absolute best material from these guys and the song order could use a little more work, but on the whole I love this album. Please don't judge this horse too hastily. Some of the songs take a little time to wrap your mind around, but once you take that time they become quite enjoyable to listen to. Give Velvet Revolver a chance to wow you I'm sure that their next album will blow your socks off like an atom bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical supergroup drivel","review":"Typical...first song released on radio gets your hopes up...then you hear the rest of the cd...what a letdown. I swear, if I hear \\"Fall To Pieces\\" one more time on radio, Im going to switch to talk radio. Nearly every track on the cd is bland and unmemorable. I swear I tried to like it. But I just couldnt. I ended up giving the cd away. Are there any groups made up of former members of other well known bands that end up being good? I think its a proven formula that this setup only produces one thing...pure crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hard Rock Record","review":"This is a Great Hard Rock Record. To that guy or girl who stated that Pearl Jam was better than GN'R & STP, Please!! Pearl Jam is making music that doesn't matter. Edie Vedder is a Joke. Now that I got that out of the way, this is a truly great Hard Rock record. From start to finish this record rocks! I'm so sick an tired of the rock bands today who only care about endorsements, owning their own restaurants, and getting movie deals. There are no great rock bands today.

I should have expected it, there was so much hype surrounding this band, but calling them a \\"supergroup\\" just because it contains members of GNR, and Scott Weiland is misleading, and is false-advertisement. Slash's riffs are okay, but Weiland's lyrics are more bizarre than ever, and really don't fit the groove or the melody of the songs on the album. I think the GNR guys are just too heavy a rhythm section for Scott Weiland, and these guys just don't fit together. What Scott Weiland needs to do is get real, and call up the Deleo brothers are reform STP, and come back stronger than ever. Slash should just go back to the Snakepit, and the other members should go back to being family men, or studio musicians, or maybe Slash should get them to play in Snakepit with him. All I know is that this album stinks, and I don't see the next album being any better. What a joke of an album and a band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music - bad software","review":"I really wanted to like this album, and I do think it's pretty good....music wise. However, it contains software copyright protection that will mess with your computer and you can forget about bringing along your favorite tracks on your MP3 player because it won't let you!!

Do the record companies think that this silly copy-protection is going to prevent these MP3 from being traded all over the internet? All its doing is punishing the people who actually paid for the CD. This also makes the downloadable version better and more enticing. If anything, silly copy-protection manuevers like this are only going to promote internet theft. This makes me want to download it off the internet (even though I didn't particularly like the music) and make sure that everyone I know also pirates it off me, just to protest this kind of stupidity. Didn't anyone learn from what happened to Metallica's career after Lars' Napster crusade?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weiland+Guns members=Dissapointment","review":"A friend of mine bought this right after it was released, he is a huge Guns N Roses fan, where as I'm a big a fan of STP. When I asked if I could borrow it, he said I could keep it, an obvious sign of someone not impressed. I tried to like this, I really did. But it seems to me that the band just threw a bunch of riffs together to make songs, riffs that are all mediocre, and then phoned it in, so to speak. I guess this music does fit in with contemporary radio-friendly rock, because it really is boring and lacks substance. A sad statement of the current rock scene.

The DRM software developed by a British company First 4 Internet is poorly written and provides no means for uninstall. The software, known as XCP, indiscriminately hides registry keys.

As an iPod user, I can't add this CD to my player, and what is more bizarre is that they're selling this album on iTunes. Then why in the world did they add this copy prevention software to the original CD?I understand the record companies wanting to stop free internet distribution of their music, but this is a little rediculous.The 1 star is for the frustration with the copy protection software, the music is actually really good. It's one of my favorite CDs out right now, along with mr.deviant's \\"Techno Obsession\\" which is a great mix of power rock and hard dance music for killer instrumentals.

But, when I drop that much cash on a CD, I EXPECT TO BE BUYING IT TO USE AS I SEE FIT. Like an increasing number of music buyers, I like to file my CDs away safely and keep the music on a large computer hard drive or portable player. CDs made like this one do not let you do this!I feel bad for the artists, because I wonder how much say they have in this.

It's been a few years since some true rock has been playing on the radio. When was the last time you heard guitar solos?

Get it, and see for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese Democracy Has Nothing on Contraband, if its released","review":"This album is everything i expected its the best of both bands. Guns N Roses were supposed to be the next Rolling Stones... well Velvet Revolver can do it they have the sound and the attitude to do it and in the video for Slither Scott has the moves. Axl has got to deliver on Chinese Democracy. Slash and the boys threw this together in 2 years and Axl has been working on that CD for what almost 10 yrs now?? His CD better do tricks or something to impress me like this CD does. Now I'm tired of people saying they sound too much like Guns or STP... You know Why?? Because ITS THE RYTHM SECTION FRO GNR AND THE LEAD SINGERFROM STP of course its gonna sound like those two bands. But its Not guns and its not STP its Velvet Revolver something totally new from the artists dealings in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"album of the year","review":"I'm gonna make this short and sweet -- This album has definitely met my expectations, maybe even surpassed them. After the first listen it seems somewhat mediocre, but after a few more times through it really grows on you. The tracks that stood out most for me were the slower songs -- Fall To Pieces, You Got No Right, and Loving The Alien (Sometimes). They stand out especially because they are surrounded by much heavier and faster songs, but this is a good thing. I have a soft spot for slower ballads, and the ones on this album are amazing. You can tell that Scott Weiland truly gets into these songs emotionally. Also Slash has beautiful solos on those 3 songs. Other tracks that stood out were Sucker Train Blues, Dirty Little Thing, and Spectacle, which are all faster-paced rockers. All in all, great album and I'll be looking forward to more from these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Hold Shift... Not Hard","review":"Anyone who knows anything about computers should know that, when you put in a cd and something pops up, its because of AutoRun. You can turn AutoRun off in device manager, or just hold shift to bypass it. AutoRun is the only way the music industry can put security on a cd, so if you turn it off, it can't run any security programs off it. They can still screw up some cd burning programs, but you shouldn't be burning it anyway. It's not that hard, people... HOLD SHIFT. Then you can put it in an iPod or whatever crap you want.As for the music, it's a solid rock cd. Not as good as STP, or GNR I suppose, but it's way better than trash from bands like Creed, Default, or 3 Doors Down. The best tracks are Sucker Train Blues, Illegal I Song, Fall to Pieces, Headspace, Superhuman, Slither, and Dirty Little Thing. Get STP's No. 4 if you want an even better rock cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I thought","review":"As a big STP fan and a not so big GNR fan I was a little hesitant to get this album. I've heard Set Me Free on the radio for about a year now I was never impressed with it. But I went ahead and bought the album (only $10.99) and put it in my car stereo. After just one complete listen I have to say this is the best CD I've heard this year. Far and away. Its original and yet at the same time it doesnt stray to far away from where both bands came from. No, this is not STP or GNR. But you can clearly hear influences from both bands. Two of the best tracks are Falling To Pieces and Superhuman. Set Me Free by the way, which isnt all that bad, is the weakest.

Their music stems from the same influences that fueled the success of Guns and Roses and STP. I think that the absence of Axl Rose is painfully obvious during certain songs. The riffs are great. Slash continues to deliver. The lyrics are somewhat repetitive in almost every song and do not live up to the pasts of the members. However this is a potnetial rebirth for metal. Guns and Roses was one of the greatest bands in history. And while this can't live up to \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" it is better then anything any band has put out in the last decade. If you don't own \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" or \\"Greatest Hits\\" both by Guns and Roses, purchase those before buying this. If you liked those two you'll enjoy this throughly. Hopefully Velvet Revolver is bringing back the glory days of metal. This is defanately a step in the right dircection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the baggage, it's great ROCK","review":"Guns and STP were two very distinct great rock bands but Velet Revolver doesnt sound like them (even though I caught them in D.C. recently and Scott did a pretty good job on some GnR songs). If you can put the GnR and STP baggage aside what you have is a pretty great Rock album without all the annoying bells and whistles so called \\"rock\\" bands seem to need. If you get the chance, check these guys out live because it's a great show and you never know when Scotty is gonna end back up in rehab or a cell block so their time together is probably limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favourite album of 2005","review":"OK I know its not Guns and Roses or STP, ITS WASN'T GOING TO BE AND WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE. I bought the album from Amazon after being bombarded by 'Slither' on MTV and am convinced that it is the first equal to 'paranoid' or 'whole lotta love' of the 21st century. I listened to the album and after the 3rd time realised that you have to LISTEN. The songs are there, the melodies and choruses are classic but I think that the band and producer wanted the listener to work a bit harder than in the past, and I think it pays dividends. This album is a stayer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They still have it","review":"These guys still have it. There's a cool chemistry here and I hope they can generate a few more albums. It's not GNR or STP, but the music is hard, catchy and sincere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Wrap Ourselves in Velvet!","review":"I just picked this album up (dual disc version) and have not stopped listening to it. It definitely rocks and the DVD side material is a little disappointing. The enhanced stereo version on that side is the best reason to own this version. This band definitely rocks harder than most new rock music out there. It proves that these more experienced musicians make much better music. Whatever happened to Blink 182 or Nickelback - they must died like the wind.Scott Weiland still has a great voice and Slash really, truly is a master of guitar. I like the combination of Guns 'N Roses and Stone Temple Pilots as a group.Now for the guy who could not rip the songs off the CD. Is he an idiot or something? I have the secret, and do you want to know what it is? The secret is Musicmatch Jukebox software. I just ripped the songs into MP3s and I have had no problems with the songs and their sound. Now just put them into your MP3 player and you are set."},{"rating":"2","title":"STP & GNR's????? who would've imagined!!!!","review":"This cd rocks as hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this is the redemption of rock n roll in its purest form, from the beggining it just blows off the top of your head reminding you that rock is not dead, this guys took the lead(along with Audioslave) to bring back the old time supergroups, havent seen since the late 60's and early 70's.Thank god someone still worries about making really good music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully this CD will give music a shot in the arm","review":"This CD is killer. I don't understand the negative responses. Versus being a 'supergroup,' VR's first album is tight...giving the feel that this is really a band that is going to last and be its own entity.Perhaps it's just that I am getting a bit older (28 yrs. old), but most of today's music lacks substance. Lyrics are lame, the guy singers have these whiney voices and all seem to sing these anthems which get old quick. VR on the other hand, is going back to basics--reintroducing musicianship, passion, ferocity, to go along with some crazy riffs.Music needs this collection of old farts, and they've all brought out their best in the Contraband album. Buy it, and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some very soild tracks....","review":"First off I saw these dudes live in Boston and the were AMAZING!!! True rock stars in all respects.I grew up with GNR in my ears and was hoping for a little more of that sound. The over all feel is much more STP with an amazing band. Slash's solos and the song arrangements are much more limited than anything GNR ever put out ... and lyrically it gets a bit repetitive.But there are at least 7-8 outstanding sounds and the rest ain't bad. Fall to Pieces is AMAZING as is Set Me Free. I miss Axl, and Scott sounds much stronger in songs where he sings rather than screams or bullhorns.Over all a solid debut. It does rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music but do not buy this!","review":"They need to find a better way to stop sharing. I very rarely get time to listen to my CDs in my stereo. So I buy them, rip them to MP3 and listen on my MP3 player during my commute to and from work. Now, after paying 14.00 I cannot listen to my own CD! An outrage! Also, if you put it into a computer it opens its own program and will not play through Media Player or Real Player. And...when you put it into a computer it loads hidden software on it and then will not play in any other computer! I am sure someone has figured out how to make MP3s by now so just download it and you will have more freedom with the files than if you actually paid for it. Unreal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Velvet Revolver and call me in the morning.","review":"Brethren: I have watched for the past decade or more with great contempt and disgust at all this \\"rap metal\\", \\"downer rock\\", and corporate \\"anger and angst\\" that has been polluting the airwaves while being fraudulently passed off as rock and roll. What a travesty.Enter Velvet Revolver: L.A. jackhammer rock at its finest!GnR meets STP for something harder and leaner. These guys are for REAL. This is a shot in the arm for what has been ailing the music scene for FAR too long now. This is what true rock and roll is supposed to be: dangerous, craved by kids, hated by parents and feared by old people.LONG LIVE ROCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY","review":"I waited far too long to pick this album up. Scott Weiland truly shows his experiences and emotions during the past years through his lyrics, and I can't talk enough about the rest of the band. Matt Sorum puts out some original and insane beats that he wasn't able to display in the early 90's, and Slash is his usual genius-self. Not to mention how Duff subtly carries almost every track with his underlying bass. Intros resembling Rage Against The Machine combined with guitar riffs that bring you back to the days of acid rock definitely creates an amazing debut album for this band. GO BUY IT NOW.Preferred Tracks: 1,4,6,7,11,12"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong singer","review":"The music rocks. The lyrics and vocals are ridiculous and annoying.Very disappointing choice of a singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, all 13 tracks","review":"Just got it today and just finished listening to the whole thing once. I wasn't a STP or GnR fan so comparisons with those bands doesn't mean much. The band sounds full, sophisticated, experienced, authentic, not as raw as the best of the good punk bands, but hard rockin'. I know each time I hear it, it will be better each time. It's good to see old rockers survive and revive. It just makes me so much sadder than ever that Kurt Cobain is gone. What would we be hearing from him now I wonder? Cobain was THE voice. Chris Cornell second, Steven Tyler third, Chad Kroeger fourth, and this Weiland guy is good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds It's Own!","review":"While not the level of \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" the tunes on \\"Contraband\\" hold up with the best of anything on Guns' \\"Use Your Illusion\\" CDs. Scott Weiland is the perfect choice for this allstar jam, hopefully this unit won't implode like Blind Faith or Derek & The Dominoes. I especially liked the ballads but the rockers on here are no mere bombast. Docked a star for derivitive of STP somewhat. If nothing else it shows that Slash was and is and will always be the genius and heart behind Guns 'n' Roses. Get busy Axl, it's gonna take some doing to top this set!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music OK, CD work is very bad","review":"For the music, Velvet Revolver is great. Good sound, singing, and lyrics. However, the CD itself is horrible. The geeky people behind the technology of the album suck. I can't listen the album in my computer. I can't see the extra features it brings. It always crashes my computer. It's a poor job.If you want the music, download it at legal and authorized places like iTune. Don't buy the album, it's not worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sucks, dirty language or no dirty language!!!","review":"This album was by far the biggest dissapointment of 2004. Given the personel present on this record, it should have been incredible. Instead, the members of this group, formerly aquanted with glory, have released a disc filled to gills with, well... filler. there is nothing memorable on this album AT ALL.Usually I complain about record censorship, even if a record company releases both a \\"dirty-words\\" version and a \\"No dirty words\\" version, as it usually represents to me a comprimise and perversion of the art. However, This disc is so devoid of any art, meaning, or originality the lack of \\"offensive words\\" really has no bearing on the end result of this product.This recording is terrible. I would use a lot more dirty words to discribe it, but as this is a review of the edited version, I shall refrain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The much anticipated team up of Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland with former Guns 'N Roses members Slash, Duff, and Matt Sorum seemed like a better idea on paper than the actual product. As a band, Velvet Revolver tries to blend both elements of STP and Guns 'N Roses with alternative hooks and power ballad melodies; but it doesn't mix. \\"Set Me Free\\", a teaser track featured on last summer's Hulk soundtrack, is just that: a teaser of what kind of album \\"Contraband\\" could have been. \\"Do It For the Kids\\" is a rocking track, but the power ballads are stale for the most part, and where are the thick and heavy guitar riffs from Slash that we all expected and hoped for? It's still worth a listen, just don't expect anything as profound as the material that these guys have put out before."},{"rating":"1","title":"david poopa","review":"when you look you see right through me!?!?!?!!!!! just another generic rock band based from other bands just like Audioslave. this album is nothing special and not worth buying!!! !!!!Slash is atleast a great guitarist,that is all i can give them... ps THE RASMUS ARE COOL hahahahahah just kidding"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of talent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What a dissapointment! Being a big fan of GNR and STP, I was really excited about this album. Slither is a great song, but the rest of the album does not live up to the hype. All the songs sound very similiar (which is not a good thing). Take a listen yourself before spending your cash (wish I would have). Anyone want to buy a like new Velvet Revolver CD, only listened to once. I think I will list this one on ebay, like the last STP album which was another major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"Wow, been looking foward to this CD for a while.. What a dissapointment. It's completely boring and unoriginal, not necessarily bad, but not a single song stands out either. These guys sound like a third rate Alice In Chains, which is sad, but Im not entirely surprised. I was never a huge fan of either Gn'R or StP, but I at least appriciated both. CD is over produced... Too much going on. Lacking decent basic melodies. These guys are trying too hard, the whole effort just comes off as phony. Sounds just like any other nu metal crap to me.. Linkin Park and Puddle of Mudd fans should dig it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money","review":"I'm not a kid so don't think I'm some 10 year old who is mad that this isn't G-N-R or STP. This cd has to be one of the most disappointing releases in recent memory. The music is at least 2 notches below the aforementioned bands. Weiland never really convinced me on his talent as a singer and doesn't do anything on this to make me feel any differently. Slash, oh Slash, what has happened? Where is the air-guitar worthy moments? Drumming is terrible, I listen to alot of Rush so that doesn't help my overly critical side when it comes to drumming. Let me put it this way, this is an average, if lucky, album. Nothing stands out to me but a few things do irritate me. Oh well, I'll go back to listening to Rush and Floyd, I would even recommend the new U2 cd over this and I thought it was just above average. Listen to the samples and if at anytime you find your nose twisting, don't buy it, because there are many more of the nose twisting moments in your future if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That Over And Over And Over Again","review":"Cock rock with tunes galore, just not very good tunes.

My grade: C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs and riffs spoiled by bad mastering!","review":"Was looking forward to this release due to the persons involved. Yes, the songs and the whole concept is great but if you are thinking of listening to this on anything more advanced than your car's CD system forget it. It's another loud, dynamically flat mix that doesnt let the music breath. Shame all modern releases seem to be done this way.

I was really looking forward to this CD until I found out that it has copy restrictions. Purchasing a CD with copy restrictions (even easily defeatable restrictions) tells record labels that consumers will accept this erosion of their rights, and allows them to more easily introduce further restrictions in the future. If I can't backup the music that I purchased and convert it to whatever format that I wish, I'm not interested. It really makes me sick that Velvet Revolver would support this.

I make mix CDs and travel CDs from discs that I buy.

I have given the CD three good honest listens and can't recommend it to any one, let alone have any desire to make copies for my children. I understand the artists not wanting their intellectual property copied and their music and hard work given away, but to install software on the CD to prevent this is just plain insulting. Maybe if record companies lowered their prices and paid the artists in a more timely manner people would not steal music.

I bought it cause I been getting requests for it. The music is OK, it isn't great. I can't honestly say that any one song jumps out as a hit to me. Part of the problem could be that because I use a computer as a sound system and I'm limited to some of the worst quality WMA files I've ever heard instead of MP3s. VR has decided to put some lame butt anti-copy turd on the disc that forces computer owners to use them. To make matters worse when I tried to close the player it locked up my system.This is not good for me because I do a lot of DJ work and my system runs on a computer. There's no way I could play this disk on the system at my gigs because I can only use the nasty WMA files and I worry that it will lock up my system at the gig.

Even though there are some very good songs here (Do it for the kids, Sucker train blues, Slither, Loving the Alien, etc..), the album lacks charisma. Slash does not have a good guitar tone throughout the album. His playing is not unique anymore. It feels like he's trying to imitate exactly what he did during his years with Guns N' Roses. The riffs are not catchy enough and seem to be all over the place. Its a generic rock album. The only reason it has tasted success is because of all the star members. This album would be more on the unknown side if it wasnt for the ex members of GNR and a notorious drug addict lead singer. This is a \\"rock n roll\\" band that the music industry expects you to listen and buy. I recommend Silvertide over this.Highliht: Loving the Alien"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Guns N' Roses minus Axl...","review":"who was the real talent and star of GNR.

Whilst Slash and boys play some solid riffs in songs ranging from SLITHER to FALL TO PIECES, it is clear Scott Weiland is not the creative genius Axl is. Most of the songs are mediocre and lack the passion and guts of the old GnR songs. The lyrics are awful in most songs and tend to be very repetitive.If want a decent hard rock record go out and buy Contraband, but if your expecting to hear GnR do yourselves a favour and avoid dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i had previewed","review":"after hearing the first release from the album, i was excited to purchase what i thought would be a rockin' cd. unfortunately, there are only two good songs on it and it's not worth the purchase, in my opinion. the boys have definitely slowed down and lost their edge in the past few years. if you're expecting the cd to reflect the sounds of the original release, i suspect you'll be as disappointed as i was."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this is a horrible albumvery very disappointing....they need another vocalist who can singand slash needs to lay off the hotdogsonly good track...NONE! dont buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been So Much Better","review":"The most obvious comparison for this band is to Audioslave, the other supergroup to form recently. This is necessary because Audioslave set a perfect example of what a group like this should be, while Velvet Revolver failed. Where are Scott Weiland's deep vocals from STP? Where are Slash's amazing riffs and solos? They get lost in the confusing assault of sound on this album. They were too ambitious in trying to create a new sound. They should have done what Audioslave did in taking the amazing music of RATM, and combining it with Chris Cornell's vocal and songwriting talent, and not trying to fuse them together until they find the right sound, which they clearly did. Contraband is a mess of noises that don't really seem to flow together, but there is so much potential for this band. By the way, does anybody else notice that \\"Dirty Little Thing\\", and \\"Sucker Train Blues\\" are almost the exact same song?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album Overall","review":"First off, to the people completely bagging on the album, grow up, I will admit that it should have been better, the Slash solos were not there like they should have been.

No matter whether you listen to the CD in the car or at home, it seems like you're listening to it through one of those cheap 1 speaker boom boxes purchased from a drug store in 1983. There is absolutely no range, and because of this the whole CD sounds very flat. However, the music itself is a breath of fresh air to those of us who have been force fed garbage that MTV considers rock music since 1993.

Scott Weiland cranks out lyrics like a power saw hitting a tree. Strong, clear, and seem to tap into some things of his checkered past. Slash still is Slash, and if you are like me, and are dying to hear what Guns N Roses would sound like today, this is it. The band is mature, knows what sells records, and doesnt try to fall into a music clique.This isnt some cheap throw together to make a buck like Motley Crue is doing now. I wish this band got together a few years ago so they could have a few albums out there of great stuff to listen too.Buy this album, listen to it all the way through a few times, and you'll love it!Rock N Roll isnt dead!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over the band member's names","review":"Yeah, we have all heard all four of these musicians before, in their own projects. You have to understand that they don't want to sound the same as their counterparts. You people who expect GnR then buy a Guns and Roses album. You want STP then buy a STP album. If you want a band with singles like the ones we have heard like \\"Slither\\" then buy this band. If everyone would just listen to this band as a group of four people that we don't already know about, we would be a much happier group. There is a lot of talen in this band. Great guitar riffs, decent song writing, tons of power behind the vocals. This CD is wonderful, and it doesnt sound like any of the bands we have heard before, which for me is a good thing. Get this one, and their next, 'cause they will prove that people still like good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear Channel Riff Rock","review":"This album doesn't blaspheme Guns n' Roses or Stone Temple Pilots in my opinion, but I'm not infatuated with either band so that isn't saying a whole lot.The production on Contraband is just polished enough to remove all the soul from the songs. None of these numbers are all that well written either, so they definitely could've used some heart. Even the best cuts on here are generic enough to have been written by any pseudo-grunge practitioner on your local eagle nicknamed rawk radio station.My advice is to skip Velvet Revolver unless you're a fanatic of any of the bands these guys used to be in or you've just fallen in love with the stuff you heard on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"like fine wine","review":"There are alot of rocking songs on the CD. There are three slower paced songs, that are just okay, but the others really rock. (At first there are a few that sound similar - as if you were listening to a Rage Against the Machine album for the first time) There are alot of times where Weiland sounds like A. Rose, Steven Tyler, Vince Neil, and Perry Ferrel so that is alittle wierd at first, but you get used to it. Also, what I like so much about the album are the choruses; they are very similar to the latest Red Hot Chili Pepper's album with all of the harmonizing and whatnot.After listening to this, I can't really rock out to Appetite of Destruction like I used to. And I was never really able to rock out to any STP albums.Overall, the more you listen to it, the more you will want to listen to it, and therefore I give it 4 count'em 1-2-3-4 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"reasons to not buy this cd...#1. It's a horrible attempt by record companies to put a new label on old music and charge $17 again.#2. It automatically places a virus on your computer that affects disk copying (be it legal or illegal.) I just can't supoprt a company that is willing to sabotage it's fans computers.

Well, when I heard about this fusion of '90s grunge and '80s metal I nearly fell out of my seat laughing (not really). But really, Scott Weiland's a good singer, and Slash is a legendary guitarist. It should work. Does it? No, not really. I mean, Fall To Peices is okay, but everything else is just bland and boring rock. It's kinda like Audioslave, but only a wee bit worse. I don't see a real future for this supergroup, and hopefully Axl Rose will stop being whiny and reform GNR and STP will get off their extended hiatus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not awful but its Overated crap.","review":"C'mon, why don't they do something new and exciting.It sounds like you'd expect, Guns n Roses mixed with the voce of STP, and a lots of guitar riffs played over and over - boring.C'mon, STP and Guns n Roses were great bands who created a new sound.This is just noise though, nothing special, just boring.What the heak is the point of this band \\"Velvet Revolver\\".??? anyway?They do'nt do anything, and in a few years this album Contraband will be seen as just a hyped up record because the state of music at the moment is so fake and cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"irs not that good","review":"I love STP....they rule still to this dayand I love GNRplus I got this cd early from the Labeland for free!!!and I saw them live in Chicagobut sad to say but this cd is\\"cliche'd rock....at its worst, withthe worlds best spokesmen\\"a sad sad day................"},{"rating":"1","title":"hohum","review":"listened to it 3 times, and each time i think its boring, and not catchy.

I was hoping that this would be the \\"return of rock\\" that everyone was slobbering over. Instead, it is a bunch of tired, uninspired cliches that are basically excuses for Scott Wieland to moan about \\"tapeworm abortions\\" and sing f**k a lot. And I mean A LOT.Basically, the songs are horrible, the riffing and solos are tired, and the lyrics make no sense at all. I tried to like it, like I tried to like St. Anger.

There is so much hype and advance press out there for this CD and I have to admit I fell for it. I do not usually buy based on reviews but when Rolling Stone gave it 4 stars, plus the so called all star lineup, I bit. I would give this CD no stars if the choice was available. Remember what happened when Gary Charone (spelling?) teamed up with Eddie Van Halen? If this band is the answer to the current rock-n-roll slump we are in worse trouble than I thought. Not one song on this CD kept me from hitting the advance button. This is nothing more than a conglomeration of egos who are desperately trying to hang on to their rock god status. Based on the reviews here, a lot of people like this CD, so I will conclude like I started. Don't buy based on reviews or hype only. LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY.

You are leaving the innovation to others (like Shawn Fanning, creator of Napster) instead of being the innovators."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Album, But Not The Groundbreaker That I Was Expecting","review":"It is natural for expectations to run high for this album. Guns and Roses was one of the greatest rock bands ever, and STP was one of the best musical acts of the 90's. While \\"Contraband\\" offers some cool tracks in the form of \\"Headspace\\", \\"Slither\\", and \\"Set Me Free\\", it also showcases a lot of redundancy. Some of the riffs and hooks are recycled, and a few songs sport uninspired lyrics.While this effort doesn't equal that of the previous 90's rock band fusion, Audioslave, it is a great album, provided that you don't expect something that will revolutionize the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"GNR + STP = Brillance","review":"Scott Weiland is one of my favorite singers and songwriters of the 90's. When I heard that he would be the lead singer of the ex GNR members band I was excited. Hearing his voice with Slash's guitar. Amazing. I really like this album. The songs are really good. Slash, Duff, and Matt had the right idea of picking Weiland and this rocks. Favorites include Do It For The Kids, Sucker Train Blues, Illegal i Song, Fall To Pieces , Superhuman, You Got No Right, Slither, Dirty Little Thing, and Loving The Alien. But the rest of the songs are really good too. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the best debute album since apetite for destruction","review":"i am a big guns n roses fan i have every one of there cds.i was watching a gnr biography and at the end it mentions something about a new band called velvet revolver.i said what the heck is that.theni went on the computer and herd a sample of fall to pieces.it was great!the song reminded me of sweet child o mine.then i went to the store and got contraband.1.sucker train blues 7/102.do it for the kids 6/103.big machine 6/104.illegal i song 8/105.spectacle 7/106.fall to pieces 10/107.head space 5/108.superhuman 8/109.set me free 9/1010.you got no right 7/1011.slither 10/1012.dirty little thing 8/1013.loving the alien 7/1014.bodies 9/10this cd is a must buy for all guns n roses fans!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Group Super Great","review":"It was predicted that this band would save rock n' roll, and for me that's what they did. The combination of ex-Gunners with former STP frontman Scott Weiland is fantastic to say the least. If you like Rock n' Roll pick this album up immediatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great Collaboration...","review":"For those of you that give this album one star because your preconceived notions that \\"super-groups\\" are crap, all I can say is give the album a listen. Listen to it with an open mind. Leave Guns N' Roses and Stone Temple Pilots in the past. I'm saying this because I too had to realize this. I was given this CD as a gift, but I sat on it for a month before I even gave it a chance. I listened to it straight through and was blown away. The vocal stylings of the great Scott Weiland and the classic signature Slash guitar sound. My personal favorite track is \\"Loving the Alien\\". Definitely one of my top five albums of 2004.And for the guy that gave this album one star solely because he couldn't put the songs on his iPod... you shouldn't review albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rock album i listened to the past 10 years","review":"I was really surprised as how good this album is. It is defenetely the best rock album i have listened to in ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the F$#@ is Slash?","review":"Me like. It sounds good. A bit less of what I was expecting. The album sounds formulated, but not a bad formula. My only problem is that, the presence of Slash is not felt as much as his previous hard rock group G'n'R. I miss Izzy too. He should be here. But the rythm is still strong. There are some good songs, just not as many as I thought. They really should have tried some softer songs. Something like \\"Interstate Love Song\\" meets \\"Patience\\" would have been nice. But this is not Roses meets Pilots. It sounds familiar sometimes, but not often. Good buy. Hard rock, is a nice addition to a band like the Darkness and their album. Two good rock albums in a row. And they are new. Maybe real rock is back. If so, then this is the coal starting the fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty freakin good.","review":"I've been waiting for this album forever. I can't stand the new music these days, so it's about time we get a real rockin band. I had pretty high expectations, and Contraband didn't quite meet them, but still, there is not a bad song on the album. Scott's voice sounds a little too whiney sometimes, just like 99% of the new crap these days, but for the most part it rocks. My favorite song, and the song that got me hooked to VR in the first place, is Set Me Free. Slither is good, but I think people are overreacting to it. Loving the Alien was a surprise, and a good one at that. My other favorites are Do It For The Kids, Superhuman, You Got No Right, and Sucker Train Blues. The only bad part is all of the software copyright protection crap. I want to play the album in winamp mixed in with my mp3s, but the volume gets all screwed up when I do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buen CD esperado por los Fans de GNR!!","review":"SAludos!

Not horrible, but only slightly above average at it's best (Big Machine). There's no real catchy hooks. The lyrics aren't up to par with what Axl Rose could've written. It's just as mediocre as any of their solo efforts, the only difference is they have name value this time. Utterly, totally, completely, purely............. adequate. I think this is proof positive that they need Axl Rose more than he needs them."},{"rating":"1","title":"greatest rock band + decent grunge band= Nu Metal?","review":"I am really disappointed by Contraband. I heard Slither on the radio, and the endless hype of GN'R members and Scott Weiland when it was first released. Guns was a great hard rock band, and Stone Temple Pilots was a decent grunge band from the 90's. But, as over 10 years has passed since their heyday, the musical landscape has changed. Now, instead of valuing great musicianship and songwriting(GN'R), bands value no solos, using large amounts of profanity, and a lack of smart lyrics( Slipknot falls into this category). So, on Contraband, there are no songs that fall into the first category but falls into the second, sadly. The music is shockingly subpar and have a bad nu metal sound. Scott Weiland sounds terrible. It could be blamed because the same man who mixed Linkin Park, John Abraham, mixed Contraband. Yep, this is a supergroup- just like the disaster on VH1. Avoid getting this album if you enjoy real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgarities can not describe my feelings for this album...","review":"And its not very good too. How to word it, way too much hype, not enough to back it. It does have its catchy moments, but in the way that KISS musak is catchy, you hear it and it reminds you of something good, but you can't place your finger on it because it's not good.in all seriousness, when you put it to play, the first track is only so-so. nothing stands out, not even Scotts unique vocal style. It wasn't until the 4th or 5th track that I was even moved by it because it fell to the background and was forgotten about. Even then, it started out very cool, then fell dormant by the chorus.GnR, great band. STP phenominal, ahead of their time, at the time. Velvet Revolver, seriously, shame on you for taking ownership of this material.I don't know, if you like mediocre music, you may dig this one, but I guess I just expect more from a band whose guitarist name is an action, and their lead singer has been through rehab how many times now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The music rocks on a few tracks and that't the reason I gave it one star but creepy scott weilands vocals send it all down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, didn't we do this already?","review":"Ok, so Scott Weiland has this band, right?

Contrabands sounds have absolutely nothing to do with such bands nor Guns'n'Roses either, this is typical modern hard rock just the same as everyone else has been making in the recent years. Gladly there is also bands that still make the good stuff, for example try Hanoi Rocks come back album 12 Shots On The Rocks or Guilty Pleasures by Quite Riot. Velvet Revolver sounds like modernized bit trashy/punky version of Slash's Snakepit."},{"rating":"1","title":"#@$holes","review":"If you have a minidisc don't buy this cd.

STP was about average for mid 90's grunge (??!). This is not the worst thing you'll ever hear. It will be a big hit, then they will dissappear. It's nothing really, more of the same. Nothing dangerous. The Germs were dangerous. MC5, definitely. Metallica was exciting, Slayer blew the ears off my damn head, and Nirvana was right for their time-they said what needed said. These guys are professional musicians, plain and simple. This is a novelty. The garage band down the road that tries to cover these songs will sound better than this album. Heavy Metal is OVER as pop music, the real innovations are done by the kids playing around in the garage. Anyone can be #1 today, so ignore the charts. Buy the first few Grand Funk Railraod albums.

Somehow they took 3/4 GnR and 1/4 STP and got 4/4 STP minus anything innovative or good. The album is full of muddled songs with boring, dispassionate vocals and tired guitar riffs. The only STP edgeyness that comes out is in 'Slither', which can be written off as on STP parody. Where is the GnR? I don't know - I guess those 3 had nothing to with GnR's song writing because none of it is seen in this album. The only times I enjoyed this album was when Weiland sang his typical monotone vocal riffs ala Jim Morrison. The album is worth a listen but not worth a buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric's best. though his last","review":"This film may not be technically better than other Stanze films, however it does have the strength of innocence and effort. You can tell that they tried hard for this film, even Stanze.The plot is a decent, though underwritten one. It has the strength of originality, in the concept, not necessarily the story. The gore is decently done for a no-budget film. Makeup was terrible.

The storyline is derivative and badly scripted with lots of exposition delivered in the first thirty minutes by blank faced actors whose boring deliveries will leave you on the verge of falling sleep. Once the gore starts flying, the storyline picks up a little but is still an incoherent and largely uninteresting mess.

From the description it sounded like a good movie! In reality its got to be the worst movie ever!! I couldn't even hardly sit through it! The acting sucked. The Story Sucked. The Plot Sucked... Ooops I am sorry I made a mistake THERE WAS NO PLOT!! I wish I never would have watched it! Unless you want to see flashbacks of the main charectors mom giving herself and aportion with a coat hanger then I don't recomend this movie for anyone. It would have been alot better if daryl hanah's charector died in the end. At least then maybe you would get some sense of satisfaction out of watching it.....I am the only person I know that has atempted to watch this film and actualy sat through the whole thing. I thought 'well maybe it will make sense if i watch some more' I was wrong..... You would have to pay me at least $50 to sit through it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicca With A Celtic Touch","review":"Although I do not feel that this book was written from a very historically correct standpoint, overall I enjoyed the information contained within. If you're looking for information on incoporating some Celtic knowledge/influence into your path, then I would suggest it. There are some wonderful meditations in this book. However if you're looking for history I'd suggest you try a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even rate as 1 star","review":"I bought this book with high hopes. I have to say not only is she boring. She is very feministic and by the way I am a women but at the same time when you read her glossary of Goddess's it is not the whole story and only focuses on their negative side.

You cannot become a \\"Celtic Woman\\" simply by performing the rites offered in this book. Sure, there's a paradigm associated with the Celts (which is such a broad term anyway since you're talking about various different peoples), and I suppose anyone could adapt them. But being Celtic is a question of having Celtic blood, and neither this book nor any other can give you that. I really feel like this book cheapens my own Celtic heritage at the same time it insults other heritages by somehow implying there's something more to being Celtic. I would love to see a book extolling a heritage other than Celtic just to run against the pop Celtic interest grain. Shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty decent","review":"I'd ordered this back on one of my deployments for something to read. Its pretty good - I enjoyed the historical aspects, but didn't have much used for the rituals as they were mainly geared towards 2 or more people. I think I'm probably still looking for more solid history, less ritual practice. But, all in all, it was a good book and will probably cover what most folk are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Celtic Magic Title!","review":"The genre of Celtic studies is new to me. I've looked at several titles but I have to say Edain McCoy's book of Celtic Women's Spirituality is the one worth you time, money, and shelf space. She has obviously done some grueling research to write this book, and facts are backed up with detailed notes and bibliographies. She explores the cults and clans of Celtic tradition. This book is rich with Celtic and Pagan history, and also has many guided meditations and rituals. What I like most about it was the surprises at the end. If you are in a location where Celtic and magic books aren't readily available, there is a great appendix of sources, magazines, and newsletters. There is also a section of Celtic Folk Tunes sheet music. This is a great gift to yourself, or any friend studying Celtic magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"AP200 Works very well !","review":"First and foremost, this unit performs the function it was intended for extremely well. When combined with a cyclone DCS, these two items keep my shop far cleaner than it was a few years ago. My only complaint would be that the unit will only accept Delta filters, which are ridiculously expensive. It is within about a half inch of accepting a standard size filter that is readily available at most home improvement stores, but those filters are slightly to large to fit. Hmm, wonder if that was intentional ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable","review":"This product does what it is supposed to do--which sounds like damning with faint praise but is really kind of unusual in this day and age.

The Delta is solidly put together with plenty of power for deep mortises. Assembly is simple, no surprises, set up also without a hitch. If the MM300 has a weak spot it would be the fence.

I love the padding, and the little velcro pieces that hold the straps down while you're getting your baby out are a nice touch. My son, now 7 months old, hated his infant carrier/car seat from day 1. Maybe it was because he was a large baby, but I have friends with smaller babies who had the same problem. He would scream and cry every time we put him in the infant carrier. The minute we put him into the Britax Marathon, riding in the car has been a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Marathon, Hate the Roundabout","review":"I bought the Marathon for my daughter about a month ago and I love it. I've had to move it between cars several times already, and it's so easy to move around. And while it is big for my Outback, it's a great seat.So I expected the same when I bought the Roundabout for my husband's car. First off, we couldn't even find the latches. I almost took it back to BRU before checking the Britax website and discovering them hidden beneath the seat and foam.Then, I discovered the belts on the latch were so short that it made it difficult to get the second latch installed. The final straw was that the belts won't tighten. We've tried to install it 3 times in 2 different cars, and nothing will work. The belts won't tighten and the seat slides several inches each way. I don't understand it--the belts tighten so easily on the Marathon.So I'm returning the Roundabout and getting another Marathon."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best car seat","review":"We have 3 roundabout car seats and love them. Once the children were older we attemped other brands because of price, but ended up buying another roundabout. It is very easy to install and un-install (that was a problem with another brand). It also cleans up very well. Hope this review helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I purchase this car seat after my daughter, 5 months old ( 16.4 lbs. and 26.5\\" long) outgrew her infant car seat. After doing extensive research and going into a local babies r us I decided to spend the additional $60 and go with this car seat. I don't regret it at all, its worth every penny. This car seat is \\"car seat for dummies\\" I'm using it with the latch system and its was in the car within three minutes. Living in the city and parking in the street this is an advantage because I have to place the car seat in the car everytime I'm going out with my daughter. Adjusting the strap is a piece of cake, with the button in the front you could access it from rear facing position. I'm glad with my decision and thank everyone that posted their review it made my decision very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great safety seat!!!","review":"After a less than stellar experience with my son's infant seat, I really researched his convertible seat. This one is the only one that consistently performs in safety tests. This compnay makes airplane safety products too and is the #1 maker of safety seats around the world!! Yes, the price is a little high, but totally worth it. I feel very secure when my son is in this seat in my car and I love that it can be tethered to the cars structure for extra support. I always had trouble getting other seats tight enough in the car, but not this one. It is very easy to install and my next baby will have the new Britax infant seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I really love this car seat.

I brought both triumphs back and purchased two roundabouts. After 1 weeks I purchased another for my mother in law. My son never complained or cried while in his seat. If he did not fall asleep he sat there playing and looking around. Make the investement the first time instead of having the headaches later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Britax","review":"Although others have reviewed Britax seats and given them high ratings, I would tell you not to buy Britax. We have the Roundabout carseat and it's been popping out of the lock-offs no matter which car we've tried it in. This causes the seat to move quite a bit since the lock-offs are supposed to keep the tight seatbelt in place. When I contacted Britax, they sent new lock-offs for us to install, but that didn't fix the problem. When I called again to tell them our seat isn't safe and needs to be replaced, they told me they couldn't do anything for me. After spending $200 on a car seat to keep our precious cargo safe, you'd think they'd be willing to replace it. Do not buy from Britax -- they won't help you if you have a problem with your seat. It's the most disappointing customer service I've ever received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britax is awesome!","review":"I bought the Britax after trying out the Eddie Bauer 3-in-1, I had to sadly return it after I could not install it properly into my minivan. After talking to some friends who are Britax enthusiasts I thought I'd suck up another $40 and purchase the Britax. I LOVE this carseat. It is so easy to install and my 8 month old daughter who HATED her infant carrier loves this carseat. It sits high up, its cushy, and she can fall asleep comfortably in it as well. I highly recommend this carseat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roundabout Convertible seat","review":"Easy to use for our 9 month old, we also have the Marathon and don't really like it. The only concern is that our son already seems tall for the seat. The seat is supposed to hold a baby up to 40lbs and our son is only 21 lbs and he seems large in the seat. The Marathon is nice because it has plenty of room for our son, but it is a pain to get him hooked in due to the position of the buckle. All in all the Roundabout is a nice seat and easier to use than the Marathon, but I question the weight limit and length of time for us to use the seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"I bought this as a second car seat my main one is the boulevard..I think it's a well put together seat but I wish it had the side impact protection like the boulevard. also I bought this seat and realized that the weight limit was like 40 and the boulevard is 65 so I should have spent the extra money and got another boulevard because I am going to have to buy another seat anyway once she reached 40 pounds! My baby seems to like it though as far as being a comfortable seat..the only other thing I don't like is that her head slumps over sometimes when she falls asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to the hype, but ...","review":"So far, we really like our new car seat. It's quite sturdy, and my almost 1-year-old son seems to find it very comfortable. But, if this is the easiest carseat to install, I feel bad for anyone who orders a carseat that is difficult to install! Weaving the seatbelt through the seatbelt holders was a challenge for me (maybe the problem was our car, not the carseat). With that said, it's not budging now, so I'm happy to feel that my child is traveling safely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Car Seat for Infants","review":"I bought this car seat when my baby was only 3 months old. My baby really hated her infant car seat she seemed so uncomfortable and after only half an hour of driving she would start crying. After buying the britax roundabout my baby loves car rides. She seems so happy and she even takes naps on the rides. I chose the Britax Roundabout not only for my baby's comfort but also because consumer reports gave it good rating for both infant and toddler safety. So I know my baby will be safe and comfortable when we go on our car rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Great car seat big and comfortable. my son is 14 months old and he falls asleep in it everyday when we pick up his sister from school.It is well made and sturdy. It got great crash test ratings and seems to be very popular.The straps don't twist that is the best part. Very expensive but worth all $200 we paid for it. We bought an evenflo car seat for our 4 year old two years ago and we hate it. We are now going to throw out the evenflo and buy a Britax marathon for her. These car seats are priced high but well worth the investment in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have the animal print!","review":"This is a really cute car seat and gets really good safety ratings.

My almost 2 year old can get out of this seat - just like the other reviewer wrote! I called the manufacturer and they didn't seem to CARE! I do not get my money back and instead, I'm stuck with a carseat my child can get out of! I have pinned the flap down, tightened the straps until it almost drew blood and done everything suggested but my child can get out! Do not buy any car seat that the child can reach the release - it is not hard to raise that up, child leans forward and GETS OUT OF THE CARSEAT IN A MOVING CAR!

This one is heavenly. The eddie bauer one is supposed to go all the way to 80 lbs, but although we have a 50th%tile 2 yr old son, it is a struggle to get him in and out. The roundabout on the other hand is true to its promise on weight allowance and is just ergonomically designed. We have traveled at least 5 times and taken this carseat with us and inserted it in literally under one minute in every type of rental car. The straps never twist and the fabric is so comfy. We have bought it for two other close family members despite the price because it is totally worth it!!! You will not regret buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop searching! This is the one! Used it for over 2 years!","review":"We bought this initially to move across country in a tiny 2 door coupe.

I love the ease of removal and getting our son out while sleeping :) I give this model ten stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - But should buy the Marathon","review":"I just bought this and am very pleased with the ease of use. The only thing, which is my fault, the upper limits on Roundabout is to 40 lbs. The Marathon and other seats by Britax are to 65 lbs. I just assumed they were the same and didn't check.This is the second convertible I bought for my son (had Eveflo Triumph for 8 months until it broke!) so I wanted one that lasted - he is already forward-facing. Anyway, I will exchange the Marathon, or maybe the Wizard with True Side Impact (britaxusa.com) - that looks even better!So it gets 4 starts only because the upper weight limit is 25 lbs less than all the other Britax carseats, should just spend the extra money now and it will last you a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"After using the Evenflo Triumph for that last 3.5 months, we decided to get another car seat for our other car. Originally, we were going to get another Evenflo, but based largely on reviews and a dissatisfaction with the strap system of the Evenflo, we decided it would be worth the extra $100 to go with the Britax. I could tell the first time I used it that it was much easier to get my son in and out with the push button strap release compared to Evenflo's strap design. I also really like the velcro on the sides to keep the straps out of the way when you are loading the baby. We have decided to use this as our primary car seat and to use the Evenflo as the spare in the other car. The design is so simple and easy to use - I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the carseat but","review":"I also did alot of research on carseats and this was one we went with. I love how comfortable the fabric is and how easy it is to get our son in and out of it.

So I am the only always having to move the carseat. Otherwise we love the carseat!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Car Seat","review":"This is the best car seat!! My husband did research on many carseats and found this one to be the best (no recent recalls that he could find). It sits very secure in the back seat. I don't have to worry about being to lose and moving when the car turns. Also, in the laid back position it still its up high enough for our son to see out of his window, and he can still fall asleep comfortably. The seat cover is easy to remove and wash. We put it in the washer (by itself), then line dried it and it fit perfectly back on the seat with no shrinking.

Professional warriors and historians should read this book because it portrays the same forces that were at work in Vietnam in a completely different environment. It's all here--a tightly organized group willing to stop at nothing to gain power, tradition-bound villagers enlisted in the cause of a left-wing revolution, a hopelessly divided Western nation trying to live up to its commitments, Western-educated intellectuals attacking the West, Westernized elites caught in the middle of a civil war, and ethnic minorities left out in the cold when power is handed over to the \\"natives,\\" not to mention pacification, \\"hearts and minds,\\" terrorism, and \\"search and destroy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to believe this happened","review":"A Savage War of Peace tells a story of Islamic terrorism, right-wing terrorism,insurrection, military coup, near civil war, torture, and repeated attempts toassassinate a head of state -- all involving France in the second half of the twentiethcentury.

His trilogy--The Fall of Paris, The Price of Glory, To Lose a Battle---is excellent, but the author reaches his pinnacle in \\"Savage War\\". He shows a masterful understanding of politics, strategy, tactics, and national feeling. I have met men who served under Salan, Massu, and Challe, and the portrayals of these leaders by the author harmonize with what I've been told. The subject may seem remote in time and in interest, but the author has written a gripping story, and also gets \\"down and dirty\\" into the details.

This is a comprehensive, straight forward account of the Algerian War. You probably won't find a better book.However, there are a few problems. First, Horne uses a fair amount of French quotes and expressions in this book, but provides no English translation. I have some knowledge of French, so I was able to comprehend some of them. For someone with no knowledge, they would be left in the dark.Also, this book needs a listing of major characters. There are just too many people in this book and it is a challenge to keep them all straight, particuarly the Arab names. Some people are mentioned only once and it gets confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start--Not the best","review":"If you want to learn Kanji, this is a very good choice to start with. The book is written simply, by and established author, and leads you well through many simple kanji, including a nice set of general rules for stroke order.There are only a single real problem I found with this book. For one thing, the author does not always introduce the names of the kanji when she presents them--given, there is an index in the back, but I would like to not have to flip back and forth quite so often. This was my major concern with the book; if you want to have speaking ability with these new kanji you must learn how to say their names.Other than this, I believe this is a good choice of book if you are looking to learn kanji; even some of the pictoral mnemonics (I need a way to help me remember how to spell that! *grins*) were helpful, though some didn't seem to be very well-linked unless you looked them over quite carefully.So to you I say--nihongo gambatte!~KeViN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This book is not very useful, since it introduces the script's characters but contains only a minimum of texts to exercise them. For those who already know Chinese script, the chapters about Kanji are absolutely not interesting, and for those who have never seen a Kanji before, it is almost equally useless with all the effort to present everything in nice pictures. Advanced learners will find that linking characters to pictures is an absolutely ridiculous method once you want to learn a few thousands of them.

Surely by the late 90s this puts off more people than it encourages. I can see similarity with Asimov in that there are central characters engaged in a bit of detective work and its mostly a battle of brains rather than brawn. Thankfully it doesn't have 95 pages of dialogue where you are supposed to spot the clue. Anyway... this book is fun to read.

In all have bought 12 of these and another one just broke. The metal seems heavy duty but... inside it is cheap alloy and they keep right on breaking. They do not correctly fit side and angle mount toilets as advertised. In addition the cheap metal alloy corroides inside causes them to stick and break. Spraying them with wd40 helps them last a few more months before they bind up and snap off inside. The only thing made of decent quality metal is the exposed handle giving it weight and fooling you into thinking this is a well made product.

The finish is nice, with a relatively dark oil rubbed bronze color. The lever itself is quite heavy so that may cause a bit of a problem with some valves since it might create some lifting force that can eventually lead to leaks at the rubber flap in the tank. I prevented this from happening in my side mount application by turning the rod in the tank in a way that now flushing happens with lifting the lever instead of the more natural pushing.

There are a lot of people out there with very silly ideas about marriage, and this book would set them straight, but offers little else to those of us who already understand the basic principles of a Christian marriage. It did do a good job of establishing some of the characteristics of a good husband and wife, although at times I disagreed with the great importance that was placed on wealth in marriage. The author seems to make the case that gathering wealth is one of the primary reasons to get married, which I would say is false. An OK read, but I would not recommend it too highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought this planer because it was alot cheaper than the others, mistake. This planer does work but spend a few more bucks and get a planer with a few more features.The feed rollers need help, I usually have to push the board into the planer to keep it moving. There is no locking device, the vibration of the unit causes the cutter heads to move up thus not giving even cut.

The owners manual has sequential page numbers but is missing several illustrations that I downloaded from Amazon. Delta's home page came up blank when I attempted to download the missing pages. A couple of screws rattled out of the machine on my first use. No clue where they belong. The nuts on the knives are so tight that I rounded the 8mm end wrench provided.

After reading the instructions, setting it up, and filling the tank, I let it run in a small bedroom from 5pm until 11pm. After 6 hours the room was not only still hot, but now it was hot and slightly humid as well. People said this works better in dry climates. I live in Southern California surrounded by desert, about as dry as you can get.

Did not leak for about an hour, so I left for work, came back home after a few hours, the towels I placed around the bottom on the unit was soaked, leaked again. Cannot return it as I've thrown the box and reciept away. The fan function is powerful and works good not sure about how good the ionizer works, but it is always on.

The 3 speed & \\"swing\\" function is great because it doesn't blow directly on me the whole time. As long as I've got ice in the bottom drawer, it stays pretty cool in here.

It's great in the master bedroom on the hotter/west side of this house. I have central A/C and overhead fans, but we've had 33 straight days where the outside temperature has been at or over 100 degrees here in Texas, so I need all the supplemental cooling I can get. This evaporative air-cooler fits the bill. NO leaks! I like the fact that the unit has casters so we can roll it into whatever room we're in. Ice-water added to the reservoir helps the outgoing air feel a bit cooler, and the ionizer is an added plus. I would give it 5 stars, but the remote control seems rather cheaply made and the water-level indicator is difficult to see/read--- which might be why some folks have had problems with leakage. This unit isn't designed to cool your whole house, but it will sure make the room that it is in much more comfortable during the dog days of summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"This is not what is boast it is, it is just a humidifier.

It includes papers written by a number of highly respected Burma scholars, including Andrew Selth, Mary P Callahan and Bertil Lintner.Some readers may not like the authors' rational, dispassionate analysis of the military regime and the prospects for an orderly return to democratic rule in Myanmar. Nevertheless, the chapters by Callahan, Selth and Pedersen are required reading for policy makers and informed lay people who have an interest in the future of this beautiful, but troubled land. The chapter titled 'International policy on Burma: Coercion, persuasion or cooperation? Assessing the claims', is a particularly sobering look at the prospects for 'regime-change' through international pressure, sanctions or boycotts.Although the march of time is making it a little dated, there is much about this book that will repay the effort of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asian Beauty by Margaret Kimura","review":"I wanted to check this book out at my local book store first before I bought it,thank goodness I did. I thought this book would discuss and show different techniques on how to apply makeup and different looks you can achieve with makeup, but it didn't. It vaguely discuss how Asian features are different, which is nice, but it doesn't discuss on how to play up those features. The pictures and the models in the book were pretty but some of the makeup is a little strange (orange lipstick?). The book claims to have all types of Asian women in the book which it does but it doesn't discuss or show how to apply makeup to different people and the explainations on how to do things were skimpy. This is a nice book to look at while waiting in line someplace, but as for reading and it's usefulness to anyone Asian or not, very little. I think anyone thinking of buying this book should look it over before making any irrational decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asian beauty?","review":"I picked this up at the book store to see if it may be useful for me, an asian-american. As I scanned through the pages, I saw a lot of pictures of asians with \\"white\\" features. Most of the models tend to be asians mixed with white or black. None of the models had single eyelids. The makeup also looked very tacky, using colors that did not seem to complement asian skin tones. I cant say this book is all bad. It does have a few good tips for skin and make-up applicators. I still think this book tries too hard to make an asian woman look white. It does not seem to accentuate the natural beauty that asians have. I am glad there is a book that focuses on Asians. I give props to the author. I still think it should be more focused on the typical asian rather than trying to make them look white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asian Beauty","review":"I have The Asian Face, written at least 20 years ago and was looking for a new, updated book on makeup tips for Asian faces. I called a local bookstore and had it put on hold. Stupidly, I bought it without looking through it. It certainly wasn't what I had expected or wanted. The faces of the models are not pure Asian faces; rather they are Asian blends with beautiful deep-set eyes. The faces in the book hardly need any help.I wanted some tips for every day makeup. Many of the models had makeup on that I wouldn't even wear at night. I am especially interested in makeup for the eyes. I had expected some tips for the various types of Asian eyes (which no magazine ever covers). However, that was not the case. I'm sorry I bought the book. I had planned to buy another one as a gift but will not do so now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should've been titled \\"Eur\\"asian Beauty","review":"Despite it's title, the majority of models featured in this book are half-asian.

As for the actual quality of the photos, I was in shock. Some of the images had been so enlarged that I could see the pixelation on some of the models' faces. I've seen newspaper inserts that were of a higher quality.If I was a full Asian woman I would've given \\"Asian Beauty\\" one star. I saw nothing in this book that deals with the specific issues that many women of Asian descent deal with, ie: single eyelids, rounder faces, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice colors, not much else","review":"Initially, I was very excited about this book. I have Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin, but I wanted another book that would teach me how to use vibrant colors so I thought that Asian Beauty would be a good choice. The design is nice and the makeup looks are exactly what I was looking for but Kimura doesn't tell you how to achieve those looks. She does mention a 'light and shadows' technique but it is not adequately demonstrated. She also doesn't give product names.

And if one has read all the posted reviews they will notice that most of the few positive opinions of this book have been posted by (probably) white readers and the majority of the negative (and more realistic) postings were made by Asians who know \\"real\\" Asian beauty. Like many I was happily awaiting a book dedicated to Asian beauty but as an African American even I noticed the frequent Eurasian featured models and the short and vague makeup advice. At first I thought I would be the only one giving a negative opinion on this book but I am glad that many recognize its faults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not helpful","review":"This book contains beautiful photographs of stunning Asian and partly-Asian women. However, as far as makeup tips that address all of the different types of problems that Asian women have (no eyelid fold, wide faces, small eyes, thin lips, etc.), it's pretty thin. It was nice to see the wide range of colors that we can use, but that's about it. I already know about drinking a lot of water and getting enough sleep, thanks!Lots of sparkle, little substance. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT!","review":"I'm an Asian American in my late twenties living in L.A. and lived and traveled in Asia. So I have an idea of beautiful Asian women. And this book does not contain that. The before and after pictures aren't anything any woman (even one as dumb with makeup as me) wouldn't know. The author doesn't take any real make up risks. She gives the basic 411 on eating healthy, excercising, etc.. She emphasizes using eyeliner. However, not all Asian eyes are similar. It's better to just look on the Internet for Asian beauty tips. I was so excited when I ordered it. When I read it, I was sooo disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ayako","review":"This book was a total waste of money. There is no useful professional advice at all.Because one of the authors is Asian American, I expected she could talk about some professional technique applicable particularly to Asian faces. nothing.The book is rather about the author's impressions and feelings, such as \\"I always found -(Asian faces) --are very mysterious.\\" But she did not provide with any solid technique to make this \\"mysterious\\" faces look attractive.Furthermore, all models photographed in this book look like as if they just come out of Chinese opera with heavy make ups (with bright colors that do not go well with Asian features at all.)Bobi Brown's \\"Beauty\\" talks about Asian faces in short three pages. But it was far more practical, useful and kind advice to help Asian faces look prettier, and Asian women feel confident with their oriental features.Total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book was completely useless as a tool to help asian women with a creaseless eye.

The interviews with former Soviet military personnel and information regarding collisions are interesting. Much of the information about submarine activity has already been published.

Great and inexpensive way to accomplished my goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I found this book to be more or less devoid of useful or interesting material, with two exceptions. I liked some of the feats presented in the book and I liked the section on creating immortals. The rest of the book was fluff, useless, a waste of space. The book tries to explain goodness to players, all of which know what it means to be good anyway. It presents a whole mess of groupings of deities which anyone could make up on their own, which is basically the way Wizards of the coast present everything divine. Instead of giving 7000 examples of divine beings, why not give us a book about how to build them, details of how divine beings interact, create, and how they fit into the cosmos? Anyone DM truly worth his salt makes all his own stuff up anyway rather than using the junk in books like this and the Manual of the Planes. Spend money on something else like Heroes of Battle, a much better book and more useable."},{"rating":"1","title":"An un-needed book","review":"In my opinion, this is an un-needed book. Why does a DM need a book full of \\"monsters\\" that are vastly powerful GOOD beings. In the vast majority of campaigns, the players are good, fighting the forces of evil. With the monsters in this book, the players won't have much to do except watch the battle. This brings up a minor complaint about D&D that I've had since the game first came out...why do the developers always give a slight power edge to good? Wouldn't it make more sense to give a slight power edge to evil, since that's what the players will be fighting against. Take dragons for example. The most powerful good dragon (gold) is a bit more powerful than the most powerful evil dragon (red). All this leads to is the DM having to come up with some reasoning why evil dragons outnumber good dragons, like in Dragonlance Chronicles with the abduction of the dragon eggs. Well, enough rambling off topic. Unless you're DMing a high level evil group, give this one a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"Well, with the Book of Vile Darkness in my hot little hands, I thought to myself \\"Can life get any sweeter?\\" I now had the power to creat terrifying, disgusting, insidious villains. But, life DID get sweeter! Wizards of the Coast produced the Book of Exalted Deeds, the counterbalance to the cruel and oh-so evil book of Vile Darkness. The Exalted feats section suddenly had me dreaming up all sorts of uber-heroes, ranging from the Sword of Righteousness to the Apostle of Peace (both of which are amazing prestige classes). I read a review on Amazon.com that mentions reference to homosexuality and bisexuality. This is simply not true! There are no such references in this book. It is a solid read, a great book and something everyone should get if they really want to crush evil underfoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but of little use","review":"I bought and read some of, skimmed some of, this book. So take this with a grain of salt, but I thought it such a poor value that I retured it immediately.The book has a lot of new classes, most of which seem best adapted to NPCs. It has a lot of new \\"monsters\\" - angels of the heavens which seem usable only in very narrow, particular campaigns with high level good characters (or evil I suppose). And everything else was pretty lame. The descriptions of what was good and what wasn't; and the ideas surround the Chaotic Good versus Lawful Good is, as D&D is always, simplistic and relativistic; but also useless in a supplement as it is so subjective. The feats were dumb, the items and relic stuff felt like filler, and there wasn't enough focus on how good combats evil and how good campaigns are run or story ideas.In short, I felt like it was an interesting book that would have made a great paperback for $11, but certainly not this full hardback $30 book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Not a Hater","review":"But this book is lame. Especially compared to its companion piece, the Book of Vile Deeds. Vile Deeds was cool--it had crazy pictures, an interesting musing on the nature of good and evil [before whole heartedly abandoning that line of reasoning and presenting such morally ambiguous figures as the \\"Cancer Mage\\"], and some really evil stuff to throw at your PCs.This book... well... it has a great cover. No seriously, it's really neet to look at.The inside art isn't very attractive. Most of the add-ons are like \\"if your characters become extra special good, they are just so swell! Let's make everything holy or something like that!\\" The prestige classes aren't very inspiring either. And it's not really clear [although Vile Deeds wasn't either] about how a non-god figure is more powerful and important than a god figure? I guess it's one of those DnD continuity issues that you just have to grin and bear... or create your own setting!overall, not really worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White that comes to Save the day","review":"I bought the Evil book first and unfortunately, this book is not as wickely clever as that one. But it needs to be written, becuase this is the dawn to evil's night, both sides must be equal. It is a great supplement for an Evil campaign, which I ran for over a year. The \\"bad guys\\" were all the paladins and high Preists of good. But once we went back to the usual type of good/neutral campaign, this book came back out and some pc's willingly wanted to become exhalted. It is well worth your money. Great prestige classes and feats are included in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Met and exceeded expectations, thanks!

The base is a flimsy piece of stamped steel; mine arrived bent and was too easily straightened. The hose is only 10' if you stretch it out, at rest it is about 8'. The motor on the AP300 is its only redeeming quality. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is that 1 star is only given to a completely useless POS.

I have installed this on several machines and found that it is only barely adequate on those that have built-in collection ports.

If I had a bigger shop, I probably would have purchased a stationary jointer since I hate moving tools around.

When I turned the board face down to plane it the machine's underpowered motor really showed up and chewed into my board 1/2 the way through.I usually use a Grizzly 12.5 planer which I love and works wonderfully but this Delta was a real disappointment in the planing side.Save your money and buy a Grizzly or Jet jointer (heck the Craftsman ones will probably work just a well) if you want to do both jointing/planing.

Larger items tend to be more challenging unless you set up a stable outfeed table. While you won't get museum quality flatness with hardwood, it definitely answers the mail for smaller home products. It was a lot quieter than I expected. The only downside I've observed it that softwood shavings tend to build up on the outfeed side, even with a vacuum port attachment.

He describes in some detail the effects of institutional racism in Detroit over several decades. He combines personal accounts with indisputable numbers backed by research. Any honest reader would see this as a scathing refutation of the idea that poor people of colour are responsible for their own conditions, rather than de facto segregation at the workplace and in the housing market. He also describes the results for workers of automation and the drive to maximize profits by the capitalists who own this country and its politicians. The rabid racism inherent in American culture and exhibited by working white people is woven throughout this narrative. If you want to understand how deeply rooted racism and its consequences are in the United States, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad thesis but a story that still needs to be looked at","review":"Sugrue takes a look at one of the crisis to hit not only Detroit but the rest of the country in his book on race and inequality. While there have been a lot of disturbing factors that have occurred during urban renewal Sugrue takes his text a little far. His flagrant bashing of urban planning gets old after the first two chapters and the book tends to drag on. This is an important issue that bears further studying but hopefully it will be done in a more academic way. This book does have all the information you need to start studying the subject and is a good way to begin looking at urban renewal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding history of Detroit's decline, lessons for today.","review":"Sugrue's thoroughly researched and documented history of racial segregation in Detroit is an essential tool for anyone working on behalf of America's cities. Detailed GIS maps show the razor sharp lines that have divided the city decade after decade in what is still the most racially segregated metropolitan statistical area of over 1 million people in the United States and the only one to get worse over the past 20 years. Sugrue does a good job of examining how racism distorts free market economics. As a result, free market approaches, critical to urban recapitalization, have received a much more cautious acceptance in Detroit than in many other cities that are coming back, such as Cleveland, Baltimore and Portland.

The blower tube will remove very light dust if I can get the outlet close enough to the material but that is as good as it gets. The blade movement is still the same and Sears says there is nothing they can do about it. I have tried bolting the unit down but that only served to vibrate EVERYTHING else off of the work bench(even an impact wrench). I can make pretty good cuts on soft wood up to 1/2 inch or hardwood up to 1/4 but thats it. Try anything more and the blade wanders all over the place no matter how it is tensioned.

When I finally turned the saw on the blade speed was wandering all over the place. I turned the speed all the way down and tried again, but the same thing keeps happening.

Unfortunately as the blade moves up and down it moves side to side (perpendicular to the direction of cut.) Calling Delta's toll free line yielded an explination on how to tension the blade, which is not what I was trying to do, I'm not even sure if the person helping fully understood the difference between a scroll saw and a band saw. The unit is so simple there is no way to adjust for arm misalignment. In addition, to get the table 90 degrees to the blade the table must be tilted 2-3 degrees relative to the workbench (works to get a 90 degree cut but does not sit well with me.)

Generally I try a recipe as written the first time around, though, and then decide whether to keep, tweak, or toss. This one falls into the last category. The dough was so short it was almost impossible to work with. Also, the recipe calls for using a 2 1/2 to 3\\" cutter, but the number of pastries is based on a 2\\" cutter. With a three inch cutter, the cookies came out teeny by the time they were shaped into traditional hamantaschen. They don't spread at all, so I wound up with cocktail sized pastries.

Initially I was fairly happy with it, other than some vibration from the spindle. But the more I use it the more I am dissapointed with it. The minimum spindle speed is 620 which is too fast for my hole cutter ( recommended 400 RPM). Delta should change the pulley ratios to allow an alternative slower speed rather than so many at the higher end. I used my hole cutter anyways and ended up barely being able to cut a 3\\" diameter hole the drill kept stopping. It appears as if the motor just stops under load. I noticed a similar problem using a small diameter forstner bit. I hope that my motor needs to be replaced, and it isn't just that that's the best that 1/3 hp can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depth stop unworkable","review":"As an old woodworker, disappointed that the depth stop mechanism does not work, even when following the written instructions. The spindle travel is very short out of the box, and ours just (without any adjustment) became shorter. The depth control ring and the guage are not intuitive, the guage reading what appears to be backwards. Not up to the old standads of Rockwell/Delta days. Do not buy this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Delta quality","review":"Received my DP300 on Friday afternoon. Out of box the tool rest was broken. After assembly, the depth stop was not settable - the screw stop inside the mechanism was not attached. More importantly, the quill raised and lowered with great force required. It would not return under its own spring return tension. I suspect there is a woodruff key in the slot and it is broken. Of course customer service is closed for the weekend and I cannot get redress from Delta until Monday.I have several other US made Delta tools with which I am satisfied. There was no damage to the shipping container, so I believe the DP300 left the factory in China in this condition. Delta needs to revisit their Quality control in offshore locations or risk ruining their previously fine name."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad motor","review":"I purchased the drill press to use with my middle school students. Less than 2 weeks after it arrived, my students called me over cause it smelled funny.

It is practically ready to go out of the box. The performance is is outstanding and it is easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the small investment","review":"This is my first planer - so I really have nothing to compare it with. Set up was very easy, most time consuming part was assembly of the stand - took about 20 minutes (even at my normal slow pace). The planer itself was a snap - just install the knobs and remove some packing material and you are ready to go.I ran some maple and walnut throught it and was impressed with the finish, smooth as glass. I used a digital caliper to check thickness in several spots on the boards and they were pretty much dead on. The only thing I wish this machine had was some sort of \\"final cut\\" mechanism, so that you could preset your final dimension and not go any further with the plaining. I guess that is something you would expect on a much more expensive machine. I highly recommedn this planer to any home woodworker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta 12-1/2 inch planer","review":"I bought this planer to prepare maple and birch dimensioned lumber for the cabinets I am making for my kitchen remodel. The two primary uses are making the face frame pieces identical in thickness and drawer conponents being squared up as I am making all dovetail drawers. I am quite satisfied with the machines overall quality. The only criticism is the feeding of the material into the planer could be better. With fir, redwood, and pine the feed works perfect. However with the very hard maple and birch it tends to slip and needs a helping hand. I would recommend this product to any of my friends as a very good value. I also have reviews for a makita router, porter cable dovetail jig, Kreg pocket screw jig, and porter cable brad nailer. John Papetti"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite useful","review":"After usuing this product for just over a month, I can safely say that this was an excellent purchase. Setup was fairly simple, (The stand took the longest) and the planer was all adjusted properly. After a month of use, everything is still in excellent conditon, and its still running strong. Overall, another quality product from Delta. Highly reccomended for a small shop or the do-it-yourselfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more work","review":"Take one very talented strangler with an interest in philosophy and his cynical profit-driven manager. Now, put them into a set of loosely connected vignettes and a sprinkling of equally loosely connected fantasy tropes. Mash them together - don't worry about how they fit around the edges - and shamelessly pad out the last third to bring the whole thing up to some reasonable word count.

Do not let the title fool you, there is no real need to understand the philosophical contents of the novel to truely enjoy it.You have fun poked at philosphy, human nature, politics, the whole works.There is always a joke or pun to be had, nary a page where you don't at least chuckle.The story is told from a the first person (Ignance) who is the Strangler's Agent. Ignance gives his insight to everything those around him do, adding his own flare to the actions of others.You find yourself laughing at his interpretation of events.In short, its a whimsical tale which pokes fun at human nature, and a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANKS AMAZON","review":"i looked and looked for this movie and could not find it anywhere, thank you amazon, not only did i find it but the movie is in great shape, for being used..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Showtime movie","review":"The movie is hard to watch at some times, but the movie is a great movie.

But this is worse than my least expectations. The format is awful. Aspect ratio awful, because the camera zooms in and cuts out top, bottom, and sides of the original film. How could this happen?

I am a huge fan of the Hong Kong Legends Region 2 DVD which is long out of print and I have even seen the film on the big screen at a reperatory theater (The New Beverly in Los Angeles) and was really looking forward to seeing this. It seems Dragon Dynasty is cutting corners. One other instance is their Supercop release without the original Hong Kong cut. I dont know... it seems like the Weinstein company doesnt actually care about these films and just wants to release them in the cheapest way possible.

This is my first and last time I will be watching this movie. I didn't hate it, but I didn't fall in love with it either. Especially to be crying over the quality of the video transfer, which looked good to me. It looked great using an upconverting DVD player (720p to be exact). Like I said this is the first time I've seen it and I don't see what the big deal was. I'm not a John Woo fan, so maybe that's it.

I enjoyed it too it was my intro to Hong Kong action films. I will be putting it in my movie collection on what ever format it is on, so far I have the Criterion and the Fox Lorber dvds. I was going to preorder it on Blu ray but saw the negative review so i waited and rented it on line. The Ultimate editon it is not since it does not have a loss less audio or commantary track.

I loved being part of Barry Neil Kaufman's experience, through this book, as he reconciled with his estranged father at the announcement of his dad's terminal illness. I really appreciate how he turns challenges into opportunities, how he models that one can change beliefs in an instant, and how and why to give control to our aging, ill, or dying parents.I'm so glad I read this book before I have to face the same experience. Now I know I'll be with my parents in a way that is honoring to them, honoring to me, and I know that it will be an opportunity to deepen our relationship. But why wait?

However, like at least one other writer I dissent on the evaluation of the new soundtrack. The original was a bit cheesy (I was always especially irked by those synthesized-sounding transitional dramatic cues), to be sure, but it was also more dramatic and much more true to the time and style in which the film was made. The almost Celtic-sounding aspects of the new score seem very out-of-place. Having seen the original many times, and having enjoyed it, despite its flaws, as a piece of film history with a very unusual storyline, I very much missed the original score while viewing this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Sound is Best","review":"One reviewer raved about the new soundtrack on the DVD, as if the 5.1 surround sound was all that was needed to make it good. I found that this new sound was suitable for the current rash of extreme poker reality shows. Come on, this is a movie about the calvary, and it needs a maching beat to cary the action. True this is 'mono' sound, but the original sountrack is still the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guy movie.","review":"This is not the best movie or even the best Western movie, but it is a great guy movie. It sticks fairly close to historical accuracy, it has great conflict situations between the Yankees,the Rebels, the Apaches and then even the French.The rivalry between Charleton Heston and Richard Harris is greater than what is shown on camera. The battle scenes are excellent. This is a great guy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is the extended version?","review":"I have seen this version in New York and the producers assured the audience that this was absolutely all that they could restore. According to them, they had not much significant footage other than what is in the extended film, nor any guidance as to what Peckinpagh wanted to do beyond this point. All things being equal, I believe that they are sincere and that therefore this is the closest we will get to Peckinpagh's intention.BEWARE though- the print that was screened in New York was an extremely dirty print full of nicks, scars, noise and the like. Let's hope a considerable digital restoration saves this DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, Not well written, poor editing","review":"There are a number of excellent actors in this movie, but the plot is jumbled, the editing it ragged, and the music needs to just not be there.

It took 2 Directors to finish this film. It had everything. A lot of great actors. Charlton Heston, Richard Harris,R.G. Armstrong, James Coburn, Jim Hutton,Brock Peters,Senta Berger & Warren Oates. Directed by Sam Peckinpah with a big budget. Then top that off with a great theme song. How this movie failed in the eyes of Hollywood is still a mystery. But did it fail really? Well I can't see any big flaws just one hell of a post civil war western with some great performances. Only a Charlton Heston could stand out in the midst of this much talent.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Substantial","review":"This book was a naked perspective of a single mother spanning twenty-odd years of scrimping, surviving, and loving, and letting herself be loved. Mama doesn't apologize for much, is too busy surviving to be self-aware. I almost wanted to rescue her, just to give her the escape she needed. I wanted/needed McMillian's character's to evolve to another level, and I'm not certain the author convinced me that they had. It was a satisfying book though, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Well, I have to agree with Katherine. I thought this book was great, it is a great story, but Mildred damn sure was a terrible mother. It was made pretty clear that wasnt her intention, but she was. Freda was a better person and a better mother than mildred, and she was rewarded. All those times Mildred leavning Freda in charge of four younger children while she went out and slept with men, is this really what we think of as a strong mother trying to keep her family together? I sure hope not because that means family values are going staight to hell. Even I feel people praise this book for the wrong reasons, there is no doubt this story was touching and leaves you thinking about the story when your finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Man, i did enjoy this book, but...","review":"Again the Strong Black Man image is not in this book. Terry is a great writer, and I have to take it as that. I just would like to see more positive Images about us Black Men! She needs to be around more positive black men so she has some to write about. Not all the black men are negative in this book just 90 %. Anyway this is one of my favorite books by Terry. It would make a good movie, but Terry has stated that this book is too close to her heart, and she did not want to let it be made into a movie.

She is very heartless, has no feelings and no empathy to her children, especially to her son, Money. No wonder he turned out the way he did! When her oldest daughter was raped she did not offer her one hug, no reassurance or anything like that. She was basically left to finch for herself. I am shocked that they did not come to hate her.

Being from a poverty background I found it not having a very good picture of the struggle.

All homes are different but this was not a good portrayal of the african amerian family in poverty."},{"rating":"1","title":"An out-of-touch disaster","review":"I hope you will use my review though it is far from glowing. I could barely finish this book. Ms. McMillan has clearly not lived the life of an impoverished black person. Her story is farcical. There is no mention of race-related problems in this 60s era novel. Apparently, blacks and whites got along just fine in Ms. McMillan's world. Furhtermore, although this family seems to be close to rock bottom, there seems to always be enough money lying around for them to do with what they wanted. Totally unrealistic. I couldn't stand the main character. She has no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado about Nothing","review":"The story moved fast, but went no where.

Please no more entries by people who have been studying Persian for two days ... learn the script, at most it will take you a couple of hours. There are generally about three factors that comprise a good Persian dictionary: it includes some form of phonetic representation of the word, verbs need to be shown with their present tense roots, and examples of usage (with an emphasis on the use of prepositions and also commonly found idioms). This particular dictionary doesn't seem to give you any of these three. If you want a good dictionary stick to the 40-dollar Aryanpur volume. It makes all of the competitors look like crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Farsi Webster's","review":"This dictionary likely has more than you need, unless you happen to be a professional translator of Farsi and/or English, but it is miles ahead of the other dictionaries, which tend to contain too little. Please note, however, that this book is one half of a two volume set. The companion volume is the Hippocrene Standard Dictionary: Farsi (Persian) - English Dictionary, also by S. Haim. By Webster's, I am referring to the quality of the dictionary, rather than any definitions, which, to be clear, are not here, only translations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total dissappointment","review":"I wish I had NEVER spent my money on this useless Dictionary!

Four stars as the headset is not the most secure but the mics have good range and pickup. The system served without glitches. Make sure you get the 3 prong mini-xlr connector as the pin connector is not as secure and will pop with body movement. For $300 you can't beat the ROI for a 4 mic system.

Then the variable speed function ceased working properly. Upon examination of the pulley system after removal of the top cover (which was nearly impossible to reassemble) it was noted that the spring system on the rear pulley did not work properly. The die-cast (cheap) rear pully had a small crack in it as well. I disassembled it and returned it to Amazon.Subsequently, I purchased the Sears Craftsman 12\\" drill press and although you need to change the belt pulley ratio manually to adjust the speed, it has worked perfectly on a daily basis for months now and under heavy loads the motor doesn't even lag.AVOID THIS DELTA DRILL PRESS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my biggest mistake","review":"I purchased this Sony camcorder assuming that it is the best non-digital available.

The fit and finish are awful. The spindle doesn't line up with the hole in the table. It's a single speed, around 12500 rpm which is too slow for small diameter bits and too fast for a large panel raiser if you're cutting anything other than pine or mdf (You can't use a speed reducer with this motor, either). I bogged it down trying to take a finish cut with a large panel raiser.The grooved metal table marked up every panel or board I've ever pushed across it and the spindle doesn't have enough travel to allow you to mount even a thin plywood top to protect your work.To get started you're better off with a 1-1/2 hp (minimum) variable speed router with a 1/2\\" capacity chuck and a moderately priced router table ... until you can step it up a notch later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta SH100 Shaper","review":"This shaper is a great value and has unbelievable power tospin larger diameter cutters.

With the 13000 rpm speed, makesure only very sharp cutters and bits are used. I have beencutting red and white oak hardwood. Delicate adjustments areno problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor preformance","review":"I have owned the Delta Router / Shaper for several years now and have come to dislike the height adjustment. Every time that I need to make the slighest adjustment, the spindel will shift to the left when tigtned by the lock. This makes for repeatable, accurate cuts impossible. I have looked at other Delta router / shapers and they seem to do the same thing.If any one has an answer for this problem, please let me know as I am about to junk this machine. I own many other Delta and Porter Cable tools that I am very satisfied with. I guess they all can't be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality machine","review":"Thought I could save some money, but it's true - - you get what you pay for. Fence is pathetic!! Called Delta Customer Service for help in locating an after-market \\"quality\\" fence, and they just passed the buck. Spindle height adjustment is also very bad. Fine tuning is impossible. Overall - a total waste of money spent. I thought Delta was better then this. I sure was surprised!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor faults","review":"I bought this after I discovered a cheaply made table and add on router cost more. I've heard all kinds of complaints for adjusting the combo set-ups. I did not want to hassel with that. The Delta works real well. Table top is good. Fences are good quality but a little hard to adjust. I have only used 1/4\\" cutters (My local hardware does not have 1/2\\") and have trouble removing them. I'll order the 1/2\\" cutters. My main complaint is the depth adjustment. I had expected it to be more accurate. I'll have to work with it more and get used to it. Overall a very good machine for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta Drops the Ball","review":"Delta definately dropped the ball on this tool!The 1/4\\" collet adapter doesn't fit in the collet without driving it in or using some sort of lubrication (dangerous!). When you finally do get it in, the act of getting a 1/4\\" shaft router bit into is harder than getting the collet adapter in!Accessories? Not hardly. They couldn't even include the miter gage with the tool. Try finding that locally is like trying to find a frienly sales person at LOWES - not going to happen!I bought the tool because I was in urgent need of a shaper at the time. Now I wish I would have passed it by and waited for a quality machine from another manufacturer.My recomendation - Don't waste your time with the Delta SH100 Router/Shaper...unless your a weekend wood worker with a weekend to waste trying to set up and change bits in this machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Without a doubt the biggest piece of junk I've ever owned. At 13000 rpm it is to slow for most router bits, but does not have enough power to do a good job with a big bit. The table is too small and has razor sharp edges. The fence is a joke so is the height adjustment. I actually smiled the day it went up in smoke while running a 1/4\\" slotcutter because I knew I could toss it and build a real router table, which I did with a makita 3612c plunge router. I am now quite pleased. I should have done this in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you're getting into","review":"I bought this device with a very specific single purpose in mind, and was able to make it work with a LOT of effort. I wanted to do tongue-and-groove on some long cedar boards for paneling, and after a lot of futzing was able to make acceptable joints on all my boards. It was cheaper than a good router and table would have been.That having been said, this is neither a router table NOR a shaper, and combines the WORST of both. The fence adjustment stinks, ditto the height adjustment (see other reviews). The hole in the top won't accept wide bits, so I had to use a spacer board to get my planks to the right cutting height, which is why I had no problems with the sharp edges on the tabletop snagging my workpiece. The extension table accesory requires the removal of the fence and dust collection port. The single speed is too slow for small bits and too fast for big ones. This is not a very adaptable or flexible machine. Buy a router and table."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be sorry you spent the money","review":"I used (not much) one of these for about a year in my home workshop. There is NOTHING good that I can say about it, except that the motor did actually run.Notes:- Lack of power, single speed, bogs down under load- BAD BAD BAD Fence adjustment. You just can't get it set accurately. Can you say snipe?- Poor height adjustment, but it can be done.- Table top is sharp and rough, which makes feeding your material difficult and unsafe.- No place for featherboards on the fence- Single speed too fast for big bits, too slow for small ones- The use of this machine will lead to a near terminal case of frustration.For a hundred dollars more you can buy a Rousseau router plate, Bosch 1715EVS router, build your own table, Incra Ultra Lite jig (use as router fence - it's great with a slight modification - see review on amazon).

Daedelus uses samples in a way that very few know how. His choices might be called eclectic, but never forced or pretentious, never simplistic. Really, \\"eclectic\\" is an unfair description. This album is definitely focused, but from a wide view. Bass clarinet, flute, bells and accordion are integrated into a broad patchwork of samples from all over. Cinematic, thoughtful, danceable, even emotional at times, worthy of close listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Time in Tomorrow Land","review":"I listen to Daedelus' 'Invention' when I'm cooking in tomorrow's kitchen. As I mix up the key lime pie filling, Daedelus mixes up the indelible futures of the past, just as sweet, sour and fragrant. When I hear the soft chrome gleam of \\"Astroboy\\", I know the most important thing is keeping the appliances happy. \\"Adventress\\" takes the test kitchen onto the Bullet Train. \\"Aplomb\\" is a woozy waltz on a slow boat full of china. In \\"Thus the Whirligig\\" the poet and the printer sit on either side of me, urgently whispering in my ears. Throughout Invention Daedelus plays his companionable clarinet and monumental bass (which structures even its absences) in the whole history of the Crystal Ballroom, from romantic heyday to treacherous flotsam.

Much did seem unbelievable for the era but it made for some smiles and cheering up while reading. It did get confusing with the various characters, like the thiefs and others introduced as family and friends.

Even with these issues, its worth the read for some fun time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt overcharged...","review":"My mistake was not reading the free sample before purchasing this book. I trusted the other review. However, I found this book to not be worth nearly 2.99, although that could be because I've been reading $.99 ebooks for the past week or so, and those have been better than this, which I paid three times as much for. I'm all for fun and silly books, but this one was so shallow it wasn't even worth the effort. His whole love thought process was \\"hey, she's hot!\\" and her's was \\"hey, he kissed me! And I liked it!\\" Nobody had any depth, or grew as a person. Which I admit, is probably a bit of a lofty goal for a romance novel, but I can dream, can't I? If you're looking for good cheap regency romance novels, I'd suggest trying Delle Jacobs, particularly The Mudlark or His Majesty, Prince of Toads.

See the other reader reviews for comments on the storyline. It is indeed a nice tale, set against a most powerful backdrop. However, it just feels like the author rushes through events at too fast a pace. Entire battles are described in a few paragraphs, what should be long prolongued drama filled scenes of major character death is boiled down to a few sentences. Really, the story told in this book is good enough to have been expanded into 6-8 books, but instead we are treated on a whirlwind tour spanning from the birth of the main character, to teenage years, to Thermopylae, to Platea and across the ocean - all in half the book so far. It's beginning to get tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"no frills, just reliable and affordable","review":"This grinder works well for sharpening chisels, slotted screw drivers, and other small tools.

When I went to grind, the act of grinding brought it to a halt. I thought Delta was supposed to be quality stuff, so I was quite surprised that this did this. because it is more than two years old, it is out of warranty, but I would expect to get more than two hours worth of use out of it.

Would be nice if it had some extending supports on the side but for the money, I was happy. the adjustments are easy to use, although it sometimes might hop out of adjustment by a degree or so, so you have to make sure your setting is right before you cut.

It was perfectly sqaure and aligned right out of the box, much to my surprise. It has a nice portable size and weight which makes it all the more useful. I also like the feel of the handle and power button design. It does not really feel that uncomfortable.Negatively, the bevel lock seems a little loose when adjusting. It feels like the whole upper saw piece could fall off if unscrewed too far. With it being so loose I wonder how long it will take for the saw to go out of alignment? Also as others have noted, the bevel indicator is difficult to read.I am in the process of trimming out a renovated house and this saw has proven up to the task. It is certainly at the right price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Saw for the Non-professional","review":"I purchased this saw to trim out a room I added in my basement. Excellent value.

A clamp for material would be a nice added feature, but can be purchased as a add-on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your miters","review":"Be sure to check your alignment on this saw before operating. Mine was about 1/4\\" in six inches on the perpendicular. Thats alot. The holes that allow adjustment of the fence for this weren't big enough so I had to bore larger holes to get it into alignment. I still have problems getting tight miters. Otherwise, the saw is easy to operate, has plenty of power, and it is easy to change angles. The dustbag doesn't do a very good job of collecting sawdust, will have to go to a dust collection system to keep sawdust off of my cutoff table. I wouldn't recommend my saw to anyone doing any kind of fine work, probably okay for cutting 2 x 4's if you get it into alignment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had one, took it back","review":"I had this, after looking at saws from harbor freight and sears and this.

I have used about 10 of these recipes, being forced to make lifestyle changes with my eating. I just find all the recipes a bit bland and leave you wanting for more.

This is a collection of essays about gender values in mass communication. The editor, Pamela J. Creedon, has identified a wide range of issues for discussion. Inspite of the huge scope of the book, the essays remain cohesive and well-knit.The book looks at the increased number of women scholars in this area and its effects. (\\"gender switch\\"). A key message of the book is that a significant change in status quo will occur, not when women try to change the system, but when they improve their position within the system and change the internal dynamics therein. A second message is that the gender roles defined by white male counterparts serve as the basis of gender inequity. The collection ends on an optimistic note and the last few essays talk about how to challenge current gender values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"At 320 bucks shipped, a very good deal.

The parts do come covered in grease and need to be cleaned.As other reviews indicate, fairly straight forward to assemble. I did buy a universal stand to move it around, but it seems hokey. Do wish Delta would design wheels etc into it integrally, it would not be that much more difficult or expensive.

I thought I was really a klutz because I could never get it adjusted right. Being a beginner, I just blamed myself and kept saying I need to take a course. Finally, long after it was out of warranty, I took it to a pro to adjust for me. I was told the beds being out of parallel was a manufacturing defect and it couldn't be adjusted enough to get it true.I know most instance of this product will be fine, and I read similar reviews of other jointers--at least in this price range. But be sure to check out the things the manual says are factory set and don't need adjustment.

First, this thing vibrates so bad when running there's no way it could make a smooth cut. I adjusted the belt several times, no help. Second, it wouldn't cut a straight line for anything. I checked all the settings, everything is right on, blades are the right height, tables are parallel, everything is as it should be. It just won't make a straight edge and the more you run the piece through the more concave it gets. I even ran a perfectly straight piece through it and it did the same to it. The tables are out of flatness a little but not enough to cause this I wouldn't think. At least I don't have to dissassemble it before I return it.

I can turn the adjusting wheel back and forth but table doesn't move. It is about 1/8\\" higher than the blades.

I used it for the 4th time last week and the lid fell apart! I did not have any problems with the numbers on the dial. they never did rub off. the glass lid was ok but the whole unit got hot, which was expected.What i did not expect was for the knob on the lid to come apart into about 6 or 7 pieces while I was frying chicken. It was a mess. I went to lift up the lid by the knob and all the pieces fell into the hot chicken and on the counter which made grease splash. Luckily I was not burned because I was able to jump back quick enough to avoid the splater. Now the glass lid just has a hole in the center where the knob used to be along with the adjustable window, spring, washers and screws. all of that stuff fell off.

We poach salmon, fry bacon, make potroast etc. etc. etc. We love the tip feature it is great for basting eggs, the glass lid so you can keep an eye on things, the even cooking throughout the pan, the max temperature gives you searing capability, you can wipe the pan clean between cooking individual items (for example, cook your bacon, remove, cook your potatotes, remove and wipe the pan with a paper towel then cook your eggs), you can also cook burritoes to a golden brown by (thawing them and cooking them 15 mins on each side on high simmer) and both the simmer and warm are exactly what you get, all of this in one pan and for our family we will have 2 of these fabulous skillets. Thanks Oster-Catherine and family"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok to cook with, but numbers rub off the dial!","review":"I like the frypan to cook with, like the glass top, the square design. It's easy to clean, and the tilt feature is nice. The quick release of the controller, while a good idea, is very flimsy and should be made of a stiffer material. We've returned it once because the numbers rubbed off the controller. Our store replaced it with a new one and we very carefully avoided the numbers on the dial until stirfrying some chicken. As soon as oil splattered on the dial numbers, they wiped right off with a paper towel. What good is an electric frypan when you don't know how hot it is? We're going to return it and replace it with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is dangerous","review":"Once you plug in the dial, it's difficult to turn and your hand is so close to the skillet, it's an accident waiting to happen.

No way to effectively control the temperature of my cooking.To make matters worse, the uneven cooking forced me to constantly stir my dishes. When I put it on simmer, I could see a bubbling \\"U\\" in my dish where the coils ran around the unit, but nothing anywhere else.So one has no accurate temperature control, nor control over WHERE the heat is going, this unit is pretty bad.

Completely nonsensical! If you're cooking anything that produces steam and plan on using the lid, you would be STRONGLY advised to purchase some good pot holders. I got used to using my 16\\" Presto which has a steam escape down on the lid so grabbing the handle is never a problem. The other con from my perspective is the cord attachment. It requires some real diligence getting it plugged into the pan since it's a very tight and precise fit. Also, the numbers wore off within the first month, so I use a cord from a different unit. Lastly, within a month of light/moderate use, the teflon(?) coating is scratched and peeling. These things are NOT what they used to be!Would I recommend this Oster to anyone? No way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A testament to the effort of man","review":"The \\"Big Dig\\" in Boston is the largest construction task ever to be undertaken by mankind, surpassing that of the building of the Panama Canal.

His great directing was the only thing that saved Mission Impossible 2 from being a completely stupid film. It's been a long time since I saw Hard-Boiled, but I remember that Chow Yun Fat was phenomenal; acrobatic and graceful even in the midst of heavy fight scenes. The scene which stuck with me is quite near the end. There's a hostage situation at a hospital which ends with a big gunfight between Chow Yun Fat and the criminals. At one point he grabs up a little baby boy to save it from falling and gets winged by a bullet. Some of his blood hits the baby. He ducks away from the killers and stops to gently wipe away the blood and whisper soothing apologies for bleeding on the little guy. It was an amazingly still moment of tenderness in the midst of the fast-paced violence of the gunfight. I was really impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insane","review":"I will keep this review short and sweet: This movie is crazy like rabies. i can safely say, this is the best action movie ive ever seen, and probably will ever see. it is well worth the ten bucks you will pay for it including shipping, and then some (actually, and then A LOT). the only downside is that the transfer is sub-par, but im rating the movie and not the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable but amazing!","review":"What can you say about a gun fight that shoots up a hospital with babies all over the place?

(Or are they?) There are undercover agents and many twists and turns to keep you guessing and on your toes with the story. But in the end, it is the amazing action that will have you sitting with your mouth open saying how did they do that?!As a older woman who has just discovered Hongkong films, this is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece.","review":"This is definitely one of the two best action movies in the world (the other one is THE KILLER).

If you can try to get this film on DVD (Criterion Collection)the special features are excellent i.e. trailers, audio commentary etc. Criterion have done a fantastic job with this DVD. The only reason I have given this film 4 stars is that in my opinion I do not think it is quite as good as The Killer or my personal favourite Bullet In The Head which I would give 5 stars.

This movie has unbelievable action scenes, a hell of an intense story line, very well-crafted characters! And of course, Chow-Yun FatThis picture is crammed with so much action, yet still manges to handle a very compelling story line, about heroism, loyalty, and honor.In a final note, I think Guiness World Rcords should look at this film for the category of most gun shots fired in a single movie. The hospital masacre scene alone appears to have five-times more gunfire than any action picture I have ever seen. I couldn't believe how long the gunplay in this movie went on for.

John Woo has a knack for filming an action sequence, and it shows up the best in this film.Frankly, aside from perhaps a couple Jackie Chan films like \\"Police Story\\", I don't think any other film coming from Hong Kong has influenced American action films so much.

All the gun battles were ridiculously unrealistic and way overdone. All the characters are shallow and most of the conversation is vapid. The body count in this movie must be several hundred. But what is worse, is that there are these sappy moments with the cheesy music where we're all the sudden supposed to care about the plight of one man after we just watched 100 invalids at the hospital get gunned down.I have to say, I'm really not a big fun of most of the action movies Hollywood pumps out, but they are significantly better than John Woo's Hong Kong flics.

But along with the operatic action sequences that would make Sam Peckinpah proud comes the acting. Chow Yun-Fat is, as always, calm and supercool. Tony Leung gives a great performance as the cop who, like Donnie Brasco, is becoming more triad than cop. Another actor who did a good job is Philip Kwok as Mad Dog, the voice of reason in all that slaughtering of innocent people at the hospital. Watch this film!

Woo demonstrates his gift for the cinema with this stirring and absorbing saga of a police vendetta against a ruthless gun-runner in modern-day Hong Kong. Woo has also often complained that Hollywood's incessant insurance and legal wranglings ruin the creativity and production of his work.

The gunfights were unbelievable-my jaw was on the floor! From the tea house to the climactic hospital bulletfest i was totally absorbed in it. Even 13 years after its release i still cant find one that measures up to it (except for maybe Woo's other great flicks The Killer and A Better Tomorrow 2) anyone who is a huge action fan like me MUST add this to their collection. this movie confirmed to the world that Chow Yun-Fat IS the world's coolest actor.

As with virtually all of his post-1986 HK films, Woo generates a tangible sense of melancholy by placing honorable, chivalrous - even lovable - characters into situations where all those precious moral virtues are constantly being challenged and devalued by the greed and cynicism of our modern age. And yet, Woo was eventually persuaded to conclude his picture on an optimistic note, with the villains routed and the good guys allowed to resume their places in the grand scheme of things. It's a daring move, given everything which precedes it, but no less effective than the all-out tragedy which Woo had originally envisaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad as You Might Expect","review":"Don't go out and buy this until you watch it on Amazon or through Netflix.If you've never seen this movie before, watch it and enjoy.But if have seen a fine quality version, you are bound to be disappointed with this one.It's about as bad as you might expect, given the history of shoddy blu-ray work Dragon Dynasty is becoming famous for.

However, on the whole, this is not nearly as inspired and nuanced as Woo's best film, The Killer, and Chow-Yun Fat's character seems underdeveloped and watered down here. Given that Woo's only real strengths are his action sequences anyway, this film is plenty acceptible, in an incredibly over-the-top way, but I prefered the cheesy pulp melodrama and clever situations that made the Killer a silly but balanced and engaging work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can get past the smell","review":"...these cookies are okay.

To do that, the top cover must be removed (small screws and washers). Why Delta did not install a piano hinge is beyond me. I did. An easy fix.2. There are no intermediate speed ratings on the face of the machine. I called Delta and the tech rep told me \\"that's not required for hobbiest\\".

To change speeds on all other presses you have to move belts. The variable speed dial on the front is slick, but don't force it. You are essentially changing the width of a pulley with the dial, so the belt has to move in or out in the groove. They reccommend oiling weekly, but the top is held on with six screws, which is way too much work to accomplish the task. installing a piano hinge on one side with a magnet catch would facilitate easier access to the pulleys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phewy","review":"I got the drill press last year as a gift.

However, the decal still has only the 500 and 3100 speed ranges. I made a decal in AutoCad 2000 that I stuck over the existing decal and shows a range of speeds (See images).

All the machining on the machine is shoddy, and today, it flew apart again, and cursing I threw it into the recycle bin. The only thing I kept that was any good on it was the light bulb and the key. Delta used to make good machines in days of yore. Then, I suppose, the white shirted efficiency expert who'd never once in his life been in a shop decided they could make more money by making throw away machinery, selling it for cheap and degrading the lives of anyone fool enough ( me ) to buy it.

There's a very hefty spring on the rear pulley spindle that is held in check with only a small retention ring that snaps on to the spindle. This is what gave way and allowed the spring to take flight with the pulley on it's heels. The manual was useless & I had to puzzle out how to fix it.

Have not yet contacted manufacturer since even under warranty, shipping and return shipping would cost $6 for a $10 item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product to have around.","review":"Holds pressure reading after removed from valve stem. Well made with quality materials. Long hose provides easy access to t=valve stem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, unreliable","review":"I bought one of these several years ago, expecting reliability and accuracy. I got neither. The first one failed after 2-3 years, it was replaced by the company, although I paid shipping. The second unit failed after 2 years, giving erratic readings, with a dial indicator that won't zero. Totally untrustworthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tire Gage","review":"This is a very nice tire gage which appears to be well-built and also well-designed. It is easy to read with large numerals and markings. The construction is mostly brass and the bleed and hold button functions very well. The flexible hose is a plus and the nozzle seals without air loss on the tires of both of my cars, one of which has valve extenders. As best I can tell, the accuracy of the gage is quite good, within one or two pounds at most.I gave this product four stars instead of five only because it was \\"made in China\\". When I e-mailed the company about this, I was advised retailers are reluctant to give shelf space to American made products if they can't meet the Chinese price point, even if the American made products are better quality. Consumers also seem to put price above quality. Something to think about the next time you are shopping at a \\"big box\\" store. You may also want to read Hedrick Smith's book, \\"Who Stole the American Dream\\", which is also for sale on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"I have not tested this against any other source to verify if it's accurate, so I cannot speak on behalf of accuracy. However, i love this gauge. I used to only use those 99 cent gauges you would get at the check out at Auto Zone, and I just like this one better. It's pretty solid, the bleeder button is very convenient, and it is also very cool that the needle stays after you remove the nozzle from the tire (it stays until the bleeder button is pressed). Overall, i found that I just like reading the pressure on a dial gauge a lot better than one of those stick gauges (especially since each gradation is 1 psi, so there's no reading between the lines). A digital readout would be cool, but if you get one of those than you have to always be concerned about the battery (and you know that it will die when you most need it too). Very nice gauge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest IRS humor book I have ever seen","review":"I bought my copy in 1980 at the U of Houston bookstore for 28cents at the close out table.

I thought I was purchasing a book about facial muscles and how they could be exercised to achieve a tighter look. After all, the title says \\"Non-Surgical Face Lift: Bodybuilding for Your Face.\\" But the book is nothing but a long-form advertisement for a face lift procedure usually done in Canada! And to top it off, it's very expensive and takes 12-16 weeks of twice-a-week procedures to produce the results. I can't believe I just spent $$$ on an ADVERTISEMENT for a face lift!!! Very deceptive - this shouldn't be advertised as a \\"book.\\" I only gave it one star because they won't let you give a lower score!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan-G face lift costs more time & money than a regular facelift & does not last as long","review":"This book is NOT about you exercising your own facial muscles. You need to get hooked up to a special machine located in Canada or Chicago, IL. It actually costs more than a face lift and needs repeating to keep up the slight results. Seems like a waste of time & money (to me). Just by writing & selling this book, the author has probably gotten her Pan-G lifts done free of cost for advertising and wears so much makeup it is difficult to tell if the procedure really works. I was very disappointed with this book & honestly cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the pan-g non-surgical face lift","review":"I personally agree with the other two reviews.

It offers numerous nontraditional and visual ways of presenting data, and can be used in any academic subject.Nancy Margulies shows her creativity in other ways. She presents her ideas themselves in map form, and even suggests nontraditional resumes that summarize one's qualification in terms of maps. She includes simple sketches that can be used in maps, and these sketches, according to her, do not require artistic talent to draw.Margulies stresses the fact that there is no right or wrong way to present information in these maps. And, of course, one has to practice mapping ideas in order to become comfortable doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun introduction to Mind Mapping","review":"I love this book. It's very straight forward and makes for a really quick read. Theory and discussion are written on the left pages, while the right side contains full size, wonderfully hand drawn, mind maps featuring some topic or style or technique that is discussed next to it. The book is broken down contextually by chapters. First it teaches readers the basics, then it gets into a few good uses for maps, followed by teaching you how to build a personal symbology. The rest of the book discusses techniques and uses for mapping in educational environments, an adult's personal life and professional businesses. It also includes an extensive bibliography and resource listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of mindmapping","review":"Mapping Inner Space is the first mindmapping book that I have purchased. There are many examples of mindmapping and many how-to guides on-line, but since mindmapping is most effective as a paper- or whiteboard-based process, having an actual book is helpful. Almost every left page has written text and the right page features mindmaps that illustrate the concepts discussed in the text or provide examples. There are color examples throughout the books. The mindmaps vary in quality, so you can see how complicated maps might look and also how quickly-drawn maps might appear. The application chapter covers many applications from using mapping as a daily and weekly planning process to problem-solving to sketching out your resume. There is also a chapter on creating your own symbols, again with several examples ranging from simple to complicated. In the short time I have had the book I have already used the visual mindmapping process to help memorize content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who has the time?","review":"I bought this book based on the 10 positive reviews it received. Unfortunately, my money would have been best spent on a Tony Buzan book. MAPPING INNER SPACE has serious downfalls. Mainly, all the mindmaps in the book are rich in color with excellent drawn pictures...how could I even attempt to duplicate this? Though the author states several times that drawing perfectly isn't required, her own examples demonstrate that her drawing skills are very superior. Also, the use of different colors made her mind maps frameable...how would have time during a meeting to draw such elaborate pictures? I would highly recommend that you buy one of Tony Buzan's earlier books on this subject...you won't feel so intimidated when you read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"wide-ranging application of mindmapping theory and technique","review":"Not only does this book contain the basics of mindmapping techniques pioneered by Tony Buzan, it presents something that many of us are lacking -- stroke by stroke exercises in drawing simple iconic figures that can be quickly mastered and incorporated into your mindmaps....as someone who is \\"graphically challenged\\" I particularly appreciated these drawing lessons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read!","review":"This book presents visual mapping in both written words and graphic form. The consistency between the two forms makes learning extraordinarily fast. I read it in one sitting and have begun to use the techniques already to facilitate my writing. My one wish was that the publisher had done it in color. Ah, but this would have increased the cost to something I might not want to have spent before seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Jarvi shows Berlioz at his best","review":"Even if you have multiple recordings of Symphonie Fantastique, you owe it to yourself to hear this recent release. The Cincinnati Orchestra plays on par with any top ensemble and the sound that Telarc gives us here is simply the best I've heard. Jarvi's take on Symphonie Fantastique reveals Berlioz's originality in orchestration and rhythm without a hint of exaggeration or fuss. I've heard well over a dozen recordings of the \\"symphony\\" over the years -- a few I've kept and I will now put this one on top of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soporific","review":"Expected more from Cincinnati/Telarc (see Kunzel, Erich cond. Hard to believe mostly the same musicians played so well for his baton.) Lightweight Gallic performance, recorded at low levels with little bass, dynamics seldom exceed much of anything (far under reference level technically), little hall reverb, all in all like sleepwalking through while mechanically doing each note on pitch and in largo tempo cutting off transients. This misfire has no resemblance to most other recordings of the work; it will not interrupt anyone's sleep or interfere with their concentration elsewhere for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Description of the ElectraTrac Extension Cord","review":"The ElectraTrac extension cord is advertised as \\"6 outlets spaced 8 feet apart\\" on both the website and the box.

She really just keeps it in her bed and cuddles with it (she calls it \\"baby\\") at night. She doesn't like to put her in the snuggle pod though. We got the boy version of this, the 'Lil Peanut, as a gift to her from her brother when we had a baby boy (she was 20 months at the time) but she's never latched on to that one like she did the Sweet Pea.

So when my sister unwrapped my small gift for Emily (peanut), her eyes teared up, then stated to laugh and just us two shared a moment at the baby shower; just us & peanut.This seems to be a very safe toy, no buttons to come off, nothing hard to hurt herself on, no moving parts to pinch a fingers and as babies do, put everything in their mouths, there will be no fuzz or lint to dig out of Emily's mouth.

We found these in a specialty toy store and love them. My boys cuddle them and pretend to feed them from their zippy cups, they even bring them to me and tell me the baby is stinky and we change its diaper using one of their newborn cloth diapers. They think this is hysterical. I love this baby, it's soft and cute, and perfect for 1-year-olds.

We drained it, returned it and got another thinking this can't happen again. Well guess what another seam leak. We were smart this time and only filled it up with ten inches of water.

But why isn't it being sold with the 2500 pump?","review":"Got rid of the ring style pool (which I did not like, you can see my review on it) and bought the metal frame and loved it!! Had it up for 3 years before we moved and gave it to a friend. Absolutely the way to go if you want an inexpensive above ground pool. We got lucky with the one we bought as it came with the 2500 pump and it worked great. Now it seems that they are selling them with the 1500 which is no where near powerful enough to do the job it needs to do for a pool this size. Needless to say you now you have to spend an extra $100 or more for the larger pump. Come on Intex, you know better and if you want to keep business then include pumps equal to pool size. In my opinion the 1500 is only adequate for pools \\"under\\" 15'. This is why you get 4 stars rather than 5!! All in all we had a blast swimming each summer and the pool/2500 pump help up wonderfully!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for the entire family","review":"This Pool set is awesome.

In a matter of 10 seconds. Then the fun started, it started blinking L L L - I have no idea what it means, but it's been doing that for the past year or so.I'm just not impressed.

I e-mailed Maverick and they seem very nice but the device has not performed like it should. It states that it works 100 feet away. I am lucky if I get 30 feet away. The device has some very cool features and the 2 probes is what really sold me, since I do a lot on my off set smoker grill.

Out of the box, the two that I purchased wouldn't work. I was OK with the fact that they wouldn't transmit at the claimed 100' but at under 5' seems a bit ridiculous. I can get one sensor to work off one probe but not the other. I have a single sensor unit that I purchased from Meijer years ago and it still works fine.

I bought it because it came with 2 probes and I can purchase them separately if needed later. I have found that the remote unit won't update if I get it more than 2-3' from the sensor which defeats the purpose of having a remote unit. My past units (different brands) have allowed me to go into my home while something is on the grill and I could monitor the temperature from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware ... product not as advertised!","review":"This product was advertised to go over temps of 500 degrees, however the fine print in the literature that came with it said that if the temp goes over 480 degrees it will damage the unit.

The problem i have with this is the sync function between the two devices stopped working after only about 20 minuets of use. In the book it says it has up to 100 feet of coverage. I go from my smoker to my kitchen (about 10 feet and through a sliding glass window). 20 mins later and the grey part stopped giving me reading on my meat in the smoker. So i went back to the book so it can show me how to sync it back up. I did that and had a reading again. I go back to sit down in my kitchen and it happens again. I then sat next to this thing for about 15 mins and it did it again. Obviously this is not working as designed. Which makes me not happy with this product. Also, if you are using this with a PROQ or Weber Smokey Mountain (WSM) smoker, the probe will not fit through the eyelid that came pre-fab on your smoker, which is a bummer as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Just took this out of the box and tried it out today and if there were someone from Maverick here I would of loved for the to see this piece of crap in a action. The reciever won't work outside of 10 feet which was the whole purpose of buying this thing. People on here saying the radio reception works great need to come see this thing at my house.

Out of the box, the remote system did NOT work. I didn't return it because I thought I'd just monitor it from the base unit. When not in use, I removed the batteries and stored it in a cool, dry place. After about 4 smoking sessions, I decide to smoke a turkey yesterday for Easter. One probe registered over 300 degrees and the other registered over 192 degrees. It is shot. My wife had a cheap Wal-Mart temp probe she bought for under $20 that we've had for over 10 years.

A must have for grillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but ...","review":"Apparently this company doesn't have terrific quality control; reviews of their other thermometers frequently mention problems with bad batches of product. This is the first item I've bought from their line, and it's a bust. The transmitter and receiver lose their connection every couple of hours, and don't communicate at all when separated by 25 feet or more. Much worse, the sensors register temps at least 40 degrees lower than actual temps, as measured by charcoal ribs and a cheap but reliable instant-read thermometer I used as a control after ruining the first batch. I'll exchange this one for another because the problem MIGHT be the batch, and because this is a great idea and very handy for long, slow barbecue cooking. Meanwhile, I'm not just unimpressed but disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just never worked","review":"I was very excited to receive this product for use in slow cooking.

The probes were both reasonably accurate when tested in boiling water, but 30 minutes after putting the 20 pound turkey in the grill, the reading was 180 degrees. I think this is due to the overly long probe (you couldn't possibly stick it all the way into the turkey) being heated by the grill heat. So in effect, it was reading a combination of grill temperature and turkey temperature.Additionally, the remote lost contact with the sensor several times in the 60 minutes that I used this product.

After thinking about it for several minutes, I finaly understood how to use it. Tried it on a yeast temp check and it worked fine. I then tried it on some deep fried oil and it seemed to not like the extreme temperature. Then I tried it for the Turkey bake. It was an 18 pound bird, and I set the device as instructed. Within an hour and a half this read the Turkey was done. After realizing the device was a complete piece of junk, I turned it off and made arrangements to send it back to Amazon. Dont waste your time or money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless will not stay connected","review":"The connection to the sending unit only stays synced up for 15 minutes which means that I had to keep going back to the transmitter to get them to sync up again. This was happening even though I was only 10 feet away. Very frustrating and pointless if you buy this unit to use the wireless feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indispensable item for cooking!","review":"I was initially cautious when I first purchased this product as there were several critical reviews. However, I have found nothing but great results with this thermometer. The instructions for use were very straight-forward. Setup was a breeze. I have cooked multiple pork shoulders and other various items in a smoker and found that without the advantage of thermometer like this, I might have otherwise overcooked a fine piece of meat. For the price, its well worth it. Dual probes are especially nice when checking the internal temperature of not only the meat, but also the barbecue/oven/grill that you are utilizing. Great product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return, button didn't work. Stay away.","review":"I usually don't write reviews but I thought I would warn people about this product.

After reading the directions, I attempted to use the ET-7 while cooking a pork roast on my grill.I became concerned when I inserted the probe into the roast and the temp showed 54 degrees. My quick read thermometer showed 40 degrees internal temp. I placed the meat on the grill making sure the probe did not touch any metal and started cooking. The remote sensor lost connections twice and I was only 20 ft away from the grill.After 30 minutes, the alarm went off for an internal temp of 160 degrees. The roast was nowhere near done. Quick read showed the internal temp to be near 100 degrees. Roast cooked another 45 minutes and the temp was around 165 degrees using the quick read thermometer.Sent the unit back and Amazon has already confirmed my refund is in process. Great follow-up from Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment:(","review":"Bought this less than a week ago and Man, I really really wanted to like this product! I messed with it for several hours; testing the probes in boiling water along with the transmitter.

(and i don't mean positive).I did read the reviews and decided to take the plung even if the 1 star rating was as much as the 5 star ratings!! Well, you live and learn. Those rating it a 5 probably work for the company b/c no way is it close to any rating above 1!!!On a side note, it does have some bells and whistles but what good are they if it doesn't work properly?!!!

I was also able to monitor the other turkeys in a large wood fired smoker. Just to make sure I didn't destroy the probe in TBE I used a small piece of tin foil to protect the probe cable as it entered TBE in case the heat of the fryer case was too hot for it.No problems with it. Like most wireless devices of it's kind it has about the range of a cordless phone. I got about 75 feet outside but when I went into the house, also about 75 feet, I lost communication.

Dual sensors for dual meats or for two different parts of the same cut.My experience thus far, however, is that the remote sensor and the broadcast unit (to which the probes connect) is finicky at best. When it actually connects, it is great, but most of the time it isn't actually receiving information and stays stuck on a single temperature giving the impression that it is receiving. Although I was quick to recognize this problem, during the final few minutes of a cook, this could have obviously ruined the meat.I've tried replacing batteries in both units but the problem persists. Certainly unfortunate as while the receiving unit is loaded with features, when the most fundamental part won't work (actually reading temperature), it makes the entire system worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"Gave up trying to get the wireless connection beyond 12 feet so just used it as a regular thermometer that I had to run in and out of the house to keep checking the temperature...way over paid for that, the connection is horrible on this tiny piece of crap.

I had meat in the smoker... and it was getting hotter...I was actually seeing temp updates... then after not paying attention for a few minutes, I checked and the temps were way hotter than the reciever reported - since it hadn't gotten any updates from the xmitter!! ARGH! And eventually a 'loss of lock' was obvious. So much for sitting in the house and watching the temps!

After 3 years of moderate use, one of my probes shorted out which is acceptable.I ordered a new unit and the new probes a WAY thinner than the old ones. These thinner probes are junk!!! One of the new probes was dead out of the box so I returned the whole package and ordered a replacement.

The problem common to both was that the remote readout receiver only worked \\"when it wanted to\\". Sometimes it showed the same temperature as the transmitter, sometimes it showed the temperature as it was a few minutes before. If you are monitoring a roast you need to take out of the BBQ at a particular temp, it was pretty useless.

I plugged both probes in and one read 70 degrees and the other 110 degrees - on my kitchen counter! I handle the probes carefully - never immersed in water, never exposed to excessive temperature, no reason for failure. Also it has a very limited range on the remote-receiver distance. I had trouble getting a constant reading even though my kitchen is only 45 feet from the BBQ. Great Idea - Poor Execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"very convenient","review":"I really like the convenience of having the thermometer in the barbeque on the porch and the receiver in the house. The receiver sounds an alarm when it reaches your set temperature. It is nice having two probes to use for different temperatures for different meats or cooking preferences. I bought this to replace one I had that stopped working or so I thought. It turns out you need to be careful when you wash the probe not to get water in it. If you do get water in the probe it will not read the correct temperature. In time it will dry out and work again. By the time I received my replacement, my old one was working again. The only other limitation is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver is a bit short.

Mark Feld must have been laughing up his sleeves when he heard the theory postulated in this book. Having said that, this is a lot of fun if you're into \\"true\\" political drama. Invaluable insight into the histories of Bob Woodward and G. Gordon Liddly highlight this book, in spite of its ultimately incorrect conclusions. When I read it, I was convinced of its gospel truth ... It is VERY convincing.

Overall I think this book is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose and EXTREMELY boring","review":"I am a fourth year neuroscience major and found this book to be extremely verbose and boring.

It covers almost everyone in great detail and is a valuable part of my jazz library.but, the book is frustrating to use. I just hate the rating system, it needs something better. Maybe 10 stars instead or something. Nearly everything in here is either 3, 3 1/2 or 4 stars and not everything is the same. Of the many titles rated 4 stars there are radical differences between them. It's just not a very good system.that's about all I can say - it's the best thing out there that I know of but if you want a more comprehensive reference it is just not realistic to expect it all in one book. This is as much as you can get into a book pretty much.

Jazz music comes from a place -an exclusive reality marked by poverty and anti bourgeoise values. It is unfortunate that all the jazz festivals and audiences are bourgeois. Their commercial values will never be able to purchase jazz-African. They will only understand the commericial values and not the true essence of Jazz- African music. For Africans, music has always been an expression of our exclusive and dire reality. Caucasians will never understand it because it is simply not thier reality of commercialism, debauchery and intemperance. long live non bourgeois, non commercial African jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep in mind, reviews are subjective","review":"Of course this is a great reference, and with each edition, it gets better. Neophytes should not be scared off by the massiveness of the book. In fact, it's Core Collection and Four-Star-Plus-Crown features make it a good place to get an overview of jazz, and sort out what to buy from the thousands of jazz recordings available.One thing to keep in mind, though: reviews, no matter how authoratative, are opinions. Some of the four-star recordings here are ones that I wouldn't give a second listen to. Some of my all-time favorites rate only 2 or 3 stars. Not that I'm right, but tastes do differ. On the whole, I think there is a bias toward the more experimental, avant-garde recordings. This actually makes for a good counterpoint to the hatchet job Ken Burns and Wynton Marsalis did in their PBS series, but still, it is a bias."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than a music reference.","review":"What an excellent tool this is--as well as a fine read. There are plenty of omissions, some potentially infuriating, but anyone who follows the numerous editions of this will already have resigned to that loss at the expense of accommodating everything else. And, anyway, a complete catalog of all jazz would be (at least somewhat) beside the point, not to mention virtually impossible. This is a catalog of a selection of all the great jazz out there. And it's absolutely essential. There is quite simply no other reference that even comes close to matching this one in regards to information, accessibility, and passion. It's a platform for discovery. Hopefully (Richard Cook, RIP), this edition won't be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the William Monk series","review":"William and his barrister friend Oliver come to the aid of Hester, whose latest charge died in her care, and the family is accusing her of their matriarch's murder. William and Oliver must go to Scotland, where Oliver isn't authorized to practice law, because that's where the trial is. The courtroom drama is as good as those in Scott Turow's and John Grisham's novels. Who framed Hester, and why? That's what William's about to find out. . .The three friends face life and death together here, and you can truly feel the bond that's been established among them. Though they don't always like each other, their loyalty and valor in helping one another makes this series a real delight. A great read all the way around"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Books, Good Writers and Matters Otherwise Irrelevant","review":"Anne Perry is a talented historical murder mystery writer. She shows her skills here as she has in her previous and subsequent works. I just wish her personal history had remained unknown as the circumstances of her own offence bear absolutely no resemblance to the wonderful characters and well researched historical locations she creates. One thing Perry has in common with her characters is courage. Courage to write and continue writing after her \\"past\\" was made known. To see such matters raised in reviews by the likes of booklist makes me wonder whether the reviewer was trying to draw some sick comparison or use the fact to assist in the marketing of the book to those whose only real interest is personal morbidity. Booklist even got the facts wrong, including the wrong country of occurrance and imprisonment. A good book, as this is, deserves to be reviewed on its merits not the childhood history of the writer however shocking that might be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sins of the Wolf","review":"Hester takes up a job as nursemaid in Edinburgh but finds herself accused of murder.This is the last in a stack of Anne Perry's that I have and having finished this, I think it might be a while before I pick up another one. A problem is that a lot of the book is devoted to Hester's predicament. Unfortunately this lacks any real suspense as the outcome is fairly obvious. The family of the murder victim, the Farralines are interesting but Perry spends too much time away from them. The revelations at the climax hint at a darker, much more interesting novel, had the book focused on them more. Pitt and Hester also prove to be rather irritating this time. The developments in their relationship are handled well but Perry's descriptions of their heightened emotional states becomes very tiresome, as Perry tends to repeat herself over and over again. So,there is a good story here but it's overwhelmed by the regular characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"CJM","review":"Good Service from this provider. Book came in the condition advertized. Book came quickly. I would purchase from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I picked this book up when an office was clearing out more because it was free than out of interest. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it through and through. Murder mysteries are not my usual forte but Perry has a knack for developing characters I came to care about. I've come to understand that this is actually a series and the main character is a recurring one but it still stands on its own very well. It isn't often a female gets the lead in a murder/mystery and I'm glad that she's feminine, smart, and capable.I was pleased with the historical setting (Victorian England) and found it pleasantly accessible and written in a concise contemporary style."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy ALL the Anne Perry novels","review":"I think the William Monk series is her best yet. You really feel as if you are in Victorian England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbed in Victorian life","review":"Anne Perry never dissapoints.

What a mistake. The plot makes so little sense that Jensen himself said in an interview that he couldn't make heads or tails out of it. Save your money and rent it if you must see it, but trust me when I tell you that you don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pathway leads to Banality.","review":"Ugh, thats all i said at the end of this ughfest of a movie. I didnt understand what the whole point of it was did the devil not want to kill her son? did the guy make all of it up to just kill people, are satanists bad partiers? The premise being this guy jake, plays this \\"pathway\\" game with his friends and the pathway does things for them, and you have to pay with your soul, and there are some satanists, and fingers in fries, and dominique swain plays herself (which is a huge psychotic Ho-bag). Apparantly some people who worship Beezlebub were supposed to sacrifice a baby, or not, and people saved the baby and raised it, and now 18 years later this demon wants her baby back (she hates not getting mothers day cards) and the girl who is supposed to play the girlfriend, is the demon mom, and ew there is implied incest. God its confusing, i know, I was bored to death, and maybe a little willing to sell my soul for a good horror movie to watch after this waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just like the two actors and the movie sinks!","review":"I only watched this movie because Jensen Ackles was in it. I got to say I like how he acts. The thing is that the story isn't very good. Suspenseful horror movies isn't my cup of tea. The other thing I liked about this movie is Shannyn Sossamon. She is so hot in this movie. I liked how this movie started out until the killing started. Then, everything changed and people were just dying left and right for no reason. The movie was just about finding the reason why people were dying. At the end of the movie, it didn't tell you the reason either. So, it lets you figure that part out yourself and you have no idea if you're right or not. I just don't like that and hate those kinds of movies. Two stars for two great actors and no star for this bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"this movie could have been great but ended up a story that did not flow and was confusing.. only great thing about this was Jensen Ackles.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devoured by DeVour","review":"DeVour was a fun movie. I have to admit the only reason I bought it was because of Jensen Ackles. The best part was that I only expected Sam Winchester to appear to save the day once or twice. Ackles didn't remind me of Dean Winchester at all. Several unexpected twist in the movie made it worth watching. I've watched it twice already so what more can I say."},{"rating":"2","title":"SATAN IS AT IT AGAIN","review":"Jake is having weird day dreams. When he turned 21, his stoned friend Conrad signs him up for an on-line game called \\"The Pathway\\" where you are called by phone and told to do something. Dakota, \\"his friend with benefits\\" is also part of the game. Jake starts to freak out when his horrible dreams come true. He turns to mystic friend Marisol to help him unravel what is going on. From the back cover you can tell Satan is involved in this somewhere. The acting was stronger than most B horror movies. The plot moves along at a good clip without many slow scenes. The f-bomb gets dropped a few times. Plenty of blood, light on gore. Sexual situation, simulated sex and brief nudity. Some good old fashion techno Satan worshiping sound track. Minor, fairly predictable plot twists and of course Mr. S himself. Solid 4 star satanic thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let-Down","review":"The movie starts off well enough and has all the elements of a great movie, but somewhere in the middle all that gets lost. I've watched it ten times trying to figure out where it went wrong and how the ending makes any sense at all. I would not recommend this movie to a friend, though I will admit that I love it. It's like the train wreck you can't turn away from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a Horror Movie","review":"I basically bought this because of Jensen Ackles (am a huge fan!). I'm a horror fan as well but this movie disappointed. Although Jensen was good as usual, it's a pity the movie wasn't. It started promising enough but went downhill about half way through. Rent it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't you glad its a rental?","review":"Jensen Ackles stars as Jake, a confused college kid with two loser friends, and a penchant for some terrifying nightmares. When Jake's friends sign him up for an onlinecomputer game they find the game has some chilling real-life consequences- the game acts as a conduit to a satanic cult which controls its players by inducing them to perform horrific acts and then to commit suicide.I rented the film mostly because I'm a Jensen fan. The acting isn't bad but the film didn't hook me. I felt bad for Jake's too friends, never really liked Marisol (Jake's girlfriend), and found the ending to be a serious ewww moment.The finale culminates in a rather unsatisfactory way (at least for this viewer)... 2 stars. Mediocre horror made somewhat more palatable by Jensen's presence. I predict this will be one of those films, Jensen would like to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":";0(","review":"Did not like it it was corny and I was confused maybe it's just me but did not get into it.

I heard the script changed from day to day so if it seems a little lost,thats becuase it was. Personally I really enjoyed the film. The actors were all great and that makes any low budget horror film a pleasure in my book right there. Plus I got quite the guilty pleasure out of seeing Jensen Ackles and martin Cummins in this film together. Not to mention jensen's dad playing his dad. If your a jensen,Martin or William Sadler fan it's worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect too much","review":"And you'll be happy. For Jensen Ackles fans its a great film. He's the lead and has some great scenes. (A showdown with his dad is very well done). I watched a friend's DVD and enjoyed it. And will be buying it myself. Go in with mediocre expectations and you'll be fine. The gore is pretty well done, like other posters I thought the ending was a bit of a cop out but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie ever made","review":"Everything about this movie is awful. Nothing redeeming... The acting is terrible.. the script is complete nonsense, the directing is bland and unremarkable. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some terrible movies. This blows them all away. Usually I can laugh at movies when they're really bad, there's nothing laughable about this garbage. I wouldn't even know where to begin... No suspense at all. Sickeningly bad. Save yourself the trauma and skip it. I've also noticed that the only people who like this movie at all seem to be obsessed with the lead actor in a really scary and sad way. Avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"D (evour) (spoiler)","review":"Yes this was a D movie dont' waste your time on it. Its very cliche, the acting isn't very good. This is a cheap rip off of Secret Window. Its not funny, not very scary just stupid. Don't waste your time on this garbage.

Read my other reviews for better movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught me off guard...","review":"This movie follows a typical supernatural path that most horrors take. Its centers around the main charcter who is always seeing visions. However, none of the visions make any sense. It is about the internal struggle we all have with good and evil.The longer I watched this, the more confused I got. I DID enjoy watching due to its constant twists and good cast. I liked it for the fact that the movie gets darker and meaner as it goes. It has a pretty original plot and follows pretty well. 4 out of 5 stars because the ending wasn't on par with the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even the pretty could save this movie.","review":"Jensen Ackles is pretty, I know, but even his good looks couldn't keep me from wanting to stab myself in the face. The script is bad, the acting is bad, the directing is bad, and the plot doesn't make a lick of sense.And for some reason, Jensen's character having sex without taking his pants off was the deal breaker for me. I mean, WTF? If you were his girlfriend, wouldn't you want to take off his pants? Yeah, me too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devour is one for the skeet shoot. Pull, release and shoot it!!!!","review":"On his birthday, Jensen Ackles (Smallville, Supernatural) gets a surprising birthday gift. His friends hook him up into a website called \\"The Pathway\\" a game where they call you and you tell them what to do and they get it done for you. Suddenly, bodies pile up and nothing is what it seems for Mr. Ackles as he goes down a path which leads to the end where of course for me it was obvious who it was predictable. Sad sad horror wanna be delivers no goods and a wast of a perfectly good cast, well Shannyn Sossoman (40 Days and 40 Nights, The Order) and Dominique Swain (Face/Off, Lolita) arent that good of actresses anyway. Also starring William Sadler (Demon Knight, Die Hard 2), Teach (Limp, Fierce People), Martin Cummins (Ice Men, Just Candy), Alan Ackles (Hexed, Walker, Texas Ranger) and Rob Stewart (Two of Hearts, The Pawn).

No one can deny Julia's honest examination of her own religious beliefs, and what she was taught through her life. As an agnostic, I enjoyed the performance, but I have found that religious folks that can separate their belief from others, also enjoy this story....because she is so honest and so raw.I've noticed that the one and two star reviews hinge on the fact that the reviewers disapprove of her conclusion that there is no god. This is a shame. In the same way that I as an agnostic can enjoy the works of Christian writers like CS. Lewis, despite my conclusion that the religion itself is not true, anyone who can put aside their personal beliefs for a truly moving story of discovery, will enjoy this work.\\"Letting Go of God\\" is one of the most moving stories I have heard in years. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everythinh was great except for....","review":"I watched the dvd first ( from Netflix), then decided to get the cd so I could listen in the car.

I whole-heartedly believe in God, although I haven't been able to figure out much else along that line. Julia's performance is humorous without being irreverant. I get the feeling that she, unlike many other atheists, still very much respects those who do believe and does not think that we are uninformed, stupid, and gullible. I highly recommend this recording for anyone and everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Grabbed Me","review":"I previously read \\"Every Woman For Herself\\" and really liked it, so I picked up the other Tricia Ashley novel that my library offered. This book bored me to the point where I was skipping pages and skimming paragraphs waiting for something to grab me. I liked Cass and Orla, but never warmed up to Jason - Cass's bear of a friend with a reportedly horrible temper and missing wife. Dante Chase gave me the creeps, too. Yes, yes, haunted by his past and all that but where was the appeal? I never got to the point where I understood why Cass liked him so much.

The pictures are nothing special and the quality is terrible. We got this as part of a 4-book box set, and all the books came apart rather easily. My daughter was pulling a slide when it ripped through the page and I was unable to repair it so it could work again. The pages themselves got worn fairly easily as well. Once the slides fall apart and tears the page, the book is pretty worthless. I don't recommend these books. Our local dump now has our copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby's favorite!","review":"I am soon going to need to purchase another copy of this book. My daughter loved this book from the time she was nine months old because of the \\"surprise\\" value of having a matching colored animal pop out of the page for each color. It's fun to read the colors, and then slide out the hidden animal and read the animal name. It also encourages the baby to say the animal name with you--one of her early words was after I said \\"green\\" and she whispered \\"fro(g)\\". Now that she is 13 months old, it is still her favorite book, but now she slides the pages for herself. The book is sturdy, but I will still probabaly have to buy another copy with this intense use.

I had previously used another product until my dog chewed it up. As It turned out, I'm glad that she did. What I really like about this is that it shows you, in a red circle, exactly what the laser is bouncing off of. It takes the guess work out of making sure that it is not hitting something closer than the wall you are aiming for.

I like this one better than the former device because it has multiple beams (instead of a single beam) so it seems to have better accuracy and is less sensitive around windows (glare affected the other device). The only thing I that I have to get used to is that it seems to turn off in a relatively short period of time so I go to read a distance and realize the power is off.

In general, the reviews for ultrasonic measuring tools were negative but the Zircon was rated OK in several reviews. I have tested this unit for accuracy and repeatablility of meaurements from a few feet to 20 ft. or more (all indoors)and find it UTTERLY USELESS. Except for the case where you are measuring a distance to a flat, unobstructed, LARGE wall surface across a room with no obstructions OF ANY SORT (i.e. no furniture, light fixtures, curtains, pass-throughs, etc.) there is no repeatability. In repeated tests over the same distance, I found that displayed distances varied not by inches but by feet. It would be impossible to trust the measurements displayed by this unit. My advice would be to pay the extra money for a true lazer measurer.

Many of the songs have awful lyrics that detract from the beat and in many cases the songs are so short that they miss the real climaxes that are available in the longer version - for example, the Walhalla song by Gouryella sounds totally different if you listen to the original mix. And the original mix is hands down much better than the version on this CD.MOS should have done better. This wasn't worth the [money]. Wait a couple months and then download much of it off of Napster... Or buy either Trance Nation 2 or the Clubber's Guide to Trance mixed by ATB.

For the price, it's an awesome unit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not perfect","review":"This FM transmitter works pretty well, and it's nice to have the option of a full spectrum of channels to choose from to broadcast to. I use it for listening to podcasts, which are mostly spoken (i.e. talk radio). Sound quality is not as big of a deal for this purpose. For listening to music, I find the background static to be too distracting.Having used other FM transmitters, this one did not perform as well as I was hoping it would. I bought another transmitter from a smaller, lesser known company and the sound quality on that unit was actually much better. Unfortunately, it stopped working after a couple of weeks so I decided to get a higher quality model from Monster, a well known company. Overall, if you're listening to podcasts, it's great. For music, I'd try looking into other options before buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much background noise.","review":"I bought this product to replace a similar unit of different manufacture. The old unit started making noise through any radio I used, and I finally tossed it. I tried this Monster FM transmitter specifically because the reviews I read about it seemed to point to its quietness and low background noise. On the several radios I played my XM unit output on through this transmitter, all of them emitted a high pitched whine using it. I returned it for a refund.

Eleven months into it, the strange static began. I thought that a radio frequency was the problem (the LA/OC area is quite crowded). I was wrong; it was the item about to choke/croak.The product doesn't have the quality of a CD, so if you're looking for that, play a CD. It should last more than a year and the warranty, unlike their cabling, is just one year limited.I won't purchase this again.For the person who was getting sound from just one speaker, one thing to check for any MP3 player is the cabling. One sure sign that one side of the cabling isn't in the jack all the way is that sound comes from one speaker only.

One of the Best","review":"The key thing that makes this FM transmitter better than a lot of the Zune FM transmitter is that it doesn't charge your Zune.

Hey, it's not hard-wired and it's not a BOSE system, but for the price, it gives a great option for listening to something other than a tape or CD.

Not worth it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The monster in \\"Monster\\"","review":"I should have paid heed to the reviewers who complained about the \\"static\\" in their evaluations. I found only one station preset with minimal static. I tried programming in other stations with little luck. Also it takes less than a mile or so of travel to get out of range of a station with decent reception which means you now have to fiddle again to find a station setting which works. Can't, of course, do this while driving yourself and even as a passenger, I found it frustrating and eventually gave up. So, it's in my car, unused, and will probably stay that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around FM transmitter","review":"I use this FM transmitter for my iPhone 4 as an alternative to the horrible selection of radio stations available in my area (Northern California). Plug it in, and go...it's very easy to use. However, with all FM transmitters you'll get occasional static and interference. I won't fault this product for that, but I will say the sound quality is acceptable at best. If you find yourself hearing crackling/distortion, try lowering the volume on your device...THEN turn your stereo volume up instead, it makes a big difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally - an FM transmitter that works. It's not going to replace a wired connection, but I've had no problems keeping a signal on it from my way to and from work. I've had problems with an analog transmitter but this one is locked into the station you set it at. I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally I'm a little dissapointed...","review":"Unfortunately this item doesn't provide flawless quality through the radio. I can't seem to find a station that doesn't have any static. Not to mention, it's awkward to use.

(5 stars for that too, by the way). I tried 3 transmitters before I tried the monster. One was an e-bay accessory bundle special which was crap. The second was an Accurian which the Radio Shack guy says he has and works great. Not for me it didn't. Then I tried a GE from Target. Nope. So I broke down and bought the Monster. WOW! I get crystal clear reception on multiple channels and I am in the Twin Cities. It also worked great on a recent vacation to rural Michigan. I am very impressed with this and would recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"This worthless piece of flyweight plastic failed to perform at all.

So far, I have used the item only once, but it was a disappointment. We were driving an older Audi Quattro with a respectable sound system. We were out in a rural area away from big cities so there were some gaps in the frequency band. We tried many different frequencies but were unable to find a setting that would work without distortion. Luckily we had some decent CDs with us. My purchase was motivated mainly by the lower price. I regret I made a poor choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"this monster product and most- if you like to listen to your ipod with a little or alot of static in back ground then you will like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I received this transmitter about a month and a half ago and I am satisfied with it. I was just happy that it worked with my Sony Walkman Mp3 player. The sound quality is not omg! This is Great but it is good enough. I am thinking it depends on your sound system in your car and the quality of your mp3s. It is easy to use which is good. Overall I am happy with it. If you are not really picky and looking for something to play your MP3 players that is not an IPOD this transmitter will do. I have no complaints about this product. I am a satified customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more quality control","review":"Based on the many positive reviews, I think I got a bad unit. I could only get sound (and poor quality sound at that) out of the left channel. I got a refund and replaced it with an Accurian from Radio Shack, which sounds much better. On the positive side it's a good-looking product. I'd recommend purchasing in a store that allows no-hassle returns just in case you get a lemon like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth transaction thanks","review":"Product as described, excellent price a must have for car stereo & easy to use !buy yours now you wont regret it is a monster product the best in the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out good but failed","review":"Bought this product to replace an existing one that was eight years old.

Would NOT recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Ordered this to replace a Griffin transmitter that I have had for years. This one pales in comparison. While I understand that all transmitters have some static when listening through them, this one is worse than I expected. Not only do you have to deal with the poor signal, the volume level of this one is also very poor. There are several songs on my ipod that I literally have to turn up the volume on both the ipod and the radio to even hear. Would not recommend. My Griffin transmitter is falling apart and I still have better sound using it. I guess I'll use it until it quits completely and then try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Bother","review":"I purchased this hoping to get the music downloaded on my iphone to be played in my car. I guess I did not understand that you need to tune your fm radio to a station with minimal noise in order for it to work well.

A good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This product works great, especially compared to the Belkin Fm Transmitter that I had before. This one keeps a consistent sound all the way home on my 1 hour commute home. My other one would always have frequency and static noise and I always had to move the transmitter or my phone (which is my MP3 player also) around to find a good sound. With this one, I just hook it up and it stays the same all of the time. I also have a hookup with my phone so I can talk through a microphone and listen through the speakers and the other callers said they could hear fine without all of the static. Very stable product. I only rated the optional ratings at a 4 because this is such a new item and I might come back and bump that up to a 5 rating. Overall I did rate it as a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work so well for me","review":"I wanted to listen to podcasts on ipod classic. I read reviews before ordering and was hoping to be one of those that found it worked well. Didn't happen for me. There was too much interference once I neared the city and audio became bad -- too much static, like a weak radio station. Since that is my regular commute and the reason for the purchase, using this product just doesn't perform well for me. I've reverted to making cd's if there's something I want to listen to on the drive. It's a pain but the audio is clear, which is important when listening to spoken word."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one so far","review":"I have tried a few different transmitters and finally threw them away.

I could never get a setting that produced a decent sound quality.I also tried this in our 2005 Sienna thinking the results might be different - no luck.I tried different devices, including my smartphone (Droid Eris) and an iPod Shuffle.Amazon processed the return perfectly, even though I no longer had the original packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it Quit","review":"This product is great - gets hold of a station and keeps it.

Sound quality is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"the item was as good as the reviews said it was, the only unfortunate parts about a transmitter is that in the area that i live, even if it is 88.1, it will sometimes interrupt my music with a stronger radio station. It seems very hard to find a channel that will never be in use. and when your station is taken over, it can be a hassle to switch both the transmitter, and the car radio. it can cause a driving hazard. so make sure you preset channels, also this transmitter doesn't have a clip to hang on to anything, which would be the only thing i would add on to it. but for sound quality, and ease of use, this thing is probably the best you will find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, strong signal","review":"I have a little experience when it comes to FM transmitters and I have noticed that a lot of them have such a weak broadcast signal that I usually have to have the device in the back seat just to hear the music (my antenna is in the back of the car).

It was a little more expensive than I thought it should be for the basic features it has, but I decided to give it a chance. The sound quality wasn't excellent but was well above what you would get from a cheap device, and the signal strength was really good. From what I've written one would think it would be a 4 star device, and it would be have been had it not shorted out 6 months after I bought it.I take care of my electronics so I know it wasn't excessive force or abuse that did it in. Now whenever I try to use it if the move the cable even the slightest bit the left speaker cuts out, very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good name.

The little part where you press the buttons to choose the station is super sensitive. Barely touch it and it switches to another station. It frequently slides down between my seat and the center console, where I have to fish it out and the station gets changed again. Sometimes there seems to be static on several stations that I go through. The display also gets super hot, even if you have the light turned down.

As promised, it was also easy to tune and set up the three preset channels.I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a frequency that was far enough away from another station to get a quiet signal. Then I tried again. And again. I had no luck so I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound","review":"As with any FM Transmitter, you will pass through areas where there is interference. But, I expected that. This FM Transmitter has excellent sound. I was surprised at how good it sounds. I have tried it in both of my vehicles (the car antenna is in the back) and I get VERY GOOD results. Clear highs and deep bass and very little background noise. This is a very good product and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would work for me","review":"It was OK but not what I expected.

The vendor offered me a refund, but after shipping both ways, it's not the wisest decision. I was better off just keeping it.The sound over the FM was heavy in bass and not enough treble. The model I received was not the Full Spectrum, but instead, the model that offers just a few frequencies.

Sound was distant and hollow. Not anywhere near a quality radio station sound.Let's put it this way, if I were to tune to a radio station that had the sound I was getting, it might hold my attention for a little while, but, certainly not a station I'd be willing to preset on my radio.This is being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"works but....","review":"for as much as it costs, its a piece of junk.

I bought the Monster FM transmitter to work with my iPod. But I could not tune the device to any station so that my stereo and antenna could pick it up.

Hopefully, the hard line will work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best FM Transmitter So Far","review":"I've used a handful of different transmitters for my iPod from Belkin to Griffin, but the Monster had the best sound quality out of all of them. Signal is so strong that I rarely experience interference, and I don't even have to have my iPod's volume setting at maximum. With other transmitters, I usually have to turn up my car stereo volume high to hear my iPod and when I turn off my iPod, the radio comes on blasting. Not with the Monster.I do miss my previous transmitter, the Griffin iTrip Auto Universal, because it had the USB port that I can charge with. I'd give the Monster a perfect 5 star if it had that same feature.I should mention I can only use transmitters that connect to the iPod using the standard 3.5mm audio jack because my iPod's bottom dock is slightly broken in that it does not transmit audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after only a few weeks.","review":"The 3.5mm cable broke after about 3 weeks of use.

However, after about 30-40 minutes of playback, this unit fails and displays a flashing \\"J\\" in the display. If I let it sit for a while, it works again for another 30-40 minutes and then fails again. This failure is both repeatable and seen with a couple of different audio sources. I contacted Monster support via their website's email form, but there was no response.

The sound quality is terrible, and there is static on just about every channel. I live directly between Milwaukee and Chicago, so there are very few stations that have dead air.

It will also take your phone calls and put it on the loud speakers (which works well when the kids want to hear Grandpa or Grandma on the phone).

The T505 seemed to be more expensive over time.The thing that appealed to me about the T505 is that its wireless, so there's less wires.My only suggestion is that you program the Monster RadioPlay 300 to stations that will not interfere with the signal.

The transmitter makers have no vision....I an very disappointed and wasting almost 40 dollars for something like this in this economy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just isn't worth the money","review":"It seems easy enough to use at first, but you have to play around and find the best frequency for optimal playback, which can be difficult. Then you have to find the right balance between mediums, meaning sometimes you have to increase the sound volume on your MP3 player and decrease the volume on the radio, or vice versa. You never know exactly what to do, and it is very dangerous while driving.It never acts the same way twice...sometimes it works great, other times it's completely useless. The static feedback is quite noticeable. The buttons are super-sensitive so if the transmitter part just gently bumps something, it can easily switch to a different radio station by mistake, and throw off your music.I would highly recommend you pay the extra money for a better model.

I used the original 3-step Acnefree since middle school and it worked fine all through high school too, I always had a clear face.When I went to college I got horrible acne (in my opinion, it was probably considered mild or mild-moderate). Anyways I always had acne and I just couldn't do anything about it. Finally I just decided to get the Acnefree severe, even though I technically didn't have severe acne. I was hesitant at first because people said it burned your face and is only for people with severe acne. However, I have not experienced these issues and my face is completely clear. It is slightly drying, but just use a good moisturizer once a day and you will be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect by itself but... the best I've found","review":"First of all, as other reviews have mentioned this product is much better than proactive.

Yes, that's right--when one colony disappeared, another appeared just slightly n/s/w/e from the original position. It was very frustrating; I resorted to sleeping in different positions and other potentially helpful measures, but to no avail. Here are the specs of my skin:1. I have extremely dry skin2. I have extremely NON-sensitive skin3. I have acne just about everywhere4. I rarely go out in the sun5.

Usually one is healing while a new one is forming. They are painful, disfiguring and slow to heal. Took 2 rounds of Accutane which was supposed to cure me, but didn't. I've developed my own \\"surgical\\" intervention when possible, but the cyst has to follow a specific pattern to open with a sterile needle. If all else fails I go to the dermatologist for a steroid shot. For some reason, I've gone through a worse episode than normal so I bought AcneFree on 5/21 I'm four weeks in and this last week my face has begun to clear - no new cysts and the old ones healing more quickly than usual. In addition, the quality of my skin is improving. I'm also pleased that I've not experienced extreme dryness as others report.

I figured that if it worked, I would just make the switch, especially since it was only $20 and some change. WELL... so much for that!!! After 3 days, I had to stop using it because 1) the smell was HORRIBLE, 2) it made my skin feel like sandpaper, and 3) the lotion was soo thick, heavy, and gritty and left a white residue on my dark complexion. I would NOT recommend this product, especially if you plan to wear some sort of concealer or make-up; the lotion does NOT leave your skin smooth.

This product didn't do anything for me except waste my time.

The heroine starts out fine, but quickly becomes, well, an idiot, with over-blown reactions, spouting off typical \\"you've wronged me!\\" sayings that make any intelligent female reader grit her teeth and want to fling the book across the room.I couldn't finish this book.

Consequently, I automatically have tremendous respect for anyone who can actually stay the course. Nevertheless, I found this novella to be very disappointing. I'm not sure why all these other reviewers seem so amazed by it. There was a story, sure, but it wasn't at all clear to me WHY there was a story. In other words, I couldn't see why there was a story worth telling here.

I'm always aware that Robbins is grinning there behind the typewriter, and I'm there grinning with him. With Haskett, I was less aware of the writer and more aware of the writing. Take your pick.

The characterization was fresh and interesting and the descriptions of L.A.'s wasteland truly amusing.It was just not at all what I thought I was buying based on it being offered by Amazon as a \\"lesbian\\" book. Sure there are lesbians in it, but the categorization of it as \\"lesbian\\" at this site has always meant to me written by lesbians, for lesbian readers *and* featuring prominent lesbian protagonists, not just side characters. Saying this is a \\"lesbian\\" book would be like saying Basic Instinct is a \\"lesbian\\" movie because the female murderer was bisexual.So I'm not at all sure why Amazon *features* this novel on its list of books recommended to lesbian readers.

Obviously, customer satisfaction is NOT a priority for Electronics Expo, but simply a catchphrase to dupe consumers into purchasing their merchandise. The LP-to-Digital Recording System is simply a record turntable with a built-in pre-amp and recording software.

The software, not so much, but with the aid of these reviews on Amazon it wasn't too hard. The first try, I recorded the wav file from my LP, and split it into tracks ok, but when I burned the CD it only recorded the first track. Then I tried again, numbering all the tracks (and skipping the dead space where I turned the record over) and VOILA - a playable CD. I figured it out trial and error.

Easy to connect to the laptop (although the instructions say you can't use the mic input, it actually doubles as the line-in, so it does work). The software is a joke. It claims to do all sorts of fun things with editing, but unless you have weeks of free time it would be difficult to figure it out. I was able to record some LP's, but the \\"help section\\" is useless. Much of what it describes can't even be found on the software. It shows functions that aren't there.

The problems are numerous, primarily with the software.First, it is not compatible with Mac. Second, it will only work with Windows Vista after a download of the 48MB patch from the Cakewalk site.Once installed, the software suffers from serious usability issues. Nothing is intuitive, and the \\"tips\\" are self-contradictory.

The software provided was easy to handle with the exception of the pop & hiss removal part. DePopper works much better and is available on their web site. I have not used the \\"Copy to CD\\" part of Cakewalk because I use Nero for all my CD work.The instructions for assembly were good and a 45 record spindle adapter is included. The AC cord is long enough but the connection to the computer could be longer.

What I DID see frightened me; the turntable had no tracking mass adjustment, no anti-skating adjustment, and no strobe for speed adjustment. It was belt drive. In summary, if one had a few dozen LPs to digitize, it might do.

It also comes with software to enable it to download albums into the computer via cable (not usb) and clean them up if they are scratched (Cakewalk).

The second took 3.5 hours, the third about 2 hours and the fourth about 1.5 hours.Learning the software interface took an inordinate amount of time, even though I've been an interface programmer.After learning the software, it appears every album will cost about an hour to record, mark the songs, name the songs and write the songs as MP3. If I want to edit out song parts or eliminate pops/clicks, it will take longer.It's really time consuming and the software doesn't make it simple or intuitive.The turntable is of reasonable quality.

I kept thinking the taste would get better, but did not. The milk dispenser breaking down prompted me to return the product and purchase a Jura S9.

But then the problems began.According to Saeco, the machine would get air bubbles in its internal tubing and would start to sputter endlessly, then ask to be restarted. It would take me 15 minutes to an hour of starting and restarting the machine to coax them out, if I could at all. I got a replacement machine, and the same thing happened again.In the end, I gave up and the wonderful store I do business with replaced it with a Jura Z5 (with an additional payment, of course, because Jura is top-of-the-line stuff).

After years of low quality, overly lavish versions of Rite of Spring, I sought out a pure, intense interpretation. It's been noted by many that Stravinsky was never the best conductor of his own music. If only he could hear Gergiev's retelling. Strong, primal, but not overblown.

Chicago/Ozawa, now that's a nice recording. Boulez/Cleveland, awesome. I don't like listening to my favorite pieces and hearing orchestra clams.

I didn't think there was a problem until she asked me what a communist was. I asked her where she heard that word. She told me on the Barbie (My Sceen-Nolee) Cd. The Song is Soak up the Sun by Sheryl Crow. I never thought I would have to check out Barbie products. This is the first. My daughter and I have been collecting Barbies for about 8 years. So this is the first time I've been very upset. We are 100% Proud Americans and love our freedom in the wonderful United States.

Beyond this there is not much positive to say. Often Kagan can't even provide accurate summaries of Kubrick's films (one example is that he confuses the identities of the condemned men in Paths of Glory, and this effectively renders his thematic analysis of that film useless!). Kagan also seems to miss the entire point of certain films. One wonders why he even bothered writing such a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most shallow and worthless book on Kubrick.","review":"If I could give less than one star, I would. This book sheds no light on Kubrick's genius whatsoever. The majority of the book is a sort of Cliff's Notes on nearly every film Kubrick has made. The capsulation of these films are so brief and hollow, that he covers a work like A Clockwork Orange in a mere 20 pages. Not only that, but the book is full of errors when lines are quoted and references made. If you want a REAL book on Kubrick, read Mario Falsetto's works on this directoral master. I will use Mr. Kagan's, however, as a beer coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shiner for Kubrick criticism.","review":"The main problem with this book is the overall sloppy job of writing. It is clear that the author failed to take notes during the films, for his descriptions are filled with incorrect statements about things as basic as the story and other errors. In his analysis of The Shining, for example, he spends a few pages recounting the plot. In doing so, however, he switches many of the events around and getting them out of order. Furthermore, he also has a habit of getting the names of characters mixed up, or getting the wrongs names altogether. If you're looking for a much better book on Kubrick, try Thomas Nelson's Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I don't know why film critics think they can get away with this kind of thing. Imagine if somebody tried to \\"critique\\" a novel, a CD, or any other type of work by retelling the narrative (or lyrics, or whatever) in his own words. Dismissed without a second thought, needless to say. But film critics write 'em and get 'em published. To what end, I don't know.That said, this book plumbs new depths in that it's ALL the author does. There's no technical background or critical apparatus at all, merely scene by scene retellings of the films along with a bit of blather about \\"themes\\". The book's errors have been mentioned, but it should be reiterated that these are of a number and level of ignorance that's truly jaw-dropping. (My favorite is Kagan's identification of the drunken Shriners of \\"Killer's Kiss\\" as \\"some kind of street entertainers\\".)One of these days, Kubrick will get the film-by-film analysis he deserves. This one ain't even a beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish! Hideously inaccurate and lacking in insight.","review":"If you're looking for a collection of poorly-written and badly inaccurate plot summaries of Kubrick's work set alongside a summary of critics' reviews of his films, this is the book for you. Really a terrible work. There's literally LESS here than you would get from watching the films yourself and consulting the some of the fine Kubrick sites on the web which collect far more insightful critiques verbatim."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Inept Excuse For A Bad Thesis","review":"I have a theory: Kagan needed to write a thesis. He decided that Kubrick's work demonstrated the repetition of certain themes, and decided to \\"argue\\" accordingly. He wrote synopsis' of all Kubrick's films, then added a few pages to the end of each to justify his [Kagan's] \\"arguments\\".And voila -- a thesis, a C-, and next year it's the PHD...This is sophomore stuff. If you want critical insight read Nelson; if you want Bio, read Lobrutto; scandal, read Baxter; character, read Herr or Raphael; general information, read Cimet or Walker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parrot Talk and Kubrick","review":"Norman Kagan should get an \\"editing\\" credit rather than \\"author\\" credit. This book on the cinema of Stanley Kubrick is basically an accumulation of articles, interviews and reviews of his films and his life. Albeit some of it was interesting, the book is nothing I found original. At the end of each chapter, however, the author does take it upon himself to interpret the films in a manner in which he sees a destructive, non-sexual, non-emotional Kubrick. That of obsessive and homicidal. Attempting to make a \\"connection\\" in all the films which I believe is poorly attempted. I would move elsewhere to find word on Kubrick and his films."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kelly Family","review":"I have been a big Kelly fan for years, but they haven't produced a good CD in years.

I truly enjoyed the way the author wrote the story. Not only did he write about Father Schmidt and his crimes, but he also wrote vivid descriptions of New York City in the early 1900's. I hope Mark Gado's name becomes synonymous with James Patterson and keeps on writing. I can see Ed Norton or Johnny Depp playing Father Schmidt.

The material about Hans Schmidt, taken from the local newspapers, trial transcripts, and other documentation was fairly interesting, but the material about the Louisville case of the murdered child is pure fiction. Schmidt was never assigned to St. John's church. He was a visitor at another church. I saw one newspaper article that stated mistakenly that Schmidt was assigned to St. John's. I've been researching this case for a number of years and have found no evidence that Schmidt was ever at St. John's. The child who vanished had only been to the church once before and did not attend St. John's school. If there is evidence that Schmidt was at St. John's the day the child disappeared or the day her body was found, I'd love to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organics pride","review":"I love this organic gypsum.

Thalia has demonstarted not only in this album but in her new style of dressing that she is not unique at all and that she has an identity issue.The worst thing about this album has to be the fact that Tommy Mottola her husband and CEO of Sony Records, has used his connections to get MArc Anthony to do a horrible remake duet with Thalia. The song \\"The Mexican 2002\\" is a remake of the famous 80's freestyle song. Not to mention another remake in English called \\"You spin me round\\" We all remember that song, I bet, well she killed it. You can't you hear what she is saying in her English songs and her voice on the Spanish wanna-be Shakira tracks are not suitable with her music.Bottom Line:Hubby is paying to make her famous and not working, her talent is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"I am not impressed with this album at all but then again I don't think Thalia has any real substance. Her music has never been well-defined. I think Thalia's biggest problem is that she has always tried to go with the latest trends in everything from music to clothing. In one album she's into ballads, in another she's a \\"rockera\\", in another she is into banda, and now she's trying this whole \\"crossover\\" thing. The truth is that we don't need this kind of artist in the American music world...she's just a copy of Shakira, Britney Spears, J. Lo, etc. My advice to her: stick to ONE style and work on it. She's got a long way to go. If she really wants to cross over, she'll have to come up with something we haven't already seen.

Her self-titled CD has an eclectic mix of pop, rock, cumbia and powerful ballads. Also, there is a recurring theme in her songs: independence and self-knowledge. I love \\"En La Fiesta Mando Yo,\\" and \\"Y A Quien Le Importa\\" -- which are feisty, I-am-woman-hear-me-roar anthems. There are a couple of English songs in this CD; Thalia has blatantly declared crossover success. Thalia is a quantum leap forward from Arrasando.

Were it not for the awesome collaborators--such as the Kumbia Kings & Marc Anthony--and the brilliant production work, Thalia would not be able to stand alone. On the other hand, I wonder why Dead or Alive sold the royalties to their work; I bet they regret it now that their formerly likeable tune has been butchered by some malnourished diva with a truncated voice and Tommy Mottola's millions (yes, Thalia is married to Mariah's ex).

Being a couple years older than Seb (and, having gotten into rock/metal at a younger age), I was able to re-live some of those old memories, albeit with a UK twist.

I never quite completed it, because I became so frustrated with the gameplay (a bad attempt to mix \\"arcade action\\" along with \\"timed puzzles\\" and \\"text-based adventure game\\"). It was never fun, to begin with, and it was always frustrating. It's probably the worst game I've ever played. The translation into the English language was even done very poorly (I believe it was originally in French?).Trust me... it's the worst PC game I've ever played, and I have HUNDREDS of games I've purchased and played (some only part-way, some I've replayed multiple times)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Thing","review":"I am a psychotherapist who found the EmWave while looking for a biofeedback product that would help my clients self regulate their moods. I can tell you that it is the real deal--it works just the way it says it will. Of course, like most things, it will only work for you if you follow the directions for use. The purpose of the EmWave is to bring your heart, brain and autonomic system into coherence, which then creates a feeling of well being. I have used it myself, as have my clients, and when used as directed it does work beautifully. You will also be interested to know that the research behind the creation of the EmWave is evidence based and sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this film...","review":"You would be better served and entertained watching the HBO series \\"Autopsy\\" with Dr. Michael Baden. This struck me as a cheap and quick attempt to cash in on the popularity of forensic science. In this film you witness an autopsy of an elderly woman.

The video monitor is a piece of junk! Our house is only 1700 square feet and we cannot see the picture if you are more than one room away. Also, it gets a lot of static and becomes very loud with static during the night. I've been woken up more by the static that I have by my babies cries! The portable sound monitor seems to work well, except the batteries fall out very easily. If you just shake it a little, the batteries fall out and then they have to be reinstalled. Unfortunatley, we received this 2 months before baby was born and didn't use it for teh first three months, since he was next to us in a bassinet. I didn't save the box or the receipt. If I had, I would be taking it back.

I moved the monitor right out side my daughters door and it still doesnt work. It only worked for about 10 mins and then hasnt worked since. Yes there is a hum and if you dont mind it or dont have senitive hearing, its fine. It drove me nuts. If you want to try it, cause yes some homes get better reception, but buy it locally and hang on to your box and your receipts. As most of the reviews state, it goes bad months later, so make sure you can return it locally so your not out shipping cost. Just be aware when you purchase this monitor and hang onto everything. We are out to do more research for another monitor. We are looking at X-10 cause so far they have had the best quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Got this as a gift at my baby shower.

Overall, regrettable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware, It is a piece of crap!!","review":"This is a terrible baby monitor. The picture quality is terrible and the interference is awful. My sound has stopped working after 4 months, it either doesn't work at all or it has a terrible loud static and then when the baby crys it is so loud it will make you fall out of your bed. There is no way of adjusting this thing. I am temped to beat it up a little to see if it will make it work better. After trying to deal with this problem for the past week (we even put foil on the antennas to see if that would make the reception better, didn't work) we are going to contact safety 1st. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not worth it","review":"For the price, I would have expected better performance. Lucky for us it was a gift. The audio performs passably, although I found the maximum volume, on the video monitor at least, was too quiet. The video signal never worked reliably when the units were upstairs & downstairs, respectively. The interference from the cordless telephone, however, was unbearable. With just two channels to choose from, it was impossible to clear up even after trying all the channels on the cordless phone. I am much more satisfied with the Sony Baby Call 900 MHz 27-channel monitor (audio only though), in all respects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"We received this as a gift, and even it is hard to get a good reception sometimes, it is the best video monitor we found. We bought about 3 others to try, and they weren't as good as this one. I like how you can turn down the volume on it, b ut you never turn it off. So even if you can't hear your baby, you'll see the lights on the monitor light up. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Again- Night Sensor Dies within a month or two!","review":"Like many others who have written, we had received the previous model (with the TV- a feature I liked) but after the infrared sensors died we returned it to Safety First, who replaced it with this newer model. While the reception & quality is still fine during the day, the night vision died again after only 2 months and now I cannot see my daughter in the dark. Whoever was told by customer service that the infrared sensors are \\"not supposed to be lit up\\" was told a crock of lies! As soon as those go out, you will notice that you can no longer see in the dark. This appears to be a chronic problem with this product, so don't waste your money. I saw that GE makes a similar video monitor, maybe that is better since they are a trusted name in electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"This video monitor did not work for us. The picture on the TV only came in when we were in the baby's room. What's the point in that? When we moved it to another room we could not get a picture. We were disappointed.

The video monitor had *severe* vertical hold issues and would not stop rolling. Very entertaining for the cats, not so much for us, especially at night. Both the audio and video had terrible interference issues. Maybe it was our Wi-Fi, maybe it was sunspots. Either way both would hiss at random intervals, completely obscuring the signal, even if the receiver was right next to the optical device. Last night, it just stopped working. Nothing but hiss, no matter what channel it was on. If the video monitor wasn't a tube-TV I'd take a hammer to it.

In June 2005 replaced monitor which was under warranty for a year, they had me send the old and sent me a new one, around 6 months later with the new one started getting lighter on the screen to see at night, in March 2006 monitor started making zapping noises waking me up in the middle of the night all night long AND monitor has picture of two cribs tried to adjust and wont change.

We picked up the Safety 1st system, having been happy with some of their other products, and have been very pleased with the product. The picture quality is very good, even at night, and the audio picks up everything in the room and in the vicinity of the room. This product was well worth the money spent.

Even though the phones and different household items would sometimes make it go crazy, it was still so handy to have - until I used it for about 2 months! One night as I was getting ready for bed I noticed that there was no picture on the monitor! The thing just wouldn't work! We could get sound but couldn't see a thing in his room at night when it was dark! I tried it the next morning and it worked fine. I left it on all day this time, but when it got dark out the monitor wouldn't pick up any picture again! This is totally useless to me if I can't see him at night when I would need it the most!

I finally got around to calling the company 13 months after the unit was purchased...mind you I got it at a baby shower... they offered to send me a replacement camera for $99...now why would I purchase a replacement for $100, when I can get a whole new unit for $150??? So, we no longer have night vision. Instead I put it in my home office for watching my child while I work. I guess if it didnt break in such a short time, I would reccomend...but for $150, it definelty should have lasted longer than a year.. in my opinion.

We traveled to Maine to a house party for my brother-in-law's birthday. There were alot of people there that we did not know. I would not of been able to relax after she went to a different floor to sleep without my TV next to me verifying that she was safe and sound. I read the other reviews, it is true that the cordless phone makes you loose the picture. I found that that only happens if the phone is in the same room as the TV, and you still have sound. That is why I voted 4 stars instead of 5. That is the ONLY FLAW. Nightime vision is excellent. Picture is perfect! If this monitor broke today, I would feel that I got my money's worth and would run out to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great but adequate","review":"There must be something better. Like everyone else (this should be a clue for new purchases!), this is a factory replacement (900M) for the original monitor (2.4G) we purchased where the camera failed (infrared again). The replacement picture is nominal at best in infrared. The reception is awful at more than a few feet. Many other devices interfere. The portable sound monitor is a nice addition, but it eats AAA batteries (four at a time) with a passion. Purchase something else when it becomes available. Don't risk it... the one's who love it haven't had a failure yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for us","review":"There were alot of bad reviews for this monitor which made me nervous at first since I knew I had gotten this one on my gift registry... but it has always worked very well for us.

It is quite expensive, but we have been very satisfied with this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.4 GHz was much better","review":"We bought the 2.4GHz version of this monitor last November when my daughter was born and absolutely loved it. We had to send it back when the infrared night vision lights went out (customer service was great by the way) and they had changed to the 900Mhz version. The 900MHz monitor has terrible reception in our house. We get almost no picture two rooms away. I would say that it might be because we have 900Mhz phones, but we bought the Summer Infant 900Mhz monitor and get a great picture.

Now my 3rd montior has broken (the night vision feature again) and Safety 1st told me they no longer make this model, and it is no longer under warantee (short by 3 months) so I have to purchase a new one. When I told them that based on their track record I was considering another brand, they said \\"fine\\".

The picture is awful, \\"snow\\" all over. And it doesn't have a TV inside, which can be nice in future.

I read a review at the time on this website which recommended the radio shack monitor. It allows add on cameras to be in multiple rooms at once so that both children can be monitored. You can program it to be on one, or both. It stays 4 or 6 seconds (your choice) one one camera, and then switches to the other room.

The video actually works really well and aside for some NOISY interference that it picks up sometimes, its a great picture day or night. The camera is kind of a pain, though. The way that it is angled, you need to mount it on the wall above the crib, or have it sitting on a tall piece of funiture that can overlook the crib. I don't have that, so we only really use it for the sound. The monitor is very large, though, and so it would have been nice if the hand held auido one worked - so I could take it to another room.

Unfortunately, it has limited channels (only 2) and they just don't offer enough flexibility to deal with any other 900 MHz systems. Not only does it creates static on my cordless phone but when the phone is in use, the video signal goes completely out. So alas, back to the store this goes...If you only have 2.4 GHz systems in use at your house, this one will probably work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice look but terrible quality.","review":"We bought this and had trouble from the start with the reception and the night vision. The reception was never stable therefore difficult to watch. The night vision is just weak compared to the Summer model which we ended up getting. And finally the tube blew out after less than a year of sitting boxed up in a closet. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company does not back up this item","review":"I have owned this product for a year and half and now the video monitor went out on it. I took it to Babies r us and they said they have a 90 day return or exchange policy now without receipt or box and they said to contact Safety 1st. I called Safety 1st and they said it only has a one year warranty. I find this absolutely horrible for a company to only warranty this product for one year when obliviously so many others have had similar problems. I will not buy Safety 1st products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with the picture, sound is not so great.","review":"I bought a different brand of monitor and never could get the picture to work so I exchanged it for this one. The picture is pretty great I was impressed but I hear a roaring in the sound but it is not extremely bad or anything. Overall, I am happy with this monitor and glad that I can see my son now without having to go into his room and wake him up to check on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I had originally bought the Safety 1st 2.4GHz Child view monitor back in 2002 when my daughter was born. It was a VERY reliable product-- day OR night the picture was great. So when the wire frayed to the monitor, I did not hesitate to purchase another safety 1st video monitor. I bought the 900Mhz sight and sound assurance and IT IS AWFUL!!!!! The picture is wavy and fuzzy during the day and I do not get ANY picture at night!!!! And if my phone rings, I get NOTHING BUT SNOW!!!! I am VERY VERY disappointed and will be returning it to the store ASAP! I am not sure why this model is so inferior to the old one, but its clear that Safety 1st needs to rethink this one!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This has to be the worst purchase I have made since my son was born. I have to take this back as soon as I can. You cannot get the picture to come in. When it does it flickers, and when you adjust the tuner in the back it gets even worse. The only bright spot is the small audio monitor....but the reception that it gets is horrible. I would have rather had my cheap Fisher Price $14.00 monitor. This doesn't make me feel safe, it makes me feel robbed....by safety 1st."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't see at night!","review":"I had the 2.4 version before and the led lights went out on 3 different ones (within less than a year) The company was actually very nice to deal with and kept sending me new ones and having me send in the broken ones. I absolutely loved the 2.4 version because I could see my son perfectly at night, it was my favorite \\"baby\\" item. I was so disappointed when the first one broke. This last one that has broken was replaced by the new 900 version and I can't stand it. I can't see my son at all at night. During the day, the picture is very grainy but I can at least make out his outline. I am due with our second child in a few months and I'm not sure what I am going to do at this point as it doesn't work as a monitor that you actually would need (like for a newborn!) I was happy to see that I was not the only one with all the problems. I would love to find another one that works at night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"The monitor worked for about one month, then the infrared system stopped working. A few months later, the audio system stopped working. Of all the baby gear I have (and I have a lot), this is by far the worst item we own. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely worth the money!","review":"We bought this monitor based off the employees comments on it and the disapproving opinions of the other video monitors. This was the best purchase we made for our son. We can see and hear him perfectly clear all the time. The best part is you can turn off the monitor so you can just see him, just hear him, or hear and see him. The other adaptor works wonderful when roaming through the house or doing yard work when our son is sleeping. I would advise this product to anyone who is looking for the video monitors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with product","review":"My husband and I had two of these monitors. Both video screens stopped working after about 6 weeks. The picture was also often fuzzy and didn't work in certain areas of our house. The only thing that we did like was that it came with the extra monitor so we could be in two different areas in the house and both hear our daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so video, goof audio and no night vision","review":"The video monitor is like watching a tv from the 70's - it is black and white with alot of 'snow' noise and horizontal bars constantly. Also, the night vision does not appear to be working and after reading some of the other reviews here, it seems this is not a well built quality item and the night vision seems to have problems elsewhere.Good luck with your purchase! Hopefully it goes better for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"more money then it's worth","review":"Even thoough, I like seeing our newborn, it is not worth the money. We have nothing but problems, every night I put the monitor on and it is either fuzzy or the pictue keeps flipping over and over. I think the idea is great, however if they are going to charge so much for it, they need to come up with something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I thought that this was going to be a great device, but I was wrong. I ordered this item the beginning of November in 2004 and did not get it out of the box and use it until the following January and it started off being the greatest and coolest thing I had. Then after the second night of using the sound monitor it just quit producing any sound. I didn't really sweat it because you can hear sound through the t.v.. The nabout two months later of just using the t.v. at noght and no other time during the day the t.v. just quits working. I get just a blank bright screen. I did notice that when using my cell phone around the t.v. that it would make the screen jump and get blurry so I kept the phone away from the t.v. so that couldn't have played a role. I wish I had known that I was going to be throwing this much money away because I could have used it on something else for my first child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the 2.4 GHz better","review":"I gave this 1 star because we originally bought the 2.4 GHz model with the TV/Video Monitor. It was nice to have the extra TV. However, the LED night vision went out in the camera and we had to send the entire unit back to the manufacturer at our expense. They sent us this \\"new and improved\\" version which is only 900 MHz and does not have the TV monitor. They said they stopped making the TV version and they didn't have any of them left to send out as replacements. I am disappointed with the \\"new and improved\\" version because the picture quality is not as good and I miss having the TV. The level of service I received from the manufacturer was lacking as well (the service agent was not very nice nor was she helpful). I will not buy anything from the Safety 1st brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The monitor doesn't work","review":"I bouht this item last september, and I lived in Brazil.Well, the problem is.. 2 weeks after I am using the monitor, it stops to work, and I don't know what to do, because nobody here knows where can I find a place to replace that.Someone can help me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 15 months","review":"Our monitor officially stopped working 2 days ago. We will replace it with another brand, b/c we find it very reassuring to see the baby at night and check on him w/o opening the bedroom door. The monitor's plug is a huge and bulky square that gets hot when plugged in. The plug seems to be the reason the monitor is not working because when we adjust it and hold it into the outlet the picture appears for short bursts of time. However, once it is let go, the unit is out again. I was surprised it only worked for a little over a year. I would not recommend purchasing an expensive product like this only to have to replace it in a short period of time. Also, the heat from the plug seems dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned!","review":"I just got off of the phone with Safety 1st moments ago. I have this baby monitor and was pretty happy with it for the first year or so. The warranty is only good for one year and now I know why. We were very careful with this monitor and after 2 years, the picture is horrible. There is a huge bar running right across the image so you can't see anything at all. I called the company and they informed me that if it is past 1.5 years, I am out of luck. They even claimed that they no longer have the monitor part in stock. I am now completely unsatisfied with this product and with Safety 1st in general. They will not stand by their product when it becomes defective and it's as if the part was programmed to stop working when the warranty is up. Don't make the same mistake that I did, this is an expensive product and not worth the money if you can't hand it down or sell to someone else when you are done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Do not buy this product or any other Safety 1st monitor for that matter! I wish I would have looked at the reviews before buying this monitor. I've had it for over a year and the picture has never been good and just recently the sound has to be turned up all the way to get any sound out of it. When I contacted Safety 1st they offered to sell me the same monitor for [...] with no warranty! Are you kidding me! I wouldn't waste my money on another monitor that would only die on me again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"We loved this monitor for 7 months. At exactly 7 months of usage the screen went blank. I am very disappointed because we have another Safety 1st video monitor that was purchased in 2000 and it is still working well (it does experience a lot of interference with the cordless phone and the microwave, however). After reading reviews on Amazon and several other web sites it is apparent that this is not an isolated issue. There is a manufacturing or design problem with this model. Please do not spend your money on this model until Safey 1st resolves this issue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got lucky with our monitor","review":"I was shocked how bad some of the reviews were on this product. I was ordering one for someone's shower gift when I saw them. I have had this monitor for 2 1/2 yrs and have used it everyday during this time. It is still working. The sound is starting to flick in and out on the video monitor. We have occassional problems with resception but nothing a little maneuvering cannot fix. Our daughter's room is now upstairs and across the house (4300 sq feet house) and we get great reception. I use this monitor now even more than when she was a baby b/c she is in a twin bed and I need to see what she is up to, ie staying in bed and lying down. I also loved it when she was in the crib so once she was in bed I would never go back in to check on her until I knew she was asleep. It is harder to see at night but you can see movement just fine. I am thankful we have it and that mine has lasted so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing failure","review":"I am a new dad, went on a shopping trip and went crazy. Bought this item and could not wait for my son to be born to test it out. What did I find :-poor distance ability with video monitoring - monitor cannot be more than 50 feet.screen flickers in the night - wife will no longer use itpoor night camera - has to be aproximatley 2 feet from baby.strange sound come through the monitor that 'other' monitors dont pick up.I am constantley repositioning the camera and monitor and only gotten minor improvments. Not enough to recommend this to any caring parent.VERY DISAPONTED - KEEP LOOKING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked a little over a year","review":"I used this monitor and thought it worked great. Then a little over a hear the screen died out on me. I could only get sound. For this price it should last longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible piece of equipment","review":"We rec'd this as a replacement for the previous monitor made by this company. The previous one had great video quality, but the sound did not work properly. Unluckily, I complained and went through 2 months of waiting for a replacement. The first one we rec'd did not work at all. We returned it & waited again. This camera's video quality is so poor that when there is ANY reception at all, I can barely tell whether I am looking at my son's head or feet. Do not buy this poor quality equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after the 2nd one died","review":"We really enjoyed this product while it was working. On the first one we bought, the sound on the monitor unit quit working after the 2nd day. So we exchanged it for a second unit, which worked fine for a few days. Then the monitor unit wouldn't turn on. So we are taking it back to exchange for a different brand. I can't believe how poorly this product is made taken into account how basic the technology used in this product, especially considering the price. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much good","review":"Used this for a week monitoring my son in the adjoining room.Reception was OK - but the quality of picture was extremely bad. During the day the picture quality was like watching a 1960's TV - which is OK - it's only a $[...] piece of electronics. But in a dark room at night, the picture provided is so poor that you can't see anything. While the camera claims to have night vision, it doesn't provide anything that comes close.So if you need something that works at night (which is sort of the whole purpose of a monitor) then this product won't do the trick. I returned this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"only lasts months","review":"I bought and loved this monitor--at first. Then the picture started to get worse and worse until it was unusable at 13 months (just 1 month past the 12 month warranty!). So I bought another, and the same thing happened, but this one only lasted 9 months! For $150 dollars, you'd think they could make them to last more than a few months. Save the headache and your money, and buy a reliable unit instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I have had this monitor for almost 3 years. When I first got it, it burnt out within a few months. Safty 1st easy replaced it for me at no charge. I have been using this one for a while and love it. The only downside id the audio monitor doesnt work well. We have it in our room less than 60 feet away and we get as lot of backfeed and clicking. I actually have a fisher Price audio one for my room and this one for the down stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night Vision broke at 6 months!!!","review":"I loved this monitor, very happy with it until suddenly I oculdn't see my son at night anymore. I didn't know what was wrong, I thought there was a bad reception for some reason because we were on a trip, but as it turns out the night vision is broken. I called Safety 1st and they are giving me a replacement camera free of charge, but it is back ordered for three to six weeks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD PRODUCT..FOR A LITTLE WHILE","review":"I bought this monitor in march and I loved it. The picture was a little fuzzy sometimes but nothing unbearable. All of a sudden, the picture won't work at all. If it is light outside or the bedroom light is on then I can see my daughter if not it is just black. The additional sound only monitor eats batteries like crazy and now doesn't even work at all. For the amount of money I paid for this product, it certainly didn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Use This at Night","review":"Called Safety 1st when we realized that the \\"night vision LEDs\\" weren't lighting up and therefore you can't see a thing at night on the video. They said the camera has to be within 6 ft and there has to be enough light around it & the baby. And even more astonishing thing is the fact that those LEDs \\"are not supposed to actually light up\\". There is something wrong with this picture..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reception","review":"I returned the Summer Video monitor and bought this one. I have a 1500 square foot home and the video monitor would not work because it was out of range. It was terrible. My house it not that big and I was shocked to find out that the video screen has to be close to the base. I would not recommend this monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like all things, it takes some practice","review":"This monitor is a bit difficult to use at nite, however, like most things, this simply takes a little getting used to. Once you learn how to \\"see\\" your baby at nite, it is quite reliable. Yes, it is much easier to see with a nite light, but it is also possible to see without it. Reason for 4 stars and not 5 is due to static when I sometimes walk past the video receiver. Otherwise, have had this product for 6 months and can say that it is very reliable. I use the the audio receiver downstair and the receptions is great. Would recommend this product if you are patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I received this as a gift from my parents. It was great for about a month and then the picture no longer worked. So now we just use it to listen but sometimes the reception is so bad that it is useless.

Buy a Different Monitor!","review":"I own the older version of this product for 2-1/2 years and now the video camera went out on it. I called Safety 1st and they said it only has a one year warranty. They no longer make this model and there was nothing they could do for me to fix the problem. (How about having back up stock for a little while!) I find this absolutely horrible for a company to only warranty this type product for one year when obliviously so many others have had similar problems. I will not buy another Safety 1st product. I told customer service if I could help it they will not make another dime off of my family or friends who have children. This could very well happen to you in a year or two!!!!!!BEWARE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!! Don't buy!!","review":"I have had this monitor for 10 months and have to return it twice!

With having 3 other children and a newborn, we wanted to thank the creator of such a product...until we got it home and actually TRIED to use it. Our bedroom is 2 doors down and we get an awful reception. The screen jumps up and down and 99% of the time, we see more snow on the screen then we do baby. You practially have to stand right infront of the monitor and hold the antenna in order to see the baby for a qucik second. The handheld monitor makes AWFUL noses. You cannot set it anywhere on the counter or even on your belt to go check the mail. Both monitors seems to get interferance from cordless phones, microwaves, computers and even the radio!!!! THIS IS AWFUL and definitely not worth the $150.00.

I was given this monitor at my shower in June 2003. By January 2004, the video had stopped working. However, Safety 1st did replace it. I happened to save the box but we needed to send it to them first before they sent the replacement. Then, sometime in November/Deceber 2004, the video monitor went again. Again, Safety 1st replaced it because it was within the one year warranty. However, since early December 2005, our video monitor is slowly going and it is only a matter of time before it stops working. I now have a 5 month old and my husband and I are looking for another model since, Safety 1st will now not replace it. I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment!!!!","review":"This was a great monitor until it stopped working after only 3 months of use!

We have the model that has the 2.4 ghz and have had no problems with it to date. The picture is clear and you can see your child even in the dark. We purchased the 900 Mhz model since it replaced the 2.4 ghz when we had our daughters. This model is the biggest piece of junk! Unfortunately, I threw away the box so I can't take it back and get a refund. The only way I can get a clear picture is if I have the monitor in the same room with the little receiver (what good is that). Most of the time the signal is so distorted that I can't even listen to sound without the video!Since most models are 900 mhz, I purchased a handheld color 2.4 ghz. video monitor which can also plug into your television for $150.00 on Ebay and it works great and it is portable to replace the piece of crap that I have.I just wish I had read some of these reviews before I purchased mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it last","review":"We have had this monitor since my daughter was born.

My sister-in-law has the same one, and is having the same problems. (Her son is only 14 months old)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better options available","review":"I will be returning this product. The Day and Night monitor by Summer Infant works much better. Although the Safety 1st monitor has 900 Mhz technology, we experienced interference from our 2.4 Mhz phone. The interference caused the screen to blink, fuzz up and roll. We had the screen in the kitchen and were also unable to watch the baby on the screen when we ran the microwave and/or washing machine due to interference. Worst of all, the baby's papasan swing at the detector camera also caused similar interference. The camera does not move up and down for viewing the baby as does the one by Summer Infant. If you are concerned about SIDS, you can't see slight breathing motions on the screen anyway. If that is why you are buying this item, don't. We bought the Angelcare motion detector/sensor for that, and it works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception on the monitor.","review":"It is almost impossible to see our baby with this monitor. A friend described it best when she said she felt she was looking at an ultrasound image. It is hard to tell where the baby is and we have to play with the antenna a lot to get some reception. However, the sound quality is good and there is no interference. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I gave it 2 stars because this video monitor worked wonderfully for us - when it worked. I have had 5 of these monitors and the longest any of them has lasted is one year. The sound has always stopped working for one reason or another on the monitor. The reason I have had so many is simple: the first time it broke, it was our fault. So we had the extra camera so we figured why not buy another one and we can have 2 camera's that way we can switch which side of the crib we wanted to view based on where the baby had moved to. But then the next 4 monitors broke so I just kept returning them. Once I did try another brand, but that one didn't even work AT ALL once I brought it home, so I had to treck back up to Babies R Us to return it. My suggestion is to try another one out there that's on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good functionality but poor quality","review":"We purchased this monitor and enjoyed it's features until the camera stopped working.

Good features, poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I received this monitor as a gift from my baby registry. I was very excited to use it for the first time...that's about the only time it worked. The tv screen monitor completely died after just 3 days of use. The small sound monitor continued to work. I notified the company and they sent me a brand new system at no charge. That new monitor worked for one night, then the picture quit working but the sound still works on the tv monitor. We notifed the company and they said they would send a new tv monitor which we have yet to receive. Also, this monitor picks up A LOT of static interference so you can't turn up the volume very loud most of the time. I think this monitor is a huge waste of money and I am currently shopping for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Video is of poor quality, I could have easily made the video myself at home. My 16 month old son was Not Interested in it at all because its to plain. The entire video is just the letters and kids playing at a playground (this part has background music only). There is no connection between the kids in the playground and the alphabet. It was just plain BORING, save your money for other videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Educational Video- HIGHLY recommend","review":"My 4 year old son has this video and watches it to re-inforce the Spanish he is learning in school. He is learning the Spanish alphabet in pre-school and watches this video once or twice a week, repeating the letters as they show on the screen. He also learned new vocabulary words from watching the video. I like the video because it is educational- it doesn't have any \\"characters\\" in it- just the alphabet and vocabulary words with pictures for each word (there are kids shown throughout the video also). Sometimes he watches only the alphabet part of the video to practice the letters, other times he watches the whole video to say the words he learned (while learning new words!). I definitely recommend this video as an educational tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Boring because it is too simple. This is a 20-25 minute video where it shows a child or children playing in the park n between the ABC pronounciation and at the end of the video would show ABC examples. As I speak in Spanish to my 34-month old, I think it would be more appealing to make bright ABC cards and pronounce each letter of the ABC myself to my son and showing the respective pictures of objects that match the ABC letters.I bought BILINGUAL BABY, SPANISH, VOL. 2 a year and a half ago and this 45-minute educational video is much, much better, but doesn't teach the ABC, it teaches colors, numbers and basic vocabulary.Thumbs down to ABC's in Spanish for Infants and Toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could do as well with m y camcorder","review":"The quality of this video is definitely not at the same level as many other children's videos. The video is quite repetitive and not very creative at all. The first part of the video is simply a recitation of the alphabet with computer generated graphics. This is repeated once and then there is a section of the video where words are mentioned that go with each letter. I don't find the images to be particularly eye catching. I speak Spanish and English fluently and am always looking for tools to help me teach my daughter Spanish. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Bilingual Baby video. It is simple, but very well done and my 19 m.o. daughter asks to see it frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"My children were bored watching it","review":"Compared to all the other options on the market to teach your children Spanish, this is one of the weakest.

My aunt bought me this book for Christmas, and I put it down only once over the course of two days. Masters of Deception brought to me, a teenager in the computer age, a wonderfully vivid description of what it was like to be a pioneer in the world of the Internet. With 100,000,000 people on the net or however many there are now, companies have become so security aware that adventures like the ones in the book require an amazing amount of expertise. Not to mention how much damage we can do now that the computing sector makes so much money. But the point is that through this book we're able to relive the experience, with all of the wonder and naive excitement that comes with exploring new territory, and we don't have to damage anything.

Not only could I put it down, but I had to psych myself up to open it. It was a painfully boring read and glorifying of criminals. There were very bright individuals, but criminals nonetheless. This book did NOT convey that message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but terribly juvenile","review":"Not a bad book on the whole. The story is interesting enough, but the author seems to take juvenile spats and revenge way too seriously. A litany of 14 year teenagers conversations (Woah, no way, serious?, cool, etc, etc) is really not that exciting. A real light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the hacker-related titles...","review":"Where do I begin?This is the most boring of all the hacker-related titles; it took me 6 months to get through it. The real substance of this book could have been written in just 3 pages. The rest is just filler and fictionalized details. There are also a few technical inaccuracies, but with so little in the way of technical information, they really don't get in the way of the author's \\"story\\".If you're looking for fiction, why not just pick up a sci-fi novel, it'll be much less expensive and more entertaining. If you're looking for an interesting \\"hacker\\" read, pick up just about anything but this rag."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK.....","review":"i tried 2 read this book for a school assignment and it was so hard to understand! There's so many things you have to remember and each person was going by different names i got confused! I think only those who have time to go back and read the pages before and really wanna get through the book should be able to read this book. Sorry to all those who enjoyed it, maybe i'm not too old enough to understand this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that isn't what might be expected.","review":"This is a very insightful and entertaining book. It hasbeen compared to The Cuckoo's Egg (Clifford Stoll) basedon it's content. Masters of Deception is a very technicaloriented book that focuses on the background of the hackeras an idividual. This book isn't written, nor (in myopinion) meant to be written as a spy novel with thesame intrigue as The Cuckoo's Egg (Clifford Stoll). Ifyou want intrigue and \\"edge of your seat\\" reading, thismay not be the book. If you want intelligent writing from acompetent and well-versed writing team, it would be hardto do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pouring with emotion and dark atmosphere","review":"This is one of the few CD's that gives me chills every time I play it. The intense emotion and vivid atmosphere displayed through voices, atmospheric sounds, and keyboards can take your mind places you've never seen. I started out listening to only rock & metal; but after this CD, everything changed. If you enjoy dark music at all, then buy this CD and lay down with a pair of headphones when you get it. You'll see what I mean.Also recommended: Arvo Pärt - \\"Te Deum\\" for its similar effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painting with music","review":"I first heard Raison D'Etre when I got the Extol - Mesmerized EP and RDE did a remix that totally blew me away. I was hooked forever. He doesnt simply write music, he literally creates pictures and moods. Its simple but genius. If you like ambient, industrial, classical, or anything thoughtful and darkly beautiful; then you need this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, kinda spooky ... very satisfying","review":"raison d'etre is Sweden's Peter Andersson, who composes beautifully dark music for this release. Wind, bubbling sounds, sudden noises, chimes, chanting, choruses, strings, and occasionally rhythms create an ambience that is terribly dark but beautiful at the same time.The low rumblings will shake your room, and the sudden jarring bangs and clangs might make you jump in your seat. There's an ominent spookiness throughout, but not threatening. The 6 tracks flow almost seamlessly from one to the next, but are different enough to keep the listener's interest. It's probably not my favorite RD release, but still makes a great listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this new Masterpiece Mystery series!","review":"Hello, Rufus! This entertaining, beautifully set, sexy series is off to an excellent start. Wonderful to see Rufus Sewell playing the elegant, understated detective, Aurelio Zen. He's perfect for the part, even if he's more Brit than Venetian--I, for one, am glad he isn't faking an Italian accent. Terrific chemistry with Tania Moretti. I look forward to Zen's future cases, more Roman sites, and a continued deepening of the recurring characters in the cast. I hope Masterpiece has quite a few installments in mind.Update: Have looked deeper into the series and learned that only three episodes were filmed before the series was shelved. Definitely our loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin Plots, Cliched Love, Indifferent Cops","review":"I have not read any of the novels on which this series is based. I do know, however, that reducing a lenghty novel to 85 minutes means the plot will be slighted, if not completely emasculated or ignored. The show has virtually non-existent plots and lots of love looks between Zen and a fellow cop, who is shallow and poorly acted. The actor who plays Zen is charismatic and no doubt could have made a good detective in a show that was concerned with plot, even just a little bit concerned. I watched all three episodes simply to see Italy, hoping something along the lines of a plot would develop. No plot-- but there were action scenes and some smooching. This was a major disappointment. The 5 ratings are inexplicable and proof that a show can sink below mediocrity and still find an appreciative audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice shots of Rome but...","review":"...overall a rather pathetic attempt to describe real life events in Italy by somebody who obviously knows the country only in a very superficial manner. There are also several holes in the plots, unexplained events, downright silly dialogues and totally ludicrous situations.Too bad because the acting is decent, the show seems well produced and Rome is as gorgeous as ever. If you want to watch a nicely done mystery series set in Italy get a DVD of Commissario Montalbano by Camilleri. This is something to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fergi","review":"I really enjoyed all the Italian settings, the characters and the wonderful stories. Great Fun! If you love mystery stories, you will love ZEN. I would love to see more of these stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Trilogy","review":"This is the first of the trilogy, and I think the best. It has just the right amount of action and intrigue. Rufus Sewell's character, Detective Aurelio Zen, is very likeable. I truly enjoyed this series, and I hope another one begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best shows in years","review":"This series has great characters, settings, plots, beauty, humor, sensuality... I hope they make a lot more than these three episodes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Policing","review":"Whomever researched for the writing and/or scripting of this series doesn't know anything about police administration or detective work e.g. the tte-à-tte in the police offices and elsewhere were ridiculously unbelievable if not sophomoric. The detective's failure to intelligently think through or anticipate problems including threats were just plain dumb. Even if he is intended to succeed through dumb luck it's still dumb. The acting is wooden (except Sewell has those mannerisms that in a primal communicative way can carry a scene but still a step down from his exceptional Dark City role). Anyway, the dialogue is also sophomoric. The show exists because of the actor's appearances and the usual tiresome romantic triangles. Nothing in the plot structure indicates to me any creative storytelling - it's all too predictable. On the positive side the English and background Italian set backgrounds were well conceived.It all reminds me of a cheap paperback romance-suspense novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closed Caption","review":"We enjoyed Zen; it is a little different from other British series. We did think that Italian actors should have been used instead of the British ones to make the Italian detective more believeable. Closed Caption wasn't shown in the description but Zen did have it.

This is very loungy(that's not a problem, i love lounge music), and way too sticky and heavy on the strings. There are no tempo changes just from slow to slower and dull to duller.

I am looking forward to reading more of your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"What I liked about the book was the pace and the availability of the characters. Meaning there were no long pauses to set a scene or over description of the characters. I found that I was very captivated with the the characters. You just enough information on each one to judge for yourself their personalities. Tori Maxwell(main character) was engaging and you understood her dilimma and the outcome of her decisions. I found the book very delightful despite a few words that were misused but this was very minor. Also the title did not grab me but that goes to say read the synopsis before you make your decisions. I strongly reccomend as a must read and an addition to your liteary library. Bravo to the author Brey."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Awesome","review":"Wow this newest cd from RACE THE SUN is so awesome.

They're just too damn streched. Now don't get me wrong, I prefer higher pitched vocals to the all too common 'mono vox' we get in rock these days, but there's a limit to what I can take. This guy sounds like his voice box is going to explode from being streched so far. I mean, there's cute vocals, and then there's annoying vocals. Race the sun falls under annoying in the vocal catagory. Still though, the music itself is top notch if you like pop-punk. 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Town Review","review":"I may be predjudiced as the author is from my home town.

Today it can no longer be called a small town due to progress but for us oldsters we recall it well.Mr Holbrook purveys the war from a young man's view without using a lot of graphic language,profanity as the authors of today are prone to do.

Dude thinks his wife is boinking the neighbourhood so he starts dispatching folks in a series of goofy methods. The video label claims the gore effects will \\"blow your mind\\". Well, they blow alright. The acting ranges from god-awful to inhuman and the irritating Radio Shack keyboard soundtrack doesn't lessen the pain. Not even worth renting, let alone purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a JOKE!","review":"Yeah, if you're a film student, you could see this movie for tips. But to see this movie for pleasure, DO NOT BUY IT! It was a total waste of money for me. The acting was horrible, I laughed through the whole movie. I wanted to fall asleep. People seem to like this movie for its \\"gore humor\\", but I think the director tried too hard with that. Maybe the movie was suppose to look like crap, and that's what makes it good. That factor didn't appeal at all to me. The movie has that horrible 80's horror movie feel, and that killed it at the very beginning. The tall skinny blonde, the main character, should have rehearsed being sadistic a little longer. I think I liked two of his killings, I must admit. Not bloody and gory enough, but it was good enough.

Unfortunately, there are very few close ups clearly showing the wrist action and hand placements. The instruction would have been much more effective with close ups and slow motion.I was disappointed with the focus of the dvd being more on Leon Jay's emphasis on the pressure points striking without providing any real instruction on that topic. I did not see the connection between the title of the dvd and what the emphasis of the instruction that is actually on the dvd is. The title could have just as easily been Leon Jay shows off his knowledge of pressure points and knocks a few people out.However, the real value and a special treat on this dvd is a short biography of Professor Wally Jay.

I have them installed at a beach house in Mexico. The summer humidity does interfere with the signal to them once in awhile but it is about 93 degrees and 70% humidity.

I have read it many times and every time I find new things that I missed before. I own every single DL book except for the Villains novels. This is the true story of Huma. And as they relate to him in other stories, it is just like a old tale passed thru the years, becomes hazy and different.

The author obviously didn't have time to even leaf through the Chronicles to find references to Huma. There are a large number of holes in it, leaving out stuff that was sorely needed to make this book even an interesting read. Huma and Magius are both hugely disappointing characters. I found it almost laughable that the so-called 'greatest war wizard' couldn't even pass the Test. In my opinion, Richard A. Knaak's book didn't rate highly when compared with some much better Dragonlance books by Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman, Douglas Niles, Jeff Crook, Mary Kirchoff etc. etc. etc.I would not recommend not bothering with this book, and proceeding straight onto Kaz the Minotaur, which I didn't yawn ALL the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Letdown To the Knights of Solamnia","review":"When I first picked up this book, I was excited.

The bolt is very easy, however you do have to do more then just slide the bolt in the hitch. In order to secure the rack you have to tighten the bolt with a wrench. The reviews that comment on how loose it is did not tighten the bolt. Once you do that (follow the instructions) it is tight and secure.

The rubber parts disintegrated within a year. While I could not find replacements, I did measure the rack and found that Thule replacement parts would fit. The Thule parts have lasted well. The rack has been welded once where the welds failed. Most recently, the adapter block to allow use in a 2\\" receiver has worn to the point that the rack sags considerably. I again called Bell and was told that the replacement part is not available. All that can be said is that the rack is cheap to buy but if you plan on using the rack, you should buy a brand that supports any required spare parts. I don't expect that spare parts should be give as warranty replacement but they should be available for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping","review":"My husband and I purchased this mount hoping to make our lives easier when transporting the family's bikes. The first time we used it (mounted two adult bikes), we noticed swaying each time we hit a bump or turned a corner too sharply. Giving the item the benefit of the doubt, I attributed this to assembly error and not faulty manufacturing. So being the perfectionist, I disassembled the rack, combed through the assembly instructions one more time and reassembled the rack. Well this time I mounted two youth bikes and wow let the swaying begin. I think the cars on the road gave us at least three car lengths between us and them just in case we lost the bikes and the rack!

An excellent complement to TaiChi actual training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wothwhile tai Chi Book","review":"This is not a fancy tai chi book with lots of color pictures of the form, but it does have a lot of good information. The tai chi form used in the book is the Yang Short Form. Each step of the form is shown in a black and white pencil sketch with a good description of each move. Of value to me was the accompanying diagram that shows foot placement and relative weight that is placed on each foot as well as text that tells how to properly breath for each movement.The latter part of the book describes the importance and history of each move that gives good background to the form. The last section includes the series of all the form element line drawings in sequence to give you a better idea of the flow of the form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and slow...","review":"I bought this book after 1) giving up on others, 2) trying to watch DVDs, and 3) blurry hours on U-Tube.

My application was unique, having very little space between the ceiling and door (5\\"). Also the door spring sits over top of the door where you are supposed to mount the rail. I had to modify a bracket and mount the rail and motor very close to the ceiling. I should also mention that my door is fairly heavy 8X16 steel insulated.The only problem I had was the chain would \\"jump\\" over top of the piece that slides on the rail causing it to grind and bind up. This may have been due to my specific application, but it looks more like a design problem with the rubber piece on the slide.

Some questions are left unanswered such as:1)Does Mitt still love Maewen?2)Does Maewen even find Mitt again?3)Is Maewen one of the Undying too?4)Does Cennoreth help Maewen get back together with Mitt???I just wish that some of these things were answered, and maybe the book had a few more chapters -- or and epelogue would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort nails it","review":"If you read between the lines, you should be able to pick up the message that's central to this book: Jesus loved all the children, except for the redheaded ones.Ray outlines a bulletproof plan that skewers the false converts. False converts are my most-hated kind of converts. They're all like, \\"Yes, we believe in Jesus, but NO we're not in it for the right reasons.\\"I just can't figure these phonies out. No one cares if you have expensive clothes in church and that you may be doing some strange things behind closed doors that Jesus would frown upon. It's about the FAITH, people. When are you gonna get that through that thick skull of yours?So make sure you do whatever Ray says, because he knows more about life than you because he is from a place called Australia, which is known for kangaroos and koalas and bengal tigers.

The built in (annoying) feature that freezes the keypad for 30 seconds if you hit the wrong number is the same feature that makes it impossible to recover when a number starts to go bad.

They debunk other theories and proceed through well footnoted historical examples that provide support and illumination. At times I found the book depressing; the stark and compelling truths and historical recounts were rough on my emotions. However, at those times I skipped ahead and read (and reread) the last section that has suggestions to counter and reverse antisemitism. The authors convey the gravity of the matter and conclude with uplifting and inspirational messages. I think this is \\"must\\" reading for thoughtful ideologues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative!","review":"This is an excellent book, which presents, for the most part, the Jewish dilemma. The authors, Scholar Dennis Prager and Rabbi Joseph Telushkin, stress that Jewish philanthropy is very important, and they claim that Jews give more than any other people.The authors also stress that \\"although Jews represent less than 3 percent of the population, they are overrepresented in medicine by 231 percent, in psychiatry by 478 percent, in dentistry by 299 percent, in law by 265 percent, and in mathematics by 238 percent.\\"The authors also make it a point to stress that the above achievements are \\"NOT, as is sometimes alleged, to some innately superior intelligence among Jews, but solely and directly to Judaism.\\" Jewish law, according to Prager and Telushkin, MANDATES that Jews give PRIORITY to enabling one another to establish themselves in the business world as proprietors and as professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ducking the Issues","review":"I disagree with these Jewish authors' stated reasons for antisemitism. The five principal reasons I believe are 1) greed and overreach based on Judaism and Jewish culture, e.g., provisions of the Talmud make non-Jews inhuman and authorize theft and robbery of Gentiles. 2) The offensiveness (to others) of the idea that Jews view themselves as the chosen people of God, with all the rights and entitlements that would imply. 3) Jealousy and envy of Jews' superior intelligence, capabilities and also their wealth. 4)The notion that Jews caused Jesus to be killed, as far as Christians are concerned. 5)And Jews efforts to dominate the thinking and actions of others in many contexts where their interests are also involved. The matter is not difficult or complicated. The authors too much dance around the issues and the history of the Jews. The matter of antisemitism is relatively simple, in my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This book bugged me.

I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the \\"awful\\" German language was hilarious. In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing. The scene \\"riding\\" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face. It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or \\"typical\\" American's attitudes today.I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to anyone visiting or living in Europe.

Very poor quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I enjoyed this first novel so much I've ordered her second one, \\"Flash Over\\". The heroine is a fire marshal new on the job, so we are dealing with sexism as well as a villian doing terrible things with fire. This is a thriller in the true sense of the word; from the first page to the last, you keep wanting to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we read the same book?","review":"Harrowing, great fiction, page-turner...Looking over these reviews, I must have read a different book. The characterization was sloppy, to say the least. The guy who said \\"youse\\" so you knew he was a louse (and he said it every stinking time he opened his mouth), cardboard characters aplenty, characters who changed their perceptions of each other just long enough to have sex, firefighting facts dropped with the subtlty of lead balloons...This was the first book I'd read by Suzanne Chazin. Even though I bought the second book at the same time and actually have it in my possession, I can't bring myself to read it. I paid $2 for both books and I feel like I got ripped off.I suggest Earl Emerson's novels for truly well-written firefighter novels. Emerson is a firefighter and, unlike Chazin, manages to create a believeable and taut thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to Start and Ends with a BANG!","review":"As a career and volunteer firefighter I thought I wouldn't like fiction, but this particular author changed my mind. She adds enough realism that her writings can be considered 'real to life'. If you like HAZMAT stuff, you'll like this book. If you like looking at the 'life' of the firefighter, particularly the woman firefighter, this book is for you. If you are a fire or arson investigator, this book reveals a real pattern of fire investigation. I agree that the second half of this book was difficult to put down - finished it in a long weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great personal account of 1960's San Francisco scene","review":"Darby Slick, guitarist for the Great Society and brother-in-law of Grace Slick, has written an autobiographical account of the rise of the San Francisco Sound. Don't You Want Somebody to Love is a distinctly personal perspective on those times -- part self-deprecating, part self-aggrandizing, it's a priceless account, written in an authentic voice by an actual participant.Much of the text concerns Darby's views on the development of the 1960's scene in San Francisco, and on the rise of the counter-culture in the USA in general, about which he often provides thoughtful commentary. There's also plenty of stuff on the music of the Great Society -- how they rehearsed, how and when songs were written, and who played what, on which song.There's also a great Stanley Mouse cover, a bunch of reproductions of Great Society concert posters, and a decent, if somewhat random, selection of black and white photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"My only complaint is that I thought the stick would be longer.

I am a huge fan of abc-era Impressions records, but I have to say, I had only heard three of the tracks from these two albums prior to having purchased this. There are a couple of tracks here that have been haunting me like the devil for the last few days, and I think everyone should hear them...they are \\"Isle of the Sirens\\" which recaptures some of that eerie storytelling Mr. Mayfield had abandoned after that first album...it has a ghostly production and lyrics that put me in mind of all those great prewar roots recordings. Simply amazing. \\"Let Me Tell the World\\" is a great ballad worthy of any Impressions best-of collection...I cannot believe I haven't heard it til now.

I gave it two stars instead of one because I know that Ms. Myers is capable of much better than this. This book is poorly written and poorly edited. There are glaring mistakes in it, and the plot is so loose that you could drive a truck through it. The last few chapters are truly terrible, and rather than feeling anything for the main characters, I just wanted to finish the book. I will read one more in this series and if it's as bad as this I will not continue. I did enjoy the first in her Den of Antiquity series, and will continue with that one unless the same thing happens with that one that has happened here.

Ms. Myers started out with a nice idea and produced an acceptable first book. But the rest have been trash. They are badly written, poorly edited and they are just plain silliness (and not in a cute/funny way)! There are far to many inconsequential characters clogging up the storylines, the most extreme overuse of a word that I have ever seen (wailing), and too many references to being one's own relative.

It is up to you to notice the difference between the instructions for your new and your old controller. The only info on the company web site is a pdf of the CLT1 instructions, indicating support for Multi-code. I guess they can't manage the five minutes of labor it would take to post the updated pdf.

The story goes way out there, as not a single police officer/agent is doing their job correctly, as well as not a single person acting with any rationale at all. In fact, can anyone make any sense of any one's motives when all is said and done?I felt let down more so than some others may be, being a huge Denzel Washington fan as well as a suspense thriller enthusiast.Oh and be prepared to nod off to sleep every so often, this movie is soooooo predicatable most of the time and the dialogue so cliched, you can probably miss half of it and still recite it line by line.I can't recommend this to anyone, not even people I dislike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie was just alright with me.

She is very pretty and plays Denzel's wife that he is on the outs with. I really don't want to go into the plot. There is a little bit of steaminess at the beginning and flattens out, there is mystery but not to much. I love that he lived on a boat that looked like a house and every morning he just went to the dock cafe to eat his breakfast. The town was very small and everybody seemed to know everybody.

Despite the film's morally clouded ending, director Carl Franklin navigates the plot turns and twists with workmanlike efficiency, resulting in an engaging neo-noir tale of lust, greed and deception.In my opinion, this film is a marvel, the plot twists every scene, and it leaves you on the edge of your seat every second.

Instead my husband and I found ourselves repeatedly saying \\"how could he go and do that, that was so stupid\\". To be honest, seeing that he had been fooled was immediate and obvious. Rather than sharing the truth with his friend and his wife, he goes and does one stupid/criminal/incriminating thing after another. The fact that Denzel Washington gets out of this situation in tact is solely because of either a) luck or b) a friend covering up for him. eg..Good grief, how many police officers don't know their chief's cell phone number in a small town. When the old woman pointed him out he was wearing the same outfit as he was when he was prowling around the night before. It gets a heck of a lot worse.

He appears to have been framed for the murder of a local woman, which is complicated by the fact that he was having an extramarital affair with her. I lost almost all interest in the story because I couldn't help but think that all of his problems would be solved if he weren't lying to his wife, running around with another woman, and trying to cover it all up. I wanted the moral fiber and character of Denzel in John Q or Remember the Titans. Even Denzel's \\"evil character\\" in Training Day was more believable. I saw this movie matinee, and I'm glad I didn't pay more to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Denzel is the backbone of this movie.

It was incredibly predictable, each part! BUT, it was nice to see how it played out. I mean seriously Denzel is a great actor, and Sanaa as a bad girl! That was great to watch! I mean seriously he was torn, then Sanaa was torn, and then Eva was torn! Tell me love isn't durable? And what about his friend? That's a friend for life \\"cause he was by his side for it all!Forget all those reviews blowing it like predictable, and it didn't live up to it's hype!

You probably can't think of any. That's OK because Five O'Clock Shadow has it all. Each of the singers is extremely talented and the vocal percussion and bass are amazing. I can't tell you have many people say, \\"This is not a capella because I hear drums.\\" The album is great but I think the band needs to work on making their original songs a little stronger. The covers of \\"If You Could Only See\\" and \\"Get Down Tonight/That's The Way I Like It\\" are incredible and they really deserve credit for changing those songs around to fit the style of the band. They also put on a great live show. If you want to hear some truly unique music (even if you normally don't enjoy a capella), buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good primer","review":"My mom had this when I was little and I used to listen to it all the time.

I'm not being moralistic. The movie just doesn't work. There is never one mention of the fundamental stalker rule: RESTRAINING ORDER! Nothing here makes for enjoyable filmmaking.

The biggest problem is Mike White's character, an infantile gay stalker obsessed with the childhood friend who has moved on in the world. The premise is workable, but White's own script never develops him beyond a single defining note, which makes for an increasingly unbelievable lead easily outshone by the supporting players - not so much Chris Weitz as the object of his obsession but definitely by Paul Weitz as a spectacularly bad lookalike actor Chuck casts in a frightening autobiographical play and Lupe Ontiveros as the show's down to earth director. It does pick up as it goes along and it's not unwatchable, it's just one of those films that really offers too few reasons to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"Every director has one movie that they want to make, but shouldn't. For Miguel Arteta, that movie was the extremely unfortunate Chuck & Buck. Never mind that the transfer from the harsh original digital video presentation is of usual substandard Artisan quality- the reason for Chuck's character's psychoses is never examined....the characters are therefore left as standard stereotypes that are as deep as a mud puddle. Plotwise, it meanders and never comes to any kind of rational conclusion. The acting is tedious & drab, which is exceptionally depressing given Mike White's talent.The most appalling aspect of this movie? The overall lesson learned is that if you stalk a person long and hard enough, regardless of how often they tell you to leave them alone, you will finally win them over. Oh, well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still waiting to start laughing","review":"I'm glad I didn't have to pay money to rent this movie! I don't see how this movie was \\"entertaining\\" in the sense. I pitied Chuck's fiancee and how she was portrayed as \\"evil\\" by Buck because she was getting married to Chuck. The whole \\"women are evil, don't marry/date them because they'll break us apart\\" thing is beginning to get quite old and played out.I don't find the humor in making fun of sheltered people with psychological problems. Mental illness is nothing to make fun of. I also don't see the humor in making fun of suppressed homosexual feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most painful experience of my life","review":"Watching Chuck and Buck was, without a doubt, the most painful experience of my life. Walking on a broken leg in the forrests of southeast Asia for two weeks was certainly more enjoyable than this movie! Everyone involved in the making of this movie, from the writers, to the directors, and even actors, should feel a great sense of shame for unleashing this monsterous creation onto an unsuspecting public. I am surprised no one has notified the Hague in order to put the creators of this movie on trial for human rights violations. Whatever you do, do not see this movie, if you see it at the rental store, walk out immediately! If a friend invites you over to watch it, crawl into bed, assume the fetal position, and wait for further developments.

Russell is always a spectacularly readable and clear writer, full of vivid, well chosen examples, and with very little abstract argument or technical jargon.

He later \\"escaped\\" to Mascot where he made three serials before landing the Western series at Warner's. And of course, the rest is history.

For a while. After running to the computer every few pages to check on recent developments in the searches for these crafts and finding out that either wreckage has been found, or that recordings of distress signals have been digitally enhanced and turned out to be far less ominous than reported, I got more and more disenchanted. That this book is frequently listed as non-fiction is unfortunate. Nevertheless, Berlitz is a compelling writer, and it's not difficult to read. I'm sure if you like this genre and aren't terribly distracted by \\"facts\\" you may enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting!","review":"This is the first book I've read about the Bermuda Triangle, and it was quite fascinating! Mr. Berlitz first describes the disappearances that have occurred in the region, and then discusses the possible causes for them. Some great photographs are also included.The only reason I've given this book a \\"4\\" instead of a \\"5\\" is that the author tends to go off on tangents - all of which I found quite interesting - however, I think it may have been better had he left some of this info. to another book.I would definately recommend purchasing this book (although you'll have to find a used copy) for anyone interested in the Bermuda Triangle, or ancient mysteries in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally preposterous but entertainng pseudo-scienceI","review":"If you believe in ghosts and fairies, this is the book for you.

At the time I read it I was intrigued by the way the book turned it self from a non-fiction fact book to a suspence novel.

His research is frequently superficial or even non-existent, as in this work. He often gets facts wrong, and favors outlandish explanations over more plausible ones. Don't take my word for it-- compare what he says about particular incidents with what you can find in reputable sources and you'll see what I mean. Instead of this book, I would recommend Lawrence Kusche's THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE MYSTERY-- SOLVED, or my own THE EVIDENCE FOR THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE.

Of course, there was no such disclaimer on the OUTSIDE of the package. If you have a doorbell sound that is flatter and less ringing, this will not work, no matter how you locate or adjust the transmitter. I could actually say Dinggggggdonggggggg and it would work--just not with the actual doorbell! This is a $30 donation to Heath/Zenith.

Just bought a set for my in-laws, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable","review":"My experience with this product is similar to most of those stated. From day 1, the extender worked intermittently and unpredictably. It's mounted right on top of my doorbell chime.

Now (even with new batteries and the sensitivity turned up), it works less than 10% of the time.

The extension transmitter is still working.So, off to Home Depot I went where the original kit was purchased from. Since they didn't have just the wireless accessory chime, I had to look for the least expensive wireless door chime kit which turned out to be the SL-6166-C which came with the push button transmitter. Only the plug-in doorbell chime was needed. That chime lasted a couple of hours before I smelled something burning. The unit self destructed while plugged into the wall outlet. I returned the piece of junk and got a refund.So, off to Rona I went. There I was able to find just the replacement wireless accessory chime. It was model #SL-6143-A and didn't have the volume adjustment knob on the back. It was only a 2-note chime which was fine with me.

Unfortunately, it does not have the range claimed and does not work outside of the house. Positioned the reciever from plug to plug in a direct line from the chime and the spot we ultimately wanted to place it in. This was of course after setting it up several times following the directions. Would ring if you kept the button down long enough and if it liked the doorbell chime at that time. Placed on the back porch directly opposite an indoor house plug we had used in the direct line site and it would ring once in a blue moon, maybe not that often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bell product","review":"I tried 3 of these chime extenders - thinking the first two were defective. Howenver, is simply poor product design. The Microphone - even when placed directly on the chime - sometimes does not function (with the sensitivity at maximum). When the microphone (transmitter) does work, the Chime (receiver) has to be close to the transmitter, otherwise it does not chime consistently. A very aggravating product experience that wasted a lot of my time. Look for a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted for 10 years","review":"We have an acre of land, and when we were out on the patio or in the vineyard we couldn't hear the doorbell ring. I bought one of these 10 years ago and plugged it in outside on the patio and it worked fine until last week, when it died. New batteries in the transmitter did not activate the outside unit. De mortuis.I used two-sided foam tape to put the transmitter on top of our \\"ding-dong\\" doorbell chime, and it worked fine. The transmitter needed batteries every 3-4 years or so. The only downside was when the cleaners vacuumed the hall where the sender was with our loud vacuum, the sender would think the doorbell was ringing and activate the remote bell.I will purchase another one of these based on my experience with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone not consistent, then failed","review":"This doorbell extender works by placing a small microphone near your doorbell. The microphone listens for any loud sound within a certain pitch range, and then triggers the remove units, (which plug into outlets.) While the remote units were loud and worked great, the microphone on the main unit was very touchy. A loud yawn would be enough to set it off, but many time the sound of the doorbell ringing would not.After about a year of ownership, the chimes started getting set off for no reason at all, and about a week later the microphone stopped working all together. I'm now stuck shopping for not only a new doorbell extender, but I need new satalite units as well, meaning that this will code me at least $40 to replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I bought this at Ace when I moved my home office upstairs and was unable to hear the doorbell. I've had this product for over 5 months now, and no amount of adjusting will make it work.

A waste of $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed at the fact that several cross references that I happened to find are missing or incomplete. Mistakes of this kind are easy to correct and the authors should have done so before it was published.

However,judging from the title of the book, one would normally expect to see a similar amount of pages are dedicated to the medicinal applications of the medicines. Sadly, this is not the case in this book. Too brief and rough is the word for this part. It, therefore, seems to me that the book promises lots, yet delivers a little and is overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The authors ought to provide an index that relates the source herbs and the chemical compounds, so readers can know the active ingredients of each herb.

This biography provides a good overview of the various phases of his life, although it tends a little much (for me) toward psychological analysis. The first few chapters, which describe what probably was for St. Ex the best period in his life, are particularly well done.I had two minor problems with the book, which does not reduce its value as a good general biography. One was the tendency to treat St. Ex's work in terms of how close or far it strays from \\"true\\" fiction, as if fiction is the ultimate form, rather than assessing the work on its own terms. I also found the ending quite abrupt -- I would have expected a little more discussion about his legacy as an author and how his reputation has fared since his death. Otherwise, a beautifully written book and a good read. REB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete biography","review":"I was there when St. Exupery flew his last mission.

It's great. My wife and I watch one episode every evening, may daughter and her boyfriend watch the whole 23 episodes in a couple of days. It's great to watch it without the commercial breaks that are on TV. So why is it good? Because it's unpredictable, full of suspense and odd characters, and is of a technical quality that you'd usually only find in a film for the big screen. My only fear is that as the seasons pile up, the script writers will be unable to create a satisfactory solution. I hope Heroes won't end up to be like Lost, a series where you feel that noone knows how it will end and they just pile mysteries upon mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise' Heroes","review":"Definately made for the American market - too many what happened previously and too many credits.Other than that a very good series.worth buying.Wouldn't work on our Toshiba disc player - no hack available"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the DVDs: Watch the deleted sceenes","review":"Best show since Babylon 5.

I have pretty much given up on anything being truly entertaining on network television but Heroes is a delightful bit of escapist fun. For those \\"geeks\\" out there, the allusions are well timed, amusing, and just obscure enough that most viewers won't get it. The casting is brilliant and, again, a few nods of inside jokes there as well. Yes, there is a derivative quality to some of it a la X-Men and Highlander but who cares when it is so very well done? Usually I can anticipate plot turns and developments. This show left me very pleasantly surprised and wrapped up so many plot threads that I was sure the final dvd would leave them all dangling. I look forward to borrowing season 2 when it is made available on dvd! (Also, if there isn't already a soundtrack compilation of the music used in the show there should be.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So worth it!","review":"The HD-DVD version of Heroes is absolutely amazing.

I started watching around episode 5 and fell in love with it. I began watching it because of the hype and a friend of mine was really into it. I dropped a star rating because I felt cheated with the finale and the 3 episodes leading up to it. All that build-up for what?...a mediocre season finale.I do have high hopes for Season 2.

Don't miss this. Unlike most serials, this show actually develops a conclusion to the major plot at the end of the season. They don't force a hanging, suspenseful plot on you to trick you into watching the next season. Very refreshing, a great cast and a very well-produced DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroes","review":"The Heroes season is one of the best shows on television. The sci-fi and imaginative appeal, along with the great characters and story line help make this show interesting and irresistible. I could hardly stop watching for three days. The price was reasonable for the length of the series (23 episodes, about 45 minutes apiece). I had never watched the original broadcasts of the show, but I was intrigued by the idea and I would suggest this show to just about anybody. There are some risqué shots along with a good amount of blood at times, so be cautious around young children. Besides that, this was an excellent purchase with which I'm very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"heroic","review":"What can I say about the first season of Heroes? A season-long arc, featuring mutants, the government, a cheerleader, the Las Vegas mob, a multi-threaded timeline, and a threat against the lives of everyone on the planet. It could have been too derivative, but it carefully echoed elements of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Babylon 5, X-Men, and other science fiction classics while avoiding that fate. How? Through careful plot pacing, with episodes that seemed slower than likely some people would otherwise normally withstand, and real, flawed characters. I haven't seen any of the second season yet, so I hope the show continues to be a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst finale ever","review":"The finale was such a let down. I know the mindless masses all have heroes fever but anyone can tell that they've already run out of ideas. The end of the season stank of the \\"hurry up and think of something for these last few episodes\\" syndrome. My prediction is that this show will severely flounder in season 2 because they've already used up all their ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroes HD DVD extremely disappointing","review":"Ordered the HD DVD in very good faith, have used amazon before and have always received excellent service - this time not the case.DVD did not work, sent back received second copy this also didn't work. Had a great deal of trouble trying to receive a refund on the item due to inconsistent feedback from customer service advisors who didn't appear to be aware of their own company's policies.Shocking service and will not be ordering from amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent show, but why 7 Discs?","review":"So why are there 7 discs? I thought HD DVD and Blu-ray offered so much more content capcity than that of standard DVDs?!? Like I've said before; Just another tactic used by the studios to raise the MSRP (\\"Ooh, but it's a 7-disc set, so it must be worth $100!\\"). Gimme a break! Not only is HD DVD competing with Blu-ray (the better of the two), but unless BOTH formats start offering content at a more attractive price-point, the new high-definition media is going to fall right on it's face. Save yourself some cash and buy the standard DVD set or better yet, download the episodes from iTunes ($1.99 x 23 = $45.77, Wow! You save $50.00!). The only thing you'll be missing is a few lines of resolution and a flimsy cardboard box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Heroes is entertaining and does hold your attention at times. It is not very original and I am sad to say,it will make any attempt by J. Michael Straczynski of \\"Babylon 5\\" fame to bring \\"Rising Stars\\" to the screen and be compared as a knockoff.\\"American Idol\\" and \\"Lost\\" are considered giant hits, followed by millions, explains the massive appeal of this show.The show bounces around constantly giving each type of viewer something to identify with and most waiting expectantly to see what happens in the next episode. The finale was a weak attempt to bring a conclusion to this season, and may be an indication of how weak this series will be in the long run as the writers run out of ideas and try to copy other successful cliche' that will be touted as original ideas.I will probably buy this for the extras. When the price drops to around $10.00 or I find a quality bootleg copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I just can't believe this show gets 4 stars and a half.I would give 2, but to lower the average, i'm giving it the worst possible.There are so many scenes that just don't make sense.Example is, in the finale, Sylar even stops bullets, but easily gets stabbed by Hiro who just runs into him with a sword without using his power.Those scenes just let me down so badly.Also, People who read subs may not feel the same way, but those who play Japanese people are the worst actors I have ever seen. Hiro may be Japanese but pretty much speaks in monotone. Ando is definitely Korean and he speaks Japanese fine, but not good enough to play the role. Hiro's sister is Japanese, but his father is not. They couldn't even hire two Japanese guys or what? Since I speak Japanese fluently, all of them are terrible actors to me. Just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best, best, worst. Where are spanish subtitles?","review":"1) Best TV show2) Best high definition format3) The worst options, this high definition title seems to not include spanish subtitles.Standard DVD version of season one comes with spanish subtitles so why HD-DVD do not?What is happening with Universal guys? I and many HD-DVD fans are not going to buy it without spanish subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"written and performed by idiots.....","review":"Leave it to NBC/Universal to come up with a show that is as stupid as say the revamped Battlestar Galactica, Smallville, and the Law and Order shows.This series is too bad to be a soap opera, weak characters that sink to a new low even for prime time televisions, and doing muti arc storylines that would be more at home on a video game. As a matter of fact, playing a video game would be worth more your time then watching this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a life (or rent a 'film').","review":"Figures - if it involves superheroes (which I loved...when I was five!) or comic-books (again....), then IT'S A HIT! The geeks-with-no-lives who made this into a hit ought to try enjoying something called a MOVIE sometime (and I don't mean Spiderman). How many great movies (or \\"films\\", to people who don't watch network shows) did you miss watching this drivel?? Amazing how many great ones I have seen lately that nobody will ever see. Of course, I could write this same review on just about ANYTHING on television, the home of 20 minutes of commercials interrupted by 40 minutes of lame entertainment (produced by people who wish they were in the motion picture business).

So how does this stack up? I think it brings a sense of realism to the comic book idealism.Nathan is Heroes version of Professor Xavier, but he is young and just learning his limits, or lack thereof. Claire, the Cheerleader, is Wolverine without the claws. I could go on, but the point is this, if you like X-men you'll love this. It is definitely for an older crowd, though; there is lots of violence that doesn't even stop with death.I hold back the fifth star only because I believe the level of gore was unnecessarily high."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Years Ago...","review":"This show came on the scene. I caught it a few episodes in and was hooked immediately. Since then, we have gone through 4 seasons. And even though I have to a faithful fan, I must say that this season is beyond spectacular. Just epic in every way I rewatch the seasons in order at least once or twice every year. Something about rewatching Season 1 all over again brings back just how amazing it was. It truly is a shame that the direction wasn't the same as the seasons progressed. The story is gripping, not all about the action. And the character development and plots were a lot more cohesive. The more I write this, the more I get sad of how this series started off on a fresh, high note but felt deflated at the end. They saved the cheerleader, but they couldn't save this show. Sigh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why call them \\"Heros\\"?","review":"I am a huge fan of this kind of show, I loved several of the characters and so stuck it out for 2 and a 1/2 episodes. After that I started feeling like I was doing something bad just watching it.They are supposed to be Heros! So why are they sleeping with married men, cheating on their boyfriends, taking drugs, and possibly killing in revenge ?(I didn't watch far enough to see if the cheerleader really killed off the fellow who tried to rape her.) Cheating is implied to be OK, heroin has its uses, and it's OK and kinda cool to watch videos of stripping women. I had to keep jumping up and blocking the screen with my body whenever my kids passed through the room as I watched this DVD. I don't watch much recent TV so this may be par for the course but it boggles my mind that no one else seems to have found this a tad immoral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received","review":"Although Season 2 & 3 arrived, Season 1 never got to me.

Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not actually a story","review":"A friend recommended the series to me highly, and so I purchased it. I was disappointed. I thought that the episodes would combine into a long story with a beginning, middle, and end. Despite the themes of time travel and prophecy, there is very little coherent overall story arc. So many loose ends are remaining, it is hard to recall the authors tying off any at all. The heavily-built-up final showdown was neither clever nor satisfying.As a tv series, it may make the producers a lot of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroes as X-Men","review":"Heroes Season One is X-Men for television, 21st Century style. A fast-paced, amusing serial blurring the lines between science fiction and fantasy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Matter of Opinion","review":"I watched the first episode of Heroes, and while it was well made with very good acting, I came away with a less than positive view of this program. The producers seem to strongly promote the theory of evolution, mildly promote teen suicidal attempts, etc. In general, if you're looking for a good sci-fi with high morals, and some family values more like Smallville promotes, you might would rather watch, well... Smallville. I'm selling my Heroes set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroes Great, Amazon not so","review":"The Heroes series is amazing. Just watch it. One of the best shows in recent years. Up there with 24. I hope Season 2 is just as good. Although I don't expect it to be.I bought this from Amazon USA to be delivered in the UK. Because I didn't want to pay for the UK hike in price (over double what it is in USA for the same item). It eventually arrived 8 days late. But instead of being delivered, there was a Customs charge of just over 12 to pay on it (which is still cheaper than UK version!). Unexpected, Amazon didn't warn me about it.

No spandex, and lots of real world dilemmas the characters are faced with. Most important, the story line is solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't made me a fan of this genre","review":"Having not seen the TV show, I went and bought the whole first season. I must say, it's not meant to be watched continuously, but I did (my mistake). Imagine watching a 16.5-hour movie where the storyline/s are consolidating into a one non-progressing plot with characters that change but do not grow. The only suspense that kept me rooted to the screen was the question of \\"who's Sylar's next protagonist-victim?\\" The psychology of the evil Mother-influence was plumbed out (Sylar's, Nathan's, etc). I wept when they killed the old Hiro, I was hoping that they do the young one. The narration's too cryptic and tiring. If you haven't watched the TV series, watch the compilation in installments. Caveat emptor: it's a 16.5-hour movie that begs you to watch an another 16.5-hour sequel. And, oh yes, the bad guy's still alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"\\"Heroes\\" is fresh and original only if you haven't read Alan Moore's comic book masterpiece,Watchmen, or seen the original Outer Limits episode that inspired it (\\"The Architects of Fear\\").

About the only \\"great\\" thing with this show is the marketing.I watched the entire season (albeit rather painfully) and usually love these types of shows. I kept expecting something to happen and I kept getting dissapointed.The acting was/is fair at best and the writing really failed to live up to even a small portion of the hype. I was dissapointed because I liked the pilot a lot and had high hopes for the show.In the end, it's mildly worth watching, but I am very surprised that the show didn't get canceled after this first season. I guess that's a testament to the marketing behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting, gross, immoral. should have r rating","review":"I bought this because I was heard good things about the show. I barely got through disc one as it was so grossand disgusting. From the opening scene of a professor calling God a cock roach to pornography then horrific scenes of rip and slash murder.

(it was obvious that the writers had written themselves into a corner and took the easiest way out of it).shows like this prove that shows such as LOST, BUFFY: THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA are works of pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy Entretenida","review":"Muy buena serie... la recomiendo a todo el mundo que este interesado en la ciencia ficcion y los comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroes review","review":"I am currently enjoying watching Heroes season 1.

The end of the season is a little anti-climactic--but otherwise I loved it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some excellent characters, but too many cliff-hangers","review":"I didn't watch all the episodes in this first season of Heroes, primarily because of the lack of resolution in the plot lines. I prefer shows like Closer, Bones, Firefly, or Dexter, where each episode solves a situation or closes a case, and the continuing plot lines have to do with the character's relationships and personal situations. Heroes does have some charming and intriguing characters (Hiro and Ando, Suresh, Matt the policeman, the cheerleader's father, the politician's brother), but on the whole, I felt like the writers/producers were teasing us, jerking us around like puppets for the sake of inducing an emotional reaction, rather than simply telling us good stories about exceptional people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome but flawed","review":"I just watched the whole first season for the first time after receiving these. The characters are so cool and real. You can really feel for them, even though they're completely strange and odd. There's a real subtext about the things we've been facing as Americans for the past eight years in here. About terrorism and distrustful government officials and people working behind the scenes of our lives and even a sort of 9/11 catastrophe of greater proportions looming in the foreground of the plot. But the writers or director or both were a bit lazy because there are lots of illogical flaws in the series as well, and sometimes it feels as if they figured their viewers wouldn't be smart enough to see those flaws, and that occasionally made me a little perturbed. Still, though, overall a great series. Would like to see the writing more careful, but otherwise, a really watchable series."},{"rating":"2","title":"this show is awesome","review":"When I first heard about the show I thought it was going to be a corny \\"super hero\\" show. There have been many shows that have come on with the same type of premise, and they have been terrible. However, this one really sets the bar. There were some parts of the movie that seemed kind of dumb and a little repetitive, same stuff that has been in most of the \\"gotta save the world\\" movies and shows. My main fear of what this show has done, is that Heros may have opened the door to many cheesy shows that are trying to do what they did. But, thats a bit off the point. The point is that this show rocks. If you are a fan of action, sci-fi, and anything good, you need to watch this. I know there are going to say that this show is for nerds or something stupid like that, but just watch one episode and I promise you'll get hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted","review":"I gave \\"Heroes, Season 1\\" as a birthday gift and the receiver was absolutely delighted!

To the Makers of the SMALLVILLE HD-DVD sets, take note of how to produce a QUALITY set. Unlike Smallville's Season 5 on HD-DVD, Heroes Season 1 has a MAIN MENU, animations and all. Smallville's episodes simply start playing after you insert the disc, no introductions to the season or episodes at all, no title screen, no fun. And unlike Smallville's, Heroes' box is loaded with ART. Smallville's box is basically completely devoid of art, it's only a space-saver -- BORING and not what collectors like me really want after having paid more money than what the DVD set goes for, which has all of these things.So if you are thinking about getting an HD-DVD Player, let this be the reason, as HEROES SEASON 1 on HD-DVD is hands down the best TV-on-DVD/HD-DVD set ever created. It is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First and the BEST!","review":"This is no doubt, and without any exaggeration the best season of any show I've ever seen in my entire life. I was hooked from the first episode. You might want to set aside about a day to watch them back to back because you won't be able to stop it's so addicting. However, one minor flaw is that seasons that come after this one will not be as good. They are still good and still heads and shoulders above the rest of regular tv fare but they will never match the quality of this season.Good Luck. Enjoy the season. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV show and DVD experience!","review":"The show is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. A great ensemble cast, visual effects, and plot twists that will keep you guessing throughout the entire season.The DVD special features are definitely worth the price of purchase even if you've already seen all the episodes on TV. For one, the alternate, 75-minute pilot is an interesting look into what might have been. All of cast/crew commentaries are extremely entertaining, I particularly favor those with Greg Grunberg.The various behind-the-scenes pieces are also great eye-openers which illustrate just how epic of a production this TV show really is. All in all, Heroes Season 1 is a must-have whether you're a diehard fan of the show or you're looking for something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss Heroes","review":"Excellent series. I really enjoyed the extras that came with this DVD too. Heroes is a well written show, and you will want to watch the whole series in one sitting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great but Doesn't Add Up","review":"Many folks agree that Heroes started going downhill in the 2nd Season but I would argue that there wasn't much there to begin with. The premise is wonderful (and not all that different from its better predecessor The 4400). But there are some terrible storylines written about African American characters and beautiful women by writers who have NO IDEA what they are like in real life. Everyone, for this reason is quite shallow and without any real depth, much like a layman's impression of a comic book character. The whole Jessica, DL and kid story is so bad, I long to throw things at the TV when they are on screen. Peter Petrelli's acting is pretty bad making him a sorry lead character. I like Hiro and Peter's brother a bit but not all episodes can be about them, can they? I would prefer a DVD set with all Hiro episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series- worth the buy.","review":"A must own title on HD DVD!

I could mention that it could use more DVD-exclusive content and special features, I do love commentary tracks. But, this is a minor issue by comparison. This is, bar none, the best opening season for any television series. Perhaps the second season wasn't all that it could be, and the third season is almost up to standards, but those are separate concerns. Here's the bottom line: Get this DVD collection.

I was head over heals in love with it. That is up until the last 4 episodes! Where they proceeded to cheat me and every other viewer out of a good ending to the season. It's like the writers woke up one day and just decided they had better stuff to do. Everything leading up to the last 4 episodes is simply amazing.

Gamba was always at his best playing Rossini overtures. This set of six overtures is ahead of the pack. Say what you will about Gamba, but his playing of the William Tell is so incredibly fast paced that it takes your breath away. He's always been known for this kind of thing. You either like it or you don't. I do. Nothing boring here. It will blow you out of your listening room. Superb recording too in early stereo from Decca London.Hal DentonCookeville, TN"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this is a great freakin album. its hardcore, its fast, its funny, and its got plenty of breakdowns and pit-inducing riffs to satisfy just about everyone. my only complaint is that the classic KLU vocals sound too reminiscient of Donnybrook (due to him not being able to hold the mic during recording).but besides the at times drastically different vocals, this album is very solid and the southern rock influences sound great. this is why KLU is one of my favorite bands.KLU @$$hole ATTACK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly disappointing.","review":"Kids Like Us just didnt do it for me on their new album. Their debut cd kicked a$$. The first sounded so much like Sum 41's critically acclaimed album, 'All Killer No Filler'. The reason I got into Kids Like Us is due to the fact that my favorite band is Sum 41. KLU captured the energy, agressivenes and absolute genius of the Sum 41 sound. This album tends to lean more towards the sound of bands like Trapt and 3 Days Grace. While the aforementioned bands are pretty good, I didnt exactly want to hear another Nu Metal band. Perhaps the next album will go back to that good ol' 41 sound. I'll be waiting till that day comes!

Moments such as planet Eden deciding Earth must be destroyed and shooting off a laser are followed by something totally unconnected with a line that mentions that one of the main characters saved the world.

For example, is Chihaya yaoi (gay) or just very feminine? He's definitely not a woman, but he was drawn with the large eyes that are used for females in anime. The English dub also gives him a high voice, though it's noticibly male, which is a good thing. He's very sensitive to humans (as well as the humanoids he encounters), and the yaoi fangirl in me became suspicious when Chihaya seemed to have a slight crush on Taki, the dashing Aqua-haired humanoid (Who, by the way, is pretty cute for an anime guy). However, when Chihaya was captured, he called for Kagetsuya, his angelic partner, and noticibly blushed for a few seconds when the handsome blonde angel kissed a wound in his chest to heal it. Perhaps it's just that angels have no preference in this sort of thing, but a fangirl can always hope, can't she?? See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"Great movie.

I was a bit dissapointed, for the romance didn't really come until the third episode, but it was still good. Earthian is only four episodes. It's about two angels; one has to record the bad side of humans, and the other the good. Then there's a main plot going through the four episodes, with side plots to make everything more spaced out (in my oppinion).I would recommend this if you wanted it for the story, but if you were like me and only got it for the boy's love, then I'd say get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basically the best foam airplane every made!!!","review":"These things glide forever!

It is not too noticeable though because it is just a little and most of the paint is on there. The detail is amazing it looks like the William G-3/G-4 in the game! Just be careful not to scratch it while playing with it because like I said the paint is fragile. The claws are not sharp they are rubbery and bendy so it is safe to play with. You can actually transform G-3 into G-4 with the different set of head and mouth that comes with it and it even has instructions on the box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another delightful Kipper book.","review":"We borrowed this one from the library.

It is both very modern and deeply traditional in its feelings with parallels to Chinese poetry and to the work of Wallace Stevens. The poems use landscape and memory of his Italian years to link us to the basic human experiences of life: ageing, loss etc. They seem a great step forward from his previous books, like the Zone Jounals and China Traces, and at least equal to his most recent book Black Zodiac. I found it both beautiful and deeply moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting biographical details on Smith and Dillard.","review":"The author provides an historical overview of the development of private Southern women's schools from finishing schools to respected institutions of higher learning. Primary in this change at Hollins is the influence of Louis Rubin on both the writing program and the writers that program produced, with many quotes from the students about their mentor. Parrish also gives many humorous and interesting anecdotes about Lee Smith, Annie Dillard and the other subjects of the book during their formative years at Hollins. She shows how their college experiences carried over to their writing both then and through the years since graduation. For Lee Smith and Annie Dillard fans, this book is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"But it has nothing to do with the original work!","review":"M. Thenadier moved to America to become a slave trader at the end of Les Miserables. Inspector Javert not only died, his body was found dead in an ending that Victor Hugo declared to be one of his best and should not be changed or he would never write another word. Well, since he's not writing any more, it has been changed. Marius didn't have a penchant for getting involved with dubious people - indeed, his participation in the student uprising was motivated by idealism.If this book had characters with different names, and did not say \\"Sequel to Les Miserables\\", perhaps it would be better.Really, this is a sequel to the musical, not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. No. NO!","review":"OK, just a few things: Les Miserables (the original novel) is commonly regarded as one of the greatest pieces of literary work ever written, and therefore should not be changed. However, in this version, Javert is still alive, and Marius is a carefree, fun-loving, and immmature character. Marius is not carefree. Javert is dead. I would call that changing the original novel. A reader who is not familiar with the original work might enjoy this, but anyone who loves Victor Hugo's classic novel would not enjoy this book. My advice to those who want something to read? The original novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT, BUT WHERE IS GEORGE W.???????","review":"I LOVE THIS QUILT AND IT LOOKS EVEN BETTER WHEN STITCHED, BUT WHERE IS GEORGE W.???????

Anything with Michael English singing is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"High schoolish tripe","review":"Poorly written, with far too much religious pontification, this book ultimately is disappointing survival horror. Although it's better than its competitors--The Book of the Dead, Still Dead, The Rising--it's still amateurish shlock whose characters far too often launch into pedantic multi-page theological discussions when they're not dying a page or two after they've been introduced.If you want something scary, read Noel Hynd's Ghosts. Or for a thriller, read almost anything by Childs/Preston.For survival horror, better just to watch the various zombie pictures again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie fiction at it's finest","review":"This book is a must read for any zombie lover. The undead in this book are vicious. The action is fast and furious and the reasoning for the dead walking again is very compelling. These are zombie from the classic Romero mold \\"When there is no more room in the hell the dead shall walk the earth.\\" This book would make an excellent movie. You will find yourself not able to put this book down and wanting to read it again once you are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apocalypse Now!","review":"The \\"guts\\" of this book are every bit as creepy and frightening as the cover. I read this book almost a dozen years ago when it was first published and it gave me nightmares. After discovering this new edition, with vastly improved cover art done by Mark Rogers himself, the nightmares returned. I have loaned my battered, out-of-print first edition to almost every friend I have and everyone of them thought it a great book.The Dead is terrifying on many levels, but the author's ability to make the premise of corpses clawing up out of their graves, bent on maiming and torturing the living seem possible and believable scared me more than anything else.The story moves along at a furious pace, punctuated by gun battles, martial arts action and conversations with the damned undead. The theology, on which the book is based, is well thought out and argued over from many different viewpoints by the characters, keeping the book from becoming too preachy.I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Zombie/Religious Thiller!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I loved that it's characters were forced to question their personal religious beliefs as a result of the undead walking the earth. It's an easy read, scary, page turner, etc. If you're a fan of the zombie genre you'll really like this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As promised...","review":"This was a gory read. Granted, I have read worse, but not really in such volume. And I can honestly say that I've never heard of the Apocalypse portrayed quite like that before.I enjoyed it though, as much as one can enjoy zombies and death all over. The philosophy and religion were interesting as well. And the illustrations were very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I don't know where to start with this, but The Dead somehow manages to be as intelligent as it is gruesome; for every face-shredding or grisly mutilation, there's a thought provoking theological debate, and although the story is based on Catholic symbolism concerning the end of the world, at no part is it ever \\"preachy.\\" The Dead also manages not to be dull at any point, with suspenseful escapes, heated arguements, and all-out battles with the undead on every page. Do yourself a favor and buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"Couldn't finish it... Read the first 5 chapters, then the last two. That's all you need. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting point of view","review":"This book was very surprising to me because I was not expecting so much religion. I thought it was going to be another zombie novel. It was very graphic and detailed and I felt like I could create a perfect image of what the author was trying to portray, even though some things I would rather not imagine. It had all the must haves for a zombie novel, but provided another point of view that I've never seen before. It was a really good read and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action","review":"I got this book as a free download.I was intrigued by the cover.It grabbed me right away and couldn't put it down. I almost had to read it with my eyes closed a couple of times. So vivid and exciting.Plus totally loved the ending. Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, But Ultimately a thinly veiled sermon","review":"The author has an interesting take on the Romero zombie, with several very good gruesome scenes throughout the book. The author also weaves a very compelling setting of despair and gloom throughout his new zombified world. However, he mars the story-telling experience by injecting page after page of theological debates between the main characters. Ultimately the book veers away from the tried and true goodness of zombie killing fun fiction and into a thinly veiled sermon waxing on about Judgment Day and Christianity. I have no problems with religion, but I don't want to be lectured in my leisure time reading. Additionally the climax and subsequent resolution of the book and it's main characters is not satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but not Great","review":"This book is OKAY, but definitely not a great read. Lots of misspellings and grammatical errors, and the author's own pentecostal religious outloook (which is strange, because all the main characters in the book are Catholic), make it feel as if you're reading the Turner Diaries as envisioned by George Romero.There are still some good scares provided, just don't expect this to be a well-written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"Sorry, I have to depart from the general consensus and say that, as a writer myself, this book was awful. Aside from the stereotypical depictions of women being creatures of bovine stupidity, the typographical errors on EVERY single page were outrageous, all the characters were completely one-dimensional, and the ending was utter garbage. This was neither scary nor thought-provoking, but laughable at best. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the concept was a good idea. It was, however, very badly carried out. I have not read anything else by Mark E. Rogers, and judging from this I probably never will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Setting the Zombie genra back to the stoneages...","review":"With very few good zombie survival books to choose from, wasting your money on The Dead is exactly that, a waste of money. Do not let the cover of this book fool you, it's really just a sermon in sheeps clothing. Filled with fire and brimstone, it places the action behind the thinly laid subtext, God God and more God. By page eight you're already tired of the thinly laid debates between all of the main characters (who are all religious figures of some kind). The plot is somewhat pacing for the story but the dialog thrown in is truly a tragity. The characters are predictible and poorly thought out. Do not waste your time. If your in the market for a good book minus the sermon, buy Reign of the Dead and call it a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close.","review":"The author uses this book as his own platform for expressing his religious preference.... disses a very good stephen king... and there are so many freaking typos in this book its hard to read. if you want a good zombie novel go with the Autumn series by David Moody or Day by day armageddon.this book gave me a headache 3 times before i finished it due to the arguments between the fundamentalist preacher, the orthodox catholic priest and the survivalist.... that should pretty much say it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What book did all those other reviewers read???","review":"I read the Dead by Rogers and I have to say that it was really bad.The story isn't horrible. The action scenes at least work, very reminiscent of either Romero's work or that old Dead World comic.But interspersed are long dialogues about the nature of man and God and the Devil. NOT kidding. This book is fundementalist and the dead coming back to life are there to punish sinners.Thought I'd read it all (I did read this whole book) before but this one was a first.If the author reads this...please in future editions, make the religious sections in a red font so readers know what to skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY VERY GOOD","review":"Here is one of the very best books ever written.

All I will say is that never, EVER in my life did I expect to read, let alone pay for, over 300 pages of religious propaganda.Perfect example of judging a book by its cover..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in Print!","review":"I last read this in college, when the author's wife (my philosophy prof) was kind enough to lend a copy. Way before zombie novels and religious apocolyptic visions were popular, Mark E. Rogers created a world where Dawn of the Dead meets Left Behind.I look forward to finally owning my own copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christian zombie story?","review":"Yes this is a Christian zombie story. Mark Rogers is a Catholic but the themes explored in this book are drenched with exploring what is salvation and forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"A little too theological and unbelievable for me. Kept wanting to stop reading, but pushed myself thinking it would get better. It doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dead left me Dead","review":"I started this book in the hopes of reading a horror story, but what I got was sadly disappointing. I like books in which I can relate to some of the characters. After reading about a third of the book, I wanted to kill them myself. The problem with the book is that it is too \\"preachy.\\" The author droned on and on about religious beliefs, biblical concepts, christianity, etc., which took away from the story. Or was it the story? It was really hard to tell. The book was a mystery to me from the beginning to end. What was it really about? The Rapture with zombies. Not a good mix. The only favorable parts of the book was the commando-style fighting of some of the characters and the zombies, but after a while even that became cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Story is quite gripping. You will want to read this. The cover caught me off guard but intrigued me so I got and glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and hard to put . down.","review":"Great story of good versus evil and the struggle to make amends.

My feelings became more negative the further I read. Seemed to become more of a treatise about God, faith and religion as it progressed. It seems the author has issues with various religions. I felt lectured to."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE DEAD - eh, didn't really like","review":"Went on way too long with no explanation of exactly who was doing this and/or WHY. Or perhaps it did but the SAME things kept happening over & over again making me forget the reason. I did finish it, though - only to see if it would redeem itself. But it didn't. At least not for me. I guess I just don't like religious / christian type themes?? (If that's what this was). Mark Rogers does have the gift of writting, though - I just didn't like this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"STRANGE AND INTERESTING","review":"I have never read a book quite this strange, but interesting as well. A cross between zombies and a dead army in an apocalypse. At least it kept you on your feet. A little slow here and there, but basically an entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising. More good than bad.","review":"As some have mentioned, some of the spelling, grammar, and spacing makes this book seem self-published. Also, the gripes about the long winded arguements over religion being far too numerous are definitely justified. I suffered through the first such instance, but couldn't help but roll my eyes when the theme kept popping back up.That said, this book is very entertaining. The drawings don't do justice to what my imagination was throwing out in some of these scenes... really terrifying stuff. The long discussions on religion do, at least, lead to something later, but they are still forced and don't really flow with the story. Even with its flaws, I read the book quickly and enjoyed the discomfort some of the scenes brought over me. Very different from most in this genre, and if you consider its age, it's hard not to appreciate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Chilling despite the typografical errrors","review":"The Dead in this novel are torturing the living out of sheer envy. \\"The very fact that that were not sharing his pain was unendurable, worse than the pain itself.\\"Consider this state of mind when dealing with a minimum wage earner in a horrendous job who is probably looking up from his grill, mop, shovel, or cash register with the same point-of-view as Mark Rogers' damned souls (why aren't you suffering like I'm suffering).On a lighter note: Max and Gary must be human stand-ins for Samurai Cat and Shiro. Since that series ended it was good to see them, even in pontificating human form."},{"rating":"2","title":"choke on some dirt....","review":"About four months ago, my fiancé read me an excerpt of The Dead during one of our phone conversations, and knew I had to read it in its entirety.

Mother Bear gives Little Bear a hat. But when our little protagonist goes outside, he's still cold. What can mother bear give her son now? A coat, of course. But,again,Little Bear is still cold. Finally Mother Bear gives Little Bear pants, but he's still cold. Then Little Bear asks for a final article of clothing-a fur coat, and after Mother Bear takes off all the clothes she has given him, he realizes he already has one.The other two stories-In my opinion-are just as heartwarming as the first.

It didn't. What this book does show you is how to build a really muscular butt and thighs. Although Mrs. Reno says that women can't get too muscular by doing these work outs, you only have to look at the many pictures of woman in the book to see that you sure can! I guess it's a subjective thing. I personally like woman to have some fat and curves and most of the women pictured in the book (who are supposed to be examples) are too muscular for my taste and I would not like to look that way.

First of all, although used, it was in excellent condition.

Since then, I have always wanted one of her books. This one reminds me of her. It's passionate in a quietly serious way. She tells you why you don't like something that she knows you would if the food had been prepared properly. You believe her and you just want to try her recipe. The method and ingredients are so straitforward that you know she's right even before you taste. She tells you what wine or beverage pairs best with your meals, why your bead dough has disappointed you, and when to save an expensive ingredient for a special occasion. Lest you think her a snobby foreigner, she recommends good old Corningware pie plates for baking the truly all-American pie. Everyone can cook from this book--novice to pro, those who think cooking is drudgery to those who can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coq au vin perfection","review":"I took on the challenge of Madeleine's \\"A well-prepared coq au vin...\\" and the end result was well worth it.

This novel from first-time writer, Marjorie Spoto not only told the story as if it was happening first hand, but she delved right into the minds of all the characters, telling a wonderful story about relationships and life.

If you are interested in wasting money on this movie, get it. If you are trying to build a mob movie collection, and you want to have every movie ever made, get it.

No one with any taste would watch this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Maybe this CD was carefully recorded and a true labor of love, especially with the involment of the composer and a famous tenor. However, it leaves me disappointed. This may be because I fell in love with a previous recording of Misa Criolla and Navidad Nuestra, one that was done in the 60's with singers in a South American church. It had all the earthly and folksy tones that one would associate with a Misa Criolla, a mass celebrated by common folks whose fervor elevated their musicality to heights that no operatic tenor or church choir can hope to attain, no matter how hard they try. That recording grew on me and I never tired of listening to it. But, unfortunately I thoughtlessly gave it away when I got rid of my vinyl records some years ago. Later, when I found this CD, I couldn't wait to hear it, but I am sorry to say that it cannot compare to the original recording. If any one still has that one, I would really appreciate if you would let me make a copy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely beautiful recording","review":"I believe this was the last recording Carreras made before his illness in 1987 and he is in sublime voice. The first part of the recording is a mass with each part is set to a different South American dance rhythm and the music and tempi are constantly changing. One moment you are being transported by a floated pianissimo, and the next, you are dancing around the room. This is probably my most listened to non-operatic CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the One","review":"I first heard a \\"misa criolla\\" track of the Lord's Prayer ( in spanish of course) on our Classic fm station and immediately call them what is the album title. They said it is a Philips album but it is out of circulation. When I found this on the net, excitedly purchased it and listened. What a dissapointment!!I expected a folk guitar accompanied singer but all I have is too much confusion on what I am hearing. It is made with too much orchestration which require a hall not your serene listening room. Too bad I missed the folk version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismayed and disappointed","review":"This version of the Misa Criolla is elegant, restrained and polished, three adjectives that have nothing to do with the raw and rousing folk original.

I bought this CD version by Jose Careras, but was utterly disappointed by his almost \\"operatic\\" approach to what is supposed to be an earthy peasant mass. It just doesn't work.Fortunately, the wonderful original version, digitally remastered, is now available on CD. It has a simple purple and black image of the crucifixion on the cover (see the second of the small customer images above) instead of the original orange 1960's LP cover , but is in every other way the definitive recording of this wonderful piece.Look for it on Amazon and buy it - you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too polished, lost in sense","review":"When I heard the Misa Criolla first time over classical music radio station in mid 60s, I had to ran to the record shop and buy LP. It was the Philips recording of Los Fronterizos and soloists, Ariel Ramirez conducting. It sold the more than 3 million copies worldwide. Jose's CD came out later, and I was very disappointed, may be played once. No comparison to the Los Fronterizos. Jose's is too sofisticated, too polished, interesting instrumentation but no original folk strength. I strongly suggest the reissue of original one, though it is an Argentine press and no lyrics posted in the Spanish-only liner note, it is a far better choice. If you doubt, go to internet and play the videos of different soloists, including Jose. You will agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obras y arreglos como ningunos otros","review":"Muy pocas veces se combinanel arte popular y el arte clasicoy cuando se combinan escasas sonlas ocacciones en que ofrecen unbuen resultado.

Be the first to complete 10 melds, or phases, in order. You can only complete one phase per hand, and if you fail before the round ends, you must try again. And it is, at first.As you go along, each round gets harder to complete, giving those who are behind a chance to catch up. But each hand also starts to take longer. And that's my biggest complaint against the game. It takes forever to finish. In fact, I don't know if I've ever finished a game because of time constraints.This is a challenging and creative card game.

This is a game that may take a little bit to understand, but once you do, it is fun for everyone. Kids of all ages can play and it is also fun for teenagers and adults as well. Basically the game in a nutshell is that there are \\"10 Phases\\" that you must complete in order to win. Everyone starts on the first phase (these can be anything like getting two sets of three, four of the same suit, etc) and the first person to get the phase wins that round. That person advances to working on the next phase, while the rest of the group has to try and complete the one they did not master.

It takes quite a few little liberties some of the characters and their relations (nothing a non-obssesed Arthur fan would notice). It's a beginning story (tells about the establishment of his kingdom, not his reign and end). Unfortunatly Arthur's wonderfuly simple wisdom, royal knowledge and extreme goodness of character are sacraficed to give Guinevere more of the spotlight (and the credit for the kingdom). Another thing that was lost was the beautiful chemistry, tension and thrill of the incredible Lancelot-Guinevere-Arthur love triangle. That would probalbly be my greatest chritism. But it is Arthur story (and therefore practically impossible to ruin). And it's also nice to get a good look at Guinevere. I always enjoy hearing the story from her persepective. Lee's acting was rather weak, but Flannery and Whyle were superb. Take a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've Been Better","review":"I watched this movie having read that it was based on Persia Woolley's Guinevere trilogy. The books were entertaining--not my favorite Arthurian story, but decent. I have no idea what happened between the writing of the screen adaptation and actual filming, but the book is unrecognizable except for the basic facts: Guinevere marries Arthur, loves Lancelot, etc. I've seen all of the main actors in other things so I know they can act, but this movie gave them so little to work with I'm not surprised by the wooden faces they have in most scenes. The costumes were terrible--a previous reviewer was right, I've seen better at a RenFaire. Cheryl Lee's short hair WAS distracting.It's a shame that one of the few (maybe only) movies centered around Guinevere had to be so bad. Watch it if you're curious to see how bad for yourself, but remember you'll be giving up ninety-three minutes of your life to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesey but great fun!","review":"This movie was shown once on the Lifetime channel in 1992 and has finally been released. It is the story of Camelot through Guinevere's eyes. Somewhat distorted - Lancelot and Guinevere meet at a Dark Ages \\"New Age\\" camp run by Morgan LeFay and become betrothed, Arthur \\"saves\\" Guinevere by marrying her and gets to take her virginity to boot, Guinevere has a baby girl.

Her work here, in this witchy retelling of the Arthurian Legend, is quite wonderful as well; powerful, Shakespearean in its approach. The Irish actress, Brid Brennan, is very scary as Morgan, high priestess of the Britons, Arthur's half-sister and sworn enemy. This is a well-made movie, quite absorbing. Fans of the legend, or of historical drama in general, should find this film enjoyable. Me, I'm a stone Sheryl Lee fan, and this is excellent work.

It's a semi-narrative film with each character giving their date of birth and I suppose who they are and what they are supposed to represent to the plot of the film. Not at all what I expected.

Could never recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Pilates DVD","review":"This was the first Pilates DVD I purchased and it was a good choice.There are 3 levels. The beginner level would be good for anyone who is really out of shape or has very little strength or flexibility. The beginner exercises are very modified. The intermediate level should challenge the average person. There are some routines with warm ups and others that get right into it with the 100. Your choice. There are also some routines that have an arm weight section at the end. Eventually I'll get to the advanced level.Pilates is about quality not how many reps you do. If you do the lessons first and then in the workouts you really focus on what you're doing you will feel it and you'll see results."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great program!","review":"I don't really need to lose weight, but I do need to tone up and improve my flexibility. I've had some injuries that prevent me from doing weights. My physical therapist has been working in some pilates excercises into program and he recommended this title. I'm going between the beginner and intermediate workouts, depending on how I feel. The pace of the workouts is perfect. There's a nice flow, you take the time to focus on each exercise and the instructor gives you breathing cues too, which can really make the difference in Pilates. This is a great program that I will continue to use for quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout, Nice Variety!","review":"I really enjoy this DVD - the workouts are very clear and there is a lot of variety. I am a beginner and there is so much here for me. Each level of workout has different models and a half dozen workouts for each level. I'll be busy for a long time with these workouts. I can't imagine wanting anything else from a Pilates DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nananaThunder","review":"Weak have a ton of work out tapes, this is my worst yet.

Gym class style workout and BOORRRIINNGGG!!!","review":"after i read all the 4 and 5 star reviews i really thought i was going to get an awesome dvd for pilates workout.. and i ended up being so annoyed the second time i tried to do the dvd... i know pilates are gradually increased movements and all but this instructor teaches too slow and talks the whole freakin time!!! \\"now raise your leg up, then down, and up and down, and UP and Doowwwnnn, and UP! and down.. two more, and up and down..\\" like OMG!!! i think we got the point the first time when she said go up and down dang it! oh well, point is... dont buy this if you hate feeling like a complete idiot moving at sloth speed... if u want a good workout do kundalini yoga same benefits and MORE! sorry to sound rude, but thats not what I'm trying to be at all... just honest and straight forward cuz its your money that youre spending on YOU'RE health! good luck to everyone bettering their health!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Pilates DVD","review":"I purchased this DVD after reading reviews about it. I own a number of Pilates DVDs and was looking forward to the versatility of this one.Bottomline - I'm dissapointed with this DVD. The voice-over is not pleasant and annoying at times . . . instructions are sometimes inconsistent . . . but, what I consider its greatest shortcoming is how poorly transitions are handled . . . and sometimes not at all. I was taught that transitions in Pilates were important and needed to be treated as smooth flowing and continuous . . . that one series led into the next . . . In this DVD, one series may end in one position and the next series starts in a completely different position. This introduces some degree of risk in making a rapid transition too quickly and inappropriately in order to keep up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast, bad transitions","review":"I bought this DVD despite the mixed reviews and have to report that I was disappointed with the purchase. I have another Pilates tape (not DVD) that was one continuous workout which I much prefer. With this one, there was no time in between transitions and there often were no clear transitions. I also found that it went way too fast and tried to cram in too many things into each session."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video is good enough, and that's it.","review":"This video tape works, but it is basically a clip of people doing a different exercise each, all pasted together to make a full workout.

The only weight I lost was in my wallet!","review":"This is soooo slow I almost fell asleep. It is good to learn the moves of Pilates and after that get rid of it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice variety but voiceover is terrible","review":"This dvd has several options for pilates workouts, but the whole time it is a voiceover with a person (not speaking) doing the workout. This creates a very odd dynamic and flow. The energy is quite low in the dvd and the production quality is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pilates DVD","review":"There is lots of variety on the DVD. All I did on the beginner section was the instruction section. The routines were not quite challenging enough for me so I moved to intermediate. I'm going to be here for awhile, which is great because I still have the advanced workouts to look forward to. I really like that each level has an instruction section so you can learn how to do the routines and then when you get to the workouts the instructor cues you but there isn't the minutes wasted telling you exactly what to do and demoing it all the way through. It makes it flow well and I feel like I get more of a workout then with other Pilates DVDs I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service, good product","review":"Good program that allows a user to progress from the basics through the more advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is an excellent DVD. You must be realistic however that just doing this DVD a few times a week will not make you loose weight. As the instructor discusses in the interview, there are other aspects to weight loss and pilates is not the only one. In addition, the instructors voice is slow in some parts (where appropriate in the beginning levels) and may be perceived as \\"monotone\\" - but this is not intended to be a motivating peppy DVD. It's purpose is to properly learn pilates technique to augment your workouts. Finally, for J.L. Garner who states her own mat instructor was trained by Romano (the Pilates Queen), the artistic director and instructor of this video, Karen Garcia, is also trained by her. Karen is an excellent instructor, extremely knowledgable, and her studios in Northern Virginia are very successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I am new to Pilates and have not worked out regularly in about 4 years. The instructor seems \\"stiff\\" and her voice is a little annoying. She doesn't seem to enjoy Pilates herself which makes it hard to get excited about it. Some of the excercises, in my opinion, are not for beginners at all - way too hard, and there is not easier alternative to certain excercises for less experienced i.e. less fit people. It also doesn't seem to have a progression (beginning, middle, end)... There's a short warm up but then it's on the floor, up again, sit down, roll around... The whole video and it's setting seems very dated too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this video. I was only on the beginner level for a few days. It was really easy for me. I started the intermediate. It was so awesome. I am just now on the challenging level. Absolutely love it. 3 times a week and I feel great! I have definition in my arms that I have never had before."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"This DVD is for those who are in shape. If you are overweight, obese, top or bottom heavy, just starting to work out, don't bother. This chick has you doing things with your body that you need a reasonable shape to do it with and plenty of space to roll and tumble in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Inspiring","review":"I was not at all impressed with this DVD. I have several other Pilates DVDs and thought this would make a good addition to my collection based on the reviews here. Boy was I wrong. This was the most uninspiring workout video I've ever seen. I looks like it was taped in stoggey old mansion and the pace is very slow to the point of boring. The narration was poor at best and I can't imagine losing any weight following this slow format."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is deceiving","review":"To explain: the cover gives the impression that the workout will take place in a relaxing atmosphere - if not outdoors, at least in a pleasant and modern studio. But the video appears old and it has a strange, kind of cheap-looking quality. It's filmed in a gloomy and dull room with weird lighting. For some people this might not matter, but I really don't like it and just can't get through any of the workouts. There's a LOT of talking and it feels like it takes forever to get to the actual exercises. The expert actually narrates without doing the workout (a blond woman does it without talking) and the audio is completely uneven - sometimes her voice gets really loud, especially when she's counting out the movement. It's too weird for me. It's also possible that I just don't have the patience for this kind of workout tape - too much talking, I want to just get to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Get Past the First 5 Minutes!!","review":"Maybe it's just me, but this video was excruciatingly slow. I've been used to Jillian Michaels, and was looking for something a little more gentle, but with the same heart-pumping pace. This was NOT it. I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes of it. Even the Advanced section starts out with sloooowwww stretches and breathing. And unfortunately, despite how skilled this instructor may be, she wasn't super motivational to me. It felt like a waste of money. If you're looking to actually WORK OUT, get a Jillian DVD. They're great. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilates weight loss","review":"good product, but not what was advertised! I was expecting the DVD that had a woman doing pilates on the grass as my product, but instead i received an interactive personal trainer DVD for pilates.

I was familar with Pilates after taking a few classes at my local gym, but defintely more a beginner than advance.

I have been considering converting my vinyl to cds and Tolonen! with an exclamation mark would be one of the first on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible","review":"This obscure item is a killer instrumental album that any guitar fan should snap up before it disappears again. Jukka Tolonen is almost unknown in the U.S., but has been revered in Scandinavia (he's from Finland) and Europe for thirty years. It was one of my favorites when it came out around 1972 and it has unique, unforgettable music by a master. It's sometimes extraordinarily lyrical, other times frenetic prog-rock; sometimes hard-edged, sometimes quiet. This is probably my favorite of Tolonen's albums I've heard--it's certainly the most original. And the dude has serious chops. (IMHO, Elements/Earth Air Fire Water is the most memorable cut, and it also can be found on the \\"Best of\\" package also available on Amazon--at twice the price.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, awful sound quality","review":"As I said, great music selection but you would have expect better sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real sleeper","review":"The picture quality was great.

Left wingers will be pleased that the plot includes pending enviromental catastrophe caused by humanity's excesses while right wingers will be pleased that the solution is more freedom, not less. Dan Randolf, the main character of the book, is the best protagonist Bova has ever created."},{"rating":"1","title":"hack rip off","review":"Be aware that this book is not a collection of Beatrix Potter's tales and illustrations, but a book version of a cartoon. Instead of Potter's delicate pictures, the illustrations are stills of sub-par animation and the stories have been rewritten -poorly. If you find the older English to be unappealing to your children, you'd be better off buying the real thing and changing a few words as you go along. You could do the story better justice rewording it yourself and your children would have the benefit of Potter's stunning drawings."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great bracelet -- better than the photo!","review":"This bracelet is so well-made and attractive! There's pretty-and-witty visual interplay in the textures, colors, and shapes of the faceted transparent gems, the polished, opaque semi-precious stones, and the silver links and bezel settings. I love this bracelet, and I'll probably wear it more than any other. I have it on now with jeans and a sweater, and I could wear it as well witha suit, or to a beach party, or almost anywhere. It would look good with almost anything. It has a nice weight, too. Someone should take another photo of it, though! It looks way better than the photo posted when I bought it -- I was really worried about it until it came, and then I was so happy-happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"This movie borders on being a little too contrived. However, it manages to pull off the comedy smoothly in the end. The story centers around a young girl being mistaken for being a rich banker's mistress and how she is all of a sudden being offered free stays at rich hotels and the like. All from people who are hoping to cash in on her supposed status as mistress. In the end, though, she finds true love from a nice fellow in the form of Ray Milland who also happens to be the rich banker's son. And he finds out how to apply himself to his work.

I passed it on to the nice man who turned me on to the work of Preston Sturges & the joys of the first few Nick & Noras, and he loved it, too.With Ray Milland as an unhappy rich young man & Jean Arthur as a working girl who helps him when he's down, plus the always steady Edward Albert, a sparkling & urbane script by Preston Sturges, if you love \\"Madcap\\" films, \\"Easy Living\\" is right up your parkway and down your boulevard. And, to quote Scarecrow Video in Seattle, Jean Arthur was one of Hollywood's great little \\"hotties\\". She was cute as a button, sassy, and sweet as honeydew vinewater.

However, it is a delightful relief from the cares of a hard day. In fact, that was the intention of many comedy-makers in 1930's, to give people a break, in those pre-commercial television days, from the worst economic depression in American history. No doubt it could not make much of a dent in the gloom of those facing very real hardship in putting a roof over their head and food on their table, but for those whose suffering was less, it was a tonic. Watch it! No hidden critique of the capitalist system, no meaning that is not on the surface, designed only for a laugh or two.

More importantly, though this film is a homage to many B Movies, many movies and TV shows since have referenced this film.

Piper does an admirable job of playing the tough, working class hero. Keith David and Meg Ryan are also great in their respective supporting role.While the movie drags along for the first half hour or so, the action picks up at a dramatic pace afterwards, including one of the greatest fight scenes in movie history between Piper and David.

The fight scene between him and Keith David is one of my favorite film fights ever - and the reason behind the fight is hilarious.This might not be the best sci-fi movie ever made, and our economic/class separation reality isn't quite as harsh as portrayed by the movie, but sometimes to critique something you have to exaggerate it a bit. \\"They Live\\" will never let you look at a billboard, magazine, or dollar bill the same way again.

At the very least, it should entertain you."},{"rating":"2","title":"they live","review":"great campy movie, if your looking for Oscar performance don't look here, but if you want an entertaining movie this could be it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"DVD was in great condition. Rowdy Roddy Piper teaches us about life. ... Also has and exceptionally long fight scene.... So, are you here to chew bubblegum or kick some ass?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Carpenter's Best !","review":"First of all, I would have given this a full 5 stars but the lack of extra prevented me to do so. Hey, the menu screen only have play and scene selection, my goodness. If John Carpenter shows little respect for his own fine work by providing a commentary along with star Roddy Piper, I bet this DVD will be flying off the shelvesFor those who are not aware of the plot of the movie, here is a basic summary, the world apparently has been invaded and controlled by \\"aliens\\" and they are among us as Politicians, sales, lawyers, cops, etc. They can only be seen by someone wearing special sunglass. To say more will spoil the fun.The sound is Dolby 2.0 and it is not bad, and the picture transfer is fine. If somebody at Universal decide to release a special edition with load of extra, we are sure to buy it again. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but","review":"These are a good value, as far as you get many tools and a cute container for them, but I was rather disappointed with the quality. Like other reviewers mentioned, the name smears off the handles rather quickly, and the pale pink color picks up stains extremely easily- not only with tomato sauce, but also stuffing, soup, and anything with curry in it. These tools, while pretty, are simply not up to the same standards as other kitchenaid products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty in Pink but stains easily","review":"I really liked a rich pink color when I bought these spatulas and spoons, but they stained the first time I cooked curry or tomato sause. I tried everything to remove the stains, but nothing seems to work. So what used to be pretty pink is now yellow and not so pretty. I am surprised the manufacturer didn't think about this \\"small\\" detail, when stirring sauces is what spatulas are frequently used for. You would be better off buying black spatulas. At least they always look like new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the pink!","review":"I love these tools, they match my kitchen perfectly! They are very sturdy and don't bend. The only thing that I would have to say I don't like is that if you scooped, say, red pasta sauce with a spoon, it immediatly stains the spoon (a little if you rinse it right away and a lot if you leave it in the pot with the sauce). I also use the spatula for cooking eggs and I've noticed that the end of the spatula is stained yellow a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bear Rocks","review":"As always bear keeps kids busy and teaches them at the same time.

Bear is great, he teaches about import things such as brushing teach, combing hair, potty training, the seasons, colors, to share, doctor office visiting, among many other things. The best pre-school has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, my son found it boring","review":"My son loves Barney and Little People and would watch those for hours if I would let him (no way). I bought this DVD because I wanted to encourage him with tooth brushing and bed habits with a fun video. And, it took Bear and all of his friends...what seemed to be an hour of video...to get to bed! I was bored to tears. My toddler didn't last very long at all. The bed habits, which seemed more like \\"how much can I stall before I go to bed\\" or procrastinate, were not exactly what I wanted my son to learn. I just did not like this video at all. Sorry.We also bought the Bear Dance Party Video. My son DOES like that one. To each their own, I guess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of 'Impulse'","review":"Normally, I enjoy Catherine Coulter's books very much - up until I read this book I believed I could buy any of her books without being concerned about if I would like it. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to her prior novels.The plot line was imaginative and should have been exciting - I am usually unable to put one of her books down and I finish it in a couple of days - this book took me more than two weeks to get through. The characters were flat and even by the end of the book I really didn't care what happened to them. Definitely not the reaction she was going for during the final chapters!Overall, I would have to say that I really did not like this book. My recommendation would be to purchase any one of her other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to force myself to finish","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author and I honestly don't know if I will try another.This book was lacking in a lot of ways.

And all the secrets!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acceptable","review":"I did not buy it new, so I knew it would have some wear and tear. It had a bit more than I was expecting, but it was still acceptable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Ignored this Impulse","review":"While I have to admit the plot is more than interesting, everything else [stunk]. There are too many things that bothered me about this. First of all, when did the hero and heroine decide they loved each other; when he took her on the lawn or when he took her in the pool knowing what others would think when they found her panties? I understand the bad men being so aweful, but if he is supposed to be the good guy, how could he treat her just like they do? What the hell does she see in him anyways, ever? So what, he is great in bed. I guess it's up to us to assume they had qualities worth loving other than sex. Second, when and how did Rafeal's mother and Cocoa meet? How did they correspond without Mr. Meannie finding out? I don't think that was ever mentioned. I feel like I never got to know the characters, except for a little bit of history. This thing only deserves one star because the plot was good and interesting. Other than that, I didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much violence against women.","review":"I've enjoyed many of Catherine Coulter's books, but this is not one of them. This book was filled with chapter after chapter of debasing thoughts of chauvinistic men. The whole story seemed to revolve around how many times you can insult and humiliate the women, including the heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an articulate author or editor","review":"I picked this book up at an airport never having read Coulter before.

The original filters, when I purchased the Air Cleaner, have a rubbery gasket that surround the filter to keep dust from slipping through the outside edge. The new replacement filter is just a cardboard frame that snuggly fits in the unit. I suppose it still seals enough to prevent dust from being blown back into the air.I gave it 5 stars because it does filter the air like it's designed to. This was one of few places that I was able to find this filter. I was very surprised that Whirlpool themselves don't stock it any longer under their parts list.I think I paid around $35.00 for this filter. That's a little steep to stock up on them, just in case the unit should stop working.

Leon Jay is a gifted teacher and demonstrates the techniques in clear detail. However, the sound quality is terrible! It is a live seminar, the dialog volume is extremely weak, and in many places during the demonstrations it is impossible to hear what he is saying. This is unfortunate because one cannot learn the small circle system without knowing which direction to apply pressure. While the techniques are demonstrated visually, many aspects of the small circle movements are imperceptable to the eye and must be explained in order to be understood. For a 40 minute video to be priced at $30.00 a person should receive a high-end product. This video does not make the grade, and as a result, I will be returning it in short order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master the Basics English","review":"I love Barron's material.

For a beginner it is wonderful and for an advanced learner it is good review."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Key Guide to the Pleasure of English Poetry","review":"Forty years ago, I found my first important anthology of English Poetry, Ezra Pound's \\"Confucious to Cummings\\", in which I discovered the poetry I still consider my first choices in the English language, particularly Arthur Golding's translation of Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\", and many other poets, including, of course, Cummings. That great critic, Harold Bloom's Anthology has the same feel, a superior range of poets, whose work is of the very best in English verse in his judgement .Most of the poets have extensive, very helpful introductory paragraphs, placing them in their particular age - written by the best teacher - I emphasise that last word - of English Literature to-day. If English Poetry interests you at all, you will hugely enjoy this book - it will give you hour upon hour of intense pleasure, heavy though it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Commentary","review":"Bloom's collection here is an excellent start for new poet scholars. He offers more than just an edited collection of poetry. Here he meticulously and intelligently shares his opinion on each and every poem he's handpicked for his collection. The title suggests it is the ultimate collection of poetry for a shelf with no other poetry. However, if you are looking for such a singular text, this is not the right book for you. Bloom at times allows his personal opinions to get in the way of including traditional poems associated with the greatest poetry of all time. If you are interested in the study of poetry, Bloom's collection is an excellent one. However, if you are in search of a compilation of poetry to complete your library, you would be better off with Norton's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to read anytime","review":"Harold Bloom has done an outstanding job of compiling a group of the greatest poets through centuries of work. His written passages that precede the author's works are great insight, even if you do not fully agree with them.I also enjoy the fact that he put in Chaucer and others' original works, not whatever he felt would read easiest. Bloom allows you to witness the creativity and brilliance of the author's work, without too much of his own personal influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Collection","review":"Of course this is \\"My favorite poems\\" collection by Professor Bloom. I was disappointed to not find Whittier in here, but after learning Mr. Bloom considers Whitman the greatest America poet it does not surprise me. He could have at least printed \\"Snowbound\\".Space given to Longfellow was very short - far too short for my taste, anyway. I think a selection from \\"Evangeline\\" or \\"The Song of Hiawatha\\" would have been appropriate.I do think he gave a nice bit of space to Dickinson.Overall, this collection is very nice and definitely a keeper. My suggestion is to read this as an introduction to poetry and the buy a book of your favorites to get a broader view.I also think the introductions and annotations given by prof. Bloom are very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and Timeless!","review":"The author does a great job framing the Affirmative Action debate.

There are simply not that many of the elite to keep this mag going. So what's in it for the average Jane? First, the writing is excellent.

Davis has simply taken a lot of really old stories from previously published sources, thrown in a couple of interviews with people no one's ever heard of before, and is presenting it as new revelation. It's not. This is just the same old silly stories packaged up between fancy new covers. Fans won't learn anything about the real Morrison or what really happened to him.

It is an enjoyable and inspiring read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better as an article...","review":"I appreciate the jist of what Mark Miller is trying to communicate in this book, but it seems that he doesn't really say anything of significance. The book is thin; the content is thinner. Miller's advice amounts to: know your audience, be creative (though he doesn't give practical advice on how to be creative), and get your audience involved in the story. Sadly, almost half the book is a re-cap of a single experience he had with his church, something called the \\"Jesus Journey.\\"This would have been a great 3-page article, but there's just not enough here to merit paying $15 for a whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I like Dai-Day?","review":"There are other duck sauces out there, but only Dai-Day tastes like the original duck sauce from the Chinese restaurants in New York where I grew up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best!!!","review":"Yep, another displaced New Yorker.

I'm glad Amazon has the \\"Good Taste\\" to sell Dai Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best duck sauce in America","review":"My wife and I originally were introuced to Dai Day Duck Sauce in New York over 40 years ago at a barbaque. The ribs and chicken had the most wonderful sweet and punjent taste ever in our memories. For many years we lived in South Florida and were able to purchase it at our local supermarket. We now live in Asheville North Carolina and none of the major chains carry it. We purchased Dai Day from Amazon and were thankful that we still can get this great item. There are NO substitudes for this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taste is close to what I like","review":"I'm from Philly and now live in Nebraska, so a lot of Asian food items now I buy online. I love the taste of Yi Pin Duck sauce in those little plastic packets that they give with Chinese takeout in Philly. I cook chinese at home now and pretty good at it ;) so I looked for duck sauce in jars and tried different brands... This one is almost close to the taste, that's why 4 stars. It's great that it comes in these huge jars, and 4 of these would last a long time. Next time, though, I'll buy Ty Ling brand, the jars are a lot smaller, but the taste is better. That brand has \\"Sweet and Sour sauce\\" (I tried it), that tastes like duck sauce and they have \\"Duck Sauce\\", I wonder how the second one tastes like.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dai Dai Duck Sauce","review":"This product is a must for making stir-fry, with a little soy sauce.

I just purchase a 4 unit pack so its probably not the same seller since it takes awhile for replenishing, but this time around one jar was broken on arrival, and I was refunded without a problem. It is as pictured. Store in pantry until ready to use, then once open ,I refridgerate. It is securely screwed-on, first time jar opening for me reqires a jar opener and extra hands!

The video cover claims that it has a candid, unscripted side of Angle in the video. Well to be honest, there is nothing of the sort. Angle remains in character for the entire video which runs about an hour and ten minutes all together. The video itself basically covers Angle's first year in the WWF thru ALL of his PPV matches up until No Mercy. The only thing that made this video earn two stars was the comments about Kurt Angle from other stars. Jerry Lawler, Steven Richards, Tazz, Steve Blackman, Rikishi and the Brooklyn Brawler all share there thoughts about Angle (All in character I might add). This is a poor video and the false claims on the back of the video make it even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kurt Angle It's True It's True","review":"This tape is good, but there are not the DVD version,no extra.

I'd suggest renting it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great video, It's True, It's True","review":"Kurt Angle has had a sucessful year to say the least.

His very own home video takes you throught all of his best moments, from winning the Olympic Gold Medal to Capturing The WWF Title. A Must have for Anyone with the Three I's."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Boring! It's Boring!","review":"I expected this video to be like an autobiography of Kurt Angle, showing him as a child, growing up, through his Olympic days, all the way to the WWF. This was not the case.The video is pretty much a non-stop clip of Kurt Angle's highlight matches in the WWF. Not a bad video for someone who missed those matches, but it's nothing new at all. Anyone who taped the Pay Per Views has most of the footage already.Another annoying concept of the video was having Kurt Angle stay in character. Why not show the real side of Kurt Angle? That's what we want to see. We see enough of the Kurt Angle character on TV every week. How about showing us the Kurt Angle behind the scenes, that we don't know much about (except for the Olympic Gold Medals).This video was a bummer. Hopefully the WWF will release a video about the Real Kurt Angle, not the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a perfect snapshot of early Kurt","review":"There are several complaints that this videotape does not have any insight into who Kurt really is or any of his matches included. This is true. If that is what you are looking for then you'll have to make due with Kurt's autobiography and DVD's of him in PPV's until the WWE or TNA come out with a Kurt Angle DVD sometime in the future.But for those of us nostalgic for that magical Kurt Angle that captured our imaginations and tickled our funny bones in his first year in the WWE, this videotape is a wonderful trip down memory lane. Kurt stays in his cocky, goofy character the entire documentary and it shows highlights of some of his more entertaining moments.Since that first year Kurt has slowly transformed himself into a more intense and credible [...]. kicker, but at the expense of his entertainment value. This video shows Kurt at what I feel was his best, simultaneously both a great athlete and entertainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE 5 STAR REVIEW SAYS IT ALLTHE 5 STAR REVIEW SAYS IT ALL","review":"THE 5 STAR REVIEW SAYS IT ALLTHE 5 STAR REVIEW SAYS IT ALLTHE 5 STAR REVIEW SAYS IT ALLTHE 5 STAR REVIEW SAYS IT ALL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work the sync mode","review":"I bought to charge and sync my HTC HD2, but just work for charge.

In addition, the heel plates are cheap, hard plastic. My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off. My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges. FootSmart charged me $12.99 to ship the shoes, and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction, they are charging me $6.99 more using the barcode return label. Thus I spent $20 to try on cheap shoes. I don't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore, and I won't order from FootSmart.

I'm sure it works better for others , because Jack Canfield has good things tok say about it, but not for me. I find that working on core limiting beliefs is far more helpful. The method is basically about 'letting go' of emotions. The author says all emotions culminate in either wanting approval, control, separation or security (or their opposites, eg wanting disapproval). So most of the book teaches you how to let go of these wants within different contexts."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be sorry if you read this book!","review":"This is actually a good book. However, this method's results are negligable at best; and otherwise seriously depressing.

Only, sometimes (not always), a temporary mild relief.I tried letting go of resistances. In that area, no results at all.In the light of all the good reviews and the success stories peppered through the book, maybe I am not normal or I am wrongly applying the method. However, I doubt it.

One day I checked my car tire pressure and the gauge indicated the pressure in all tires was in the mid 40s (should be low 30s)! I figured a mechanic had over inflated them, so I let some air out. Several weeks later my mechanic checked my pressure and said my tires were under very underinflated (mid 20s) and he filled them. When I got home, I checked again. Sure enough it read in the mid 40s. I checked against another gauge and which read in the mid 30s - which is what the mechanic set them to.

It is made of brass with 4 moving parts. It is accurate, consistent and reasonably priced. The quality and durability are very good for an air gauge in this price range. Remember, when buying an air gauge, the pressure you plan to use it for needs to be in the middle of the range of the gauge for best accuracy. If you are checking car tires in the 28-35 PSI range you want to buy a 0-60 PSI gauge. If you are using it on trailer and truck tires that operated at 45-60 PSI you want a 0-100 PSI gauge. Also, when checking tires it is best to check them when the tires are cold. The recommended pressures stamped on the side of the tires, in the owner's manual etc. are for cold tires. When driving the tire temperature rises due to heat generated by friction so any reading you take when the tires are hot will be high and not accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tire guage","review":"I got this tire gauge after I saw my son using it.

Those two songs are the reason I give this album a 4 instead of a 5.The people that complain about the tracks on the cd not matching the mixes that were in the game need to realize that the music in the game is mixed dynamically, meaning it can mix back into itself depending on how long you stay in a certain part of the game. Video game music has to be arranged differently than movie music because of that fact.Marty and Mike do a good job at capturing some of the themes you remember from the game and arranging them into a linear format for the CD, although many do run on the short side. If they release a volume 2 soundtrack, I would really like it to have mixes that are longer than the 2:30 average that most of the tracks run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally good, but not without flaws","review":"I am a big fan of most of Marty's music on the soundtrack. Also being a rock music fan, Breaking Benjamin's song was among one I liked a lot. However, the Incubus songs were waaayyy too erratic and all-over-the-place for me with the exception of the Third Movement. They just drive me crazy. It's like I should be having a seizure when listening to Follow... :\\\\Hoobastank's song is pretty good too, in my opinion, but it's not something that should be on Halo's soundtrack; perhaps it's better suited for a racing game.Overall, I liked a bunch of the stuff on this album. For those of you like me who are into competition grade stereo systems in cars, one track to check out with a good system is In Amber Clad. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bungie Never Ceases To Amaze","review":"I have had this CD about five months and have listened to it hundreds of times.It still gives me chills.The music is beautifully written, and anyone can enjoy it even if they've never played Halo.I own many soundtracks, an this is the BEST soundtrack I have listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Halo 2 but not the soundtrack","review":"I got this because I like the music in the game, but some of the stuff on the soundtrack really disappointed me. At times I thought I was listening to Riverdance or Enigma. At other times it reminded me of Santana or even Miles Davis. I expected to get a CD that would put me in the Halo mood - agressive, powerful, ready to rock. What I got is so ecclectic I wasn't even interested in playing the game after listening to it. Maybe you'll like it, but I'd return it if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Freakin soundtrack out there!","review":"Wonderfully orchestrated music coupled with some awesome rock songs make this the best soundtrack available"},{"rating":"2","title":"a kick ass soundtrack to one of the best games in the xbox generation","review":"this soundtrack is one of the best that i have ever seen.

Everything is computerized and the characters are all in bold thick print as though a marker drew it. It makes it impossible to see how to write a letter and/or word naturally. Everything seems to just blend together. There are NO examples of actual handwriting whatsoever. I think the author could have done a much better job.

She is a Latina, her new love is African American. The story is set in New York city where he's a young Johnny Cochran - except he only defends the good guys - and she's a spokesperson for the NYPD. The story is obviously told by an insider - the author worked in New York politics - and it's told with a woman's point of view. I savored this book and its characters are still with me.

A beautiful girl affianced to Gustave and loved by both brothers, she plays a major role in the surprise and emotionally satisfying ending.Rehak writes with a charming simplicity and smooth seques to form an enchantingly gripping story.I look forward to his next and hope he continues to supply us with many more hours of reading pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY!!!!","review":"When I purchased this item, I thought I was getting the metal box, gameboard, and peices shown in the picture.

When the guitarist \\"remixes\\" old demo's and rerecords the guitar parts is anyone really surprised when the vocals and bass become inaudible beneath the ego of the man at the faders? No, not really. Which is a shame as it happens, as this album is potentially full of great songs dragged into the late nineties with all the productions whizz-bangs at Paul Chapman's disposal. Sadly we will never know how great they might have sounded as this sounds like Mr. Chapman was demoing his playing and not his song-writing ability. It's clear to me he holds both Pete Way and Danny Vaughn in contempt. If you want to know how these two fine musicians really sound, buy some \\"UFO\\" (Pete Way) or better still get some \\"Tyketto\\" or \\"Vaughn\\". Better songs, better production (and if you get the right albums) better guitar playing. 2 out of 5 says it all.

Almost this entire movie was great, the acting was great, the music was great, the camera work was great. then the writer or the director(i am not sure who is to blame)gave the movie the WORST ENDING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. The ending is made that much worse because of how good the movie is until then. if you are going to see this movie just know to have a vomit bag with you at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a twist","review":"Gossip says it all. What happens when someone spreads a rumor? The ending was the best part of the movie. James Mardeson plays a jerky guy who doesn't know how to tell the truth, lying is all he knows.

It says it's a thriller but it's really not, not gross or anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like All Gossip: A Lot of Talk About Nothing!","review":"A very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level. The movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue: I've heard better lines in 'Fast Times At Richmond High' thank you.Altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing. Don't believe the great reviews about this film: the film might appeal to the 14-17 year-old crowds fantasizing about how 'cool' college life might be with all the 'cool' people and 'parties.' If you're not in that category, skip this boring film and save both your time and your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies to come out this year","review":"This was an excellent movie.

It plays with the idea of yellow versus real journalism. I like that. Unfortunately, the execution is seriously flawed. We go through all of this twisty turny stuff that's telegraphed ahead of time and then gives a very unrealistic and unsatisfying conclusion to the whole thing. If you've got nothing else to do, watch it with some friends, but i guarantee that the conversation it provokes will be a lot more interesting than the film itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Buffs Delight","review":"This trilogy makes compulsive reading.

They were not hard to read at all, because I'm 13 years old and I undertstood them(of course, you can't exactly go by my judgement; I read Hamlet and understood it). I liked how they were written in a diary format. It's like you are reading Josephine's inner thoughts. Even though they are fiction, they are packed with historical facts.

And by the end of the movie, the killer's motive is so predictable, it's almost laughable!!!In trying to capture the \\"grittiness\\" of McBain's popular series, director Bruce Paltrow only manages to give us lifeless acting, no true suspenseful scenes, and an embarrassing romantic entanglement for Randy Quaid and deaf mute Deanne Brey. Randy is not as apt at this type of role as those in which he is allowed to release his inhibitions and chew up the scenery. Alex MacArthur as his partner who finds out his wife is cheating on him is also flaccid and uninteresting.Good plot, weak script, poor acting, Ed deserves better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"All his great movies in one set...but not great for people who love extras...","review":"For the first time all Tarantino's great movies together in one neat box set!!!!I myself like the way the box is made eventhough many hate it.

See others find it insane the way some dvds are packaged in that way, but you have to realize companies are never going to give in to our complaints. Just either don't take it out as much as you want to or put it in a cd case.For some people that care alot about extras this set is not for you, otherwise BUY IT. There are few close to no extras at all on the discs. It is cheaper than buying the movies seperately though.The Positive about this set...1.

It don't think it was ever widely released here in the states but it's a movie that's definitely worth checking out.It's a coming-of-age story about a young man who is struggling with his sexual identity amidsts the often glitzy and decadent club scene of Lima, Peru.What really makes this movie special and sets it apart from most American \\"gay\\" movies is the fact that it is utterly honest, it never tries to oversimplify this man's relationships. Maybe what's really refreshing is that it's wise enough to know that the truth about human sexuality does not lie in extremes, that someone should be \\"gay\\" or \\"straight.\\"It's a gay movie that is subversive for not dogmatically celebrating the gay lifestyle as the end all and be all of homosexuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very realistic movie","review":"First I read the book. Then I saw the movie. I was very pleased by the result of the movie. It shows how being gay in Latin American countries really is. It shows how society behaves when dealing with homosexuality issues. Being gay and from Mexico I felt really identified by this movie. I really liked it for being real. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I bought the DVD edition, and they don't take advantage of this technology, they don't add 'interviews' or 'comentaries of the director, produces or actors'.

Eddy tends to be unfocused in his writing, usually unable to stick with an idea longer than a couple of sentences, the title basically saying it all: it is a \\"misguided tour\\" through popular music. In fact, I fail to see how \\"The Accidental Evolution of Popular Music\\" even applies here. Connections of ideas from song to song throughout history seem poorly linked, and what the reader basically gets is one man's slanted and garbled interpretation of them. Eddy defends mindless bubblegum music while harping on any that attempts to bring deeper meaning. If your looking for one man's opinion on music, this book is for you--especially if you like Debbie Gibson, Def Leppard, and Donna Summer--but you may be surprised that such acts as Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd are sorely misrepresented because, by the author's belief, they have too much to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was good, only in that it should me what truly bad criticism and writing can be.","review":"This book is unbelievably bad by a writer who possesses possibly absolutely no talent or intelligence.

He looked kinda fat because of all the peanut butter I was luring him with the other traps. It was a guilt free experience to bring him to a field and release him.

While following instructions and baiting the trap with peanut butter and crackers, the trap has been cleaned of the bait on numerous occasions without tripping the door release.. There have also been three occasions when the bait was removed and the doors did trip shut, however no squirrel was captured.Even though this is advertised as a squirrel trap, apparently it does not work, unless the squirrel is small enough to get fully into the trap before tripping the release. I can only assume that the times the trap was tripped, the squirrel was able to hold the doors open with some part of his body while eating the bait. Very frustrating efforts over a two week period.

If you are using peanut butter put a small amount on top of the bait pan and then smear some on the underside of the pan.

I did have to put a heavy rock on top of the trap. I am not sure if it was a rat or something bigger but it must have gotten caught and jumped around enough to turn the cage and release itself. I put dry catfood, deli turkey, pumpkin seeds and craisins in a little bowl made of aluminum foil. Also, to make it harder for the rat to swipe without setting off the trap, I ducktape the bowl to the middle trigger plate.

So, I bought another 1025 and also a \\"Havahart 0745 Live Animal Professional Style Trap\\". Since it's advertised as a chipmunk trap, whereas the 1025 is advertised as a squirrel trap, I wanted to compare them. I've used the two side-by-side, and can tell you, that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1. They like the 1025 so much, I've occasionally left it out overnight without bait, and found a chippie inside in the morning.I've caught squirrels in this too, they apparently like peanut butter as much as the chippies do.

I could hear it from my bed as it kept running back and forth over the tray, looking for a way out. By morning, it had escaped - the doors were still locked so I assume it squeezed out of the corner where the door comes down. I understand that rats can squeeze through a hole the size of a nickel, so that is apparently what happened.I then used pliers to bend the four lower corners of the two doors inward a bit to decrease the size of those gaps. The next night I caught another rat (I don't think this was the same one), and this time it was still there in the morning.

It's like all the re-cap episodes - you'll watch them the first time to see if there's ANYTHING new or revealing, find there isn't, and you have no desire whatsoever to watch them again.If you REALLY must buy this, wait till it hits the discount rack.

Escaflowne is one of the most visually and intellectually stunning anime's i've ever seen. Although it becomes somewhat of a soap opera, aimed at pleasing the young HS crowd. The characters are very well devloped. The hero's are not completely good, and the antagonists are not entirely evil.I think the part that kept me on the edge of my seat is that, even though the story is centerered around dragons and knights, they showed that theme in a way that i'd never seen before. I'd definately get this box set over the new English DVD's. This series ranks up there with others that i really enjoy like Outlaw Star and Trigun."},{"rating":"2","title":"very kewl...","review":"Vision of Escaflowne can best be described, in my mind, as Fushigi Yuugi meets Gundam Wing. You have the girl getting pulled into another world, and being rescued by a young king that happens to have control over a mecha called Escaflowne.

You'll probably find other inconsistencies to harp on, but beyond all this...the anime is exceptional!

The story is gripping, character developments are shown as we see the young prince slowly grow up into a king. The action sequences are very well done and the idea of thought becoming reality is extremely inviting. The mecha battles are very well done as we see not only the outside but the insides of these war machinces enhancing the realism of these giant robots. Just watching the internal workings of these machines are a treat for anyone that's into mecha action. About the only thing I disliked in the anime is the un-defeatable prince Allen.

It is a blues,rock,jazz and funk guitar album. The songs are all instrumental and feature some great guitar work from one of the greats, Jeff Beck. Jeff Beck explores many different types of music and blends them together and the results is fantastic. The best songs are \\"Freeway Jam\\", \\"Diamond Dust\\" and his tribute to the late great master of the Telecaster Roy Buchanan, called \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\". Monumental guitarmanship from Jeff Beck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against the grain but urgently needed.....","review":"While Jeff Beck's offering here as well as his \\"virtuosity\\" have been touted by many realms of guitar aficionadom, I can't really say that the album here (or really much of his work) represents the best of the fusion genre or even serves as a mindblowing example of how electric guitar can be played without a pick (something that many Beck devotees point out ad nauseam...ugh). His ideas really don't coalesce all that well particularly here although \\"Cause We've ended as Lovers\\" has its moments but one song really doesn't cut it.Anyway if you really want to delve into fusion from around this time more check out Parliament, Miles Davis (\\"Bitches Brew Era\\"), or Santana. For good examples of electric guitarists who axe the pick (no pun intended) check out Mark Knopfler and Lindsey Buckingham."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece, pure and simple!","review":"This CD blew me away 25 years ago, and still does today. Despite the number of 'guitar heroes' (whom all of which I admire very much) out there, 'Blow by Blow' was THE one to get the guitar-rock-fusion thing going.This CD is FAR from dated - it has hooks, jumps, jams and all sorts of other stuff to put it ahead of the pack. Beck, already a 'classic guitarist', outdid himself on this one. The variety of tones and intensity on all the compositions are awesome. 'Freeway Jam' is a classic, as well as the mellow 'Cause we ended as Lovers' - just these 2 are worth price of admission. 'Scatterbrain' and the other gems on 'Side 1' displays Beck's ability to make his way around a guitar like no guitarist could...This has to be one in your collection if you are a 'guitar-rock' fan (eg Satriani, Vai). Even if you are not, this CD would appeal to the non 'guitar-rock-music' fanatic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtuosic Masterpiece","review":"This is one amazing fusion album that shouldn't go ignored by anyone claiming to appreciate guitar technique. I've heard faster guitarists 'shred' their way through song after song and CD after CD with the same blistering speed but this album puts Beck in a different catagory. One where technique and style take center stage. There isn't a single note on this album that doesn't show Jeff Beck to be an absolute virtuoso with the guitar. Cuz We've Ended as Lovers is so well done you can easily identify the guitar as being two people breaking up complete with all the emotional baggage that goes along with that scene. Easily one of the most overlooked guitar masterpieces of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows You Away","review":"This is the best place to start when it comes to Beck's solo work. The material is top grade (including Stevie Wonder compositions like \\"We've Ended as Lovers\\" and Beatles' \\"She's a woman), with great production by the legendary George Martin, a top notch band, and most of all: tasteful, brilliant guitar by Jeff Beck. Each and every track--yes all of them-- is a fusion/instrumental guitar classic. Those who play guitar have probably seen every track transcribed in a guitar mag at some point. It's hard to pick a highlight from such a monster album, but if I had to, I'd say the emotion drenched guitar on the superbly executed \\"We've ended as Lovers.\\" Ever wondered why Beck is mentioned in the same breath as Hendrix, Clapton, Gilmour etc.? Check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff, the voice in the guitar","review":"There is no other guitarist I can think of that can make the instrument communicate on such a Vocal level as Jeff Beck. On this album - and particularly on \\"Cause We're Ended as Lovers\\" - he plays with such soul and depth, phrasing as if his instrument is really breathing and singing for him.As for the rest of the album: George Martin's production (and string arrangement on \\"Diamond Dust\\") is sympathetic and always on the right level to carry every part of Jeff and his band's playing.Speaking as a singer, I can only rave that Jeff makes the guitar communicate so richly. He's the greatest, and this album offers ample proof. A beautiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Huge album","review":"Back when this release came out... it was such a ground breaker. It's hard now to even think of how innovative this was, because so much has happened over the passage of time. Jeff Beck still has his chops together, which is certainly indicitive with the caliber of musician he is. I have this in CD and play it every now and again. I will have to say that this album influenced 3 or 4 follow up releases before Mr. Beck started changing his formula, riding the wave of earlier things that worked. But this was cutting edge stuff back in the day... and he still is releasing cutting edge stuff.... need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar album!","review":"Jeff Beck is one of the pioneers of instrumental rock/blues/jazz/everything music. He can bounce from musical style with ease and manages to capture the attention of the most deaf,ignorant music fans.

Don't listen once and toss aside. You'll be sorry! If you want three-chord rock, this aint' it. If you're a guitarist who wants to know what you can do with the instrument, listen up.

Admittedly, I have not heard all of him, but I have been listening to this album for over 20 years. It has stood the test of time. As a former guitar player, I have a very high appreciation of the guitar work on this album. Both the foreground and the background. So subtle and yet so tasteful. Anyone who is attuned to artistic guitar work should appreciate this album. And the drumming is also excellent. The keyboards and bass are just sort of so-so, but the guitar orientation and tasteful drumming have made this a long time favorite.I also think that a previous review was incorrect in suggesting that Jeff uses a \\"wah\\" pedal. To my ears, it is a \\"volume\\" pedal, which can be easily mistaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Hero Defined","review":"If you can overlook the somewhat dated sound of this cd (and you should be) you will hear some electric guitar work that easily moves from rock to fusion to ballad and creates highwater marks at each stop. I first heard this stuff when it was released over 20 years ago any very few artists have come close to it since, though many have tried. Amazingly enough, less than a year later Jeff released \\"Wired,\\" which is \\"Blow By Blow\\"'s equal. So get \\"Blow By Blow\\" or \\"Wired\\" or better yet, BOTH."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars is not enough","review":"Genius! Pure genius. There are really no other words to describe this album.

When, as Jimmy Page said, Beck is on, he is the best there is. On this album he is definitely on! And to me there is no finer instrumental song than Cause We've Ended as Lovers. The bending, the legato slides, everything about it is perfect!More than any other player Jeff Beck epitomizes the Guitar God. You must listen to this album, over and over and over...As perfect a recording as there ever was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blow by blow by Jeff Beck","review":"Together with Wired and There and Back this is a must have Jeff Beck album. Beck is one of those guitar players that were able to develop a style and a sound of their own.

This set contains wonderfully remastered hits with the videos that accompanied them. Mind you, this was before songs were made into videos and the outfits were frightening (but then again, what were we wearing back then)? You can blame the A&M executives for the wholesome appearance of the duo. They thankfully were other than they appeared.The music is the main focus here and the videos are merely the means to show them.

NOT ALL LV's have brown egyptian cotton lining. This bag authentic retails for over $5000, because it is made with exotic skins (Ostrich and snake) as well as exotic gemstones. Be the judge?

This was back in the 80s when we all smoked and drank -anyway a bunch of us were sitting around my TV watching this, laughing ourselves sick when another person I knew stopped by. He came in on the middle of it and couldn't understand why this room full of people were laughinig so much at this movie. I guess you had to be there, but it was a lot of fun.

The science fictional elements come into play only late in the story yet are integral in making all the various story lines come together. The use of astrology throughout the book is represented in terms and language that are completely accessible to the layman, yet are done with the thoroughness of one who is an expert in the field. The debate between science versus astrology is approached through the protagonist's personal relationship as well as her credibility to the public at large. And Barbara Shafferman is likely to expand a few minds along the way. This is a \\"must read\\" for all and is a fine first novel for the author. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best constructed novels I have ever read!","review":"A wonderful blend of future gagets, politics, spin, astrology, and romance within a complex and intense adventure.

Snippets of the author's childhood, reference to her father's drinking problems, some small indication of her bipolar diagnosis, but mostly a reverie of her successful career in television.

However, Jane's personal struggle with depression sounded as exciting as watching paint dry. Maybe it is just me, but I feel there was something missing, like she wasn't really spilling her gut feelings. I felt Pauley was still very protective of sharing her feelings. She seems like a nice person with a deep desire to protect herself as well as others for fear of some type of criticism. I plowed through it with hopes of learning something, but it never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"skywriting is on autopilot","review":"The book is bland and one should borrow it from the library. Jane mayhave had good intentions to come out of the closet on mental health issues but the book seems like she is guarded and protective of herimage, her husband's celebrity status and her future employment prospectives. I do not think she is insightful enough about her experience and how her celebrity and wealth affect the entire process.I believe a waning career (mid-life crisis) and the onset of menopausehad something to do with her health crisis. Menopause hormonal imbalancescan create as much havoc as post-partum depression--including bouts ofmania and psychosis. Not enough details in the book to help anyone orfeel that you know Jane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who saw Jane Pauley on Tim Russert?!","review":"Man - she is seriously messed up! How could people at NBC work with this woman for three decades and not realize that she was seriously messed up? These high profile people in Holywood are obviously idiots. I've never seen her cancelled talk-show, but if she talks to everyone the same way she talked to Tim Russert tonight...man, it just boggles the mind. She's got disorganized thought process, disjointed and disorganized sentences, inappropriate effect. She's probably full of personality disorders, too. The book was lame and full of pretense. It was as awkward and funny as watching Tim Russert rocking back and forth while Jane went on and on and on and on with endless tangents, which is how one could sum up the content of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This was such a disappointing book. It never really revealed anything about J Pauley's battle with bipolar disease. It HINTED at some things (that maybe she was screwed up because of her dad's drinking problem, etc.) but overall, it was dumb. She didn't give enough details about ANYTHING. In some parts of the book, I could hear Jane Pauley talking -- but overall, it was quite a disappointment. Contrary to other reviews, I found this book to be poorly written. Jane should just stick to reading whats on the cue cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Could* have been good...","review":"The Introduction was so excellent; deep, complex, intelligent, and meaningful. But the rest of the book never matched its tone or quality. I kept waiting for the point, the meat of the personal discoveries, but they didn't come. For example, references to how Jane and her sister would only realize later how deeply certain parental aspects affected them, but never actually telling us about the revelation! So frustrating. And as someone working on memoir myself, it seems the book needed the hand of a good editor to help with flow, transitions, and theme. The raw material was there, but hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I read Skywriting to gain insight about the bipolar disorder, learn more about Jane Pauley's media career, her co-workers, the fascinating people she has met and perhaps some personal anecdotes about her husband, Garry Trudeau. It did not happen.Skywriting is uninformative, disjointed therapy writing.The only redeeming value of the book is the few pages near the end where Ms. Pauley writes about the final years of her parents as they aged and passed on.Giving this book one star is generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn -- boring and bland","review":"I don't know what the point of this book was.

The people in charge of the music should have had their head examined, there was just no research. No oldies, no disco, no soul, not even a spanish song! just a generic rip off of Blondies Rapture and some other c-r-a-p, even their generic wannabe jazz is bad.If you have to watch this rent it, or borrow it.

Damon Wayans totally missed the mark and Lisa Kudrow just wasn't able to make it laugh. This movie you could easily skip...it's a stupid story about trying to get (an untalented) rapper to change who he is and show that he's not a threat to the kids, and Kudrow, who plays the daughter of the rich man who owns the record label that Wayans's character is associated with, just doesn't really deliver the kind of performance I thought she would. Basically this movie is something you can skip. Stupid storyline, dumb character, and not-so-good acting..I don't know about Damon Wayans but I do love Lisa Kudrow. If you want a great, funny performance by Kudrow, check out the movie \\"Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion\\", it's way better than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damon Wayans missed the mark","review":"I'm very happy I did not pay $8.75 to see this movie in theaters. The movie is one of those you watch when you have nothing better to do, and want to burn some brain cells. There were some moments you can't help but laugh at. Overall the movie is just okay, it's not grab your sides, and fall on the floor laugh, but there were some funny moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I was really disapointed with this movie, it had some funny moments but not enough.

It's great to see her successfully explore a role with a wider and more complex range than Hollywood has allowed her. That's what indies are for, I suppose. It's beautifully shot, and has a tricky and understated plot. No car crashes or nude scenes, but a film well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ceiling is Listening","review":"In one of Arthur Miller's more obscure works, he explores government limitations placed on a group of writers behind the Iron Curtain. The drama begins with the offstage seizure of a Russian novelist's manuscript by the KGB.Adrain, a visiting American writer, is alarmed by the seizure of Sigmund's novel and urges his colleague to seek asylum in the United States. Maya is the voice of reason yet she resides in the very problematic building that records the group's conversations.Motivations and affiliations are clouded as the story evolves. When the manuscript is returned to Sigmund, resolutions still seems to ellude the writers. I am not certain what to make from this work since I had difficulty digesting what I found to be a clunky ending. Regardless, the story is an interesting concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video.","review":"This tape really works specified areas.

The narrative is clearer than the over-rated recent movie. Altogether, a good read. I would like to see more from this author. Her bio says she is an experienced sailor but an unsuccessful fisher. One senses that the details of sailing down-wind and \\"foundering\\" are slightly beyond her grasp as she describes the strategies employed by the Andrea Gail on page 28.

The actual read itself is like watching film footage it's that real sounding. Fred ? I believe him... However it was a long time ago, people can and often do change. The principal point is that there are disturbed people on the loose out there with easy access to weapons and a warped bonding with fame which terrifies some high profile celebs etc. The book for me concludes that no-one won in the end, but even then, the fans (shortened term for fanatic I might add!)continue to haunt Yoko at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pie on fire!!","review":"The live tracks on this CD show why Humble Pie we so revered as a live act-totally smokin!

Gone is the sexual chemistry and tension between Hand Moody and his harem. Instead, he lurches from one boring sexual conquest to another without the freshness of his wits that made series 1 and 2 so enjoyable.Perhaps Hank Moody is still the same and I am the one growing up, but after watching series 3, I feel Hank Moody is an old dog who has no more new tricks. Other characters, such as Moody's agent, also become irritatingly unconvincing and irrelevant. I don't think this series will last too much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable- this show makes me weep for society","review":"Full disclosure- I have watched the prior seasons of this show, and found it somewhat entertaining, if unrealistic. This season though, is totally unwatchable. The show has become a sad caricature of itself and is so offensive I stopped watching after two episodes.

Normally this wouldn't be a problem, with a removable tray, but this tray will not budge. The entire thing heats up to an untouchable temperature on the OUTSIDE, so don't even think of trying to pull out that tray for at least half an hour. It toasts very unevenly, turns a bright pulsing orange inside which is just weird, and to top it all of the door is now not shutting tightly.It receives an extra star for working and not bursting into flames... yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I burn myself EVERY day on this toaster oven","review":"Very Unsafe!although it toasts fine, the outside (including the handle)gets extremely hot and it's virtually impossibleto retrieve your food without getting burned.if you choose to buy this you should alsoinvest in a good burn cream-you will need it for yourfingers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it says","review":"There's a big sticker on the top of the oven WARNING that it gets hot.

Very cheezy brittle plastic knob. Yes, you will get burned if you touch the outside of the oven so be careful. I put an oven thermometer in it and it only reached 325 degrees after 45 minutes.There's no taking it back at this point, but you should look at kitchenaide. My daughter has one and it's quick to heat up and toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"The problem with this product is that a few months after I purchased it, it wouldn't shut off by itself when the timer reached the end of the pre-set cycle. So for example, if you put it on toast, it would toast indefinitely (yet that's right, even until your bread was burned to a crisp and god-forbid your house was on fire). Oddly enough, it wouldn't do this all the time, sometimes it would shut off (with the requisite \\"ding!\\" and sometimes it would just keep going and going and going). To say that this is dangerous is an understatement. I would actually unplug the thing after each use because I was concerned about what else it would do. Definitely do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timer doesn't work","review":"I bought this cute little toaster oven because my old standby stopped working. This is one HUGE disappointment. Not only does it get super hot on the outside, but my unit came with a timer that didn't work! I should have learned my lesson when I tried it a few times, but kept hoping it was just me and not the unit. This morning I put two pieces of toast in, on the middle (light) setting, and before I knew it, the house was full of smoke and the timer hadn't budged. The toast was burned beyond recognition and about to catch fire. I'm returning it to the company because it is a piece of crap and I hope the replacement is not the same model. If it is, I'm going to call back and talk to a manager and get a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven Toasting, Almost Set Itself on Fire","review":"To say it gets hot is an understatement.

DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"toasts unevenly but burns fingers consistently","review":"This is clearly a product that has never been user-tested before going on the market, but I suppose \\"you get what you pay for\\". It's an affordable oven, not too ugly, and does an OK job. The primary annoying bit is the door handle and surfaces... they are a consistent source of finger burns (I now leave the door open after taking the food out and close it later in the day). The second equally annoying bit is the uneven toasting... if you don't turn your toast over and 180 degrees, it will burn on one end. You definitely need to monitor your food in this oven, especially since the toast settings on the knob are meaningless. And yes, the whole thing gets hot, but that's an easier annoyance to avoid. This toaster is essentially one step up from heating your food over an open flame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly ineffective at toasting and roasting","review":"The feature set on this seemed attractive. It's a pretty big space, comes with two racks, and even a rotisserie. \\"If it could do all that, then man it must be awesome!\\" is what we thought.But we were sorely mistaken: It is extremely inefficient at heating.Toast takes 10 minutes in \\"Toast\\" mode.No temperature indicator light: I've never seen the indicator light turn off, regardless of how long or how hot I want the oven to be. 40 min for 200 degrees? Light stays on. 5 min for 400 degrees? Light stays on. As a result, I'm forced to constantly watch the item and check the internal temp.Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Quality Control","review":"Our 15 year old Delonghi finally died and we bought the Emerson as a replacement. It seemed to have numerous features although its construction seemed rather light. Upon opening the box, the machine was literally falling apart with the outer edge bulging out from the front seam. As the device was securely packaged and there was no damage to the box, one must presume that there are no quality control inspectors on the Chinese assembly line where this machine was assembled. Needless to say, we never plugged it in and will be returning it right away. I wish Delonghi still was made in Italy and of the same quality as our previous model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty only skin-deep","review":"We bought this toaster because it looked nice, and because we figured, \\"hey, it's not like a toaster could be bad at toasting, right?\\"Absurdly enough, it is. The \\"toast\\" range of the timer is about 5 degrees of rotation - so between \\"off\\" and \\"dark toast\\" is about a centimeter. Furthermore, the knob is very imprecise (it \\"wiggles\\"), and if you turn it too little (in an attempt to have moderately-toasted bread) the timer doesn't start ticking, so you need to babysit the toaster or get ready for burnt toast. Or, you have to turn it further than you'd like and enjoy darker toast. Of course, even when the timer DOES start, it occasionally fails to turn off the heating element, and the toaster just stays on until you run into the kitchen because you smell burnt bread (or worse). A poor toaster is one thing; this is a fire hazard.It's a shame: I like the brushed metal looks and the compact size.

In addition it is a very poor toaster because the timer control (how you set the darkness of the toast) has such a wide range (to 30 mins) that the difference between untoasted and burnt is only a few degrees. The dials are very hard to read. Also the timer sometimes gets stuck on if you don't go to > 5mins then back .

BIG waste of money. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Don't buy this toaster oven! Timing controls are confusing and very hard to get right. One day my toast is undercooked, the next day it's burnt, and it's always cooked unevenly. The oven/toaster often doesn't turn off when the timer dings, burning the food. The heat doesn't shut off when the door opens, and the tray doesn't slide out when the door opens, causing burns. It gets incredibly hot on top too, which is dangerous. Mine's going to the dump.

Looks good on the counter top, and it appears to be a well built appliance, but when we started using it, we realized that it is not built very well. The convection fan was too noisy from day one -- it sounded like it was low quality China-made junk, which it apparently is. The control knobs do not work in some positions (noisy fan running, but producing no heat) so we learned which knob positions do work and have been using those settings. The oven still works, but the fan has gotten so noisy that we are now looking for a new one.

Series star Natasha Henstridge makes an all too short cameo in the beginning of the film, as she births a super hot alien/human hybrid with mating on her mind. Besides that, the rest of Species 3 comes off like a made for TV movie, with some bad FX but some nice T&A to go around. The acting is horrible, the story barely makes any sense, and there is hardly any redeeming factor to be found in the film. Fans of the surprise 1995 guilty pleasure hit and even it's lacking sequel may want to check this out since it does continue the tradition of what is in a Species movie: no plot, but a horde of gore and nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Species series devolves with this third installment","review":"I guess I shouldn't be so hard on this film because it is in it's place, being a straight-to-video production and all. But if MGM was so inclined to shortchange the funding for Species III, then why even waste the little money they threw at it? It's not like you could've really expected anything good to come out of it.Aside from the cheap effects, flying stuntmen in prosthetics who are obviously on wires, bad acting, (which is all excusable for the low-budget) is the horrendously boring storyline, which in an attempt to take the series in a new direction, fails completely (not excusable). Plus the climax was probably the least exciting climax I've seen for a while. And there's enough plot holes that this film could be a slice of Swiss cheese. This will be the last Species film I ever watch. I'm not going to waste money on Species 4, which will even have less money than this did to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh...","review":"Yeah, Species 3 has a hoochie and some decent blood and gore but it turns into a silly mess. This 3rd volume in the Species series is the cheapest of the three films and it shows.The plot of Species 3 centers around a crazy scientist who thinks growing planet-devouring alien monsters is a good idea.

Although he had massive hits worldwide, he was absent in the U.S. shelves. He had two albums overseas that sold big, but many people thought he was over with in America. With his latest song Feel, he proves that he isn't out without a doubt. The song has a vibe that is similar to several songs that Elton John recorded, and a strong vocal impression to go with it. The song just sometimes comes as a shocker, when everything else is overdubbed like Eminem, and Nelly. If you really want to hear a real \\"Bad Boy\\", I suggest you listen to Robbie Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...a book that actually makes sense!","review":"This book is great and is something you've got to have to understand ways to protect yourself and your partner and kids if you have them.

It has multimedia stuff on it. It has interviews with other musicians, a video clip, and more...very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is a re-issue of the album \\"Blue Trane.\\" An absolutely incredible horn section with Coltrane on Tenor Sax, Lee Morgan on Trumpet, and Curtis Fuller on Trombone. A must-have for Coltrane fans, this CD has a couple of alternate-tracks, that are a nice bonus, but nothing special. It is also enhanced with studio photos and works as a CD-ROM with an interview with Curtis Fuller, the only remaining member of the Blue Trane recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coltrane Rules","review":"This set was uncommonly affordable and features some of my favorite works by Coltrane. As others have mentioned the most severe drawback is the lack of session information, however the price cannot be beat and the sound quality is superb. Get this one while it lasts and then copy the first reviewers information. You'll be glad you did. He deserves a round of applause for his work. I am so pleased with this set, its an incredible testament to a great player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of the RVG Series","review":"My only qualm is that this release is part of the Rudy Van Gelder Remaster Series, though that isn't mentioned anywhere in the label information or in the product description. I bought it thinking it would be a European remastering. Not that the quality is bad or anything, it's just that some people have very strong opinions about the RVG series, and this should be made clear in the description so as not to mislead anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate ultimate?","review":"As it turns out, the ultimate blue train edition was not ultimate. I like the RVG remasters, but I can understand why someone wont like them. I like that these remasters are more on the 'bright' side than on the 'warmth' side. I traded my ultimate edition for this and I am happy I did. This is a masterpiece, but I am taking one star because of Blue Note endless list of reissues of the same material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great accessible jazz","review":"Absolutely love this album. I know most says that A Love Supreme is his best album, but I really think this one is. Every song on here is a classic and it is a bit more accessible to the everyday listener. A Love Supreme is a must for jazz lovers, Blue Train is a must for music lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Train Left the Station a Little Early","review":"Unless you're a John Coltane fanatic/collector, you'll miss nothing of importance by not passing on this really quite pedestrian blowing session. The lineup seems impressive enough at first glance, but the session wound up as a perfunctory-sounding changes run by all involved - - aside from John's solo on 'Moment's Notice,' there really isn't any magic here. Jay Jay Johnson muddles through the tunes on trombone along with Coltrane and the rest of the bunch, and the tunes themselves even seem to lack zip - - even the title track lacks drama, and clocks in at an obscene length for such a bland performance. I'm not saying it's terrible, and it does offer a few fine moments in addition to the reliably solid blue-note sound, but if you really want a Coltrane from this period, go with the Coltrane/Hartman album, or skip ahead to 'A Love Supreme,' by no means a straight ahead offering, but one with some real juice just the same. - - George McCoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"John Coltrane along with Miles Davis and the rest of them ruined jazz. They're just so random. I mean, come on, 5 year olds could play this music.Jazz was headed in the right direction with Glenn Miller and the rest of those brilliant, gifted pop-jazz musicians. Jazz then went spiraling into the ...for 40 years, until Kenny G came along with his perfect, soul-filled solos and such. Oh, he's just heavenly.So, as you can see, I have really poor taste and you should want to disassociate yourself from me and buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even consider it.","review":"For a long time, many people have had the idea that what is termed \\"improvisation\\" in the music business is really just as much of a hoax as \\"avant-garde\\" is, and they're right. An early recording such as this one proves that it's been that way for quite a while. \\"Improvisation,\\" in case you didn't know, is the making up of music in the studio or live on the spot! The ENTIRE CD consists of this \\"improvisation!\\" I guess this \\"music\\" doesn't require any sort of thought put into it. It doesn't matter what the end result is, because music requires composition, and \\"improvisation\\" is not composition. Thus, this is not jazz, and it certainly isn't music--regardless of what so-called \\"experts\\" might say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz doesn't get any better than this!","review":"This is my favorite Coltrane album, even over the excellent Giant Steps. Actually, I'd have to say that it's my favorite jazz album overall...ever-so-slightly nudging aside Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, which is phenomenal in its own right. It's just that good. There's not much I could say that hasn't already been said better by other reviewers here. The bottom line for me is that this album is a masterpiece that never gets stale - my copy of this version is ten years old and still spins frequently (though it has moved over to the iPod). Do your ears a favor and give this one a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Upgrade","review":"Since anyone considering buying this probably knows what a great album it is, I am writing this simply to address the Hybrid SACD version of Blue Train. This is one of those albums that I, personally, have spent the money to upgrade 3 times (it's THAT good).While I can't speak for the recent RVG Series reissue, I can say that this version sounds considerably better than the 1996 reissue, The Ultimate Blue Train--bass is richer, drums crisper and overall live feel of the recording is unprecedented. If are considering buying the RVG remaster, why not spend a few dollars more and get this Hybrid SACD since it plays in both Super Audio and regulars CD players. It's definitely worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest jazz-album I've heard in my lifetime","review":"I'm a 16-year old hip-hop head who's just begun to love jazz. Everytime I listen to John Coltrane's music I feel inspiration. When I get home from a long day at school I put \\"Blue Train\\" in my CD-player. Listening to it clears my mind. John Coltrane truly was one of the greatest musicians of all-time, and \\"Blue Train\\" truly deserves the title \\"classic\\". Jazz is not very popular among young people today, but everyone who says that jazz sucks should do like me and listen to this masterpiece. It surely will change their opinion on this wonderful genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coltrane is awesome!!","review":"This is one of my favorite jazz CDs. The title song 'Blue Train' is sort of eerie with nice harmony notes in it. 'Moment's Notice' is a good tune also. 'Locomotion' (my personal favorite) is a nice upbeat tune. The theme is a repeated pattern, with Coltrane taking off on short solo breaks and then goes into his actual solo. After solos by Curtis Fuller, Lee Morgan, Kenny Drew, and \\"Philly\\" Joe Jones, it goes back to the theme. 'I'm Old Fashioned' is a laid back song, good to listen to when you're trying to relax. 'Lazy Bird' is simply an excellent song. This is a great CD, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive, decently well made","review":"Good value, I prefer this to a tie rack and there don't seem to be many other options. It looks great on a dresser as it shows of your collection in a sort of sartorial way.The only problem is that there is a brass brand plate screwed on the front. They are not put on their with any precision, I have two boxes and its easy to see that one is crooked (or they both are).For a item designed to organize men's ties this is a very unfortunate, ironic oversight.That said it's still recommended at this price. I may remove the plates and put on some of my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect stories for bedtime scares","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed these short stories. They're the perfect length, each about 10 to 15 pages, just enough to build up the story and knock it over with a classic Bradbury twist. My favorite stories for far are \\"The Burning Man\\", which asks the reader to reexamine his or her own prejudices in the setting of a typical lone road hitchhiker horror story, and \\"The Perfect Murder\\" which shows that time is the ultimate judge and jury."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened?","review":"A friend of mine said it best... Caution would be a triumph for any other band, but its not the Hot Water Music that everyone knows. They completely changed their sound, and personally, I don't like it as much. No breakdowns, no dueling vocals, no fun. This sounds very much like A Flight and Crash, but is better. I like it a lot, I just pretend its someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"legends!","review":"I recently bought this album cuz ive been hearing so much hype about it! and i wasnt let down, right from \\"remedy\\" to \\"the end\\" its awesome, ide previously bought \\"a flight and a crash\\" in a sale and i thought its was ok, but caution is definetly better, an amazing album by a legendery band, definetly recommended to any true fan of punk!This album is not trash as previoulsy stated by another reviewer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THis is not Hot Water Music","review":"definitely the worst Hot Water Music ever. After Forever and Counting they lost all the energy they had in their earlier CDs. I dont understand what happened to them. Maybe they didn't like being labeled as an emo band and they decided to go punk rock. I don't know if anyone noticed but they never slow it down anymore, every song is the same exact speed and the bassist and drummer do not get to show off their skills like they used to. I am so dissapointed, things have gone down ever since they signed with Epitaph and I probably will not buy their next album. Ht Water Music was my favirote band and they still have an impact on my tastes in music...but that is why this album dissapoints me so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure trash","review":"i bet they didnt even write any of this album. brett probably wrote it for them. screw you epitaph!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why was the piano player arrested?","review":"\\"Because he got into treble.\\" Tirez Sur Le Pianiste or \\"Shoot the Piano Player\\" is an interesting Noir tale about a piano player and his trouble making brother. When cornered to make difficult decisions he retreates to the only thing that's never let him down. His piano. There's Love, Gangsters, Shoot Outs, and a Stabbing. Can you ask for much more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"This is a brilliant commentary on the short sidedness of typical genre pics in how they ignore the reality of the everyday-- especially that gangsters are run of the mill like the rest of us. Another astute New Wave feminist style criticism, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I LOVE AL'S VOICE WHEN HE WAS WITH THE WILD WEEDS. i WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ALBUM. i COULDN'T FIND ONE SONG THAT I LIKED. A WASTE OF MONEY, IN MY OPINION"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Father's voice is very evident in this book!","review":"Yes, the voice of the Father...the voice I very much needed to hear. Dean Sherman writes with frankness, eloquence, and tender-heartedness on the subject of relationships. His wisdom is practical and profound. He expounds on the Scriptures' admonitions regarding sexual immorality and general immorality in a way that convicts without condemning. This book showed me that I had such a low view and goal for relationships. The Father's purpose and view of them is so much greater and better and higher! He desires so much better for all of us than we do. It is eye- and heart-opening and powerfully transforming knowledge! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful guide to life after integration","review":"This book is a realistic guide to life after integration written by a former multiple and her therapist.The most helpful part was a discussion of the effects of missing the developmental stages of childhood. This prompted ideas to promote recovery.Helpful for other multiples, and a testimony to the courage of the survivor author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First released Vlad novel","review":"I enjoy Dragons, but most Fantasy novels seem to play these as too generic and boring or too extremely different yet uninteresting or unbelievable - and though the dragon is NTO the center of the story, it is the companion of the main character and a fun insert to the novel and dialog - having the quirky asides with his dragon with their mental link allows for some information dump in small doses with humor thrown in to make you like that character more - quite honestly I don't think that I would have liked the character Vlad without the conversations with his dragon - the rest of the tale is straightforward with little surprises and a ton of flashbacks within the chapters, so be prepared to have to change gears rapidly and repeatedly for this jump after jump within the story - because of the amount of flashbacks I gave this story a four out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"Fourth in the series. It's an odd series--it's all out of chronological order. In fact, this one, if I'm not mistaken, takes place before any of the previous books in the series. Yet, if I'd read it before the others, I probably wouldn't have liked it.As it is, I liked it a little less, because the rapid bouncing back and forth between 3 timelines kept me from really getting involved in any of the stories. Still, since I'd already met Vlad and the other characters, I did find it interesting to find out how he met and hired his right-hand man, Kragar; how he met Morrolan and Aliera and Sethra Lavode; and what really happened in the Paths of the Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good. See.","review":"The thing is, I got sick of fantasy because I got sick of Tall Beautiful Elves and Short Grumpy Dwarves and Nasty Old Ogres and Absolute Good and Evil. Get rid of it all, keep the magic, rub the entire story with ashes to get that nice grey look, and add a whole lot of very funny lines, and you get something I can really get into.If it sounds like something you could really get into, too, than definitely pick this book up, and introduce yourself to this series.Oh, one thing? I was lying a bit about the Elves. But only a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vlad Taltos's Early Mistakes.","review":"Steven Brust appears to be a man with an addiction to bad one-liners and a whimsical sense of humour. This book contains plenty of both. I've always enjoyed stories with chapter titles or smaller tales to begin each chapter with, and this book surprised and delighted me by catering to that small pleasure. The characters are almost always easy enough to like and understand and the authors style gives them a slightly mad but sincere quality. Vlad Taltos's business difficulties are always amusing, often touching and well worth reading about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing CD","review":"This cd was not what I expected. Poorly engineered and lackluster performances by two Hammond B-3 giants. I had the album years ago, so maybe my tastes have changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great!!!!","review":"I think that that is one of my favorite or \\"the favorite\\" album i got or i did ever heard. Why? Everything is so perfect. From sound, production, swicthing tempos from fast to slow. Its also very dark and somewhat \\"creepy\\". It s also critical to politics, worlds... I think that this is the best album of His Hero is Gone. I have beautifuly drawed booklet. In few words: its not just highly recomended, if you dont have this album and I want to be in (or you think you are)punk/hardcore, you cant be if you dont have this album. Ave triumvirator!!!!

It is a small, but powerful book that causes you to examine your spiritual life. Not exactly biblical in content, but along those lines. This book is a little bit more generous than the bible in that humanity is given a second chance. This book cannot be put down once you open it. It is a novel about a farmer and his family and what happens to the earth once God has had enough of our brutality and hatred of one another. Written almost a half decade ago, it is very prophetic and timely. Excellent. Must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your sins and Mine","review":"I read this book 45 years ago. I have shared it with friends and pastors. It really makes you think about life and where you are going with faith. I think the most important page was 200.

I also had quick service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Edition","review":"This edition is really quite awful. I'm only a few pages in and it is already rife with spelling errors and mid-sentence paragraph breaks. I made a bad decision trying to save a dollar or two when I could have purchased an edition that was actually legible."},{"rating":"2","title":"prophetic","review":"Whether you agree with Freud's psychoanalytical theories or not, there is no dispute over his intelligence, insight, and his eloquence. In this short book, he explains the conflicts civilization process created in individual psyche. Basically, he argues that the civilization's aim in uniting community in order to avoid sources of suffering imposes restrictions on individual liberty (of origin is libido--pleasure principle) which becomes the main source of discontents. He also warns about the danger of a powerful group with control over the force of nature which can potentially eliminate some human beings, which is rather prophetic considering the Nazi's presenct in Europe shortly after publication of this book. His logic is very tight according his main theories (structural theory, mainly), and writing is precise and eloquent. Just Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, as ordered","review":"Purchased for my Father's train set.

It has good photography, a storm, cats that meow hauntingly, and even some humor.

You can't go wrong with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT THE KARLOFF/LUGOSI CLASSIC! THIS IS AVAILABLE ON DVD!","review":"I never saw this film growing up and I'm sure it was because of the confusion with the earlier classic Universal film with the same title starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi(1934). 'The Black Cat' listed here is a murder/mystery/comedy from 1941. The film stars Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi in a fun supporting character. I did like this fun film full of secret passages and things that go bump in the night. This is available on DVD on a 2 disc set called Universal Horror and it is a limited release only sold at Best Buy. The DVD transfers for all 5 of the films are very good. I rate this film 3 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meow","review":"Years later, Gale Sondergaard described this as the kind of movie actors do strictly for the money.

Therefore, we haven't even enjoyed 1 day in it, and I have planned a birthday party for my son 7 days away. Right now I am not a happy camper. Why? I spent over $100 leveling the ground, I have 5,582 gallons of water used, and I have a manufacturing leak. A leak that wasn't my fault. So I have to go back to the store and buy another one, level the ground at the new spot, transfer the water, then take the defeated one back for a return. Hopefully I will be a happy camper once I finish and I will be back to update my review rating. Think of me in this Texas heat while enjoying yours. (lol)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FIND!","review":"I just purchased this pool summer 04 and we love it. It is much bigger than I had estimated so I was pleasantly surprised. The box is very heavy and it took me a while to get everything out of the box. It took me only 45 minutes to put it up. It is really durable and I am hoping to get a couple of years out of it. The best thing is that it is a complete pool set. It has a pool mat (which I put sand under)for liner protection, ladder, pump, pool cover and a vacuum with changable strainer head. For the price you just can't beat it.Be sure the ground is level. My pool is tilted slightly and it caused the liner to streatch and buldge more on one side. It says it is 36 inches deep so I assumed it would come up to my daughter's chest but it actually comes up to her chin! When this one goes I will purchase the 24' x 48\\" size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Stunning","review":"This rates in my top ten albums of all time. No other album has touched my soul like this one. I was living and working in London the year this was released (1998) and I read a review somewhere that described it as \\"Crowded House for Intellectuals\\". Nothing could be more accurate. This is an album that will make you celebrate everything in life the one day and philosophise and wallow the next. It hits a raw nerve every time - no matter how many times you have heard it before. I went on to buy all the singles from this album and every time I was pleasantly surprised - they have b-sides that are absolutely stunning. What a pity they went their separate ways after the second album, but I can say that they have sure left their mark in my heart and my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD of 1998","review":"I too learned of UT through CMJ and bought the import prior to the US release. I find the music quite beautiful and did from the start. Yes, it is melancholy, but that is so often appropriate. The EP \\"Higher than Reason\\" has a slightly less melancholy track (the third)for those who are interested in hearing a more upbeat side of UT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivo Does it again","review":"It seemed like I was waiting in vain for another This Mortal Coil album to come out after \\"Blood\\". When the first Hope Blister album was released, I was a little sceptical. (Can one be blamed with a title such as The Hope Blister?) While it lacks the epic proportions of \\"Filigree & Shadow\\" or \\"Blood\\" it hits such an intimate level, that it becomes it's own mesmerizing creature. Like \\"Filigree & Shadow\\" to This Mortal Coil, \\"Underarms\\" continues with the intimate reflection of \\"Smile's OK\\" for the Hope Blister. I can only hope that there will be a third act to Ivo Watts-Russell's new love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Compilation! My best Christmas music pick.","review":"This rocking CD is a must have for all Alternative Music fans. The Supertones put the \\"JOY\\" back into \\"Joy To the World\\" with their ska version of this classic tune. Some notable new tunes are a grunge sounding \\"Evergreen\\" by Switchfoot and 80's influenced \\"Asia Minor\\" by Fold Zandura both of which are very good.Two skips are \\"Heaven's Got A Baby\\" by Sarah Masen and \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\" by Bon Voyage. These two just don't match the feel of the rest of the CD. However, they are no reason to pass up the whole.They saved the best for last with \\"Saviour of the Fools\\" by Puller. So sad to see this band break up, because this song is incredible! Soulful lyrics mix with driving guitar lines to produce an unforgettable song.I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made no sense","review":"This book made no sense to me when I read it. I dug into the book knowing it was mostly going to be hallucinogenic ramblings and stuff, but there was no real plot to speak of. The writing was all over the place, sometimes telling a vague story of how law enforcement was after them for drug trafficking and then suddenly drifting into random nonsense and bloated symbolism. I kept wishing the author would come out of the stoned stupor the whole book felt like it was written in and actually continue with the half-way interesting escape from the law plot, but it kept making less and less sense that I could not ever see picking it up again to give it a second try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky to get 1 star","review":"Shocking book.
