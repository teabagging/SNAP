Centering on six gorgeous women, many of the episodes hit emotional highs by a mix of intelligent dialog and summation narration. One episode in particular - I think that it was #13 entitled \\"The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened\\" - was worth the price of admission alone. It was heart-wrenching throughout, centering on a handyman's life and his influence upon the lives of the six leading ladies.

More like The Hard Times Edition","review":"I personally love Desperate Housewives. I had a huge problem with Season 5, but because of my love for the show, I still have an interest in it, and I'm willing to give it another chance for Season 6. I agree with a lot of the reviewers about the repetitive story lines and lackluster plots. Everything seemed to be put together in a very sloppy manner and quickly. The 100th Episode should have been amazing, instead it was just ok. Plus, who in the world was Eli Scruggs? Nothing was extremely interesting about this season and the mystery was boring and dragged out way to long. If it was 13 or 14 episodes then maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. But I went through this season begging for it to wrap up. I enjoyed the mysteries from seasons 1-4 and then in 5, it was like the writers gave up. I don't see how anyone can say they absolutely loved this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started off strong, fell apart by the end.","review":"Desperate Housewives - The Complete Fifth Season saw the show jumping 5 years ahead, I think it was a good change but by the end of the season, the storylines started getting ridiculous. I liked how Gaby lost her sex appeal and Carlos got his sight back. I didn't care for the whole Mike and Katherine new couple situation, they have no chemistry! Felicity Huffman is my favorite actress on this show but I didn't like how her character became so boring. I was very upset when Creator Marc Cherry killed off Edie played brilliantly by Nicolette Sheridan. The best episode of the season is the last one Sheridan is in, she was a force to be wrecken with, and she proved she could act - the show doesn't feel the same without her. I didn't care for the finale, Lynette is pregnant with twins again, c'mon!! Hopefully Season 6 will be the best year yet. 4 stars for Season 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desperate houswives season five","review":"It was a good season very excited.I was hooked and had to finish the whole season in two days.Now I can't wait till the next season comes out.I live in germany so it feels like forever for the season so show up out here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as addictive as always.","review":"With the whole month of December being re-runs because of holiday specials, I kinda forgot what had happened so I didn't watch anymore until the dvd set came out.

We ended up watching the whole season in 3 days. That is what happened when I bought season 4 as well. But I ended up watching that in one day. The show is just as good as it used to be. Just because some of the characters have changed and matured doesn't mean that the storylines are weak or predictable. I loved this season just as much as I have loved all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! They're back....","review":"Gotta love those desperate housewives!

Great photos and interesting stories.Not a \\"how to\\" but a \\"why to\\" book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Regulations needed","review":"A fascinating and, at times, challenging book, written in the spirit of 'Liar's Poker' but with more detail. Partnoy describes the damaging and borderline criminal practices of derivatives salesmen and the huge investment banks that drive their performance. One would think that the people described in this book couldn't have agreed more with Willie Horton; it's just that poor old down and out Willie was limited to the crude use of a pistol while these well-paid gents had derivatives as their weapons! Indeed, America will likely institute hand-gun control before it passes the necessary laws regulating derivative trading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another take on the goings-on of Wall Street","review":"Frank Partnoy worked in Wall Street as a salesman, well selling things that he did not understand although he performed his job as though he understood. In this book he narrates his experiences, not only of the office activities but also some of the things that they did after work. This is an interesting book along the lines of similar books like: \\"Liar's Poker\\", \\"When Genius Failed\\" to mention just two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten years later","review":"The book was published in 1997. I found it and read it in a day. Now that we are in the midst of another derivative crisis and we are watching our politicians on both sides of the aisle falling over themselves to bail out Wall Street under the guise of helping the homeowner....I am thinking that this book should have been required reading before the more recent crisis. I don't know if Bernanke has read this but it might be a good idea for him. If the characters and motivation and compensation of these clowns are anything like this book suggests, and the news media suggest it is the case, the average American should be outraged. These salesmen have even forced the US Government to do their will. In any event a short, quick, well written and humorous read that seems strangely prescient."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating candour","review":"This book provides an excellent expose of the derivatives and investment banking trade in surprising detail. I found the step-by-step explanations of how the derivative products were engineered and where the banks were making money most fascinating! The author has confirmed my personal belief that investment banks,just like the 'banker' in a casino,clearly has the upperhand when it comes to derivatives trading. Play at your own risk.Finally, if anyone doubts any of the facts presented, one bank (mentioned in the book) was recently suspended in Japan for engaging in one of the very derivatives scams highlighted by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awaken your senses","review":"Call it what you want. \\"entertaining dirt disher\\" is one opinion.Read this book and decide for yourself if it is bogus or fictional.If you decide not, we have a huge problem staring down the throat of well known billion dollar losses. And ask: how could that happen?How could it be that some guy could show the corelation between blow-ups and derivative trades.Facinating read, totally in-your-face if you are in that business.Even if you think this is all bullpucky, it is a great read by a very smart author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hate letter from a writer to his ex-colleagues","review":"The writer clearly detests his Morgan Stanley ex-colleagues at a deeply personal level. The book is not only void of a single kind remark on any of them, but it also contains a number of surprising low-level shots. For example, by the end of the book we are given the extension number of the derivatives division at Morgan Stanley. What purpose can that serve? In fact, some of people that he does his best to portray in a most damaging manner, come through as normal though rather eccentric people operating under great stress. Finally, I felt that the writer has oversimplified derivatives beyond recognition. Yes, there is more to bonds than \\"positive convexity is good\\"! On the other hand, I enjoyed reading the descriptions of certain derivatives products if only because such information is not available in the textbooks. All in all, my impression is that this was an attempt to write a second 'Liar's Poker', but the attempt is not successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for People in Derivatives","review":"In contrast to Wall Street Poker, this book is about the world of derivatives. Definitely the best book available in this field. Frank succeeds in explaining the life on the trading floor very well. Very readable! There's only one point: Frank remarks that a salesman doesn't have to understand Hull's book to be successful. Well, I disagree. A derivative salesman's knowledge should go beyond that in order to advise clients properly...(the sales of today might not fully understand Willmott's book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"This is a great film in that it takes on a never-ending issue of racism -done wonderfully by Wm Macy, Laura Dern and others. Arthur Miller's ideas were presented beautifully; bringing out self-searching feelings in all of us. Another example that a film can be great without car-chases, bombs, and the typical needless krap of Hollywood. It is what a film should be: plot, good acting, and the effect of deep thought both inside yourself and of the \\"bigger picture\\" in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shows Jewish discrimination in the USA Early on","review":"The Mishkan I attend recomended it , Great Movie how theJewish people were discriminated against by many in the USA early on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor movie on a serious subject","review":"Let me first start with the obvious: antisemitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of Jews. That said, the problem with this movie is that it views the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever to Jews outside of Israel - as a not very different place from Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the movie is about a Christian man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses!. A number of very nasty things happen to him after that (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, the neighbors won't talk to him, all ending up in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's self pitying, patronizing novels, the sort that gave liberalism a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but VERY techincal","review":"If you are looking for video of actual bomb tests, this video is NOT for you.

Some provide very good information on how energy is propogated and released from a nuclear bomb ignition and explains how the energy released seems apparantly greater than what scientists believed the bomb originally contained. What was actually happening was a confluence of shock waves that magnified the force of the bomb itself.Although the Cold War is over, we still see countries developing nukes. India and Pakistan developed them and our Intelligence Services exclaimed \\"HOW THE *** DID THAT HAPPEN????\\" well, now we hear Iran is developing nuclear weapons.Or are they?Well, our fearful leaders say they are.These videos give a glimpse of our own nuclear history through our own historical materials and provide an insight into this chapter of American military history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound & short playlist.","review":"The song selection is ok, but it only includes 10 tracks, clocking in at under 30 minutes. Also, the sound on this set is terrible. But that should be expected coming from some random import company, who only copy old 78's, cassettes, or previously released legitimate CD's. If you want a Bing Crosby Christmas CD, there are many to choose from that are produced by Decca/MCA (Crosby's recording company) that are in much better sound and include far more songs.

If you picked up this DVD you wouldn't think that because the season is not in it's Original Aspect Ratio of 16:9, but once again in a dreary 1.33:1 full frame. This far into the lifespan of DVD there is NO EXCUSE for releasing a title outside of its OAR. It would appear this is some manner of underhanded ploy to force people to buy the Blu-ray in order to watch this season as intended, and I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Show, So-So Season","review":"The last two seasons of Scrubs have clearly been plagued with bad luck, whether it's the Writer's Strike, network switching, actors' contracts ending, or just a lack of funding for an incredible cult television program. This season, unfortunately, was bad enough to make me stop watching for several weeks. It's far from the funniest season of Scrubs, which I'd say occured around Season 5, but a bad season of Scrubs is the eqivalent of a good season for most sitcoms out now. Scrubs is by far one of the more creatively funny shows out there and deserves way more recognition that it has recieved. If you're truly a fan of Scrubs, buy this season; although it's a lackluster season as a whole, a couple of the episodes (including the absolutely perfect finale) make it worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad decline in a great, under rated series.","review":"Scrubs was a great series, never got the respect it deserved. But this season just is sad. Not really funny or touching like it was. Even all the actors can't be bothered to show up for all the episodes.One note, may be me, season 8 wasn't really the final season, it was back for season 9, but they may have a point, not the same show with characters gone but name the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable DVD Aspect Ratio","review":"I have a Sony upconverting DVD player and Sony XBR LCD. The XBR has features which automatically adjust the display based on the signal coming in from the cable box, PC, DVD, etc. This works flawlessly on everything. Every DVD set I have, the PC, every cable TV program--everything, except Scrubs Season 8. Even when I disable the automatic features, this set still looks too wide--stretched.Bad aspect ratio drives me nuts--actually makes me ill--and I can't watch this set. I don't know what they did in transferring this season to DVD. Even 10 year old TV shows (West Wing, STNG, others) including all the older Scrubs box sets are fine.Either they messed up, or did it on purpose to get some other sale, but it's going back to Amazon tomorrow. Not satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it........","review":"My all-time favorite show.....period! Alas, this show ran it's course but what a great show it was.

This season was utter crap. The writing was horrible, the actors seemed bored and I applaud NBC for dropping this dead show.The \\"new\\" characters are pathetic imitations of whats already been done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best season of Scrubs!","review":"Season 8 was phenomenal and a great ending to the show (since I don't count season 9 as the same show as it has a different main character and half the original cast is gone in this season).

I could not believe that such good heat gun can be had for such a small price. I use it for reflowing soldering on printed circuit boards and the adjustable heat works great there. Even in the low temp setting the heat comes up pretty fast. A temperature scale would be nice on the gun but that would probably make it more expensive. If measuring temp is so important to you, get an inexpensive multimeter that comes with temp probe and use that. Such independent measurement would be more reliable anyway. I have not tried to use the gun for paint peeling but I'm sure that in high setting the gun packs plenty of heat for such jobs as well.I was also impressed by the fast shipment of this heat gun. It can't get much better than this, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"works, but not for me","review":"This is a great heat gun that has many heat temperature settings and blows extremely hot air.

If it does burn out I'll buy another for the price but don't anticipate that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Price","review":"This heat gun has a few fairly annoying flaws, the most annoying of which is that the temperature control is a big dial at the back with no numbers, so you never actually know the precise or even rough temperature of the air. It's also larger and more cumbersome than any other heat gun I've used.BUT it is cheap, and it works for everything I've used it for. The problems are an inconvenience only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not heat up","review":"I returned this item because the heat adjustment did not work and it blew only lukewarm air.

The variable heat control is a nice plus. I've not tried it, but I'd bet the heat is high enough to melt paint for stripping. Can be set low enough to not melt thin plastic. Did a great job on shrink tube. Quick heat up, nice hanger on base of handle. Only down side I can mention is that it won't stand up on its own and comes with no holder for when you need to set it down between uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned it","review":"while this fondue set looks cool and very functional, the cheese and chocolate burn and stick to the bottom of the stainless steel pan, even with just a low flame. i returned mine after one use as it was too much effort to clean the pot afterwards...besides, with the amount of calories that go into fondues, i would have never used it often enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is wanted by FBI","review":"I'm glad to see the reviews for this book are old.

It is filled with useful information and it is displayed in a readable format for even the novice Shakespeare reader. I believe Dr. Harold Bloom is a literary genius and not just a critic. He knows how to display the information without it becoming too concrete and provides information like characters, plots, subtext, and other criticism of Shakespeare's works. Dr. Bloom is our country's leading Shakespeare expert perhaps he is the worldwide's most well known literary critic. It is because he has made an industry of helping others become literary readers without being overburdened with too much information."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Health Book ever!","review":"Once you purchase the African Holistic Health Book you would never have a need to purchase another Health book.

It is ideal for the black aspirant of complete health (wholistic), while good for people of all races. It covers a wide variety of material concerning holistic health, human existance, psychology, behaviour, and also differnces between races. One might read this book and think that L.Afrika is racist, but the concept of racism is an illusion of the mind imposed unto us by our own ignorance of Self, and backed by a corrupt system of injustice.Re. the previous reviewer:1-2 cups of salt??????? Are you insane??? That had to have been a miss-print. For you to judge the book off of that miss-information shows your complete lack of judgement and common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOTEP HEALING!","review":"The information Dr. Afrika presents is a must read for all melaniated original peoples. Dr. Afrika presents verifiable, documented scientific research evidence for the causes and remedies specific to BLAK peoples specific health concerns. Dr. Afrika sites european-centric scholarship to prove his points of the origins of westernized sicknesses. The language he uses is deliberate to initiate the healing process thru mental and spiritual agitation of the reader to move toward taking control of one's health. As to the negative reviews by white caucasian persons, your responses are typical of the denial of being the cause of the problems of imbalance in the world. All in all, this is a fantastic work that needs to be in every BLAK persons home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR ANYONE INTO HOLISTIC AND NATURAL LIVING","review":"I love, love, LOVE this book.

It's written completely in a disorganized fashion, replete with errors, and full of commentary about the \\"bi-polar psychosis that whites have to uphold their white supremacy\\". What that has to do with holistic health, I have no idea. Oh, and healthy women are not supposed to menstruate, other than every 3 years - the \\"solar\\" cycle, not the \\"lunar\\" one (why wouldn't a solar cycle be a year?). And he goes on for a couple pages about the dangers of condoms, even though unprotected sex can be far more dangerous.I was disappointed. I'm sure that there is a lot of wisdom in African holistic health, but it won't be found in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!","review":"This is surely the worst book I have ever read. I was hoping to find information about African herbs, and african alternative medicine, but instead I found a book which does not provide any valuable information. First, the author is extremely ignorant, and racist. He believes that white people descend from apes while blacks don't. Almost every sentence the author wrote is inaccurate and reveals extreme ignorance. Some examples are that women that are swallow semen become infertile, and that menstruation is an abnormal disease that can be cured.Don't do the same mistake that I did!

Do not buy this book, unless you want to laugh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Most books can be compared to other books; this one stands alone. I have never read anything like it. The author has a clear,lyric but unobtrusive prose style and the ability to cast himself back in time to capture the flavor of American life decade by decade since 1900. It's like looking at a collection of old Life magazines in the attic, only better. Really makes you feel you were there. Buy it and you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What if Felt Like Reading this book","review":"This is a concise history of the American Cultures exhibited in the 20th century. The author uses ten chapters, one for each decade. He displayed his liberal point of view and considered mostly the extreme radical happenings to paint his cultural pictures. It's not that his illustrations did not occur but lots of other moderate life styles were also progressing. He fails to even mention these. I have lived through most of the twentiety century and I did not see \\"myself\\" portrayed in any of these chapters. Maybe I did not \\"live\\" with his crowd. The author, a feature writer and editor for the Washington Post, uses a telegraphic type of prose which sometimes becomes annoying. Generally speaking, I did not enjoy the book. It was not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but not executed well","review":"A superficial look at a century of decades of American life, in which the author does not effectively manage to project beyond his own viewpoint. What was it like for a woman to vote for the first time? Don't look in this book to learn that, this major historical event is not even mentioned. Instead for the twenties we have a chapter about a silly drunken flapper; it was hard to imagine a woman like that ever drew a single breath of life. In fact, the one dimensional stereotyped portraits in nearly all the chapters was difficult for me to get past, as was the absence of hope and strength of character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finely observed but....","review":"A fascinating gathering of some of the trivial details thatreally DO describe what it felt like (or must have felt like).

Judging by the book's size and... pricetag one might conclude the defining event of the 20th centurywas inflation.

It's an easy read - you can get through the entire thing in an evening. It's organized into a chapter per decade. The author appears to hate every single decade. The commentary is snide, with little underhanded digs here and there. With each decade, life appears to get worse and worse. Why would anyone want to read that? From the title of the book, I expected some documentation of people's feelings of what each decade really felt like, as reported by an unbiased outsider. That is not what this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this here!!","review":"I can't believe that this merchant is selling this for over $44!!!

Although Waltman wonderfully develops the main character, Gary, he does not make him very likable. He drives around in a stolen car with his friend Wilson, trying to be a good boyfriend, and a good son even thought his girlfriend has issues, and his father is an alcoholic, with a twister temper. Gary also feels trapped inside his small Indiana town. A teacher Mr. Roverson, who is constantly taunted about having an affair with a student gives therapy to Gary, and helps him with his prudish girlfriend Lauryn, and his father's temper. The teachers own love for his student Lindy, extends the credibility. In the book, baffled with life, Gary quotes \\"Sometimes it's like I don't have a will of my own.\\" This book is realistic, about paying to get free, and the price you must pay to achieve freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Not to Write","review":"I'm this novel's ideal demographic: I've lived in Austin for three decades; I love and hate the place; I have a degree from UT; and I'm certainly a card-carrying liberal, one who has even subscribed to The Nation (to which the author has contributed). But I loathed this book. Not because it wasn't true to \\"my\\" city, but because its author thought she had to write Art instead of telling a story. By page 90, I was wondering if the story would ever begin -- or if I'd ever find anything to admire in the person who, I surmised after many choppy chapters, was the main character. But there was nothing to admire or to even vaguely like in the struggling Austin Chronicle journalist who is the protagonist. I did make it to the end of the book, because of the odd moment of funny truthfulness or because some vivid detail was keenly rendered. For that, I give the novel one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-Read Debut of the Fall Season","review":"Olsson has written a witty, sophisticated novel that promises to entertain native Austinites as well as readers outside the boundaries of Texas' familiar capital. Beyond delving into the political nuances of state politics, Olsson possesses a sharp eye for affairs of the human heart. Her scenes and dialogue between her characters resonate with truth, and often with smirks and laughter... whether it's between Nick Lasseter, the half-hearted, left-leaning journalist, and his inebriated Uncle Bones, a washed-up lobbyist... or a brief exchange between assemblywoman Beverly Flintic and a grocery store cashier. Also, it's not any debut novelist who can seamlessly shift between characters' points of view as well as moments in time. Olsson makes something seem easy, which isn't easy at all. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost three stars-","review":"The second half of this novel was certainly better than the first. The author was at her best in scenes heavy in dialogue. The narrative tended to wander off laden with too much description that really added nothing to the story or the characters. I don't think the overall spirit and vibe of Austin came out although I could be mistaken since I have only visited the city and have never lived there. The writing got stronger as the story went on but over all I never saw much pint in the whole thing. I did find the characters interesting enough to keep reading. Not the greatest of novels, but certainly not the worst. The author had potential so I would be open to reading future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly for Generations X & Y","review":"Waterloo is very well written, but is peopled by the most boring losers I have read about in years!

Bland, boring, unconvincing. There's nothing wrong with having characters who are slackers, but it might help to have the slackers be interesting or even a little nuts. Nothing is at stake in this book--for anybody. And Olsson apparently has no sense of humor--her charactrers are all very grim and very earnest, and she's very condescending not only the poor boring dopes that inhabit her book but to her readers as well. Very sad. And why use \\"Waterloo\\" for Austin--especially since the book jacket says \\"Austin\\"? Stupid.The sound you hear is Billy Lee Brammer spinning in his grave...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross between Danielle Steele and Nick Hornby","review":"I could not get interested in this book. Distill this book down and it's Nick Hornby (slackers looking for meaning) meets Danielle Steele (affairs and intrigue). Boring and it doesn't bring anything new to the table.And why not just be blatant about the city? I can't grasp the point of using the skeleton of the city, yet renaming EVERYTHING...even Town Lake. I mean, it's not like the river is going to sue you for using its name. Good grief. If the goal was to make the Austin setting into Everytown, USA, why go to such efforts to describe Austin? But the great thing about Austin is precisely that it is NOT just anywhere. Go with it, girl!Regardless of any \\"government-industrial-media complex\\" this book might explore, the root of any good book is an interesting plot and compelling characters--neither of which exist in this book.

It is an easy read, and it was filled with insight and with clear exposition on issues that had been bothering me. I kept phoning my father, with whom I have deep theological dialogues, and reading passages to him for us to discuss.

It is an emotional roller experience. I moved between laughter, crying, apprehension, anger,jubilation, you name it, I felt it.I fell in love with Kylee and Reese. This story reminds me of a Frank Perreti novel. There is spiritual warfare that goes on in the heavenlies, the average person is not aware of. However this is a timeless message that God's purpose will come to past and that He has the final say. Nothing happens haphazardly. He is still in control.

I would say that the author shows promise. The novel has some historical inaccuracies that most people wouldn't spot. The biggest flaw, in my opinion, is that almost 40% of this short novel isn't story-- it's saying either how good Christianity is, or how bad atheism is. If the goal of the author is to try and convert atheists, I doubt he will have much success since most probably wouldn't finish the book.However, like I said before, the story itself (when the author chooses to pursue it) wasn't that bad for a first novel.

He has been labeled as being anti-semitic for exposing the truth about Zionism and Jewish supremacy, but anyone publicly criticizing Zionism as Jewish supremacy will be labeled anti-semitic by the media and U.S. government (which are both heavily influenced by Zionists). David Duke is not anti-semitic - he is anti-Zionist. The term anti-semitic has been used improperly anyway. There are many non-Jewish peoples (such as Arabs for example) who are semitic but not Jewish. There are also many Jews who are not semitic (such as Jews descended from Khazarian converts to Judaism for example).There are numerous Jews-against-Zionism groups in existence who disagree with the ways of Zionism and Zionist Israel.

I used a chapter on Ischemic Bowel Disease to present at Grand Rounds (gulp) to the entire Dept of Surgery at the Mt Vernon Hospital, NY and actually came off sounding competent. I supplemented my Neurological Surgery Observership at UCSF with the sections on neurosurgery and it served as a good PRIMER to the specialty.

This time a piece of plastic on the door frame corner had been broken off. We decided to keep it anyway and just glue the piece back on (the piece was there, just broken off.) We did not want to be in an endless cycle of returning damaged wine coolers! These damages occurred because the item is shipped in a cardboard box not adequate to the task.

As a subtext, this particular strain of influenza could have been perpetrated by Al Qaeda or by an independent cell of terrorists. Or perhaps, this strain of influenza emerged because people in the Philippines keep and live in close proximity to chickens and on occasion, avian strains of flu emerge and cross to humans.Whatever the cause, the lives of the citizens of Macon and the key characters in \\"Bone Dust\\" are disrupted and they must now deal with the consequences.\\"Bone Dust\\" sustains interest throughout.

A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Story","review":"Rick Maier has written one of those \\"can't put it down\\" summer reading books. BONE DUST is as intriguing and as fast paced as THE DA VINCI CODE.He ingeniously and coincidentally weaves a SARS-like pandemic into his story about contemporary Macon, Ga.If you are from the South you will appreciate the boldness in which Maier describes through his characters and situations how Southerners deal with \\"race\\" concerns, especially at the corporate level.If you are a runner, as I am, you will identify with the main character and how \\"running\\" is a sustaining factor in his life.Pertinent human issues show up in Maier's book of short chapters with nifty titles. The details of death, the facade of being religious, and a father's relationship with his daughters are three images that remain with me.Even though BONE DUST is a drama, with a touching ending(be ready for it), Maier's main character is a jokster kind of guy- so the book is not without humor! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 5 star read","review":"As I've previously written for a review for Eye of the Bear, these books are essential reads for historical novel buffs.

This package has enough terminal connectors, spade Con., etc. for three Amp. jobs. It even has connector ends for the speaker wire! This package is such a Steal... shhhh, don't tell Amazon, They'll only raise the price. The only bad thing I can say about this package is the red power wire seems just slightly thinner than 4 Gage to my eyes, but all the other goodies in this kit more than make up for that.

This is NOT 4 gauge wire, more like 8 gauge with extra plastic insulation added to make it look thick. The odd thing is the terminals included are for 4 gauge. So when you go to install this you'll have a terminal thats way too big and your wire is flopping around. Another problem with this kit is the included RCA cables. The cables have big bulky connections that are too big connect to the back of your headunit with putting stress on the inputs. I had to go out and buy new RCA's to avoid this.

I've never liked these these kinds of saws because if you are a right handed person, then when you need to trim off a 1/2\\" from a board, you are gonna do it with the board being held in your left hand. With this saw, that sort of cut is difficult because you have no saw base to rest on the board. Some people think it's great because you can easily see the blade, but if you know how to use a saw you don't need to always see the blade. It has good quality construction, so I still gave it a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb.

There is a space in this CD that is not matched by any other CD. The songs from \\"Falling At Your Feet\\" through \\"The First Time\\" reprise is such a beautiful auditory experience, I recommend it. Milla's screeching just doesn't sit well, nor does the final track's vocals, but you can hear U2 still thinking and experimenting and that is a enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"bono never fails to please the fans","review":"This album is not supposed to be a U2 album.Like Passengers before it it is about capturing moods.It does that just as much as any album I have ever heard.The Ground Beneath Her Feet is the best song i have heard in a while.Falling At Your Feet is Bono at his best with Daniel Lanois providing some beautiful back up vocals and Dancing Shoes is a totally different Bono Vox Then I have ever heard before.Milla Jovovich also is excellent.Her screeching vocals are actually soothing.This record is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the Frisell stuff","review":"I bought this way back in 2000 for the U2 songs (in fact, I have still not even seen the film). Repeated listenings over the past 5 years has led me to the conclusion that the finest material on this album is the instrumental stuff comprised of the non-U2 groups. Bill Frisell fans should pick this album up for sure, as a couple of songs he plays are breathtakingly beautiful.Unfortunately, you'll have to skip over the song titled \\"Satellite of Love\\" because Milla screams and gargles over a good portion of it, leading me to cringe uncomfortably - I really like her in movies, but this vocal performance is sad and annoying.But aside from that, the album is worth buying for the reasons I gave above."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 keeps getting better","review":"I was not sure what to expect from a soundtrack to this movie, but I was not disappointed. This is a great addition to my U2 music. I think that is is not only different but a maturation of U2. The music is moody and also has a jazz/blues feel to it. I even enjoyed the music from other contributors and the MDH band. The evidence of U2 comes through the music and it is because Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno are involved in the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have gotten five stars, BUT...........................","review":"Milla Jovovich completely destroys SATELLITE OF LOVE, although the reprise (minus her voice) is nice. This album reflects a much needed change for U2, after having come to the realization that \\"Pop\\" just was't that good. I love all the new songs written for this title, but could have lived without ANARCHY IN THE USA! I liked STATELESS and FALLING AT YOUR FEET a little better than I did THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET. It was also nice to hear THE FIRST TIME from the \\"Zooropa\\" album (I loved the reprise for this too). Overall, This is worth the price, but I think the new album later this year will be better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passengers-like lack of coherence","review":"What's with the foot fetish? Even in the song 'Falling at Your Feet' the verse lyrics can't pull away from other people's feet as Bono tries to do his best Leonard Cohen impression. I'm a huge U2 fan, but like Passengers and Pop, this album lacks the continuity of inspired sound that make every other U2 album the godsends they are. Bad points: not enough U2, too much of that model girl, and most of all, _uninspired_ lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie.","review":"Pretty good soundtrack. Like alot of people, I picked this up for the \\"U2\\" related tracks. They're all good, even if they're all a bit on the moody side. There is nothing essential here, but it's mostly enjoyable none the less. I must admit that the \\"Satallite of Love\\" tracks with Milla singing can be a bit jarring, but it's not too bad. About half of this cd involves either \\"U2\\" or \\"Bono\\", and those tracks are reminisent of most of their softer 90's output. Overall, anyone who is a big fan of the movie, or \\"U2\\", should get ahold of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indications of things to come, hopefully","review":"In my opinion, U2 is the greatest band since the Beatles and such talent cannot be overlooked. For those of you who say \\"It doesn't sound like U2\\", get over yourselves. U2's contributions to the soundtrack are phenomenal. As for the rest of the soundtrack, it's as smooth as one could want it to be. I love this and I can't wait for the album in the fall. U2 is the biggest, sort of boldest, baddest band in the land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"This is a excellent book for the homeowner or a great addition for the pro, pretty complete read given the broad topics and excellent pictures and writing on the subject matter, recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tore down the back with one year old inside","review":"We absolutely loved this swing for the first week it was installed in our home!

My daughter is 21 months old now and can not use it anymore. The padding is so thick in the front that when she sits in it the front padding compresses her stomach. There is nothing on the swing that holds it open so the heavier they get, the more they get squished. That front pad is square and projects inward and that is what is pushing on her tummy. She cries because she wants to get in the swing but then cries when she is it because it is hurting her. lt is also hard to get her in and out of with the parachute above.

Adrenalin: Fear the Rush (love that name!), deliberately avoids all three, preferring to concentrate on non-stop action, and low-budget action is what Albert Pyun (directer) does best.While this doesn't appeal to many, if you get into the action you will find Adrenalin a tense and exciting journey, and never boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sci-fi Future Thriller","review":"This movie's plot develops slowly, but moves quickly and keeps the viewer pinned waiting for logical explanations for the motive of the killer and the genesis. In the future, we might not have control over what's happening or why. Perfect uncertainty film. In a crisis situation with a maniac killer there is no logic. Natasha Henstridge performs well in a role as a rookie cop and elevates her acting ability showing vulnerability and durability to a tough role. With each film she does, her acting skills grow better and better. It's a shame that she continues to have trouble shaking the Species- Chick label. I believe her acting skills will continue to improve and she is on the brink of a break-through performance. She would be excellent opposite a notable leading actor in a movie with a good storyline and plot. She makes the most out of what's available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable and economical printer/copier","review":"I bought this new several years ago for our small business and it is a workhorse.

I expect a blender to be very loud, but this is truly ear-splitting. My last blender was also an Osterizer and the noise level was much better.We've lived with this one for about four months and have finally had enough and are going to buy a different blender even though this one still works. (I'm going to look at Consumer Reports and see if their reviews cover noise level!)I see that there are several identical blenders listed on Amazon. Mine is model #4094. Perhaps I just got a bad one and most are fine, but I'd stay away from model #4094. Since this blender entry doesn't specify the model #, I'd be wary."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE KING KONG OF THE KITCHEN!","review":"Lord knows how much money I've thrown away over the years on \\"multi-speed\\" stylishly designed blenders, some of which couldn't cut through yogurt. This Oster is amazing! Overcoming my apprehension about it not \\"fitting in\\" with my otherwise modern-looking kitchen appliances, I relied on the previous comments and just did it. News Flash! It's now safe to put ice cubes into your home blender. The Oster chews them up in seconds, and doesn't sound like it's about to implode as it does it. I'd call this a professional grade blender at a consumer price. I chose a white one, and it not only performs splendidly, but looks great as it exudes an aura of authority on my counter top. The powerful motor is a giant among the myriad of wimpy 16-18 speed (all weak) blenders.

There's nothing special about it other than it is easier for me to get the components apart than other blenders I have had, it has a metal gear rather than plastic to run the blade.

After a year and a half of limited use, it died. There was a thick molasses-like substance on the bottom of the pitcher where you stick it into the base. The substance made it so that the base couldn't turn the blades. I fixed it the first time by taking a screw driver and sticking it into the hole in the bottom of the pitcher and spinning it until the substance leaked out even more. I then wiped it all off and was able to get my drink mixed. I went back to it a couple of weeks later and found the same thing. Only this time when I turned on the motor, there was a blue spark and a bad smell. Yep, it burned out. I would say that between me and my roommate, we only used the blender no more than 15 times.

This, and the acrid burning smell that appears briefly if you run the motor for 45 seconds or more are the reasons it's not getting 5 stars from me.Overall, a very good blender at a reasonable price, with good looks to boot.Edited 10/4/09 to report: The blender is still working just as well as when we first got it. We're very happy with the purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful but broke within 1 month of purchase","review":"I give this product 2 stars because the powerful motor really blended things up nicely. 1 star would be more appropriate!HOWEVER, this blender cannot handle frozen fruit or ice. The post that insterted to turn the blades was held on by rubber which broke against the slight strain of small frozen fruit.I would not buy this blender if you plan to use ice or frozen fruit. Also, the design of the lid sucks;the plastic insert that you can remove so as to add things while blending was very loose and fell into the blender and got chopped up (for a few seconds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO LOUD!","review":"I had read some reviews of this product under this model but purchased the copper model. People said it was loud. I thought, of course it's loud, all blenders are loud. Received it today. Sounds like a jet engine is taking off in my kitchen. Yeah, that loud. The kids had their hands clamped over their ears and my husband and I were screaming over the noise. And I hadn't even added the ice yet!

But, someone with a granite counter would most likely be in bad shape. Funny thing too, this is the only blender I've ever seen that has leaked like this.

It is set about 1000 years after colonisation, during the period that the ruling families warring against one another and were breeding for Laran (psi-powers).Unfortunately, this edition is really, really awful to read because of poor editing - every now and again there is a sentence that makes no sense until the reader suddenly realises that a word is missing a letter, or a word is missing entirely from the sentence. eg. \\"He could see it in her yes...\\" - yes=EyesApart from the cryptic editing, it is still a good read for Darkover fans (not the best to start reading the series with), and a cheap way to buy a couple of classic SF/FAN novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn is right!","review":"I agree with one reviewer on the subject line, but agreement ends there.

Some specifics:* Excessive mental stream from key characters (Allart, Renata, etc.) leaves little to the imagination, and is so frequently repetitive and trite it's painful to read* Insufficient development of other key characters (Donal, Cassandra, etc.)* Illogical and sometimes silly use of fantasy (e.g. intense Tower sessions for tasks like charging batteries!)* Editing is bad* The fantasy focus is overdone and wearisome. Save yourself money and time by skipping the book and engaging in self debate on this topic: \\"woe-is-me-I-have-strange-fantasy-powers\\" / \\"hurray-for-me-I-have-strange-fantasy-powers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cover - Skip the rest","review":"In reading the other reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, I struggled to get through the short 94 pages. The tone is condescending and the content is more a collection of the author's random, disconnected thoughts presented as useless pieces of \\"advice\\" on what you should and shouldn't do. (So much for \\"being yourself at last\\"). The additions of scientific research used to validate the author's opinion seem out of place and more like a desperate attempt to prove she's saying something worthwhile. The author's use of language often seems forced, almost as if she's trying too hard. For example, a section entitled \\"Beyond the Dualistic Approach\\" starts off \\"The relentless search for the best is not a pursuit of excellence, but an attempt to create a duality between what's on top and what's on the bottom...\\" Wow! In general, there was nothing insightful for me in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"I wasn't blown away by this book and found the message to be pretty basic.

Zero stars describes it best. This book was thee most horrible thing I have read about deaf/hearing-impaired children. Not only was it written way over a normal person's head in medical speak, but it was so very negative that it left me feeling sick to my stomach. It told many \\"facts\\" about how deaf children are 'lesser' and do not achieve or 'cannot' achieve things (education, speaking, reading, etc) that any other normal hearing child could. These 'facts' are not true and/or are outdated and only make your \\"stress\\" worse. It continues to harp on the 5 stages of grief and how a parent goes through these when you have a deaf/hearing-impaired child. DO NOT get this book if you are a parent!

I persevered by going to their website , getting their office phone # and calling. I was told they were very busy with a lot of calls. I asked how many people they had answering calls in tech support and was told 2!!! I finally did speak to a tech who informed me that my pictures were too high quality and that's why it took many minutes (instead of seconds) to switch between slides. My camera takes 7.2 megapixel pictures and I was told that unless I re-size them and copy them on to a memory card (i.e. make them lesser quality) then the problem would persist.

You'll want to BUY ANOTHER MEMORY CARD, further expense, and copy some good photos to it for use in the digital frame. I did this and now it won't read any cards at all. I even reformated one of my memory cards, took new photos and inserted the card. Still won't read them. Don't waste your money. I'm asking for the receipt so that I can return it to the store.

Soon I was looking for more information on the Internet. Many website kept referring newbie riders to the Motorcycle Safety Foundation. I figured that their motorcycle primer would be a good place to start.The book thoroughly covers the basics - parts of a motorcycle, controls, how to ride, and how to stay safe. Lots of illustrations and photographs make visualization easy and the text is written expressly for those of us with absolutely no experience on a bike.Further chapters try to explain traction dynamics, countersteering, cornering, and street smarts. None of these chapters became too bogged down by the abstract concepts. Again, some nice illustrations did wonders toward explaining traction and center of gravity.Excellent book!

This book gave me the confidence to purchase my first motorcycle and I've been riding almost everyday for the last two months. I know I'm a newbie, but in applying all the skills, I feel like a very safe and confident rider. There is a lot I need to learn and I'm looking forward to taking more classes by the msf.

This one is by far the worst. I followed the directions to the point (not that it matters because I have made so many waffles that I can do it without thinking). I tried changing the ratios of ingredients and even used multiple types of mix including some of the best mixes you can buy (even tried one \\"just add water\\" mix which was the worst of all) to compensate. No matter what I did, these waffles came out unevenly cooked and rubbery every time. Even for the cheap price point, I would never reccomend this iron. We plan to return it tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"Not the best waffler out there, but definitely the best for under $20. I replaced an old B&D; with this, and I'm very happy with it. It doesn't cook perfectly evenly, so I flip the waffle when it is almost done so that the top cooks a little more. (I usually finish them off by toasting them in a toaster oven for a couple of minutes anyway to reheat and crisp them.The lack of a light is not a problem, I leave it on max heat and haven't had a problem over cooking it, just watch for the steam subsiding.Update: The waffle iron is still going strong with regular use.Also, I'm not sure if this should really be a \\"belgian waffle\\" maker.

It's easy to store because of its size and is perfect for apartment living. I plug it in before I start my batter, and I've never had an issue with it being hot when I'm ready. It seems to heat up rather efficiently in my opinion.I really like having the temp dial on it, because I like having crispy waffles, which is what you get on the high setting.

I was looking for one that would be reasonably priced and work well.Right from the first time we tried it we had yummy homemade waffles.... It takes a couple of tries to get the right amount in. If you put in too much it can overflow ... so when you first put it in go easy. Th batter should be the right consistency. We usually make waffles with the dial at \\"Max\\" so that its more brown. The only oil I use is some that I spray very lightly on the 2 sides of the waffles maker. No oil in my batter unless the mix already has any fat.Now I can make healthy waffles with fresh grated apple, chopped bananas, blueberries etc.I have had no sticking problems that some other users have mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing appliance","review":"Very disappointing. The waffle maker on it's highest setting only cooks the waffle in the center, the outer 1 1/2 inch rim is limp.

For example, I liked how the author demonstrates how to use the shell modifier in 3dMax 6. This is a new feature and the tutorial attempts to demonstrate its use. Only problem is that the turorial is not easy to follow as many are not. The author fails to include examples of the different stages of modeling. You get the begining 3d model on cd and the final version (in some cases). However, it would be nice to show a model in different steps of completion. Overall, many tutorials suffer because of this. The still life tutorial was a dissapointment. 3d max comes with a better tutorial that is more realistic and impressive. The best tutorial is the character animation tutorial. However, this character looks weird. The worst character I have ever seen. Not the best book on 3d max with black and white diagrams, poorly sequenced tutorials and instruction that leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX","review":"Bought this set and two days later the impact driver went out...

Instead she wanders around the subject, throwing in seemingly unimportant annecdotes and stories. It is really, in my opinion, poorly written. But, for me, the biggest issue is that I didn't get any advice on mentoring my teen friend. My brief experience with mentoring shows that teens can be deeply spiritual beings.

If you do this with the quarterly top-up of chlorine tablets, you're 90% of the way towards having a hassle free septic system that doesn't need pumping frequently.

Armor is not given section by section breakdown, but maximum and minimum. Allied armored cars, which were quite numerous, are not listed, unlike their German equivelent.But on the positive side, an appendix of british and American tank armament is included in the back that is in far more detail than the one provided in the German one which is excellent reading. And the same can also be said of engines.A good refurence in regards to the British, American, Canadian and Australian tanks and their sub types."},{"rating":"1","title":"not nora jones","review":"this CD was advertised as a nora jones CD it is not, she is only on the first song.

The soundtrack has been out of print for some time, and now it is finally here!! There was a two disc limited edition that was available on other web sites, but sold quickly. This here is the original soundtrack release from 1982.Trevor Jones' other scores include Excalibur, Labrynth, Runaway Train, G.I. Jane, From Hell, and The Last Of The Mohicans. His score for The Dark Crystal is haunting and beautiful. The Overture is grand with it's use of horns and strings. The love theme is quiet and haunting. The Pod Dance is playful and sounds like Irish folk music. The Gelfling Song helps give the movie and soundtrack it's own voice. Some battle music is missing, but all in all, it is a great representation of the movie. I highly recommend this, and is great for any fan of The Dark Crystal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood dream","review":"It was the first film I ever saw in my life and all the stuff about it it's a wonderful memory"},{"rating":"2","title":"A David Bowie classic","review":"words cannot describe how impacting David Bowie's performance in this film changed a generation.

It has a very soft, ethereal quality to it. The soundtrack makes what is essentially a puppet show seem like a real epic. I only wish the 2-disc version were still available. Still, the original soundtrack has over 40 minutes and covers most of the musical highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the job done","review":"I actually only wanted a little bit of this stuff, but the brick they send you for $30 is pretty huge. I'll probably have this for the rest of my life.I don't use this stuff in any sort of professional quality so I'm afraid my review is going to be fairly unsophisticated. I purchased this to buff some scratches out of a polyester-finished piano bench. It did the job very well using a cotton polishing wheel and a power drill. Actually getting the stuff on the wheel was a bit of a challenge. Are you supposed to heat it up? I don't know. I didn't. I was not able to completely remove the scratches because I didn't want to polish the finish off, but the bench certainly hides the scratches better now.I imagine this stuff would also work quite well on automotive paint finishes, but I wouldn't recommend any laymen to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mathematical mystery solver","review":"Timothy Hemion says he is a mathematical researcher.Maybe that's why Suzuki is a math wizard?If you like math and puzzles you should enjoy this book.I read it from cover to cover.I didn't know that they played baseball in Japan.It's a good mystery, which treats the reader as an intelligent person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspector Morimoto is great!","review":"This book has a fascinating plot.It really makes you think.Definitely for those who enjoy a good puzzle.The setting in Japan also makes it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting mystery book","review":"I like the way the inspector Morimoto and the officer Suzuki discuss. They are putting logical steps each of which drives me to imagine what they imagine.Japan shares many things with Korea, for example, meal, people's attitude, or thinking process. I was exciting to see what Japan and Japanese are like written in English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like it's written for a 12 year old.","review":"I found this book extremely disappointing, especially given the glowing reviews that encouraged me to buy it in the first place. The writing style is extremely simplistic and lacking in depth. The author is not Japanese so the poor use of language cannot be attributed to translation. The plot did not hold my interest and the characters seemed one dimensional. Even a 12 year old would find this dull reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A model detective","review":"This book reminds me a lot of the great Japanese detective story by Matsumoto Seicho, Points and Lines. This is a proper detective story allowing the reader to try and solve the crime too, rather than the rather cliched detective stories one reads so often when the detective himself (normally with a stack of emotional baggage)is the focal point of the story. In this novel one can sift through the evidence with Morimoto and Suzuki and try, like them, to ascertain what has really happened. That said, the characters are nonetheless interesting as they cautiously tread their way to solving the crime. We could all learn from their methodical approach to problem solving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Excellent book with challenging twists whilst solving the crime.

It is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Pappa is back in a big way","review":"It has been a long time since we heard from Crowbar, albeit not the original line-up.However, with Kirk on vocals, Rex Brown(Pantera/Down) on Bass, and Craig Nunemacher(BLS/Crowbar) on drums the riffs are nice and sludgy and the drums are just like they were in '93.If you follow Crowbar at all or love Louisiana sludge, you will eat this album up. Kirk spans his entire repotoire on this one.In past efforts it seemed they would get focused on a style that defined the album, but the trend is broken on this one.I agree with the above reviewer. It is not as good as the self titled Crowbar album, but it is a close second and in some ways better. If you could only buy three get Crowbar, Time Heals, and Lifes Blood.They are on tour now and will be on the west coast. You can visit Crowbarmusic.com for information.Let us hope we don't have to wait 3 more years for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"doomcore at its best","review":"Crowbar have come quite a long way since their early days of \\"sludge\\". Kirk Windstein, only original band member and mastermind of Crowbar, says about this CD that you woulnd't have expected it from a band whose early albums were not very sophisticated. The fact is that the songs still have a certain riff-oriented simplicity (also, they have lost none of their heaviness). Yet the songs are very smartly arranged, which, combined with a surprising amount of melody on this album, makes them little doom-masterpieces. If you look for keyboards and production, wrong address. If you look for the exactly right mix of doomcore and melody, slow heaviness and the occasional explosion, this is dead right. Kirk's singing is also good on this record. Don't forget to check out the two DOWN albums, on which Kirk also plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was perfect for my party!","review":"I was looking for a way to keep a number of foods warm for my son's graduation party. This server fit my roaster well. My rival 20 qt. roaster (RO220) was way to big for just one hot food even though I had around 90 people. I found the perfect solution. It was very easy to use and kept the food warm. I served beef brisket and meatballs in the serving containers. Surprisingly, the containers held a decent amount of food. I filled each container in the kitchen and easily transported it to the roaster. Clean up was also very easy as the server is in four parts, 3 containers and the holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love on Layaway","review":"Excellent movie that deals with various relationships.

You draw tears from it if you are a person who has ever experienced love in a peculiar way. I loved it. You would miss out if you thought twice to make this purchase.

The singer has obviously learnt some classical indian music and it shows especially Jai Ma and Opium are deliciously mellow and make you want to drift away. But if you are looking for kirtan on the lines of Jai Uttal or Krishna Das you may be disappointed. None of the songs are brisk or invigorating, and hard core kirtan buffs might even find the singer's pronounciation of sanskrit to be dopey/half swallowing syllables and words. Definitely a good addition to your collection of relaxing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but no sitar","review":"Despite the WAH!nderful CD Cover, the CD itself is really quite nice but it misses that bit of excellence that I like to find in music.

So What."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great director's commentary","review":"The movie itself was pretty good, if only for the scenery of Mexico City. The movie was mostly shot there and captures the city perfectly in all of its glory and all of its horror. But the real thing to watch for on the DVD is the director's commentary. It's not one or two scenes, but the ENTIRE movie. I watched it twice for that reason. The director gives fantastic insight into making movies and particularly interesting were his stories about filming in one of the most dangerous cities in the world, including crew being kidnapped. A must watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and suspenseful","review":"I enjoyed this movie pretty much from beginning to end. It was not predictable and kept my interest. It was good to see a female character who was determined and brave. Also, the Mexican taxi driver was great as well!

Of interest was the lead roles played by the men who signed attended the Second Continental Congress, debated the Declaration of Independence, and now saw the need for a new form of government. Noteworthy also were those delegates who opposed the Constitution in its origin, yet returned home to help ratify the documment. Most surprising was the role played by James Wilson of Pennsylvania.

There were too many changes and they did not seem necessary at all. Some of the casting felt wrong, especially Robbie and Tom. I really like the actor who plays Robbie, but he seemed a lot younger than Tom. Dave the Laugh (my favorite character in the series) was ok, but his dialogue felt awkward instead of funny and cheeky.

After reading through some forums, I found out that FujiFilm 4X DVD-R 10-packs were known to burn at 8X as they are Taiyo Yuden media. So I bought those and they indeed burned at twice their rated speed.These Imation discs, however, max out at 2X. Even after downloading some \\"tweaked\\" firmware from the http://www.rpc1.org forums.

The editors make no mention of Strindberg's incredibly sexist views in the introduction to \\"Miss Julie\\". The \\"Topics for Critical Thinking and Writing\\" are so leading they aren't suitable for anyone more intellectually sophisticated than a middle-school student.

Diane Keaton does her usual great acting job, three parallel male leads are pretty convincing. Mandy Moore, in my opinion, does well in more emotional situations than she does in ordinary circumstances. There is a little boy in this film who is VERY much like a lot of kids his age I have known. I don't know how much he has to act, and how much just comes naturally, but he is a standout as just a tiny bit obnoxious, yet amusing, kid.

And the movie tries to make it look fun and promising. What is fun and promising for being narcissistic and destructive?! It's simply annoying!

I am not certain if it is just a bad storyline, or a combination of bad storyline, awful editing, and under/overacting.

Diane Keaton-as mom- is the MOST neurotic, overbearing, personal space invading nutcase-with an overly cutesy stupidity act. And Mandy Moore is a crying daughter of nutcase Keaton's character. This movie is unfunny(I saw it free-at a hotel on HBO). It is stupid-obnoxious and and just annoying. I used to respect Diane Keaton as an actress, until I saw this piece of garbage.

The makers of this movie should refund everyone with interest penalties and assessments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-so-good.","review":"I'd have to agree with the general review about this film. The movie is quite badly done. The movie is about the conflict between a domineering mother and a pushover daughter. Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore both over-act and gets down right annoying to watch. And as mentioned in other reviews, it seems as though the film tries to downplay the fact that Mandy Moore's character is two-timing two men. Millie (Mandy) does get pushed around by her mother and we are made to feel bad for her but it still doesn't justify the fact that she cheats on her men.I did enjoy Diane Keaton's wardrobe and actually Mandy Moore's as well for that matter. Lauren Graham and Piper Perabo are quite charming as Mandy's sisters but all in all, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Two stars - a generous rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute chick flick","review":"I bought the DVD because I was watching it on TV and lost the last 45 minutes of the film... I enjoyed the movie...

This is a sad revelation. I think this movie promotes a lifestyle that I would hate for any of my children to grow up to become. And Dianne Keaton definetly has to grow up. Her days of Annie Hall were great, but very much over. It's time to mature and become a distinguished actress. Maybe I'm wrong? I have no idea. But this was definitly a walk out. One's sex life is nobody's business but their own and this movie was just pretty disgusting. It's like they TRY to shock the people in the audience as opposed to writing material that will sincerely make someone laugh by using satire. Anyone could say \\"orgasm\\" and get a laugh because it's so rediculous. How abbout trying to write some good satire instead of going for shock value.

I wanted to see if Reshma Shetty could act beyond what she does in Royal Pains. I had written my book Gone Missing and the subsequent screenplay with her in mind for the character of Lalita Singh. I needed to know if she could pull it off.I'm convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that she'd be perfect. So, did I get my money's worth? If I think of it as an audition reel for Reshma Shetty then absolutely.I wish I could say more about the film but it was really hard to watch. Most of the lead performances, especially Ruby Dee's were stellar. But the script, the dialogue and the direction missed the mark. I found myself skipping forward to the scenes where Reshma was in. Unfortunately there weren't many. The other characters just didn't hold my interest. I didn't care what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This movie is 3 short stories in one, with scenes from a steam room used as the story dividers. The first story regarding the older widowed woman is my favorite story of the 3. It is heartwarming, touching, and the only story which I could relate to. The second story involves a single divorced woman with no job, no self esteem, and a mentally abusive ex-husband. This story made no impact upon me as the actors/actresses were sloppy and their dialogue was juvenile. The third story involves a 20-something college student who is trying to break free from her parents as well as enter her first lesbian relationship. The actors who portrayed her parents were so awful, and their lines so scripted, that they were a joke. In every scene that the parents were in, I didn't listen to the dialogue because I was distracted by the dad's robotic voice.I originally was going to give the movie no stars, but decided to give 1 star because of Ruby Dee's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Wasn't available at home depot,lowe's or any other hardware store in the area.

As presented in the documentary, the oldest Clovis spear point found in the Eastern United States is connected with similar spear points and artifacts discovered in Europe.

It also had very unresponsive buttons (had to press so hard my wife would call me over to turn on the blender). Didn't do a very good job crushing ice or chopping up fruit -- has dead spots in the corners and under the blades where chunks of material would get stuck. All in all, a very poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for the brand name","review":"I thought when I bought this blender about 5 years ago, that being a Kitchen Aid, it would be a 1st class product. Well, in 5 years not much has changed with this product (I have checked it out at the stores). The main problem is that the blade is so DULL. If you reach in and touch it, you can see that it is thick but not at all sharp. This blender always leaves chunks of ice - you cannot make a decent margarita with this machine. The motor is plenty strong. If there was a way to put in a sharper blade, it may make all the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for KitchenAid","review":"We purchased an earlier version of this model a few years ago. Ours gets infrequent use, maybe 1-2 times per month, maybe just a little more around Christmas.It has been a disappointment.The component that sticks out of the base and drives the blade quickly began to make a loose connection with the blade. Other than that it worked ok for about 3-4 years. Then all of a sudden it stopped working.This was at the time a fairly mid-high end unit, one which I would have expected many years of dependable use particularly at a low usage rate.I will avoid Kitchen Aid in the future for small appliances, and have begun to wonder about larger appliances, of which we own some."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR SMOOTHIES","review":"I am very unhappy with this blender.

They should either re-design their blenders or discontinue them.I bought one of these for my son and his wife for Christmas. They didn't tell me it was such a bad blender because they didn't want to hurt my feelings. So I bought one for myself, hated it, and then they confessed that they didn't like theirs either.Not only do they almost always leak at both ends and make a mess, they don't crush ice all that well and the berries in your smoothies will always be chunky rather than blended.Take my word for it, this is one you will not be happy with and it's overpriced to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this blender","review":"This blender simply doesn't work well. I bought it to match my kitchenaid Mixer that I love. The container is too large near the blades so it doesn't force all the liquid through the blades, I had to use a spatula through the hole in the top of the lid to direct the liquid over the blades so that everything would blend smoothly.

It's going in the trash where it should have ended up right after I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a week of use","review":"After a week of use, the knobs on the blade drive coupling chipped/broke off.

I hate it, and I want it to die.Today, I wanted to make a smoothie, and the blender started making sounds like it had pneumonia. I glanced at the words \\"ice crusher\\" on the machine, and remembered the 4 huge chunks of ice leftover in the blender from my last shake-making fest. It should be labeled \\"ice slapper.\\"But, this review has come across as too negative. On the positive side, KitchenAid's marketing team must be phenomenal because they convinced me to pay $100 for a worthless piece of crap.Does anybody have KitchenAid's marketing team's email address?

I bought this blender in Tangerine, because it matched my kitchen. I love the way it looks on my counter, but have been completely disappointed with its performance. I use my blender primarily for shakes/smoothies for breakfast every morning. This blender is unable to blend fruit with yogurt and milk, which seems to be a simple task as far as blenders go. I have had this blender for approx 2 months, and have yet to have a smoothie without huge chunks of fruit in it. Today's smoothie was the worst (hence the review), and all the blueberries were WHOLE and sitting at the bottom of the blender after at least 90 seconds on \\"liquify\\".

I called the company and they said I could order a new blade assembly for $25 and with shipping I was up over $30.

I was dissappointed overall, with the product and the customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deffective or poor","review":"I just bought this blender after months of looking for the best, but I guess I have to keep looking. This one does not blend properly, fruit stays on pieces after 5 min puree, even blueberries stay whole!!, so no drinking from a straw. It could be a deffective one, I am not sure I will replace it probably to check, but I doubt it.

There is more separation between instruments at all frequencies, although the bass is the most obvious improvement: Bass notes through my subwoofer are more tonal and less generic. Given the modest price, the Pyramid Power Supply is a tremendous improvement akin to upgrading to a nicer DAC. People spend much more on fancy cables, which in comparison offer very little improvement in audio quality.The power supply also has the ancillary benefit of adding a large illuminated power switch. The build quality is nice, and there is a hobbyist-inspired look to the unit.On a technical note, I chose to snip the wire and tip from the VDAC factory power supply and reuse it to connect the Pyramid Power Supply to my VDAC. The positive wire is the one with the white rectangles on it, and the negative wire has tiny lettering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for my DAC & Phono Preamp","review":"I am supplying power to both my DAC and phono preamp with this power supply. There are noticeable improvements to sound quality upgrading from the wall warts--a veil is lifted for each.The phono preamp I am using is a BBE and it wants 12V DC, so I just connect it directly to this Pyramid power supply.For the DAC, I have the FIIO D3. It expects an input voltage of 5V DC (normally powered off a USB bus). So what I did is buy a few parts from Radio Shack for a few bucks to make my own voltage regulator--a 12V to 5V voltage regulator IC, heatsink, small perf board & little project box. I just place this DIY voltage regulator in between the power supply and DAC.Love this power supply--hugs & kisses."},{"rating":"2","title":"An improvement for the V-LPS","review":"I was skeptical that I'd hear a difference, but both my wife and myself noticed an instant difference when using the Pyramid to power Music Fidelity's V-LPS phono stage.

I have a couple thousand dollars wrapped up into my headphones rig and, up until ten minutes ago, was a little disappointed with the overall performance. I even thought that there was something wrong with my ears because all the other headphone, amp and DAC reviewers raved. This little power supply has made all the difference. Thanks Pyramid!!!It's been said by other reviewers but I need to repeat... the positive side of the V-DAC's cord is the one with the long rectangles.

His pro Bush pro war feelings color much of this work and he says that if you disagree with his findings you just aren't as evolved as he is. I could not replicate his results and am surprised that he would put something out that focuses so much on divisive generalizations.

She exposes many arguments and personalities used in Holocaust denial.I was intrigued about her expose on the origins of WW1 hisorical revsionism and its the impact on historical revisionism of WW2. She documents how bad academic scholarship and a willingness to absolve Germany can lead to disturbing nonsense . Holocaust revisionism has its origins in trying to absolve Germany from WW1 guilt. This should give pause to any revisionist historian when trying to disect and interpret the historical record. Lipstadt demolishes Holocaust revisionists. There is a need to always reinterpret a historical event -the Holocaust included but this needs to be done without trying to advance a nefarious agenda (i.e Hitler apolgia,anti semitism). The book will be an in important book cataloging the misuse of revisionism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Searching for the truth","review":"I recently bought this book do hype brought about by my local newspaper. I found this book to be filled with more emotion based opinions than facts supporting her book. She has taken the liberty to throw every major writer, institute, and organization which tries to examine the events of WWII, and the holocaust into a denier catagory. Searching for the truth, and questioning events does not make one a hater, or anti semitic. In my opinion I have found other books on this subject to be of much greater value than this poorly emotionally opinionated written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use of term \\"revisionism\\" should be avoided","review":"Reviews and commentary should avoid the term \\"revisionism\\" when discussing the Holocuast denial movement and its proponents. As author Deborah Lipstadt points out, revisionism is a legitimate academic pursuit, while Holocaust denial is nothing of the sort. To do so is to lump together serious scholars with the crackpots and anti-Semites who make up the denial movement. Holocuast deniers want to be known as revisionists. Do not grant them the honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Done","review":"This book is as others have stated an emotional plea rather than an academic work. Yes, I believe the Holocaust was a reality but this work only leads me into denial owing to the he said she said argument. Where are the facts, footnotes, and scholarship? I would pass this book over, a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Job","review":"This is a worthwhile subject, but the author does an extremely poor job. Her appeal is emotional, and she does not offer a coherent, FACTUAL refutation of Holocaust deniers' claims.

Unfortunately, this is a very sloppy piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"??","review":"Read \\"Nature's Eternal Religion\\" by Ben Klassen for the complete story on this book of hogwash.

The Armenian Genocide, the first holocaust of the 20th century, preceded the Jewish Holocaust in WWI. It is historically accepted fact by nearly all historians as well as the International Society of Genocide Scholars, the leading experts in the field. It is disgusting to me that the author of this book, while condemning denial of genocide and holocaust, is a genocide/holocaust denier herself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The appeal to motive is a well known logical fallacy. One cannot show that someone is wrong about a point of fact by showing that he has an ulterior motive. If \\"holocaust deniers\\" are factually wrong, their motives hardly matter. If they are right, again their motives hardly matter. Since Lipstadt's entire book is devoted to imputing ulterior motives to her opponents rather than debating them, it has no value.Even Lipstadt's characterizations of her opponents' motivations are inaccurate. She continually misquotes, distorts, and invents whatever is necessary to make her opponents look bad. Books like this are the reason the word \\"screed\\" was invented.For a fair assessment of the holocaust controversy, seeDebating the Holocaust: A New Look At Both Sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST PLAIN BRILLIANT!","review":"Deborah Lipstadt has more chutzpah than any Holocaust author I know...she's a real tiger for the truth and for exposing the reaches of hatred, both then and now.

It is full of antagonistic, name calling rants that condemn revisionists as mindless haters of Judaism. It does not give any credit to the opposing view points (no matter how academically based) and the author comes off like a Howard Stern like personality: she is right and all others are, at best ignorant and at worst, stupid. Not all revisionist are Nazis. Some revisionists happen to be Jewish.

The case is ok, and seems to protect the PDA decently well (I have a Toshiba e310). I would have liked to see a further reenforced screen cover though. Some may like the belt clip included in it, but I do not. The fastener for the clip protrudes when it is in your pocket, and can get very annoying.

Although Peter B.E. Hill's style is rigorously academic, the nature of the material itself is so sensational that the book is at times a thrilling read. It offers a glimpse of the underside of Japanese government and society, and reveals historical facts likely to shock the average non-Japanese reader. getAbstract finds that this book will, of course, interest readers who are professionally concerned with crime, sociology, economics, Japanese studies and the like.

I think the Imation designers were thinking about people attaching it to back packs, but that's not how I use it.

His wife, Sharyn, had enough common sense for ten people, but unfortunately Denny didn't use her as a sounding board before he got involved in business deals. Sharyn has served her hell on earth and will go to heaven. There are many similarities to Pete Rose. Denny is another story of a gifted athlete who had trouble adapting to real life.

I've had it for 3 months.However, one of my complaint is that the the balls consisting analog sticks are confined to a square base, instead of a hexagonal or circular base. Another would be the D-pad, which is extremely stiff and makes my thumb sore when I do rapid <<< - >>> mashing.As a controller, it fulfills its uses.

It looks like a PS2 controller, but it is fatter. It is just fat enough that my left finger encounters a lot of stress from pressing against the rear section.The main issue I have with it is that the D-pad is also a button, and the extra pressure required makes playing fighting games a painful chore. I can play for about 30 minutes and require an hour-long break.Of course, few would have recommended this for fighting games, but it is all I have, and I am surprised at how incredibly painful it is to use.I played SF2 on the SNES back in the day for days straight, and never experienced anything like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Logitech Gamepad","review":"I thought that this product worked well for me.

The issue is that after about 2 months this controller will start to have a calibration drift, where if you play with it for a steady time period, the calibration will go off center and you have to unplug it and plug it back in again. The time it takes for this drift to occur seems to get less and less as time goes on. The first controller I had, they told me this was a known issue and had already been fixed in firmware. They then sent me a replacement that did the same thing, only less pronounced. Even though this is only $20, it's not worth the hassle. Just get a USB adapter for a PS2 or PS1 controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an everlasting joypad...","review":"I bought this elsewhere as I was in need of a pad for my PC. I thought the PS2 controller look was pretty good, and the price was ok. Well, after a few months of Fifa 2004 and Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, the left thumbstick grip on top wore down and then it started to lose its connection. The analog stick would have to be reconfigured every time I wanted to play something and even then it would become twitchy, so instead of say a player standing still they would take a step right or steering a speeding car in GTA and then suddenly lurching to the right, ARGH!

Also, the profiler software kills the use of my other gamepad when it is booted up.All in all, this is what could be a flawless pad - except for a couple of flaws, one of them major.Logitech is apparently working on a version with more viable analog sticks, and these should be available by april 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This gamepad lasted for about 2 days then the left analog stick had \\"calibration problems\\" in which i couldn't move down or to the left at all unless i replugged it into my usb port.

It feels mushy, but more importantly it impossible to consistenly hit any single direction. If you try to go right, you will often press up or down in addition, resulting in diagonal movement. This can be devastating, depending on the game. For example, it is impossible to reliably perform even simple fighting game moves such as SubZero's freeze or Ken/Ryu's fireball. Also, this pad lacks a button to swap the D-Pad with the left analog stick.The Saitek P880 is much better in this area. Also, Logitech fixed these issues when they made their Rumblepad 2, but it's a bit more expensive due to the rumble feature.

While the text of the \`stories\` includes some thoughtful questions to ask the child, many of the stories are oversimplified, and less interesting than if told in more detail. Although the colorful illustrations will engage any youngster, I am also concerned that all the people are depicted with creamy, peach-toned skin. With so many stories packed into a small space, the book is thick and heavy, like a small dictionary, which makes it difficult to hold open with one hand, a manoeuver which, especially if you have one or more children who move, is an absolute necessity. I highly recommend THE LION STORYTELLER\`S BIBLE, which is written to be told. There are fewer stories, but the writing is better (attention paid to rhythm and repetition, for example.)

America on the Move is about staging a Smithsonian exhibition on American transportation. The details of the exhibition are recounted in exhaustive detail: How a bus was resized to fit the exhibit hall, where a historic car was found, how to display a locomotive. What suffers is the actual history, which is included in brief dibs, dabs and snippets between interviews with curators and designers. We had hoped this would be an informative show on the history of American transportation and it's role in the growth and expansion of the United States. My daughter, a teacher, needs such material for a unit in her social studies class. This DVD has too little for such use, even as short clips. We found the recounting of the mounting of the exhibition very tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie","review":"I love this movie!!!I bought the movie and have watched it several times.

I LOVE Christmas movies, but this one is a REAL STINKER!don't waste your time. Lifetime and Hallmark both have some great Christmas movies, this one does not make my repeat-viewing list....I urge Hollywood, do not hire that actress again, MAYBE as a some sort of carnival-dwarf or an extra at a fat-camp.oh, there is a scene with really strange singing in the warehouse and they are dancing around with their carts, for 'camp-value,' it is worth buying the dvd and posting it on the internet!

Hate to ding their product, but they need to get it together. Aside from the error, the product is fine - fit and finish look great. If you have an older or more obscure rifle I'd suggest checking with a local gunshop or gunsmith first; I did after receiving this incorrect part and that's ultimately what pointed me to Weaver 90 being the correct part. Calling Weaver's tech support number was completely useless.

Chief among these is critical thinking, as its use impacts everything we read, hear, and see to some extent. This book is an excellent introduction; it is clearly written, with each successive idea built firmly upon the previous ones. The authors use a minimum of jargon, and make no assumptions as to the reader's prior knowledge of logic or argument theory.I now have a command of the basic principles and terminology, and find myself making better arguments. More importantly, I can now spot flawed arguments as well as fallacies and rhetorical ploys that make up so much of public and political discourse. I expect to refer back to it many times in coming years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear explanations but a little long- winded","review":"As a student studying philosophy at Glasgow University i found this book well laid out and it gave clear explanations to the topics presented. However, i also found the particular explantions were very long which was simply not needed.

This was very unhelpful and it makes the section quite pointless becuase you do not know whether you are correct or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and readable","review":"An excellent book: well written, clear, and helpful.

Unfortunately those hopes were not filled. I felt that the story line was ok but the good just did not get up and go.

I bought this because my daughter loves insects and I thought it would be an interesting perspective. I am now going to go see if I can get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid overview of basic concepts","review":"This is a good introduction to basic math skills, but I don't think that it will be very useful for a high school student. Upon entering high school, a student should have mastered such topics as fractions, percents, and integers, and if he or she hasn't, then he or she is in trouble.The DVD consists of what seem to be simple PowerPoint slides. The voiceover is clear and spoken at a good pace. Each lesson lasts a few minutes, and ample time is provided to complete the given examples. Each lesson includes good definitions of key terms and ends with a quick review of the material that was covered. Overall, I think that this DVD would likely be more beneficial to an elementary school or middle school student who is looking for an overview to material that he or she has already been exposed to in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fran's Fab Fiftie's","review":"Loved reading and will love re-reading this book about the life of a teen in the fifties because I was there, too!

For anyone who has been thru that shakey post-depression era, you will relate to Fran's fears, uncertaincies, needs, and trusting nature. It was the best of times for the carefree life of most teens: going to games, dances, good movies, fun clothes, and little crime. But Fran's life takes you past that facade to the real down-and-dirty life that went on for those who looked for it! And Fran not only looked, she found it!! She put herself thru hell but seemed to enjoy it! You'll laugh and cry with her and it may seem like a wild story, but it is true and she really lived it all.

I captured with the bundled software (Analog 8mm via composite port) but I created the DVD with the software I had bundled with the HP DVD so I cannot comment on that aspect of the product. The quality of the image was great and the sound was in sync with the picture ( I mention this as some seem to have an issue with some capture cards and sound syncronization).

You can specify the time duration for each video capturing. Based on the time duration that you specified, the software tells you how big the video file would be.

It's fairly attractive, though I'm thinking about some yellow or orange paint in the diagonal stripes between \\"bumpers\\" just to enhance the industrial look of the thing.This case gives the main navigation controls a much more tactile, positive feel much nicer than a naked Zune. On the other hand, the menu/back and play/pause buttons take a little more effort to press.The belt clip doesn't impress me, but I've certainly seen worse.

The book itself is very clearly written, and colorful and highly informative to boot. I bought some books that covered only one of the iapps previously, and found this book was at least as informative as those books - and it covers all four iapps! I have loaned it to friends and recommended it to several others, and they have all raved.

It was a great read so I'm buying several more copies to give as Christmas presents. The book works on several levels. It is first and foremost a book that details the triumphs of a black man at the turn of the century and his subsequent quest to do what he loves to do - race horses. The book also describes the trials that the black athelete faced in the United States during the first half of the 20th century. It would take 50 years before atheletes such as Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron were able to break the \\"color barrier\\". Finally, Black Maestro is a great adventure across two continents and through two world wars - I imagine Hollywood is already chomping at the bit to get this story on the silver screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read, good perspective","review":"the sport of horseracing owes much to the African Americans who have nutured its athletes.

Congratulations, you've succeeded. The science fiction premise is interesting, but half the book is nothing more than a philosophical and political rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"Readers can approach this book in two ways: as a work of fiction or as a forum for Hayes to discuss his educational philosophy. As fiction, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The dialogue is contrived (if I ever read the word \\"amigo\\" again I'll puke), there are so many characters who add nothing to the plot, and speaking of plot Hayes destroys what could have been an interesting one. The only reason I gave this book a star at all was because of Hayes' expanation of his thoughts on self-education. He has some insights on classical fiction which spurs further thought. The problem is that he has embedded this in the form of lectures which he tries to pass off as character dialogue. If you like to get preached to, this is the book for you. It's ironic that Hayes endorses self-education yet comes off as a college professor, and a boring one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blending the \\"here\\", \\"there\\" and \\"everywhere\\".","review":"What an interesting and thought provoking book this one turned out to be! With its blending of the past and present, philosophy, action and adventure, science fiction and literature...it covers most of the bases.

Were it not for a number of editing errors and omissions, I would give this one 5 stars...no question about it; however, as it stands, I give it 4 1/2.

Hopkinson follows the true stories of five young immigrants. She tells the story of life on the Lower East Side at the turn of the 20th century using excerpts from oral histories and memoirs. Somehow the stories of the young Russian Jewish and Italian immigrants tie in seamlessly with information on coming to America, what it was like to live in a tenement, work (including conditions in the sweatshops and the Triangle factory fire), going to school, and what the future held for these young men and women. The historic photos are so evocative and powerful.

Perhaps that's the problem. The studio may be trying to get the series out to the media before there was any good source material so they just started making stuff up.There's too much filler episodes and not enough story/character development.

It was great to be able to put in a stack of photos (I went up to 25 at a time) and walk away while it scanned.

Quality is excellent but I'm returning it as it takes too much time to adjust the scans afterwards (\\"auto straighten\\" feature doesn't help--photos frequently feed crooked; part of scanner hardware ends up in the scans; frequently get 1/2\\" black band on left in scans).

I hoped to scan a large number of photos efficiently and have had an HP 6350cse with a document feeder that has worked great for years and an HP Digital Sender that I bought for my ofice that is also great, but the document expertise does not appear to have translated well to this innovative attempt at photo feeding.

Setup was easy on Windows XP but the main problems are with the 'gadgets'. The auto photo feeder (APF) is little more than a plastic toy. It left fine parallel score marks (scratches) along the direction of glossy photos as they were scanned. This seems to be a known design issue and could not be fixed by Tech Support. I was told a replacement APF would not help. The multiple scans were not straight and there were too many problems for auto correct. You may as well scan one by one in the first place. As for the capabilities for scanning slides and negatives, my advice is get a proper slide scanner.

Love-love-love these!","review":"Bought these in March... They're still going strong in December and are used repeatedly (on-off) over several hours daily. In this house, that's a real achievement -- usually bulbs burn out so quickly here. Maybe our electricity is dirty? Or maybe Sylvania is better than GE, dunno. Anyway, for our cold, sometimes gray and gloomy northern exposure home, this soft pink light is a remarkable improvement over the GE Reveal (something akin to full spectrum) light bulbs we had been using. The whole place just feels somehow happier with this light suffusing the rooms. Such a difference, especially if you tend towards SAD-type symptoms during the darker winter months. Love 'em.I wish these were available via Prime, but it's totally worth paying for shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding sound quality !","review":"I had bought these speakers in late 2004 and am still using them now (2008).

The young man, who is now in his 40's lived intensely what so many went through in one form or another in the 1960's and 70's.

I finally sat down and watched it and I am so glad I had the opportunity to do so. I have never listened to the Grateful Dead and I don't think it is necessary to listen to them just to see this movie. If you have ever been moved by music, then you should see this movie. The story is simply moving and so extremely powerful. J.K. Simmons is a fantastic actor and is surrounded by grade A actors as well.

Let's start with the fact that the author is barely literate enough to put a sentence together. She continuously misuses words (although apparently she does use a spell-checker, though that might have been her editor), rambles incoherently, and in general this screed reads like the writings of someone locked in a mental institution for paranoid schizophrenia.Basically, that is what this is: the ramblings of a paranoid schizophrenic. There are NO facts here. She makes statements she cannot possibly back up (largely because she made them up in her own head).

Also, it has been proven that the Ancient Greek the Bible was originally written in has been mistranslated many times. Out of all the verses on one page, each one has at least eight different translations in English.

The format is terrible! There are typos all over the place, misspellings, extraneous letters and other characters randomly inserted everywhere. Quotes are not clearly indicated so readers are not sure if they are reading a quote or the author's words. Indentation varies from paragraph to paragraph.

Though somewhat funny, the two male models weren't funny enough -- they needed to exaggerate the characters more.

Zoolander was just an incredibly hilarious movie. If you are going to see this movie, do not go expecting a movie that will be up for oscars; just go expecting a movie to pick you up and make you feel better ( and smarter). Also you have to pay attention when Zoolander talks, because he gets his words wrong and some of them are hard to understand. Go see this movie, if you want to have a good time.

When Zoolander is beaten for male model of the year award by Hansel, he decides to retire as he belives theres to life then being \\"really, really ridiculously good looking\\". When he is asked back by fashion designer Mugatu (the hilarious Will Ferell) he is reluctant but accepts, little does he know Mugatu has a secret plan to brainwash Derek to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister. Also starring Jerry Stiller (Ben's dad) and Christine Taylor (Ben's wife) this film is hilarious and very entertaining. Stiller and Wilson are excellent as rivalling models and also very funny.

At first watch, this film will no doubt seem sort've stupid....but get past that, watch the film a second, third, and fourth time....Every line in this film is comedy, literally.

Plus he got to hire his father Ben Stiller as the manager and his mother Ann Meara in the crowd scenes. An utter waste of two hours and whatever it cost to produce this turkey. The premise is retarded: Male models are superstars. Can anyone name a male model? Oh, Ben Stiller is soooo hot when he pouts. Jokes? Story?

I probably wouldn't have even finished watching it if anyone else had been in it. There was just not enough material to carry a feature length film. As expected the plot was pretty lame, and jokes just wore thin after a while. I like Stiller much better when he is not trying so hard to be funny, the same goes for Owen Wilson. They are both very funny naturally, and this attempt at extreme characters just did not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't laugh one time","review":"First off, it doesn't even deserve one star. This has got to be one of, if not THE worst movies I have ever seen. I did not laugh one time and could not even finish watching this awful movie. I can't imagine anyone spending money for this truly pitiful excuse for entertainment. Not only was the writing bad, but it was one product placement after another. Was this supposed to be a movie with a message or a feature length commercial? Ben Stiller was bad and should be ashamed to have ever written the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Sucks!!","review":"The only reason, it gets one star is for the effort it took the director and Ben Stiller to screw up such an easy thing. Just like the Saturday Night Live of today is but a shadow of the great old shows of 10-15 years ago, this movie is entirely flawed in its premise. We left the Theatre after about 10 minutes and Ben Stillers attempt at having some sort of an accent was pathetic. The cast members from SNL can always be counted on to be completely unfunny and lame (see \\"Corky Romano\\", another failure), but unfortunately Ben Stiller, whose career was looking up for once, now has to deal with the fallout of this movie disaster.

Owen Wlson also does a nice job as Hansel, and this movie delivers jab after jab at the modeling/fashion industry, especially pointing out how models are required to do as they're told and spinning off that to make up a story about how models make good assassins to use to benefit the fashion industry. Ben Stiller also does a nice job in his titular role as Zoolander.Some of the scenes are especially funny, such as Zoolander's friends playing at the gas pump - I was like wtf lol. It's also funny when he tries to reconnect to his roots and goes back to his family, and what he does in the mine (he just can't shake his model training) as well as him and Hansel trying to infiltrate the evil agency.

Well I have rented sooooo many Amazon unbox videos that I had run out of options so I decided to take the plunge and rent it. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. It definately was much funnier than I thought and I had a few good laughs. The costumes and hair are hilarious and Vince Vaughn as Zoolander's coal mining brother who didn't say a work cracked me up. There is a great many \\"cameos\\" that make the movie worthwhile and even has Paris Hilton in it 2 years before she bacame famous. Will Farrell does an expected funny job as does Owen Wilson.

It does have about 2 scenes that are a bit \\"risque\\" so you might want to be aware of that with kids but overall a comedy worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Stiller is the man!!!","review":"Zoolander is one of the funniest and stupidest movies of the year. I love stupid movies. Its a great spoof of the life of a model. It also spoofs off of great movies like enemy of the state, the godfather, and 2001. by the way the 2001 spoof is one of the funniset parts in the movie. Will Ferrel as always is awesome i can't wait untill he gets a movie all to himself. There is one scene in the movie that outstays it welcome and most people will hate it. Its the scene in which Zoolander gets hipnotized at first the hypnotizem is really funny but it just gets real annoying. Zoolander is stylish, funny, and worth while for people who love stupid movies. I hope to god there is a sequel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!","review":"This movie and the actors in it have an amazing ability to make you laugh at everything that is said and done. You can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it.I find myself(even if i haven't watched it recently)endlessly quoting lines from it. Two of my favorite actors, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, are an incredibly funny pair. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a slight sense of humor and they would love it.Definitely a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Funny Film that entertains.","review":"Ben Stiller always seems to have films that really hit or completely miss(There's Something About Mary and Meet The Parents as opposed to Mystery Men and Keeping The Faith). This film does both, but in the end I am giving it a positive review because it hits more than it misses. The plot is flimsy, and many of the scenes are downright stupid, but yet I found myself laughing in many of the scenes. Stiller is very funny as the dim bulb model, and Will Ferrell does a good job as the villian. The actor that makes the film work is Owen Wilson. As soon as is part gets bigger, the movie gets better and funnier. Wilson is a very good actor who also was hilarious in Meet The Parents. While this film wasn't great, it was still better than most of the live action comedies released this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoolander?","review":"More like Snoozlander. Nothing funny here, folks. Move along. I have 11 more words but I honestly can't think of a way to fill them as this movie was as vapid as the industry it tries to make fun of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children, cover your eyes up??","review":"Zoolander, starring Ben Stiller. After seeing Meet the Parents I had high hopes for this film. Meet the Parents was a hilarious comedy in which Ben Stiller performed astoundingly. In Zoolander, the movie had it's funny parts, but, during scenes such as the massage parlor seen, is this really appropraite for some kids who will see this movie? Some kids that see it that are 10 or so that are allowed to see PG-13 movies because they are \\"not that bad\\" might not even know what is going on in this part. Although this movie was overall, a good movie, I do not suggest children in 6 or 7th grade and under to see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny for a while....","review":"Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), the greatest male model in the world, teams up with his archrival Hansel (Owen Wilson) to foil an assassination plot against the Malaysian foreign minister for planning to abolish child labor. This film takes some effective digs at the fatuity and insipidness of the fashion industry and its dependance on underpaid labor, and Stiller and Wilson are terrific, but this is essentially a one-joke film and the joke wears thin pretty quick. Wil Ferrell does a great job as the evil fashion magnate Mugatu. I'm waiting for the breakout role that will make him a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused satire","review":"This is colourful but lightweight satire on the inanity of the fashion industry and male models in particular. Unfortunatley the makers apparently regard the film's audience as itself lacking critical faculties and intelligence, so the satire is obvious and inane rather like, um.... the notional male model."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was so surprised!","review":"I saw Zoolander because someone recommended it to me when I mentioned that I really wanted to see a comedy that didn't have the disgusting elements of Austin Powers (which doesn't even back up disgusting with funny) or Scary Movie (just plain ...). I didn't really think I would like Zoolander, but I took a chance and I loved it!I won't even attempt to describe the movie, as there are a surprising number of little plot complexities and I don't want to ruin the movie for the potential watcher. I'll just say that you have male models, vacuous empty brains, assisins, and tons of great eighties music. The whole thing is funny and ridiculous and doesn't even try to pretend that it's anything else.Some of the best stuff, though, is the extras on the DVD version. The VH1 fashion awards clips are hysterical as are the 'public service announcements' and a lot more. The extras alone are worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst movie of all time!!","review":"I only give this movie 1 star because I couldn't give less.

Ben Stiller is brainwashed by Will Ferrell to kill the president of Korea and the movie is about all the twists and turns as the day approaches.

It almost annoys me that people actually find this cheezy drivel funny! Although I am a Ben Stiller fan from his work in \\"Meet the Parents\\" and \\"There's Something About Mary,\\" this is by far his LEAST funny comedy. \\"Zoolander\\" gets 1 star only because there isn't a 0 star option. I know I sound like I'm ranting but trust me, do yourself a favor and never see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"Here we have mindless entertainment brought to us by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. It was in fact not as entertaining as I might have hoped. Although I found the tale of two competing male models who eventually join forces to be not quite as funny as it could be, the scenes of Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) visiting his father and brother (played by Jon Voight and Vince Vaughn) seeking their acceptance but not getting it rather funny... later when Voight cries in acknowledgment, \\"That's my son\\" as Zoolander unleashes his new \\"look\\" is also amusing, but that is all I can say for this film: it is mildly amusing but nothing I could not have lived without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Will Ferrell","review":"Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are great, but this is one of the funniest movies I've seen Will Ferrell in.

It's a very zany comedy, don't expect it to get serious for even one second. Besides the hilariously funny scenes such as the gasoline fight, the model \\"walkoff\\", the brainwashing scene, and the orgy, there are a lot of more subtle jokes that you can miss if you're not paying attention. This is definitely a movie you need to watch at least twice in order to catch everything. Every scene with Will Ferrell and his look-alike poodle is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and not funny enough","review":"I liked some of the recent stupid-funny movies, so I gave this one a look. I think I laughed maybe 8-10 times. I smiled once in a while. It started slow and seemed disconnected often, like jokes with a story trying to tie them together. The scene where Derek Zoolander has to hide out with his friend is so irrelevent to moving the story-line. The implied sex in that scene is also a waste. I \\"got\\" the spoofing. It just wasn't all that funny. It is a shame, because I really like Ben Stiller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical difficulties","review":"I bought this DVD as a replacement to the first one that had not been returned to me after letting some one borrow it. I had purchased the first one several years ago. I love the goofy humor of the movie, but when I played the first DVD, there were issues with the movie freezing momentarily, or stopping altogether. I was not sure if it was the DVD player or the copy. However, when I played my new copy, on a different DVD player, the same thing happened. I don't know if it's a distributor/manufacturer issue, operator issue, or just bad luck. Regardless, I still love the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"zoolander","review":"What wonderful acting! It must be very difficult to act that aloof and keep a straight face.

However, given the offal that I mistakenly rent on a weekly basis, I was not driven to shower or puke after watching it. No belly laughs, but a few guffaws.

What [the] reviews say is basically the people who reviewed them think the movie is stupid. Allright, i have to agree with them on that. But what i dont agree with is that they think stupid is a bad thing. This funny part about this movie is how stupid it is. Also, this movie is meant for younger people. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE THAT IS GOOD FOR OLDER PEOPLE. what i mean by that is that one of the key parts of being able to enjoy this movie is being young. Overall i would say that this movie is one of the best movies ever and it is very funny so it deserves a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Atrocious!","review":"Words simply can't describe how awful Zoolander is. I went into the theatre expecting to be doubled over in laughter the entire time. Half of the jokes from the previews aren't even in the movie, and trust me, the jokes in the previews are great compared to the ones in the actual movie! The plot is too ludicrous for words, revolving around a fading supermodel who is brainwashed to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. Ben Stiller is a far better actor than this film gives him credit for. He was hilarious in Meet the Parents, but here he's simply not funny. Zoolander is not without it's one-liners, but for the most part, its an absolutely terrible excuse for a movie.

It is probably funny for kids under eleven years old, what with all the urination jokes and non-material characters. Ben Stiller was funny in meet the parents, but this movie is boring and too predictable. It [stinks], so be advised to keep far away from this waste of time that further enriches Hollywood and its constantly falling standards of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoolander a Complete Bomb","review":"Ben Stiller playing a supermodel is a ridiculous premise from the get go, unless he's modeling for Horse Face magazine. This movie takes the Austin Powers concept and adapts it to the world of fashion. Great idea. :(~Problem: people like Bond movies, but do they give a hoot about fashion modeling? Probably not. But lifting from Austin Powers goes beyond just a premise: Zoolander's \\"blue steel\\" facial expression, his modeling trademark, is pretty much the Doctor Evil expression.

They are dated and difficult to read, but if you wish to have a better understanding of mathematics other than the often times socially distorted material you learn in the classroom, these are for you. It's an excellent introduction to Geometric Algebra, but the insane price for such a short book that does not go all that far into depth is just not worth it. It's 5 stars if you can buy a used one, 4 stars for the insane price of a new one. I would consider this book a luxury buy, but worth it if you're serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greenstreet and Lorre and a Chinese Goddess","review":"This is one of the best Noir films of the bunch.

Based on a marching-corps drumline, it lends itself perfectly to the classic dancehall beat, and the 'tickatickatick' of the drumline makes a hi-hat unncessary.I haven't listened to every single version on the album, but really, there's no need to go beyond Movado's 'Mr. Palmer,' Vybz Kartel's equally-menacing answer, 'Mofraudo,' Ward 21's '2000 Gyal' and my personal favorite, Delly Ranx's 'We Nuh Like Them.'Big up all dancehall massive.

It begins by laying out a helpful historical distribution of power existing in the Roman Empire's leadership. It makes the book accessible for the curious layperson as well as the academic.It places Roman law in its historical context in western civilization. From the original Twelve Tables, through Justinian's Code, to the author's reflection on its modern ramifications, it is a great read for ancient history buffs. It also provides a very rewarding challenge for the s layperson who is able stick with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inventive Fiction at its Best","review":"In a sense, society can be considered the connections between individuals, instead of the individuals themselves. This book explores one such connection, in the form of a series of letters between a married couple. Their connection is exposed as a frail and tenuous thing, buffeted by confusion, frustration, and yearning. Make no mistake though, this is not simply a novel about a relationship. This is avant garde literature of the highest rank. Mathews' wordplay is exceptional and he spins tales, in turn tragic and comic, in and out of the main narrative. The plot is less an arc than a contrail, tightly focused at one end and disturbingly hazy at the other. This is an exceptional novel for lovers of language who like their fiction unconventional. Also, I give Mathews high marks for one of the most imaginative uses of a title for a novel I've ever encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff really works and it tastes good","review":"I'm a college student with a pretty stressful life and I've never been a big believer in herbal remedies, but this stuff really seems to work.

You only find out about it when you get the product. When you try to find the software and computer attachment no one has it and it will be a long time before it is available. At $50 this is over rated and not presented as what it is. I would be very careful before I ever bought another item that was produced by this company.

They each tell of their past experiences, their present situation and their future aspirations. The ladies are very open, honest and candid in divulging their innermost secrets. This makes for a book you cannot stop reading until it is completed. The reader is compelled to read some of the stories more than once because they are so intriging. You feel you know each person and can identify with their humaness. Everyone has a story to tell. These ladies have done so in a riviting and inspiring manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Stories from Women about Life","review":"If you're a woman having a hard time with life...like the friend who shared this book with me...this book is especially for you. If you're a man having a hard time understanding life or women, this book is especially for you too! The stories of these women are riveting, as they take you through the lowest lows and highest highs of their life experiences on this planet. But best of all, these accomplished women show us how they triumphed over their adversities and healed themselves so they could create new lives of personal fulfillment and spiritual contentment. And those lessons are what so many of us need as we try to find happiness and fulfillment in these turbulent times. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant reference to most highlights of modern analysis","review":"Originally conceived as a quick introduction to modern operator theory, this book surveys from the very foundations of analysis (topological sapaces, normed spaces, etc.) up to a state-of-the-art exposition of integration theory, stepping through spectral theory, unbounded operators, and more.Its style is adequately abstract, rigorous and concise. Covers more material than most of the old-fashioned classical references on the subject.A must-reading for the graduate student. Even undregrads will find most parts acquaintable and useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly dense and concise; not for beginners","review":"Functional Analysis was the first course in mathematics where I truly struggled everyday. Although I was fairly comfortable with banach spaces after taking measure theory, I had a brutally difficult time digesting weak topologies and an even harder one understanding hilbert spaces. I would really recommend that undergrads take an introduction course to functional analysis before trying this text."},{"rating":"2","title":"tough but rewarding reading","review":"I used it as my introductory textbook to functional analysis. At the beginning I thought the prof was crazy. Indeed as a beginner it was a tough experience to learn from this book. I could still remember that I spend hours and hours checking his statements on weak and weak star topology in section 2.4 line by line... At the time I got really unhappy reading that book and complained a lot about it: its lack of intuitive explanation, its high density, its dry exercises... anything. But about 3 years after that reading, today I still benefit so much from that book. Whenever in studying PDE or probability, or operator algebras, hints and feelings suddenly jump out of that book from time to time. And finally I could see that the neat style of this book really gave me a good overall feeling on the subject; and the hard work of checking details left to the reader educates me a good habit of learning mathematics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality Control","review":"Do not buy this drive.Our company bought about 12 of these, as an economical large-storage and backup solution. 3 have already failed within 2 months, and I am having to think up other backup solutions in anticipation of the next one. The failure mode is very similar to what some of the other reviews have said on this site and others (try PCWorld too) - the platter starts making some racket and the thing just quits.

I really think that is a problem they need to address.... The drive seemed to work fine for a few days, then made a series of loud grinding noises and died. I don't know for a fact but I suspect the lack of an on / off switch had a part in the ultimate failure of the drive.

I purchased a new unit, and had it replaced twice, and all three of them died in a similar fashion. I believe the heat gets too high in these (there is no built in fan), and eventually the drives give out. I had them replaced under warranty each time, but losing your data is NOT fun especially if you don't have a backup.I would highly recommend you look elsewhere. Maxtor could not have created a worse product. Three NEW drives going bad in succession has to tell you something about the quality!I'm well versed in HD technology, and I tried to recover the data each time by using the drives internally after removing them from the enclosure. It was clear the drives themselves were the problem each time because of the noises they would make (tell tale clicking sounds).Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs that immediately seize you","review":"There are some albums that require a few listens before you're even sure you really LIKE it! And there are those rare albums that you feel you have always known as you listen for the first time. I don't understand the mystery of that but it's such a joy when you discover one. I ordered this album \\"sight unseen\\" - based on a written review in a country/western book. James' voice reminds me of a cross between Elvis and Marty Robbins. Every single song on this album is either contagious or haunting. Each cut seems important. (No throwaway tracks here.)

It worked amazingly.On its third run on the third week, the mixer stopped working while it was kneading bread dough. It just kind of got stuck in the dough and couldn't push through the dough's resistance. The motor still seemed to be working, but instead of turning the dough hook (which stayed dead still), the motor kept making unbearably loud and obnoxious noises. It still didn't work when I dislodged the bit from the dough, too. I am so disappointed.

(I'm trying to think of some other things) the effects of the 2002 World Cup on development. There's a lot of Japan's most modern history that's been left out.If there was an updated version of this book somewhere, I'd recommend that.

I thought it was one of the best historical fiction books I have ever read. Some characters in this book, such as Hanna Siegel, need more development to justify taking up so many pages, but other than that, I thought it was very well written.I have a 50-100-page rule when I read a book. If I am not slightly interested in a character when I reach these pages, I just stop reading and move to the next book. On Secret Service pushed the limits because it spends much of the beginning skipping from character to character, and you are not sure when each will pop up again. However, in the end, this book kept my attention very well. My total reading time was 7 hours, which I completed almost continuously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Topic, Very Poor Execution","review":"I am a fan of John Jakes.

Besides romance, the reader sees first hand the riots in Baltimore and New York, military prisons in Richmond and Washington, ruthless secret services of both North and South, and the heavy price often paid by ordinary people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Lives in the Civil War","review":"I am a big fan of John Jakes. ON SECRET SERVICE is as good as all his other books; the difference is that it stands alone and is not part of a series. The books tells the story of how the modern-day government Secret Service agency began during the Civil War. It's really interesting to read how it started from untrained amateurs, what tactics it used and how it infringed on individual rights...especially in consideration of today's operatives in the Secret Service and CIA. It is, however, more than just a story about this service. It is a wonderful historical fiction about how the Civil War affected the lives of ordinary people and how it truly tore our country apart. It also gives great insight into Lincoln and the original Pinkerton Detective Agency. If you hated studying the Civil War and know little about it, this book will change that."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating discussion","review":"this book explains the relevance of the little-known, now un-sainted Saint Wilgefortis.

I'd already opened the package so I took the blade out and cast the handle into the box empty. Then I came back and ordered a blade with a cap.

I always assumed it was just a temporary glitch with our ISP. After seeing the orange failure light way too much over the last month and especially last couple of weeks, I finally had a tech from our ISP come out to determine what was the problem. He was confident that it was the modem, not the high-speed Internet service. I don't know how he determined this, but he thought there was something wrong with the power supply to the unit. The thing had begun power cycling just if you touched it. Of course, this product failure happened just a heartbeat AFTER the warranty expired. I bought this cable modem back when the reviews were better, around 3 years ago. Maybe 3 years is a long life, but I would expect longer for something that just sits there, with no moving mechanical parts.

For the next week it would intermitently connect to the Internet for a few hours and fail again for a few hours until it died completely. I called Customer Service, which seems to be overseas, and their technicians were terrible. In two calls I had conflicting answers and they did not seem to know how to troubleshoot the problem; they kept asking me to ping addresses unrelated to the modem and they kept refering to it as a router. Once they decided that it is defective they asked me to pay for shipping charges to replace my brand new modem which amounted to 25% of the cost of the product.

My son's literay tastes run to Robertson Davies and other highly literate authors, so I took his comments as being quite positive. And, he was right.Alloway has taken the skeleton of little known and oft neglected biblical stories and overlaid a richness of detail and dialogue to illuminate the rawness of life in the crucible of experience of early modern humanity's struggle to reconcile the inner world with the harshness of the social environment, itself a reflection of harshness of the physical environment.This is a book for those willing to travel beyond the superficial to the highly personal, intimate effort that every person must make to encounter the reality and meaning of his or her existence and reason for existence. It is a book for the robust explorer of spirituality in the world of pain and wonder and searching and confusion and insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAT CAN BLOW!","review":"I don't know why there are no samples here to listen to but believe me they would not do justice to the sounds that Saxman is putting down.

As a motorcycle rider, I've dreamed of international riding, but never had the gumption to undertake something of this magnitude.Glen's writing style in this, his first book, is a bit amateurish and rough around the edges, but the story is of such gripping immediacy that I can forgive his occasional repetitions and minor inconsistencies of style (I'm married to a technical writer, so I'm a bit sensitive to this sort of thing).I think the title is a somewhat unfortunate choice, as his kidnapping by the Columbian terrorists was really only one episode of the journey, but on the other hand it was a life changing event and undeniably had a major impact in Glen's outlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quote on page 357, paragraph 2 sums it all up.","review":"Written for the \\"Good Morning America\\" television audience.

I live vicariously through the adventures of other people and boy, was this an adventure. What makes this book even more delicious is Glen's use of the written word. He tells the story so completely and brings the whole feeling to life that you are actually traveling with him. You won't go far once you sit down with this book in your hands and some good reading time. How great to have writers like this tell us what other people and other countries are like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"For some reason I don't believe this book. The whole book seems like some kind of hoax - a planned event. There are several wonderful places a man going through a mid-life crisis can explore on a motorcycle to find himself; Glen seems begging for all of these horrible things to happen to him. The author is a bit full of himself and his uncultured descriptions of the places and faces he encounters are a complete bore. I admit that when I purchased this book I was searching for the innocent escape I reaped by reading \\"Jupiter's Travels\\" by Ted Simon, not an ego charged, made for t.v. action adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left deflated...","review":"Really disappointed in the book. I'm actually forcing myself to finish it. The authors story telling is vague and treats the reader as if they've never been on vacation or ridden a motorcycle. He writes it as if the general public will read it instead of motorcyclist which I find hard to believe. No motorcycle details and alot of \\"Sun on your face and wind in your hair...\\" fluff. Or I should say rain on your face. He had a great adventure and an extraordinary tale of captivity but a writer he is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for the adventurer!","review":"I found it very enjoyable and read it all in 2 settings.

Anyway, I bought this one today and I was quite reluctant about buying it being thirty dollars and a nerf gun, but with a winning ruling by any minie miney moe, I bought it. It comes with 20 velcro darts which is pretty sweet and it also comes with 2 clips which can clip onto your belt which is also pretty sweet. So you put a clip in the front, pump it about 20 times or until it starts squeeking and then you hold down the trigger and it shoots all 10 of the darts in the clip with in 2 seconds. It's very shoking being shot with this. It is possible to shoot one at a time lightly pressing on the trigger. The only problem with this gun is that you run out of ammo so fast, but I guess that's why it comes with an extra clip. It also comes with the vest and shades which make you look really cool. Fully pumped, it shoots the darts about 30 feet"},{"rating":"2","title":"good dart gun","review":"I couldn't find the longshot for a long time so I got this one. This is a great nerf gun once you get it pumped. There are several downsides to this gun. One of them is the fact that it takes a great deal of effort to pump. The other downside is if you didn't pump it all of the way and you can only fire say, half a clip, you have to pump it again and the clip tends to fall down and you end up launching air instead of darts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique design, slightly disappointed in performance.","review":"I have a substantial Nerf armory, and I liked the concept of this gun, but it failed in execution. I dont like the new wave of battery powered nerf guns, so I thought this air powered one would be a neat addition. The biggest flaw in the design is the pressure. In most cases the tank doesnt hold enough pressure to feed through the entire clip, leaving the bottom few darts in the gun. I've pumped the hell out of the thing and 3 out of 4 times it fails to fire the entire clip. Its not my favorite gun so I'll probably tear it down and see if I can fiddle with the seals.

Fine, except for an abrupt reversal of these endearing traits halfway through the film. And of course their clumsy attempts to escape mayhem at the hands of bad guys that come out of NOWHERE (and everywhere) begs the great philosophical question: when Wiley Coyote is being chased by a train, why doesn't he just step off the tracks? As mindless action goes, it's not a bad flick; although rumor has it that the animators at Disnry passed on it, and left the producers scrambling for the appropriate actors to play the leads. Then came...Bronsons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Charles Bronson Film","review":"What's with all the bad reviews everybody? It's a Charles Bronson action picture for goodness sakes. We have explosions, we have action, and we get to see Bronson act with his beautiful wife, Jill Ireland. What we have here is an hour and a half of fun on the silver screen. Bronson will be remembered as one of the best action film heroes. SO, don't go into this film, with your brain turned on, turn it off and you'll enjoy it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Buffalo Jump\\" is a very enjoyable romance.","review":"The \\"romance\\" in Buffalo Jump starts off more as a \\"business\\" proposition between two very logical people who need each other to run a ranch.

I wish I would know what was the actual goal of Mr. Sharifi to make this album. Did he want to present Persian music to the westerner? If the answer is yes, Axiom Of Choice is a superb example of doing that. In this album Sharifi gets totally mixed up and represents a mixture of Persian, Chinese, African, and modern 20th century style of classical music and the result is a catastrophe. He tries to imitate the Middle Eastern musical instruments with his keyboard very unprofessionally. On the other hand, Axiom of choice brings you the original music instruments mixed with keyboard in the most beautiful fashion.

American accents, etc.-Instruments: 4/5 Very authentic, and tight.-Choice of Beatles vs. Xmas Songs: 1/5 This is where it really sounds like they're forcing the issue. Some songs are so bad, that they're unlistenable (my wife actually asked me on Christmas Day to \\"please turn it off\\" after only 2 songs).Save your money, and buy The Fab Four's version.Bobbie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Practical!","review":"I love this bag!

Stone taught himself Greek so he could learn directly from the original source material that's still extant about the trial and execution of Socrates.

Then get into this DVD and as in any yoga practice, use it at your own pace, practice with your own pace. It's a lifelong practice so don't expect to be all bendy and flexible as the instructors.

The relationship between Kosovars and Albania Albanians on a lower level than politicians. The shock of Kosovars seeing the poverty in Albania and the anger towards them from their kin in that poor country. Writing about politicians and what they did is just documenting what was for public consumption. And to the reviewer before me.. if this was propganda, then it was very poor propaganda. A greater Albania or any Country in the Balkans can make sense on paper, but reality can be a bitch. So read it with a beer and a grain of salt.. step away and have another beer. Nothing special here."},{"rating":"1","title":"False False False","review":"Went throught it, very poorly written from a pro-albanian perspective. Now if you go to a search Engine and put in Greater Albania, you'll get journalists reporting facts and Profesors political analytical points of views on facts that will give you a much more professional insight into the subject. Just don't bother buying this, its only worth burning it in the fireplace to keep warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Good for cutting posters 27 x 41.

Elise is so beautiful and graceful making all of it look easy and painless. Couldn't be farther from the truth! Seriously! I've danced and workout for years and this 60 minute work is great! You will sweat and burn fat all the while with a smile on your face because the instructor is so serene and in a lovely setting.I recommend this to anyone who was wants to shape their rump and lengthen their stance. It's a great strenght building exersice. If you have dance in your past or your dancing now it's a great bar exercise she goes over every warm up in every dance classes I'e been to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I really like this workout! It is calming and fluid but really works your muscles. It's a nice change in my routine and I recommend it for anyone wanting to lengthen and tone your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome work out","review":"This was exactly what i was looking for to supplement my workout. She's a great teacher and the setting is beautiful. She is a little to hippy for me. But Understanding where she works its to be expected. Other then that I have no complaints. It's a lovely workout and anyone who has dance before will catch on quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent conditioning","review":"This is a great workout DVD for strength and dance conditioning; it is quite a challenge the first few times,and left me sore for days - which, in a workout, is a desirable outcome. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout-bad music","review":"I have danced ballet for many years and like the dvd because it did do typical ballet movements. The dvd is not easy, and it does work your muscles. My only complaint was the music. Musicality is arguable the most important aspect of ballet. The elevator music was a drag, and to be a true ballet workout, there should have been classical music or at least something besides elevator music. The instructor is pleasant, but I was surprised to see that she had been a professional ballet dancer due to her lack of technique in certain areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first few times it was a challenge to complete but it's fun!","review":"I really like this DVD. At the beginning it was hard to for me as a beginner. The first time I only completed the first 15 minutes and my arms were in pain but I don't workout regularly. After the fifth time I was able to complete the workout. The movements are very elegant and I felt like a real ballerina it's fun to do and the movements are easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Challenging workout","review":"I just purchased this DVD after reading a recommendation in Shape Magazine. Just by looking at the video you it doesn't look difficult and very easy but it's actually a challenging workout. The instructor is great too, she is make it easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic :->","review":"I have to start out by saying that I'm not normally a ballet fan or have done ballet since I was 4 or 5, but I wanted to try this to mix up my current routine and use different muscles for some cross training. I am really happy with how great this workout is.It's an intense lower body workout with ballet inspired moves. Because you work deep into muscles, it's designed to help you get that long lean body look that ballet dancers have. Elise is a good instructor with great cuing so you know what to do next at all times. I love the outdoor setting (instead of the inside of a studio for a change); it's great to do a workout that has been done outside to make you feel like it's Summer all year round and motivate you that little bit more.I never thought this would be a workout that would be for me, but it's very enjoyable and fun and you feel the next day all those muscles you've used and I can't wait to see the results from this. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballerina amatuer","review":"My legs were SHAKING after completing this workout and I've been doing the NYC Ballet workouts 1 and 2 for over a year plus 2 ballet classes once a week and an hour of cardio on the treadmill 5 days a week. This is a great workout and she makes you feel like a beautiful ballet dancer no matter your skill level. I can't wait to keep doing this workout-- I want to see what I look like in a month!!Tip--- the only chair I had on hand wasn't tall enough or sturdy enough for this workout. I recommend a tall chair that doesn't fold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"This dvd is very good. I do exercise on regular basis. But, I can tell you that you will notice that your working a part of your muscles that you never use before. You will feel the difference. Is good because you will develop more balance, a better posture and you also will challenging your muscles in a different way. And the option with the chair is so good for those who don't have a bar in their house. And when you have enough time practicing this dvd you can also try it without the chair for do it more challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Excellent basic video, great at strengthening the legs and hits the core quite well, weather you realize it or not! First few times you do the video you think man I can't raise my leg very high, but with a little persistence the next thing you know getting your leg to hip level doesn't take much at all! I started this video after a knee injury and wanted to gain strength as quick as possible (I'm impatient!). At first, Attitudes and Rond de Jambe's just about killed me, but a good month of practice I amazed myself at the height I could get. There are quite a few moves that I use as my warm up now, part of my regular workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"a graceful, but tough workout","review":"It's a helpful exercise for those trying to improve their posture and push the limits of flexibility. While she makes you work hard, Gulan does it with a grace of a ballerina, making the workout more pleasant and less stressful. She explains every move, but doesn't stop to talk -- no time wasted.My only criticism of the workout is that it can be hard on knees.For those unfamiliar or new to ballet conditioning, I would suggest practicing yoga and/or pilates with lots of stretching prior to trying Gulan's workout. While one will become more flexible after a few sessions of ballet conditioning, prior stretching and strength-building will help make the most out of this workout and in less time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is a great workout video that really works your muscles! It focuses on lower-body strength but also adds in some arm strength and a few ab workouts. What it is, is basically warm-ups you do in your ballet class with a higher intensity. If you've never done ballet before, do not assume that it's relaxed and easy. You make it look graceful, but the moves itself are intense and challenging. But they are also doable even for someone who has never done ballet before. Just know how to point your feet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Dancer :)","review":"I have never taken dance in my life-- and ballet is completely foreign to me! I just did the video for the first time, it was easy to follow, and gave me an intense and amazing leg workout! I had just hurt my hip recently, and have had to tone down my workouts-- this is my solution, and I couldn't be more satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I studied ballet for about 12 years and really enjoyed this DVD. It is essentially the barre portion of a ballet class with some things that would typically be done center floor included. This was always my favorite portion of class and it is a great strengthening workout. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I think if you have no ballet experience you might not get as much out of some of the movement if you don't know the technique. For example, a tendu should use muscles all the way up your leg, which is why it is a good exercise. But if you don't know this, it kind of just looks like sliding your foot on the floor and you wouldn't get much of a workout. I think she could have done a better job of explaining technique for those who are not familiar. I will definitely be using it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I have several workout DVD's, but this is by far one of my favorites. I've never taken ballet, but am an avid, intermediate-to-advanced level exerciser. Over the years I've tried several different workout routines and I tend to get intrigued by new fitness methods and ideologies, often to be disappointed. This workout is an exception. I'm not sure why, but I feel just plain good when I'm done ~ I stand taller, feel (if not look) graceful, and am more aware of my body and posture. If you're looking for intense, high-impact, serious sweat-inducing cardio, this is not for you. But if you want a lovely, fluid, yet challenging workout that will build lean muscle strength, increase balance, and leave you feeling serene and relaxed, try this one. Another note: I'm picky about my instructors and let me say, Elise is a darling ~ she's encouraging but never patronizing, and she doesn't irk me in the slightest."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Thighs are Burning!","review":"I bought this after trying the new Shape Bikini Body 20 min. makeover. I was impressed with Elise Gulan, searched her name and found this. I thought I was in pretty good shape, then I did this workout.... my thighs were burning!! For legs, it doesn't get much better than this! She does some core work at the end that is pretty tough too. Highly recommended leg workout, plus it'll help improve your posture =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This video is a great workout! This was my first barre exercise video, and I loved this one. She has you stand just like a ballet dancer. She moves slow enough so you can keep up, but fast enough to make your heart pump. She has you hold your arms in proper ballet form. The next few days after doing this video, my muscles were tired. It's a great video!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this video","review":"This video is overall really great! The movements definitely improve muscle tone and posture and the brief series of jumps get your heart rate up. At the end there is an intense ab workout that is also VERY effective. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the video is dubbed and it is slightly odd listening to directions while watching the woman doing the moves just smile. Overall really great video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Element: Ballet Conditioning","review":"Wow! This workout kicks serious butt, which is perfect if you need to reduce the size of yours. I have only done the workout once and although I am sore I will keep on using it. The movements are so graceful. It takes me back to when I took ballet class a few years ago. The instructor doesn't make you feel bad for not being able to do everything perfectly. The idea is to keep at it and eventually your effort will pay off. It's definitely challenging and my goal is to be able to do the entire workout without my legs quivering like jello after 10 minutes....okay 5 minutes. Baby steps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I was really excited about this one but it's not that great. I stopped after about 10 minutes because I was pretty bored with the routine. I also agree with the other people that it hurts your knees!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I actually loved the music, scenery, workout and I am just getting into ballet in my late 40s. This is a nice alternative to the NYC ballet DVDs I also use. It's relaxing and not intimidating so great for newbies. I'm in great shape but ballet has helped the back of my legs the most and this DVD has plenty of leg work. It is fun and really does feel like you're taking a class at a beautiful day spa."},{"rating":"2","title":"My body hurts...!","review":"This is an awesome workout.. and yes, my body hurts!I am a pretty conditioned person and no stranger ot working out, but I had to stop several times to stretch, this gave my muscles such a work out.I would recommend this workout to anyone, especially in conjunction with other workouts. It is challenging and fun.I don't like the music, though... Other than that, great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This is a easy to follow workout that can be done in anyone's living room. I feel stronger every time I put it in my DVD player. No matter how far you get through the DVD, your muscles will be worked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"As a complete beginner to ballet, this DVD was quite difficult to follow. I expected the tutorial to give a basic introduction to ballet basics before going into the harder exercises, which it did not do. The instructor, though pleasant enough, begins using technical terms within the first few minutes of the video, never explaining how positions should look and feel throughout the body. She also does not thoroughly explain many of techniques. For example, she will say 'Leg up, lift up', whereas I would like to know which muscles should be used and which you should be feeling, posture, and core positioning. This is particularly irritating with most of the leg stretches, in which I'm not sure whether to push through my heels or through my toes, tighten hips or relax them, etc.It seems more suited for people who have had some sort of ballet or dance training in the past, but I would not recommend it for absolute beginners who are looking for a step-by-step guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides an amazing Full Body workout!!!!","review":"I read about the Ballet Conditioning video in Shape magazine; so I figured that it had to be decent in order to receive a review. I had no idea that the workout was going to be this good. This video provides an amazing full body workout. It is easy to do and uses your own body weight to tone and condition. It challenges your endurance and strength. I have been using this video to workout for about a week and a half and my body is already toning up. I haven't even made it through the whole video once yet. I have done dance videos before but none with the challenges and results that this video provides. I bought another ballet video along with this one (because it was recommended as a good addition to this video) that was $20 more expensive, and it absolutely sucks compared to this one. You owe it to yourself to try this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"This is not a conditioning class; it's simply a beginning ballet class taught by a very average ballet dancer. I wouldn't even recommend it to a beginner ballet student because you're liable to pick up some bad habits like sticking out your thumbs, and not working through your feet, both of which the teacher does routinely. And she doesn't have any business talking about how to develop the long, lean look of a dancer -- which she does ad nauseum -- since that's not the type of body she has. She has a nice figure, but it's definitely not a ballet dancer's body. If she has primarily been using dance as her means of exercise (as she implies) then she's been using her quadriceps to lift her legs into developpe, which is a definite no-no. If she comes out with an actual conditioning DVD, that might be good, but this one has no redeeming value to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and disappointing","review":"I studied ballet intensely when young and was looking for a video to bring back the joy of doing a barre to classical music. The annoying sound track of this is matched by the instructor's robotic personality. There is no vigor or energy here and the tone is condescending. For ballet, look elsewhere! Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!","review":"Having taken ballet as a youngster, I thought this would be a good low impact \\"work out.\\" This was a disappointment. The exercises are so simple that the DVD should really be marketed to older people. I can see how it would benefit someone who has limited mobility, but for the average adult, this is child's play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good video","review":"A challenging workout tailored for the beginning ballet dancer to strengthen those muscles essential for good technique. I wish I found this video when I started ballet. It introduced many of the terms used in class and is very easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just OK...","review":"I did enjoy this video but that's because I enjoy ballet. As a new stay-at-home-mom I was looking for a way to feel motivated to do ballet without having to leave my living room. (I used to dance years ago). This was just not enough for me. I was looking for more than bar exercises. I already know how to do this kind of workout at home and was looking for something that was a tiny bit more challenging. I also did not like that she wasn't even in ballet style clothing, like the cover leads you to believe. It does motivate me though to at least stretch my legs a bit but if you know anything about ballet, it might not be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love ballet, so I thought this would be a fun workout. I was wrong. If you don't already have high flexibility, you will be more frustrated then energised. The instructions are vauge. There are few moderations given, and you can easily strain a muscle. Beware if you are exercising in a room with fragile items, as there is a section of constant jumping. I left this workout annoyed at my wasted time and will not return again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, not very challenging","review":"I don't understand all the positive reviews. I like these type of workouts (big fan of Cardio Fusion and Lotte Berk), but this one didn't do anything.I wish it would have been more challenging, usually after the first time on a good workout DVD, I can feel it somewhat the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful DVD for very reasonable price","review":"If you are like me who has no dancing history, mid-aged, but looking for a comprehensive workout with grace, this is the first and best one to be choosen. dancer is so gorgeous, intruction is clear, video is beautifully made. It is a such joy to follow her exercise everyday. In this DVD, mostly is stationary movement, I am really looking forward to see more her ballet workout DVD with more moving flows, the conbination of movements in it. if so, I will certainly buy it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good!","review":"I really dislike this DVD. I think her technique is very poor and don't like her combinations much. The scenery is very beautiful but the workout is not great. There are so many better workouts based on ballet out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I used to take ballet and those classes were a lot more fun. I was expecting to get the same motivation I would receive in a class... but this was blah..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer","review":"Oh Lordy, when she does the intense leg workout near the beginning of the video, I almost cry each time. However, the exercises are mostly fun to go through, and while the first few times are hard to follow, once you learn the moves it's easy to go along with her. At the end, there's another killer workout, this time the abs, but then you get a nice cool down, though it does feel a little short. Overall, I enjoy this video, and it is challenging for a beginning worker outer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little bit boring","review":"Perhaps ballet is meant to be a bit more meditative, quiet, serene... that is the mood of this video, but with those calming, repetitive movements comes a bit of boredom. Yes, I felt my muscles aching the next day, but I never worked up much of a sweat (for me, this would have to replace weight training and NOT cardio), and I haven't found myself popping it back in the DVD player. It's a beautifully made DVD, the setting and sound reminds me of many of the yoga DVDs I have done, but I just don't want to do it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ballet conditioning","review":"I LIKE THIS BALLET CONDITIONING VIDEO VERY MUCH IT CAN ALSO BE USED AS A SORT OF WARMING UP, COOLING DOWN OR STRETCHING EXERCISE FOR EXAMPLE BEFORE STARTING WITH CARDIO EXERCISES OR WALKING ON THE TREADMILL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch! In a good way...","review":"I am not a fan of exercise tapes, but this seemed different and I wanted to try it out. After one work out, I can't even sit down!

I also liked that all you need is a chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"great home excercise","review":"I ordered Element: Ballet Conditioning after viewing a library copy and following the ballet excercise instructions in the DVD.Was so impressed with the stretches and basic ballet steps in the DVD, that I searched for it on Amazon and found it easily and that it was available at a reasonable price.The instructor explains what each exercise is doing for your body while you are taking part in the ballet steps she is demonstrating, she is encouraging and instructive, and you feel you have accomplished a lot at the end.I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine an Exercise Class where You Feel BEAUTIFUL on Day 1 !!!","review":"This DVD is Amazing. From the first 5 minutes you feel like a dancer. Totally inspiring. So hard I can only do a little of it, but she is so inspiring and encouraging that I feel like I will someday be able to do the whole workout, as beautifully as she does.

Strength and Flexibility!","review":"I popped in this DVD today for a gentler workout. Ha ha! I run, swim, pilates, yoga. I considered myself in flexible and in decent shape, until TODAY... It's been a long time since anyone has had my legs start shaking halfway through a workout. Elise is stunningly beautiful and her soothing voice is encouraging. When she tells you to smile, I knew then for certain that ballerinas truly grin and bear it. This is a DVD that I will be using regularly.This is relatively low impact, not a whole lot of crazy jumping. There is some jumping however, but no cutting motions that strain knee ligaments. Think one gentle squat to another. If you cannot squat at all, I would not recommend this DVD for you. You will also need a chair to help support with balance.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the purchase","review":"I do not have a dancers body for starters but I am always looking for a great leg workout. This works well! The movements are controlled and not rushed. Easy to follow and the music is nice. Not a DVD to get bored with. I like that it wasn't in segiments and flowed through. I will try other DVD's by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"I bought this DVD because I wanted a low impact workout with stretching, and I like barre style workouts. This workout is no joke. There were some things that I just could not do. There is a lot of repetition that might make this seem boring for some, but I liked it. I really felt it the next day as well. As to those who feel the need to comment on this lady's body and how she doesn't have a dancer's physique, have you looked at her? She has seriously muscular legs and a really well-defined rear end. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this lady's body. I recommend this DVD if you are looking for something that is low impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Out!","review":"After losing a lot of weight and being very active for a few months, I thought that I would start with Ballet for a more regular exercise plan. I figured muscle memory would be my friend. Ha! This is tough. I am sure if you are used to working out regularly it wouldn't been too much but this work out hits muscles you aren't using when you walk, run or bike. I will keep working at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most sore I have been since basic training","review":"I was very impressed with this workout DVD, a lot of people's reviews talk about it being an intensive lower body workout, but I have to say I find it to be the most complete full body workout I have experienced since Air Force Basic Training. I can't name a muscle in my body that isn't feeling it the next day. Most workout DVDs I have tried will work some area of the body, but this is a full body workout at its best. Also, it is excellent if you don't have a lot of money to spend on expensive equipment or gym membership--it only requires a chair...my only suggestion is that women make sure they are wearing a good sports bra while doing the workout as the jumps can be a little intense. Overall, I felt every bit as worked out as when I go the actual gym without having to leave the comfort of my living room...or my two sleeping children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice results","review":"This is a lovely, deceptively challenging workout. Anyone watching you would think you were just mincing around playing ballerina, but it takes strength to hold your arm up for a long time while carrying your body weight on one leg and making small, precise movements with the other leg. I skip the section of \\"leaps.\\" At 58 years old, I'm done leaping. However, the standing work and very challenging ab work give the kind of lean body tone that most women want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!!","review":"I did this dvd for the first time two days ago and I can still feel my calves burning when I walk. The music was good, the instruction was excellent and the moves were amazing! I love ballet but this was a little more than ballet. It really is a conditioning dvd. It looks easy but once I started doing the exercises I quickly realized it was not. I will treasure this dvd and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to tone and tighten their body. I am not a ballet dancer so anyone can do it if I made it through. BRAVO!! I would give it more than 5-stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful burn!","review":"After reading the reviews of this dvd, I was inspired to give it a try. All I can say is that it lived up to my expectations! You will work up a sweat and really tone and lengthen your muscles. The cueing is easy to follow and creates an extremely smooth workout experience on the first try, even if you don't have a background in ballet (which I don't). The setting is peaceful and calm. The other wonderful detail about this dvd is that the exercises require very little space. If you have a chair and enough room to lay down on the floor, you are ready to go. As someone who travels quite a bit, I'll be able to do this complete workout in a hotel room without any trouble. This is a wonderful total body workout that leaves you feeling long, lean and strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Video","review":"I had never done ballet before but this video was easy to follow and has really improved my strength and flexibility.

While the author draws what is probably an honest-though-sympathetic view of union members, his view of business people is so skewed as to make his portrayal a joke. A heavy handed story that misses. Too bad, it might have been quite good, with a real editor and a less self-indulgent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"One can only suspend so much disbelief","review":"As we traipse from plot convenience to plot convenience, we learn about the lives of the one-dimensional residents of Elk River. The author has literally created a world of his own, where no outside influence may intrude. In his world, murder upon murder happen in a vacuum and nobody outside of this town notices? Yeah, right. A total ignorance of the legal process also serves as the means by which his evil character Tony Hunt gets everything done.Let's not forget the stereotypical policemen and union members in this town of 20,000 and one church.The plot was unique and had great potential.

You could definitely say that a lighter model like the 14volt DeWalt is more convenient for drywalling. And the hammerdrill function is only useful for very light work, like drilling the occasional anchor hole in brick. It is absolutely not a substitute for a real hammerdrill, even a small one like the Bosch bulldog. Nonetheless, it's very handy to have a drill like this in your holster. It can do 95% of what you need if you're doing basic residential home construction or remodeling. If you're a hobbyist, you could probably go with a lighter model, but this one really takes a beating. I abuse it - use it for things that I shouldn't, like running a mixing paddle for thinset - but it still runs straight and clean, handles finish work well. It's just a well-made tradesman's standby. I don't see how you could go wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is up with this drill?","review":"First. I have a workshop, barn and truck bed full of Dewalt tools and I would give every one of them a five or four rating. But this drill was nothing but problems for me and I returned it. The chuck adjustment was terrible, the speed(transmission switch) would not stay locked in position and the final straw was the distinctive sound of metal on metal and a wisp of smoke. This was within the first five hours of use. Given the number of great reviews this drill gets I am willing to accept that I got a lemon. I was not willing to take my chances on another. Just returning the drill is a long trip for me and we need tools that we can rely on. Our work is often done way \\"off the paved road\\" for you Foxworthy fans.

Everyone I work with (four people) owns this Dewalt drill and we have yet to take any of them to the repair shop. This drill has taken a few drops from about six feet and has worked without any failure afterwords. The only complaint I have is that a few of our drills get tempermental when trying to turn them into hammerdrill mode. After you fiddle with it for a second you can get the chuck to turn. I would buy another Dewalt drill even with this small problem. The drill has plenty of power for harsh use and the XRP battery lasts a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching music that stays with you for years","review":"I originally picked up this album on tape eight years ago on vacation. I had heard it in a souvenir shop and fell instantly in love. Once it entered my walkman, it didn't come out for the rest of the week! Since that vacation, I still listen to the tape, so much that I wore it down.The music here is seemingly very simple, but the harmonies and melodies are very moving. It is music that colors your life, and changes your attitude. Various instruments and sounds have been worked around piano melodies that range from soothing to toe-tapping to melancholy.All of the songs are eternally re-playable, but my favorite is 'Child of Dreams.' It is music that speaks of innocence and hope without ever having to say a word. I also recommend 'Restless Spirit' and 'Footsteps in the Sand' for truly beautiful music.Buy this CD if you love beautiful harmonies and moving music -- you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful photography book captured everyone","review":"wonderful preview the to World Wildlife. the pictures beautiful and great. photography excellent from mitsuaki. mitsuaki the best in the photography World Wildlife ."},{"rating":"1","title":"7 pages of errata - RIDICULOUS","review":"There are 7 PAGES of errata for this title. http://www.artechhouse.com/GetBLOB.asp?Name=leach%20errata.pdfMany of the critical figures are simply broken.

I was stunned at how much people didn't like the film. The film was a very interesting study of the gay underworld and Pacino's performance as a gay undercover cop was great. Although it does have some unexplained parts. Like the part where the naked cop is slapping Pacino and a killer suspect. I've watched the film many times and I still can't work out the ending. The only thing I can think of is that Pacino is the killer.Overall it was a great film with a few confusing moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruisin","review":"I really liked this movie.My brother has it on vhs.

I saw this kind of behavior first hand myself...mainly in the BIG cities like New York City,Washington,DC,and Atlanta,Ga..I can also see why many gay people didn't approve of this, seemed to think the public would think that this behavior was common and was practiced by ALL gay people...NOT True..Most every day gay folks were not like this...promiscuity to the extreme. Al Pacino does a great job in this role, one of many good performances during the 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambiguously Gay Al","review":"I was drawn to this film because I was told it wasn't as bad as it's reputation suggests and may have been ahead of it's time. What time? The Stone Age?! Every print of this flick should be burned and banned from human consumption. I've never been accused of being a champion of gay rights but I smell class action suit here. This flick is seamy and has no socially redeeming qualities. William Friedkin's direction is clueless. Al Pacino, in probably his worst performance, seems puzzled as to how to play his character. The script is consistently incoherent. The lone saving grace in this film is Paul Sorvino's portrayal of a police captain. Run from this flick if you ever get the urge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Although many dislike this film, including Mr. Pacino, I find it to be an intense, realistic and wonderfully acted New York Thriller.

Well that was then this is now,it does not stand the test of time. We were all bored and kept wondering what was it that we liked so much before? Maybe we are all so desencatized now days.so to put it in a nut shell it was really bad and not even bad in a campy way.there are so many movies you can watch over and over again and they hold up well...this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant think of anything good to say about this film.","review":"This was my first viewing of this film. Maybe I was expecting more, but I felt let down by the whole story line. Al Pacino does infact do very well in his part which seems to pull you into the film. Its a dark and depressing look at the overly stereotyped S&M and cruising scene in the 70's/80's. The shocking or disturbing murder scenes, with the exception of the first, are dull and lackluster. There was nothing disturbing about them. Bigger drawbacks were the overall gay scenes were not convincing enough. So much looked staged and rehearsed, specifically the cruising scenes in the woods or city. It felt like people were trying to hard to act the gay parts. The ending is a let down. The climax of the movie seemed to peter out in a film that should have ended 15 minutes ago. There are some good points to the film itself, but I cannot think of any at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME, TAME","review":"William Friedkin knows his way around a good thriller -- he made The Exorcist, after all, arguably the most potent, effective, garishly horrific thriller of all time. This movie, for all of its subliminal and outdated anti-gay sentiment, is so badly written and acted that in the end, it is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. It is one of those movies where the repugnant killings and dark, smoky, dangerous posturings come with no thrill, making them not only repugnant, but completely uninvolving. The ending is unintentionally hilarious. On the political side, it is no wonder, with propaganda like this, homosexuality got a bad rap in the 70s/early 80s...this movie portrays all of its many gay characters as pathetic vampire-ish creatures who live for the night and for dark, torturous encounters in hideously lit bars and back alleys. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still an important part of gay cinema history","review":"No matter what you think of the messages in this film, its important to realize it was groundbreaking nontheless. Especially so is what was really going on in the clubs at the time. I can tell you this is how it really was. Exciting and scary at the same time, you can see how a deadly disease could've spread so quickly. Put this in your DVD collection right next to Boys in the Band, Making Love and Priscilla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie - terrible DVD-version...!","review":"\\"Cruising\\" is a great, underrated movie, no doubt about that. Gay cult-filmmaker Bruce LaBruce was right when he wrote that no other film depicts the S&M-scene in NYC better than that film...there is just one big problem with this Special-Edition-DVD: William Friedkin couldn't resist tinkering with the visual style of the film. For example, he changed the colours, so that each scene either has a heavy blue-ish or green-ish tone to it. That looks silly and disturbs the realistic atmosphere of the film. Even more disastrously, he added visual effects to Pacino's famous dancing scene - probably to heighten the feeling that Pacino's character is getting crazy. (As if we didn't know). The problem is: those stroboscope-effects look horribly cheap and totally take you out of the scene. The scene was the emotional highlight of the film. Now it is the lowpoint. Friedkin ruined his own film. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally","review":"This movie has it's flaws but it is a film that takes place in time that has long past in New York.

Disregarding the obvious, pitiful, miscreant portrayal of the New York gay community, the story goes nowhere. This is a fault of the primary source, hands down.

It was absolutely awful. The scenes were choppy and hard to follow. The reasons for all the murders was never officially established. Al Pacino, as our hero, was in no way likeable. All of the scenes in the S&M leather bars seemes unrealistic. These scenes were over the top. It leaves you with the impression that Pacino has taken over the persona of the killer he was trying to capture. This movie was awful.

This happened, and Crusing initiated it.If it were a work of art,with merit, opening up issues, then the incident I went through might have been understood as insane people doing insane things.But Crusing is not art,and,it teaches hate and promotes physical violence toward gay people; and it is shocking that Friedkin, after Boys in the Band, could make such an anti gay film, and with such awful acting.It was and still remains one of the more shameful portraits of gays as predatory, promiscuous, and homocidal.Avoid this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruising","review":"The only reason worth watching is Pacino and Sorvino isn't bad either, the ending I am sure is what gets to most people as I hate open endings.It could have been way better had it not had the gay backstory(no pun intended) especially s&m and freddy mercury look-a-likes. Do I think this is representative of an actual people NO not all,Do I think it is Moral? NO. Of course that is none of my business but as long as you don't parade it around or force others to your culture(Homofascism).

I have had it now almost 2 months, and have charged it twice. However, since I am in the process of finishing my basement it has been used every day to drill many holes, drive countless screws, and also take care of odd jobs around the house. Idle charge drain is minimal on this battery - I went on vacation for a week, and when I came back it had plenty of charge left to drill about a dozen 1/2\\" holes for conduit.

My old Dewalt batteries wore out while I was building my house so I just went out and bought a Panasonic, which is awesome, by the way, to replace my Dewalt... didn't have time to mess around with batteries at the time. That was five years ago. I was cleaning out my shop the other day and found my old DeWalt... of course the wore out batteries hadn't improved with age, so I decided to take a chance with this new battery. Wow! This new battery is great. I charged it up for the first time and tested it out. drove a two inch drywall screw through a piece of pine and split the board and burried the screw in it. Lots of power.

But since they are expensive, I also want to get it or something similar on sale. So, I decided to replace the battery on the Dewalt. This battery is as others have described as being much better than the original, being stronger and holding a charge longer. I don't think I really need two batteries for the amount of time I use the drill. I also am not in a hurry to buy the new drill. The new battery is a little heavier, but the weight at that location on the drill seems to provide good stability. I thought the battery was a little pricy, but you probably get what you pay for.

I thought \\"OK no big deal\\" till I dropped one battery 3\\" onto my bench and the entire battery came apart. It looks like the factory over torqued the screws on assembly and broke every screw socket. I checked the other battery that I bought and it is in the same condition.

I couln't find a better price at the time of purchase anywhere else either on line or at a store. Upon receiving the batteries, the first thing I noticed was they were a bit larger than the orignal ones and would not fit in the drill case. When I plugged one into the drill, there was a noticeable increase in the power of the drill. In fact, you will think you are using a corded drill and if you don't keep a firm grip on the drill, it can twist out of your hand.

Normally I don't buy \\"no name\\" power tool products, but with the large price difference, I decided to try a non-brand 14.4 volt power pack to see how it holds up to the DeWalt brand. I bought this PWR+ Ni-cad pack several months ago and so far it has done very well, keeping a charge a long time and recharging quickly. Recently I needed to use my cordless drill and realized that I had not charged this power pack for some time.

The head on this thing is bulky making it a huge pain to use in your car on tight spaces.

It feels like the gears in this thing are loose because the handle moves half an inch before I actually put any force on the nut.I threw mine away, but for those looking to give a gift, similar tools can make a mechanic happy. Consider flex handle ratchets or roto-ratchets instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy tool!","review":"I am giving this tool 5 stars simply for its versatility and price. Being able to remove the ratchet from the handle and use in a drill is great for light duty tasks.

I know this isn't a hedge trimmer, but didn't perform the way I'd hoped or for what I wanted. Sad to say, it went back last week and I finished trimming my hedges with my hand driven old-fashioned lopper. It did a great job, but took a little extra time. Back to the drawing board for me.

Terrain, unit positions within each other, prescence of commanders, flank or rear attacks, surprise, morale, or anything else from more realistic battles have no effect.For these reasons, the game (TBFME), ends up being a flashy patchwork of sounclips and cinematics from Peter Jackson's superb movies and nothing more than a failed attempt at recreating the epic battles from Tolkien's masterpiece novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This could be a great game if you could play it.

Not a good situation to lose track of troops, or worse yet, of heros. The heros are an important part, as are the upgrades, and it's such fun to do a lightening sword shot with Gandalf.

You can be good or bad and travel throughout middle earth controlling the armies. The good campaign you control gondor rohan and the fellowship as you go through all the epic battles of middle earth and more.The good campaign is the funnest because you control the unique heros of the movie and book and lead them with an army at their backs through several fortress fights and enemy encounters. You fight all the way to mordor or lose hope and the quest will fail. I will not spoil much of the battles and surprises. But the negative things about this game would be the unrealisticness to the story and how it never changes and gets too easy.But the maps are amazing and great and the evil campaign is harder. but you siege middle earth altough they mistook the balrog for sauron.I think the game is worth buying, but still be careful because after awhile it DOES get old."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"the game its self is an amazing game but i bought the disc from amazon and its a pirated disc i have all these problems with my buildings blowing up and such"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings:The Battle for Middle Earth","review":"It is a way fun game for Lord of the Rings fans, and for people who are into the combat side of strategy games.

As one other reviewer pointed out, parts of the book are written in the style of fiction, presumably to make one feel like one was there. The tone of writing is flippant and condescending. The auther follows the lead of Goodrick-Clarke in blaming the phenomenon of Nazism on esotericism, rather than recognizing or admitting the truth that, as was their usual procedure, the Nazis simply distorted and appropriated those occult theories that were useful to their agenda in their distorted form.

The Cape Cod book was published by the Boston Musuem of Fine Arts and contained wonderful color saturated plates. Tuscany, on the other hand, looks like an amateur effort.

And there was not ONE photograph of the fields of sunflowers that Tuscany is famous for. Only a picture of dead ones in winter!Tuscany is breathtakingly gorgeous, and vast, with so much character!

Tiesto has just finally began to choke on his ego, and it will be the eventual complete demise of him. Tiesto is more concerned about spreading his name, and doesn't spend enough time in the studio.

It seemed to be the same old thing with Dance and Electronica, regardless of the artists (most of them, at least) that create these songs. \\"Dance4Life\\" was just someone reading this phrase \\"Dance for life\\" in a monotone voice - which I personally found to be boring at the least, and irritating as fingernails on a chalkboard at the most. The drum and bass might have been an interesting tempo, but the notes - an average of only 5 or 6 played until the melodic pattern repeats itself - were boring. Maybe I'm wrong, but the 29-second snippet of music that I am allowed to hear didn't help to influence me anymore into a more positive and encouraging review for this album.

In my opinion, this printer makes a great personal printer and could be used in a small office. The HP 2500 color laser cannot keep up with the demand of a high volume office. For my purposes, occasional documents and quarterly reports, this printer meets my needs. The time to print from cold start is a long one but this is a case for all color laser printers of this vintage. Yes, it make a lot of noise on start up. It is testing all the components.

I wouldn't recommend these collars for barbell curls let alone deadlifts or power cleans...they just don't keep the plates in place on the barbell's inner sleeve.It's too bad because they are nice looking collars and very light aluminum (with a steel cylinder) that supposedly locks against the sleeve. It is my guess that the cylinder because it is just a small rounded steel bar that engages against the sleeve just can't grip on a rounded sleeve and can only slide once bar and plates are in motion. The nylon handle will lock the cylinder in place with less than a full turn which raises doubt to how these clamps could possibly keep plates tight and in place on an olympic bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading in its Intended Audience","review":"This volume is strictly aimed towards lay persons serving as elders in various Christian denominations.

I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter because she would keep spilling her regular bubble bottle while trying to blow the bubbles. The problem with this one is that the wane is not smooth and the notches (hearts) catch while going in and out. She kept trying to get the wane out with force and then gave up. Also instead of a circle at the bottem of the wane from which you blow bubbles, there is a heart. I even had a very hard time blowing bubbles from the heart.I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inteligent music for inteligent people","review":"I have both this CD and the Four Dimonds CD and love them both.

The other reviews hail this volume as a \\"comprehensive resource\\" for multiple areas of study. The problem is, the definitions of each term are too broad to be useful to specialists and too random and/or inaccessible for people merely interested in these topics. Most of the terms are all so unrelated that I just don't see the point of owning this book. If you need a definition for \\"globalism\\" and \\"materialism,\\" buying this book would be useless. There are plenty of free resources online which also define such terms, and often more comprehensively than this broad overview.I can see why such a volume was viable when it was first printed in the 70's, but why it was reprinted in 2005 is beyond me.

Great dissapointment. It just doesn't sound like ELP. I admire Marc Bonilla for trying hard and playing ELP music, but sorry, his voice is no match to Gregg's (even now days, with what's left of Gregg's voice). And even more of the same with his guitar playing stile. Basist is o'k but makes the music sound too hard and monotonous for ELP. I don't see anything this guys doing better then original ELP unlike others say. Sound and picture quality is o'k. Bonus material isn't helpful unless somebody enjoys watching naked (Keith's?)ass. I wouldn't recommend this DVD. Buy ELP Live in Montreux instead, it's so much better.P.S. Front photo shows famous church in Petersburg. They couldn't find any nice shot in Moscow?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, Self Indulgent","review":"I'm glad Keith is still working in spite of his current physical maladies with his hands. Bonilla provides a good foil to Emerson's return to the stage without his ELP bandmates. But the live gig in Hungary, available as a bonus DVD with the Keith Emerson Band CD, is so much better. The Hungary rhythm section (bass and drums) was fresh and edgy. The Moscow rhythm section is not. I wouldn't really recommend this DVD: many of the works--most notably, Lucky Man and Tarkus--were marred by all that \\"heavy metal jamming\\" at the end. Also, I recall how cheesy Emerson's workstation pianos sounded this time around...Nice to have an official live version of \\"Touch and Go.\\" The Finale from the recent album is pretty thrilling, if not a little chaotic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"Yes, finally we have a DVD that truly represents the talent and power of Mr. Emerson. This is without a doubt the best video and audio representation in his and ELP's catalogue. The surround effects and bass response are the best I ever heard in a concert video. The band is great and the new music from Keith's latest cd is played excellent. You have to give Marc Bonilla much credit here for he being a great versatile musician has given Emerson a music challenge he hasn't had since ELP formed in 1970. If you have a surround sound system wait untill you hear the Moog!!! My only complaint is why not put the whole concert on the disk, oh well maybe on the Blu ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool camera work!","review":"I love this line-up (much prefer it to the first incarnation with Dave Kilminster) and it's wonderful to see the new material performed live. This concert is an energetic performance, you can tell the band are enjoying themselves, and it has its poignant moments, as well, like Miles Away and their interpretation of Lucky Man, which Marc Bonilla sings very well. It's a superior performance to the Paks Hungary set included on the Keith Emerson Band deluxe CD/DVD package, which does not include any new material.But one of the most fun things about it is the camera angles -- lots of overhead shots of Keith's keyboard playing, not just the typical shots from the side. As a keyboardist, I thoroughly enjoy watching just what exactly he is playing and how.And the photo gallery is quite entertaining, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding product","review":"Well packaged, clear manual in English and Spanish, well illustrated. Phillips screw driver was only tool necessary. A volt meter would be helpful if you are installing in a house which is \\"pre-wired\\" with two switches... one for the fan and one for the light. Fan and blades together weigh 26 lbs according to the box, so be prepared to hold the motor slightly above your head for a few seconds. I have 10 foot ceilings. Purchased an 18 inch downrod on a different website to match color. Globe fixture casts a rotating pattern on the ceiling. Downward facing lights would have preventing this. Maybe the manufacturer could have placed a shield above the globe. I own a solar powered house, so Energy Star fan important. High speed uses same power as 60 watt bulb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and easy to install","review":"I bought this fan from Walmart several months ago. It was relatively easy to install and it works without a hitch. I bought it because I wanted the white look without it looking too much like paint and the light maple side of these blades worked beautifully. I have very dark painted ceiling and the white washed look only stands out more. I plan on buying more I just hope Walmart will still carry it because I only paid around $100 from them. This is a good bit over that mark, but if worse comes to worse I will spend the extra money.

With a lot of talk of politics, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I promise that it makes up for it with drama, romance, intrigue, rather cool fighting scenes, and a great deal of humor. Laugh-out-loud funny, with a solid plot, and startling plot twists. The characters are simply amazing and well presented so that you can connect with them, some of whom have some rather fascinating oddities (one who always wears a mask, one who can get lost within two steps, etc), and you fall in love with all of them. Even the villains are fascinating and make you want to see more of them! The English dub, which I was rather worried about, is actually one of the better jobs I've seen done (good choice of voice actors as well). So I rate this a MUST see, it has something for everyone, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saiunkoku Monogatari","review":"Amazing.

I've performed the same test with several other cases which always seem to break at least one. (except for the hiscox) But this kind of quality for under $100?! I never write reviews on amazon so you know I'm impressed. My estimation is that this case could outperform similar styled cases that sell for 3 times the amount.

The cover boasts that the version it contains is \\"uncut & uncensored\\"; however, that claim is false. Inexplicably missing is the entire \\"nightgown\\" scene with Bridget Fonda, which should appear just after the orgy. I'm pretty sure that this scene appears in every other version of the movie. I'm almost certain it was in the R-rated general release, I know it is in the \\"uncut\\" VHS tape, and part of it even appears in the broadcast televsion version. In fact, watching the censored TV cut of that segment on BBC America a month or so ago is what inspired me to order the DVD in the first place. Now I just feel ripped off.

Last time I watched it, I was moved to tears by the suicide of Ian McKellen's character. The aftermath of the Profumo affair illustrates how foolish and sad prostitution laws really are. It was these laws, in large part, which Steven Ward was so humiliated by -- and the movie gives a human face to that fact. The girls in question were labelled call girls but they were more like party girls -- and yet, when the powers that be conspired to find their scapegoat, they were able to portray these amateurs as prostitutes, for the purposes of humiliating Steven Ward publicly.

It's a must-see for anyone who like the band and I think a damn fine hour and half for anyone else as well. The main theme is about growing up and still holding on to your adolescent dreams and it is told in a really poignant way.

It's explanation for that title is that when a person dies, after it's soul leaves, 21 Grams mysteriously is lost from your body. A very interesting concept, but it had nothing to do with the film. The mystery of 21 grams leaving your body is never explored.What is left is a film filled with miserably sad people who are suffering from losses they have sustained and fighting personal demons. I think Sean Penn is a rare talent, but he is not nearly enough to carry this downer of a film.\\"21 Yawns\\" is a better title.It is said that after viewing this film, in it's entirety, that all the yawning that is done, when measured in breathe and water release, amounts to 21 Grams.If THAT was the overall goal, then the film was a huge success.Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yep... 21 Grams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodramatic Soap Opera","review":"21 Grams is an outstanding example of a cinematic soap opera.

In other words, nobody in this movie behaves as they would in real life: every gesture, every line, is highly exaggerated. Maybe I'd be more open to getting over the pretentiousness if I cared about the characters, but there is no attempt to make them interesting. Add to this that the \\"Law and Order\\" style shaky-cam never lets up, and you need an aspirin after five minutes. Basically, I'd say that if you loved the movie Traffic -- a better, but also shaky-cam melodramatic pretend version of realism-- then this is the movie for you.

Unfortunately, if you require a reasonable plot and/or entertainment value of some sort from your films, this should not be on your list. Although the technique of skipping around to various timeframes is interesting, it has been done before and I no longer find it to be quite so novel. The acting is well done, but I found it to be acting for the sake of acting, and such a thing holds little interest for me personally. A terrible plot and a dark tone leave it without any entertainment value whatsoever. All in all, the most unwatchable film of the past two years for me, but keep in mind, I am not an art film guy. If you are, you will probably enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Electrifying Journey Through the Depths of a Person's Soul!","review":"This movie was quite possibly the best movie of 2003. No offense to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" fans, but I was very impressed with the originality of the screenplay, the emotion coming from all of the actors, and the unique direction.First of all, the movie is about the lives of three people who all have major problems. Note: This synopsis will be very vague because I don't want to give anything away. The three people end up colliding at the end. It's so hard to explain without giving away the whole story. Let me just say this. Rent \\"21 Grams.\\" The performances from Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, and Benico del Toro are all spellbinding, especially Naomi Watts who, in my opinion, should have won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

It has been a very long time since a movie touched me so much. Not the usual type of movie but 21 Grams is so moving I feel like watching it again and again.

Penn plays a dying man in need of a heart transplant whose wife desperately wants a child before he goes. Watts plays a wife and mom trying to get past her drug addiction and return to a stable life. Del Toro's story is the most interesting of the three as an ex-con who begins to straighten up his life convinced that Jesus has given him another chance at it. These three characters all come colliding together in interesting ways, and it is truly a movie that makes you think. There are some very rough edges of the film, with rough scenes to go along with it, but the film's intention and terrific acting make it one that I want to see again."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"THE WEIGHT OF A CHOCOLATE BAR . . .\\"","review":"21 GRAMS has become one of my favorite films. I recently bought it and have only watched it twice. In those two viewings, I became mesmerized by the film's mystery and magnetic energy. You can't really tell what is going on from the previews but it is best left that way. You go into the film not knowing what to expect and leave with what you came for. Basically, the characters are connected in different ways. Little by little, the connections are revealed and the suspense is unbearable. The reason I like this film so much is that its originality is refreshing, coming out in a time when a lot of copies and pointless films have been released. This film slips into a category of its own and is sure to become a classic. People can't explain the film, only how they feel about it. That is what makes it so interesting. Go see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped drivel.","review":"I'm a fan of all the actors -- but they're in overdrive in this movie: whiney, self-absorbed to the max, unbearably humorless and inarticulate. Penn especially is just ridiculous. I didn't buy him for a single second as a mathematician, nor did I believe -- or understand -- any of his motives. All these characters are just so selfish, they care only about their angst. This isn't a film about \\"motives\\" -- it's about agony, and all three stars give their most intense, oscar-vying performances, and yet -- it all amounts to a bunch of crap. Gee, your heart donor's wife just happens to look like Naomi Watts! What do you say! (They do their best to make her look drugged out...to no avail...) Now imagine if the guy's wife looked like Kathy Bates -- that would have been an interesting movie to watch, but nobody would care, because everything in this movie is superficial to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oscar sells, but this is just Bad","review":"I can't stand this film. I couldn't get through the film the first time around. I've finally decided to sit through it (on my 3rd round) coz I don't want to waste the money I spent on it and there's nothing good on TV. Plus, I'm curious why Sean won an Oscar for it. The plot build sooooo slowly. The first 20 minutes are just jumbled-up plots that don't seem to be have any connections... but you wait and wait and wait for it to happen and it's maddeningly slow to come. It's worse than watching your bad dreams & trying to make any meaning out of it. If you're not particularly patient and love action movies, save your money and pass on this! I think Sean should have won his oscar for \\"I am Sam\\", but the Academy tends to give out overdues than current."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!","review":"The right trailer can make any plodding, incoherent art film look like a thriller. The only reason this poorly written and impossible to believe peice of junk gets one star is the solid work of Naomi Watts, as usual Penn overacts and Del Toro iscompletely incoherent. Like Traffic, the director believes he must use lens filters to make us feel the emotions of these hollow characters, it fails here, too. Apparently, Focus Features liked this film so much that they decided it stood fine on it's own on DVD, since there are no special features at all.

And the slicing of the chronology was an attempt to hide that fact. I also hated all the gratuitous and melodramatic guy fights, all the guns, all the blood. Fine actors (as these actors all are) are too often put in the position (or put themselves in the position!!!) of having to work with really awful scripts. Melissa Leo's performance really shines, and seems to have been almost totally ignored in both the handing out of awards and in so many of the reviews of this theatrical and horribly manipulative movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the year?","review":"This movie moves extremely slow and the story line is disjointed.

There is the standard introspective stuff and the not so subtle question of God's existance so many people think is still provactive...blah, blah, blah, so what. Another problem is the characters. While not bad people, they are just not very likable or interesting. Clocking in at two hours and five minutes it seemed three hours and fifty five minutes as the story develops at a snail's pace. As others have said there is some decent acting here, especially by Naomi Watts so I'll offer two stars for that, otherwise this is just another average flick. Quentin Tarantino mastered this presentation style and it is interesting and well done in his films, but I'll be glad when this fad dies because in the hands of lesser talented directors like Alejandro González Iñárritu it is just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak and depressing look at bleak and depressing indiviuals","review":"The color, backdrops, pace and acting (yes, the acting was very good) lent to a very \\"downer\\" of a movie. Sure, I've watched a lot of movies that have had ongoing depressing scenes that ended in a sad story. Well, this is one of them.Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts give their best to a movie that shows the down-trodden lives of people who've hit bottom in some very tragic circumstances. You get a taste of betrayal, deception, lies and confusion, all rolled into one.I really don't know how to truly classify this movie other than that I would never want to watch it again. Yes, it is a \\"thought-provoking\\" movie with some very emotional and touching moments, but there is no reward in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped Garbage","review":"I hated this movie. It was so slow and annoying, filled with over-the-top acting and a story that jumps all over the place. I understand that the directing was different because the movie goes back and forth through time to explain the story, but this wasn't interesting to me. It just served to confuse and make the movie move along at a snail's pace. The more Sean Penn films I see, the more I am starting to think that he ain't so great. Naomi Watts was so annoying in this movie and I'm sorry, but I felt no sympathy for her at all. Benicio Del Toro was great, but he is great in everything so it was no surprise that he did a great job in his role. Ultimately, this is a slow movie that is way overrated. I didn't enjoy this film and was very happy when it was over. I give it 2 stars because it tried to do something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heavy collision of imperfect people","review":"21 Grams is a heavy movie - despite a light title. The story is about the collisions, literal and figurative, between three imperfect people: A religeous fanatic with a dark past, a cheating husband with a critical heart problem, and a drug addicted widow. The movie operates as a series of flashbacks and fast-forwards, much along the lines of Amores Perros and City of God. It's a bit faster, which makes it optimal to see the movie in one sitting to keep up. (I saw it in several, which detracted from the viewing)In the end it's easy to see the movie as a work of art. It's best at it's darkest. People really don't lose 21 Grams when they die, and the spiritual side is weaker. Even with that, if you like the genre, you'll like the movie, even if it's not as solid as others. All movies don't need to fit the Hollywood stereotype."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most powerful movies I have seen","review":"The nonlinear narrative method used in this movie is not for everyone. And it is definitely not for people that want to mindlessly watch a story unfold.However, the powerful portrayal of three intertwined lives and the brutal cause and effect relationship that ties them together is incredible.If you are a thinking person, then you owe it to yourself to watch this.I put this movie up there with other powerful cinematic tragedies : Dr. Zhivago and The English Patient."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love depression and confusion...","review":"There are plenty of reviews here that relate the storyline, so I just want to mention two things about this movie that will affect your decision on whether to watch it or not.First, this movie is VERY depressing. It's about death, disease, and the destruction of lives. If you think you're subjected to enough of that stuff out here in the real world, don't watch it!Second, this movie is not linear. It jumps around A LOT, and you will probably not fully understand where everything ties in until at least halfway through. It is NOTHING like Memento. That movie, while backwards, was linear, and after the first few scenes, it was easy to figure out the method. If you're like me and lose interest easily, you probably won't finish 21 Grams.I know a lot of people liked this film, but these are two very strong factors you should consider before you spend your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My 9 year old loves her pink suede beam.

This also affected the flow when reading it to my daughter.The pronunciation guide in back is very nice and my spouse found it easy to understand. It would be nice if the word was also on the story pages so the non-Spanish speaking reader could know how to pronounce it when reading it instead of having to flip back.I would recc. this book to anyone wanting something akin to the rhyming Dr. Seuess books, or to anyone wanting a fun way to pick up some Spanish vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"visually pleasing, but not durable","review":"I bought this item about 8 months ago and it is now completely non-functional.

As the Dalai Lama said: Change only takes place through action. Frankly speaking not through prayer or meditation, but through action. This new book is all about the action of transcending the ego and how to do that!!

He provides a detailed psychoanalysis of each of the levels of consciousness, an explanation of the dualities and obstructions for each, and techniques for advancing to higher levels. Woven through the erudite and at times rather technical psychological treatment is the spiritual viewpoint.

Very useful and worthwhile in describing and explaining the different states of consciousness that can go with the different stages of consciousness. But since he only focuses on state levels, his work is true but partial. This is how it is, but I did wish that his teachings were more fuller, more comprehensive in enlightenment teachings. But that is what other books do, especially ones like Integral Spirituality, which is a more fuller, comprehensive book on enlightenment and levels of consciousness. Nevertheless, I do rate this book high as it is good enough as a primer for these different levels. Certainly not a be all and end all book though, that would be False, and which calibrates as such, but True as a excellent primer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out...","review":"... read Iron Fist instead, although the photos are not identical in the two books (this book also has some interesting ones).

To fully understand the plot line, I've found that you must watch all of the episodes a few times and make some mental notes, such as what sounds or people were in the backround of certain scenes. This may help you figure out when an event occured. The series tends to jump around between the present, 5 years ago, and one month ago. It can sometimes be hard to tell when the scene is going on. Over all this gets a VERY good review from me. It's intriguing, mysterious, and creepy up to the very last episode. If you liked Serial Experiments: Lain, you'll LOVE this.

I liked the dark twist for a change of pace.The storyline gets confusing only if you don't pay attention to the details and it is rather hard to see but it in my opinion allows for even more eerieness when your mind tries to compensate for what is really going on and plays off the all too common fear not of the darkness itself but what lurks in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoing the masquerade","review":"This book leaves behind the constant sweat of religious performance.

Varek and Christine are great charactors, and kept me interested till the end. I thought the ending was a little abrupt, but at least it was fairly happy. There are some reality problems (6 miscarriages and they don't suspect anything?) but over all I would reccomend this book. Christine and Varek have been married for 10 years, and when Christine can't produce a child, Varek is forced to set her aside. Christine, unable to watch her husband marry another, runs away and marries someone else. When they meet again in venice 6 years later, Varek's wife has died in childbirth and Christine is married with a son.

He sat her aside and went on to marry another but he expected her to stand by and wait and yes, even watch him with his new wife. Did he not think she had any pride and would just accept that? Of course she only married her husband because he saved her life and to remove her from her ex-husband's orbit, possible even place her out of his reach.Oh yeah and I have to agree that the ending was a bit quick and things were not explained.

(Hannibal was or still is president of Grey Advertising, I believe, one of the nation's top advertising firms; and yes, I believe it is on Madison Avenue.)Read this book if you can get it; it's an excellent work of art, just excellent.

Logitech 250 is cheaper than Plantronics. This is probably because of the huge honking 'DSP' box on the USB line on the Plantronics model.

I don't think it's on DVD even in Europe, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"L'Aventure C'est L'Aventure","review":"I recommend this film to everyone who like humor. I watched them first time when I was 17. Now 37 years after, it is still fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of L'Adventure, C'est L'Adventure","review":"This movie is rather silly. However, it stars several French superstars such as Leno Ventura and Jacques Brell. (I think Brell's really Belgian.) It also has cameos from other stars such as Johnny Holliday. It concerns a group of rather stupid criminals who get involved in all sorts of illegal activities from kidnapping, hijacking, revolution, and bank robbing. They're bumbling criminals, so the movie takes nothing seriously, not even the French criminal justice system, nor religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Map missing","review":"Justly acclaimed. The New York Review does a sleazy job of reprinting, leaving out the map in the original. You will miss the map."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderous, beautiful book about discovering the world for the first time","review":"At 18, and freshly kicked out of school, Fermor decided to walk from Holland to Constantinople, bumming around central and eastern Europe, staying anywhere he could and striking up acquaintances with peasants noblemen and everyone in between. It's an almost weepily romantic notion of travel, and it's all compounded by the fact that he did it all in 1933, before WWII would violently wipe away virtually all of the kooky, old Europe. What makes this book so strong is that it doesn't fall into the black hole of vain self-discovery and self-affirmation that makes so much travel writing pure garbage. Fermor is fiercely erudite and he's able to synthesize convoluted central European history, architectural/artistic musings, and reflections on local customs and language into a wonderful pastiche that beautifully evokes old Europe in all of its strangeness and insular splendor. He'd be the greatest drinking buddy of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book To Savor and Treasure","review":"This is a book to savor-- to read, not skim. Fermor's gift is to describe everything he sees and experiences in language that has the texture, detail and coloration of a fine painting. Each page is an individual delight. It is the ideal book to accompany one on a long trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand all the praise","review":"This books has quite a few excess words. I am very disappointed.

I had assumed it would be more a travel book. Beware, the conversion to Kindle ebook didn't go well. The font size is a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love them, stop the violence","review":"This has so much critical information about domestic violence. It has the facts and figures necessary to argue for improving current attitudes regarding domestic violence. People need to be armed with the facts and figures if they hope to do anything to help alleviate the suffering of abuse victims. This book provides those facts and figures and also provides well documented citations and references. It is easy to read and understand, and no \\"fact\\" has been provided without plenty of evidence to back it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Person Below Obviously Hasn't Read It...","review":"Or she would recognize the documentation contained therein which proves the assertions.Men are battered to the tune of 30 - 40 percent of victims and murdered at a fair clip as well, yet 100% of the 5 billion dollars in funding in this country is for women. Not to mention the Duluth Model which forces police departments to persecute and arrest male victims of domestic violence as opposed to their battering spouses.It's time male victims were not only recognized but had some help and options available to them; if not it is at least time the sexist, man-hating laws which discriminate CLEARLY against men were rescinded and sent back into the dark ages where they belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prejudice Stinks","review":"The theory that all women are victims simply ignores reality, and promotes gender prejudice. Trading one form of bigotry for a different flavored biogtry still leaves us with bigotry.Certainly many women are victims, but there are also male victims out there who should not be dismissed and relegated to the shadows. If we are to achieve true equality then speaking truth to power, like this book does, is necessary in this age of politically correct male bashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Distortion of Domestic Violence","review":"As a straight, white, heterosexual male from a red state, but who also works with Domestic Violence victims, I can assure you that Mr. James is well off the mark with this book. Though it would be nice if the stats were skewed and men were truly less responsible for violence in the household, it is simple not the case. This book is irresponsible scholarship, and a prime example of the type of prejudice that exists against the DV movement as a whole. It is no longer a \\"feminist\\" issue, but rather a \\"family\\" issue. Domestic Violence is a serious matter, that deserves serious scholarship, and this book does not meet that standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame you can't give a zero","review":"This book definitely deserves a zero for its deceptive take on domestic violence. I bet the feminist haters will just adore it, however. It relies on twisting facts, anecdotes, and just plain lies to try and make its case that men really are the more battered gender----this of course, despite having greater size, strength, political representation, prestige, social dominance, and so forth in society. In order for the author's theory to be correct men would have to discriminate against other men at every level of society----despite books like this which have repeatedly 'exposed' the 'truth.'What's chilling is that people are really desperate to make victims out of men who are in some cases attackers themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piddling nonsense","review":"This book is little more than a manual on how to misrepresent statistics with anacdotal nonsense and junk science. Mr. James would like us to believe the the government has some kind of conspiracy against men, despite the fact that government officials are overwhelmingly male and all reputable statistics indicate that men wield more clout in the judicial system and medical canon. I now understand the meaning of the phrase \\"wasted three hours of my life.\\"This is a book for self-absorbed MRAs who believe themselves to be oppressed by the growing sentiment that it's not okay to treat a woman like a punching bag.

I have very fond memories of the class (my first foreign language class), and learned quite a bit about grammar. I still remember some of the lessons.The book is good. It is not always clear, and tries to explain things on the level of a high-school student. There are times that a linguistic explanation would be much simpler, but it's a school text book.The second book seems a bit more rushed than the first. Much more grammatical \\"nitty-gritty\\" is in the second book. I think the author assumes a level of familiarity after one works through the first book, and picks up the pace a bit. Sometimes this leaves things a bit \\"less than excellently\\" described. However, overall, I think the book did a good job. I was very happy to find the series so I could start re-learning Latin (eventually...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latin for Americans","review":"I am taking Latin 3 now out of this series.

The main languages that this book focus are C, PHP and perl. This book is also good as a reference.

Paul DuBois systematically takes the reader from a MySQL tutorial to advanced topics in MySQL database administration. Since I have installed the MySQL database I have barely put this book down.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is thinking about using MySQL.I already owned the O'Reilly book on MySQL and there is no comparison.

Since I had access to MySQL as well as PHP, I figured this would be a good book to get me started. Huge understatement! Before even finishing the book, I was able to offer this service to my existing customers. Now, granted, these databases were not massive and multi-featured, however, they suited my customers needs perfectly. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about MySQL and it's related scripting languages.

His characters are always fleshed out and intelligent, especially the women. The female characters are tough enough to take care of themselves, and have no need of a male rescuer.

This is one of the best guitar related books I currently own. It not only teaches the how of blues playing but gives a fairly good treatment to the why. The first section is all fairly straight forward music theory then the book gets into the standard \\"how to\\" blues techniques.The guy on the CD sounds like he smoked his breakfast but the playing is solid and really helps get some of the elements from the page to your fingers.If you want to play blues guitar (or even rock for that matter) I would suggest this book with Keith Wyatt's Blues Guitar Step one and step two videos... get a cd full of jam tracks and you'll be soloing over a 12 bar blues run in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet Another Great Book by this Talented Writer","review":"After reading Releasing the Goddess Within, I must compliment the clear, concise manner in which author Katherine Gleason transmits her uplifting messages of self-love in this tome.

It is something that almost everyone familiar with divorce in America has come to know, but now it's official. You've read it from an expert and an advocate for change. But, Prengel's book is not an angry one. It makes good reading for both men and women. It focuses on one man's journey through the divorce process and into maturity as a father and human being.

The beautiful cover, however, is the only inspiring thing about this work.What I believe was intended to be a fun, irreverent tone is severely marred by Ms. Cameron's unexplicable need to take blatent pot-shots at people working and practicing different types of spirituality. These nasty comments were unnecessary to her essays about her own spiritual quest, and she comes across rather like a playground bully who wants others to rally behind her and gang up on high-profile people who don't see things her way.Ms.Cameron is far too accomplished a writer to reduce her work to nasty drivel. I hope for a subsequent volume in which she speaks more from her heart and less from her ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so bitter, Julia?","review":"I agree with Tracy Becks - this book is so bitter (and also poorly written) that you have to wonder if Julia Cameron actually wrote it.Eric Winter"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"God is No Laughing Matter\\"","review":"What a relief from the old axioms that God is a \\"sour puss\\" just waiting for us to sin so He can punish us. Julia's way of explaining God is refreshing, uplifting, and at times even laugh out loud funny.One of my favorites is in the chapter \\"God's Will\\", where she talks about God baking a lemon pie as we sit eating a lettuce leaf. I won't say more because it would take away from the impact of reading it. I thought of myself in that situation and decided that God is baking chocolate chip cookies (my favorite) and from here on, I'm going to savor every single cookie and not feel the least bit of guilt. Reading the book will explain what I'm saying.I'm sure there are those who would think her a heretic or worse, but I believe she makes God REAL and approachable, and I give her kudos. We need more reading like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bitter than grandma's boiled greens (why, Ms. Cameron?)","review":"I used to be a fan of Ms. Cameron, but this book really turned me off. Offering nothing useful or new, this book is one big rant against organized religion that gets downright hateful in spots. Really, Julia, do we need this? Is this what creativity is all about?Her prevous books show no indication of a future dive into this bitterness and bile, and it even makes one wonder if perhaps Ms. Cameron has fallen off the wagon (but that's hardly relevant). Please avoid this if you're even remotely a fan of \\"The Artist's Way\\"; if you've just escaped from a cult, this might help you bring your rage to the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA, HA, HA! Yeah, right!","review":"The title of this book is ironic, since Ms. Cameron thinks God actually IS a laughing matter! Her opinion is that people tend to take their spirituality too seriously. Well, I agree that many people should lighten up. However, spirituality is a basically serious matter (although not devoid of joy, anything but!!). As an evangelical Christian, I regard spirituality as a matter of eternal consequence. And, make no mistake about it, her approach is not necessarily a Christian approach, although she throws Christ in there quite a bit. But everything else is thrown in the mix, too, as if it all had equal worth. That's not to say there are some potentially valuable exercises included in the book, and even some interesting opinions. But, ultimately, a self-constructed spirituality gathered from a hodge-podge of sources leads one only to the \\"God\\" of wishful thinking, not the one true God."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is among the best CD's I own- don't hesitate to get it.","review":"I'm constantly moved by the depth of thought and melodic quality on this record.

I recommend to all owners, and think you will be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point please","review":"The first part of the book has some interesting historical and technical details about Greyhounds. But then it develops an annoying habit of telling you what it is going to tell you and how important it is for you to know, but when it eventually gets around to the actual info, it isn't much. You could say the same thing in one paragraph, not a whole chapter! I could not finish it. I read two others and highly reccomend \\"Greyhounds: Everything About Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Behavior, and Training\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile investment","review":"This book can help you decide if adopting a retired racer would (or would not) be the right decision. If the answer is \\"yes\\", it will also help you make your dog's post-racing life the best it can be. After reading the book cover to cover, it left me with no unanswered questions.I have several other \\"For Dummies\\" books, and this one has a much less flippant tone than some of the others. Thankfully.Some of the material here is what one should expect in any good basic general dog care book, but there is plenty that is specific to the greyhound breed. For example, a section about the breed's unique dental concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall book","review":"Great 1st step for anyone looking to adopt or even if you already have a greyhound. I've found myself going back to it, even months after I've adopted, for little tidbits of info. One complaint is that the author seems to be trying to 'sell' you on his way of doing things.

Lee Livingood shows an excellent appreciation of the greyhound and is very honest and matter-of-fact about the problems that can be encountered when adopting a rescued racer. I have used it when dealing with my own greyhounds (even after they were in home for a few years), as well as newly-rescued greys I have fostered.

Some of those DVD of Brazilian Music are available for renting.The DVD has low quality. There are lots of improvisation on the music theme and the lyrics in english are different from the lyrics in portuguese. I guess, it has to do with the way that the words sound, rather then the accuracy of translation. The overall performance for a JAZZ Festival is good for someone who really likes Jazz, I guess. The person who introduce the singer has empty comments such as \\"wonderful singer... beautiful bla bla bla\\".

The problem is that the steel does not reinforce the part that you pinch to open up the clip. So after a few months of daily use it developed a stress fracture in a straight line just above the steel part of the clip. There is no way to fix it and the only thing to do is purchase another one which I won't do until the design is improved. Too bad, because otherwise this was a very handy addition to the ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but nonetheless garbage","review":"This looked like a really good design at first, but then my nano kept working it's way out the bottom slit and I constantly had to push it back in.Another result of this is the protective clear screen cover that guards the nano screen would also work it's way loose. It's not built in to the rubber surrounding it, but is kept in place by the pressure of itself against the nano.Returned it and got the Griffin clear plastic cover instead. It doesn't have a belt clip or the rubberized bumpers like the Speck does, but I can live without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toughskin for iPod Nano","review":"Purchased for my son for christmas.

After steady use the belt clip broke off of my silicon case, and I searched the internet for a case with such a clip.

It was advertised as \\"comes with optional belt clip\\". When it arrived, no belt clip, just the case. I already have this, I needed the clip. Sending the case without the clip for $25 was not cool.

I've found this to be a chronic issue with these USB DSP headsets.

Comfortable even for long conversations.6. Great value (paid less on Amazon then they typically go on eBay)Cons (relatively minor for me):1. Even after folding, kinda bulky if you will be traveling with them a lot.2.Wish the wires werent so long--too long for the average user--perhaps making them prone to damage?3. Plantronics used to include a nice case, BUT NO CASE INCLUDED ANYMORE (at least as sold on Amazon)4.

As a result this Plantronics model can be used on laptops only when running on battery power. Since that's not practical, I am now the proud owner of a stylish $40 paperweight.It would have been easy for Plantronics to include a low-frequency rolloff around 120 Hz which would filter out the hum, but leave voice signals unchanged.

The humming goes away when you unplug the power cord but that doesn't help me, I need to be able to use it when the power cord is plugged in or not.Anyway, I chatted with Plantronics support and then informed me that it's a known issue with no work around except to unplug the power cord while using it.So, it's getting returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good customer service","review":"The item received is everything the that I ordered and wanted.

This headset is used primarily for voice recognition dictation with Nuance Naturally Speaking 9.0. First, I was put off by the very long cord and the large audio processing unit on it. Then, I felt the folding headset to be pretty rinky dink and too fragile for traveling. But, I rationalized that surely the digital enhancement would greatly improve the voice recognition leading to reduced typing errors and justifying this purchase. After several months of retraining the software to the new device, I returned to using the \\"el cheapo\\" headset I initially received from Nuance, which produces far fewer typing errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing, wasn't expecting the quality","review":"ok I had read the reviews, and heard the complaints about the headset falling off, have no idea what they are talking about.

I can't believe how good this sounds for hi-fi music. i've never had a usb headset, the mute button is nice, when you mute it glows bright red. you won't embarrass yourself on conference calls. the volume control real nice feel and works great. im amazed at how good this thing is.. since i only bought it for voip and didn't really have much use for it for music. yes ithas a clunky box towards the end of the cable, but it kinda anchors itself to the floor or wherever... not really that big of an issue, I love this headset and i can wear it all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing rocks!","review":"I got this for a position I had taken working from home. The position didn't last (boring beyond belief) but the headset is awesome! The noise reduction, the software equalizer settings, the clarity are all excellent.

I used them for gaming, VOIP, listening to mp3s, and believe it or not some voice recording. They have been great! They've been tossed around the room a few times and still appear like new. The first complain I have is about the spongy microphone cover falling off, it always did fall off and was annoying to keep putting back on. Also its dying now, one ear doesn't work, and the other is slowly fading and cutting in and out. So it lasted a very solid 3 years. It has a very high quality microphone, but the audio isn't the best, it gets distorted on higher volumes, but then again my set is old and I don't quite remember what it was like new. Overall, it's a fantastic set of headphones, and I'm buying a new set of Plantronic headphones (DSP 550s) to replace this one... it deserves a proper burial ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good headset","review":"Mostly I am impressed by Amazon for being so responsive to me in my multiple orderings of this product, both of which had major problems (my fault) which were quickly resolved by the team.However, I should tell you that the product itself is great. It is a major improvement over the cheap headset I have been using for the past two years (the quality degraded significantly after I started carrying it between work and home). The only bad thing about this product is the cords which are kind of long and which I trip over. I don't think this is necessarily the fault of the product, but rather just an observation that wireless would be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive, poor audio quality","review":"I bought this headset thinking I would use it with voice recognition software on my Mac Powerbook. The fact that they fold up was a selling point because I thought they would fit well into my laptop bag ... but the bing dongle thing which seems to contain the electronics is huge and intrusive and the cord it too long to be helpful. What makes it worse is that the audio quality of the stereo headphones is poor and the recording quality is also poor as it seems to skip over words or mangle parts of them ... and I have an excellent speaking voice (everybody always wants me to read aloud). (And, not to be nitpicky, but they come in one of those hard clear plastic coffins that makes it almost impossible to get them out of the packaging without wrap rage.)So I definitely don't recommend them. And now I'm looking for something better.

I have no complaints with the sound quality offered by this headset. The mic is well adjustable.On the downside, what you gain in space by having a foldable headset, you lose with the long wires (I was only going to plug into my laptop, so could do without the 11' cable from headset to usb). The whole thing was flimsy. It's one step forward and two steps back. The material on the ear piece made my ears itch so couldn't have it on for too long.I prefered the Logitech USB 20 with it leather-style ear pieces. Even though it wasn't completely foldable, you could twist the earpieces 90deg to make it flat.But most annoying of all was the bulky audio interface box. It's not as if you can disconnect the headset from the box and plug it into the audio style speaker and mic ports... so *what* is the point??Basic flaws -- I'm just so upset at Plantronics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware !","review":"1. This is NOT a noise cancelling headset : it has just a noise cancelling microphone so this only works in filtering your voice (I can't really see the point...), NOT the surrounding environment (like airplane buzz or aircon in the office). 2. It only has a USB plug, no hifi-jack so forget using it with an MP3 or CD player. 3. The CD-Rom with the Plantronics software was defective. 4. Plantronics customer's support is difficult to access and poor. The FAQ's on their site are uselesss (try to figure out if the DSP 400 has a Noise Cancelling function, good luck ...) If you want a Noise Cancelling, try the Maxell NoiseBuster (probably the best deal 40$) or the Koss QuietZone 2000 (better but is it worth 140$ vs. the Maxell ?).

I've been using it for years. I have a very small head so most headsets just don't fit.Not only does this fit, it is light enough that I can wear it for any length of time. As others have pointed out, the cord is far too long. I hate ear cups and prefer to be able to hear the world around me in case the cat/kid decides to get into something.However, this product has a lifespan of only 6 months.

It shows the esssence of writing is simple genuine expression, I am not a big beat fan, I think Ginsberg is stultifying and Kerouac entropic; albeit, I do enjoy Bill Burroughs (who adds a short preface to the anthology) because he seems so honest- spooky honest, I think his best book, because of that is Queer, and Hunke musters up the same kind of bravery within the written word.

The tape that we work out with was made in 2001- this one is much newer- Its nice - but a little to fast for us. She divides the walk into 3 different 1 mile walks on this one and hence its faster with stronger more vigorous miles, for those who want a good 15 minute(1 mile) workout) We always go three miles on the old one(45 minutes).

I find her style of walking to be really effective in maintaining your weight plus it's gentle on your body. My only gripe is that the bands on the belt snap eaily.

At first I will admit to being a bit apprehensive at first. I really hate the workout DVDs where everyone is 40+ in age. It just makes me feel kind of silly, being only 21.

I like how it shows 1 mile, then 2 mile, then 3 miles. It lasts 48 mins. but you can do less if you don't have as much time. The waistbelt works really well and is easy to use. It makes a difference! I would recommend this to anyone who needs to get in their daily exercise, burn calories, and doesn't want to go to the gym to do it. She includes sidesteps and kicks and arm exercised as well.

I used to be a very active energetic person until this setback. So slowly building up with her various miles helped me to do a 5k. Now this one with the band had me pretty skeptical. I use free weights up to 5 lbs so I thought this would be nothing. Well the tension was enough on the bands to give a workout you can feel! If you concentrate on tucking your abs you will feel them after the workout as well. The only thing I would say negatively about this workout is Leslie gets too chatty with one of the background walkers at the end of the 3rd mile and not only could I not understand what they were saying, it was rather annoying trying to catch what she was saying.Oh well other than that I highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as others of hers","review":"Leslie's tapes are both encouraging and fit for one's pace.

She probably could have used it a little more. Overall I really like the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fast workout!","review":"This is my first DVD by Leslie..

Glad that this one includes the walk belt which really puts a blast in to the workout. Like probably most of her workouts, this one is also based on the 4 basic moves, walking (obviously), side-steps, kicks & knee lifts. In this workout she has 4 ladies doing it with her. Personally I do not care for the chit-chat she engages in with them, especially when it distracts her and she stops certain move countdowns more than once. Her talking to the other ladies also messes her up a couple of times when doing walking up & back. While it's not necessary to keep pace with her, I prefer to do so because that way I know I'm getting my best workout/calorie burn. The \\"countdown meter\\" is kind of useless because it only pops up after she's already told you that it's almost time for another mile marker.

The writing is pretty good, which is not surprising given the authors, but they were constrained by the tv show's story and it shows. Original tie-in novels are better than novelizations of existing episodes; the book was not bad, but I'd recommend spending an hour watching the actual episode rather than several hours reading this.There was one line that made me laugh, that may or may not have been in the show: Bridger is searching seaQuest for something small (and hidden) and says to himself, \\"I think I need a smaller boat...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK*************!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great book to read for people of all ages and people.

I would drop calls all the time, even sometimes when standing in one of my special 'signal zones'. You know what I'm talking about. Anyway, I tried this thing out, and it would occasionally help my signal, but it just wasn't reliable. Maybe that's because my signal was so flaky to begin with. So I sent it back.And THEN I learned of the Verizon Wireless Network Extender. If you have Verizon and broadband internet, don't even think about this wireless booster. Just get the network extender. It's awesome, four solid bars throughout my whole house. If you have Sprint, they have a comparable product called the AIRAVE. Verizon's is $250 up front with no monthly fee.

Basically the z-Boost did not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"I live in the country with a weak cell signal. I mounted the external antenna very high (second floor porch) where the signal is usually one to two bars. The unit sits in our den which has open access to several rooms. When standing a foot from the unit, the signal strength is a solid four bars. Step a few feet away and it drops to two. Go in another room and it drops to one bar and sometimes zero. I have had calls dropped due to signal fade while in the next room. I would not buy this item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item was used and not working","review":"This item had clearly been opened and handled before it was shipped to me. The seals on both ends of the wireless extender box (not the shipping carton, but the product box inside) were broken. The accessories inside were not packed like you would expect when getting something new. They were in a beaten up ziplock bag. It appeared to me that the contents of the box had been opened and handled a fair amount before they were shipped to me.Despite all these warning signs I followed the directions to see if the extender would work with my phone. The first two or three times I turned my phone off and on the green light did blink indicating that it recognized my phone. I then hooked up the exterior antenna, but the extender never again recognized the phone.After fooling with this for about an hour with no luck I gave up and called for a return merchandise number.

I could get 1-2 bars in the front of my house. Outside I could get 2-3 bars. On my roof, 5 bars.I mounted the antenna on the chimney about 12 feet above the level of the transmitter and about 15 feet horizontal distance. Now I get five bars in the in the family in the back of the house.I noticed that best placement of the transmitter was line-of-sight. If you can't see the transmitter antenna from where you are using the cell phone, the signal is not as strong.Great product, but takes some experimentation to get full functionality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for RV applications also","review":"Mine is an RV application for Verizon Cell Phone, AT&T Cell Phone, and for Verizon Air Card; during our travels we are often in fringe reception areas. I compared it with a Wilson trucker antenna and amplifier at a single location in rural southeastern Maine; with my application I got 3 bars with Wilson, 4 bars with Wi-Ex. With the Wi-Ex 500 CEL we were able to get internet connection in about 95% of our locations. Very good. I then ordered the high gain booster antenna upgrade YX022-CEL (about $100) which increased internet download speed from 280 kbps to 1200 to 1800 kbps range -- 4 to 6 times as fast. Internet reliability is also very much improved with the YX022-CEL.

Complained to Verizon, but no success. Ordered the extender without extra accessories and it worked out well.It mentions that for best performance/amplification use vertical distance/wall separation, I did not have that luxury in an apartment so I placed my unit in the furthest room, and routed the antenna out the window and on the porch as far as the cable that came with it would allow. It worked great. Would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better with add-ons","review":"This did not work great out of the box....with the antenna upstairs and the receiver downstairs.

Someone will call back in an hour. Two days later, the unit went back for a refund.If you want to try one, I advise a temporary installation.

I was unable to set up the equipment where the signal was \\"just right\\" enough to keep a call. Initially, I would get addtional bars of service, but then in the middle of a call, the boost would flash \\"too strong\\" and drop my call. Customer service was unable to help, since I couldn't sustain a call long enough get advice when I was near the equipment. Overall, the cost of the equipment was not worth the trouble and was ineffective for increasing and sustaining my cellular service through a phone call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solves the problem","review":"This signal booster does exactly what it's supposed to do. As long as you have some detectable line-of-sight signal at some reasonably accessible location within the 50 feet of the supplied coax cable, it will boost your cellphone reception to full signal. You have to pay attention to the instructions, however, and of course make sure that you have the correct frequency for your cellular network. I am very pleased with the results - the initial try out took only a few minutes to find a suitable location for the antenna and the transmitter unit before tidying it up to make the installation acceptable to my wife!

The Catholic Mass is identical to the Black Mass?

And anyone who knows Catholicism, nobody is \\"worshipping\\" the Blessed Virgin Mary, they are honoring her, as well as the Saints and Angels in Heaven with God our Father and His son Jesus.

Catholics are very open about what they believe (CatholicAnswers), although many of the lay may do a poor job of explaining it, if one takes the time to learn and obviously this work has taken little time to learn the truth. There are no secret ceremonies or secret societies in the Catholic Church. To be sure the Catholic Church has issues with abuse by some clergy and its poor handling of that situation and rejecting these types in the seminary. It has also had a handful of popes who while keeping the apostolic doctrines straight, got carried away with themselves in their personal lives. But to attack Catholics as some black magic organization shows the ignorance that perpetuates into the 21st century all the way from the 1st century.

Once again they have captured the flavor of the series, bringing in the news room regulars (Ron Updyke, Miss Emily, and, of course, Tony Vincenzo) for comic relief and the monster Carl battles this time is arguably the best one yet. Another nice touch is the continuity and the growing frustration Kolchak is beginning to show with constantly running into the creatures of the night. That touch gives this series a realistic element that makes it all the more entertaining and addictive. Highly recommended.

The material may be \\"the finest beech wood,\\" but it is rough and unfinished.For a person who has trouble with their grip, the cushiony handles may be helpful, but for me, they only took up extra room in my utensil jar.

If you have ever marketed yourself or your business, if you have ever read a business book in your life, if you have even just managed to stay in business for more than a year, this book is far too basic for you.According to the authors, the crux of personal marketing seems to be creating \\"personal postcards\\" and sending them to people anytime you can figure out an excuse to do it. There are a few other ideas that they beat to death, as well. While these ideas may be a good idea for some, there is just so much more that.The book looks good, but the reality is that there are too few ideas, the ideas covered are outdated, and I thought the whole tone was pitched really low and patronising.

This was one of the worst of them. Mr. Weramantry who I have reaseared has never written another book on chess since this one. I am glad.The book jumps around too much without explaining things in it so that you can understand it. The book says the writter is some big time chess teacher but he doesn't know doddily when it comes to putting his teaching into words. I found the book hard and difficult for a kid who has been playing on his chess team for over a year at his school and is ranked as number 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good example games to enhance chess thinking","review":"This book would be beyond the absolute chess beginner, since just learning to make moves is their primary focus.However, for the avid chess player, one who plays in tournaments, at a chess club, in a school program, or who just plays every chance s/he gets, this is a wonderful book to help improve the understanding of the game. It is so well written that one who can visualize a short sequence of moves (1 or 2) need not use a chess board to fully understand the games discussed. Mr. Weeramantry has written the book as a coach would teaches a student, often asking his student a question about a given position, and then explaining why the student's best response would be good or not so good. If not so good, he asks for another choice.This book (for a chess book) was very easy to read. I'm a class A tournament player who completely enjoyed reading it,... and re-reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is a book based around teaching some basic positional principles by illustrative games and it succeeds in that endeavor, but so do many others. One feature that elevates it beyond many others of its genre is its use of contemporary openings.But the unique value in the book is not the material it teaches but the manner in which the reader is trained to think. This is a series of Socratic dialogs investigating chess positions, during which the reader is expected to participate and form plans based on the position at hand. This is the stuff that you just can't buy in a book (ordinarily). This is chess - at least as I am coming to understand it.This is a must-buy. Even for those whose rating implies you already know the positional lessons you owe it to yourself to work through the games and find the moves. At worst it would be a validation of your progress. At best a game changer.Simply outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here is The Beef!","review":"Are you under 1600? Are you trying to get better? Do you teach chess at your school or club?

Why it's here is beyond me. Price is way too high. Buy direct from HILTI or through Home Depot for much less. Also, HILTI branded pins & shot are overpriced as well. Gun uses generic .27 cal loads & pins just fine. I've had mine for about 2 years and shot 1,000's of pins without any malfunction or down time. Being fully automatic capable, this is great for high volume jobs. Also comes with single shot nose so you can use lesst expensive non collated pins when the application calls for it.

The solos by Hoffmann are incredible, melodic, strong, intense.The lyrics continue to be the weakest point of the band.

I think some people who reviw here don't know that 5 star-rating should be used to a classic rock, inside a band's career and style. \\"Metal Heart\\" paved the way for the downfall of the band, being extremely commercial.

New school dub lovers will enjoy the subtle 'new school' overhauls of esp. Black Uhuru's or Burning Spear's tracks on the album's first half whereas they may be somewhat disappointed by the album's second half, which is characterized by spun-out, more or less uneventful new school artists' dubs. The producers would have done well to include some more divergent modern dub bands; apart from the inevitable Mad Professor and the vintage 'rastafari' by Alpha&Omega, the new school half is just a bit too monotonous. Most dub fans will either like the first or the second part; nevertheless this album is a nice, albeit superfluous attempt at comparing two eras of dub. For a clearer picture you'd be better off buying yourself two separate CD's with some classic dubs both from the 70s and from the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that kept me up reading through out the nights.","review":"I had already known Reggie was a man of God but the story of his life really made me proud that the Packers have him.God has a man in Sports that can sure show the unbelievers that he is alive.This book made me laugh and brought tears about how a father I should be.

It sounded like throwaway tracks left in the studio that could have been on a Gerald Levert album. I hate to say this, but the Gerald Levert-produced songs on LSG2 are some of the worst I've ever heard from him for this trio. Most of the album is disjointed and Keith Sweat doesn't sound his best on here. Johnny Gill sounds disconnected from the songs. And Gerald sounds like he wants to lead the group, because he's the only good singer on this album. Even the guest appearances by Loon and another rapper don't blend well with the group. I can tell why this album flopped. I can't believe their label delayed their group's album so much, because people were excited for it.

With that fact presented, anyone who tries to bury this review as unhelpful simply because it is negative is (unfortunately, anonymously) demonstrating themselves tro be a true jerk determined to keep customers from making an informed decision.

If the screewriter/director had focused more on the father and son's relationship DURING the film instead of the father and drug addict's relationship then the ENDING when the father and son come together would've made more sense. This film was not as it was implied to be, and for the life of me--I don't understand how it won the Oscar. That should've gone to \\"Osama\\" instead.

This film succeeds in that attempt. Regardless of what other reviers write, this film reminds me of why I continually choose a foreign film rather than a domestic one when selecting amovie; foreign films have worth and meaning while their American counterparts do not. American films were great at some point in the past, but there have been very few good american films in recent years. The Barbarian Invasions is a moving tale of the bonds of family and friends. It reveals a harsh reality which none of dare face in our daily lives, a reality we fear when we wake late at night, a reality which silently haunts us, a reality which we will all face one day. We will never prepare enough for that day but after viewing this masterpiece, we can know that we do not share that burden alone. Bravo! Five stars without a doubt.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some sequels are great!","review":"This film can stand on its own, but viewers will appreciate it all the more if they've seen the earlier Arcand film \\"The Decline and Fall of the American Empire.\\" In this sequel we see the same intriguing, disparate group of characters years later, and this is a character-driven opus like its predecessor.

A huge plus: there's not a hint of Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and smart movie","review":"This movie is a true revelation.

It addressed my feelings and disappointments and gave practical advice that helped me to end my relationship and \\"move on.\\" What was really different about Dr. Gordon was his honesty. Too often I was told \\"hang in there\\" and \\"love will find a way.\\" This book, however, told me the truth -- that sometimes relationships just aren't meant to last. Yes, it was \\"tough love,\\" but I needed to hear it. It helped me to re-think my notions of \\"love\\" and gave me the support I needed to leave my partner. Today we are both happier people, and I have met a new man that I know is right for me.

I'm not talking about the intimidation scenes or the blatant disregard for the female officer's rank. They might have been sexual in nature, but the two I remember weren't particularly deviant.The female lead is a joke. She couldn't detect her way out of a wet sack. While I understand the traitor sold out his country for money because he needed it, the backstory wasn't particularly believeable.Don't waste your money on this one.

It has many twists & turns in the plot. Set on a Naval carrier, it uses just enough of the military lingo to be realistic, but not so much that a military novice is lost or confused.

After the second set of batteries started to die on me and the drill started showing some bearing wear, I decided to get a new one. The 3 speeds seem nice even with the extra weight that comes with it.I do have a problem with the clutch mechanism while the drill is in first gear. Even at the lowest setting, the clutch does not release while the drill is in first gear and breaks off the heads of screws. The clutch does work in second gear and is down right loose in third, however it would be nice to be able to use first gear so as to slowly drive a screw without worrying about the head snapping off. I returned the drill and got a second one thinking it was an adjustment problem. The second one has the same problem. I am now thinking of returning this model drill and getting a Panasonic or other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're not what they used to be","review":"The newer production 12-volt drill drivers aren't worth your money. do some more research (as I am in the process of) and get something else!My first Dewalt 12-volt drill driver (from 1993- or 94) was great, versitile, heavy-duty, and the batteries lasted longer than their spec'd work time. It finally started wearing down when it got to 10 years old and I bought two new batteries for it--they didn't perform well, one would work great for 10 minutes and die while the other would work at about 60% power and die 12 hours later.I finally got a whole new Dewalt 12-volt system last fall and both batteries are terrible.

As a blues player and teacher I am always searching for new artists and books about the blues and this book does not deliver. The \\"riffs\\" are played on a cheezy keyboard - not a real piano and are sequenced and quantized rendering them lifeless and useless. Playing these \\"riffs\\" will make you a better piano player, but will not help you learn the blues.

The strength of Naoli, and the calm way she handles herself during the birth are poignant images to juxtapose to the view of birth in today's hurried society. The most interesting point she makes, is that birth does not need to hurt, it can be a beautiful, wonderful, exhilarating expierence, and your family can be a part of it.

At the time I thought that the reason that I was having problems was me.

If a recording is ever made of this organ with the music on this disk I would not hesitate to buy it if the organ is repaired and in good working order."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better...","review":"It was okay, but it was kind of slow. It carried on for way too long. And it lacked some of the witty comments that I expect of Buffy and the gang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too entertaining, but I still LUV the show...","review":"This book is an average. It's not too exciting though, because much of it is history, and history is monotonous. Also, this book moves at a snail speed. The author should write for nonfiction books, not action books. Fans of the EXCELLENT show (da bomb baby) should read Coyote Moon, Halloween Rain, or the new books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst in the series","review":"This book was hard to follow and not very true to the series. It was, in my mind, easily the worst of the various Buffy books so far. For me, the only good news for this book was that it was still \\"young adult\\" so I could read it in about an hour -- about all I would waste on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great.....","review":"As a major fan of the show (having created a scrapbook, having every episode on tape, and having pics up on my bedroom wall), I found this the least favorite of mine in the new book series. I've read all of them up to \\"Blooded.\\" And this one, didn't seem to catch my eye all that much and wasn't all that realistic. It didn't carry the same excitement as the other books in the series. The plot to me was confusing. I do not recommend this book. I think it was a waste of my time. I am however looking forward to the Watcher's Guide coming in October. That's gonna be really cool. :0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close!","review":"I have seen all the episodes (except for one of them), and I have read all the books, and have read lots of the fan fiction out there... Most of them do the show quite a bit of justice, but this one was just terrible. The storyline was nearly impossible to follow, the characters were constantly saying or doing something completely OUT of character for them. (I have yet to hear Giles use even half that amount of common slang) and all in all I would rather be forced to watch bad reruns of 90210 or Barney than to have to try to struggle through this particular book again. All the others are great! Both series are great and I look forward to each new book, but this one will be leaving my possession in tiny pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of disjointed","review":"I am a huge Buffy fan I have read many of the books. I really did not enjoy this novel. It was boring, disjointed, and confusing. The characters never developed and the plot jumped back and forth too much. I would not recommend it since there are so many novels that are better in the Buffy series. Only for the true fan that wants to read every book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sounded so good on the back cover...","review":"I first read this book over three years ago and didn't like it. But then, a few weeks ago, I decided to see how much my taste in books had matured and gave it another chance. Big mistake! I hate this book! They took a wonderful concept and blew it to smithereens by ruining Giles and Xander. I would have felt better if they'd somehow discovered that the real Giles and Xander had been locked in a warehouse for the duration of this novel and had been replaced by cyborgs because only that could explain why the heck they were saying such stupid stuff!Not only were they horrible, but the supposed climax of the novel - the zombie diner fight scene - was over waaay too fast and easily. It completely and irreparably damaged my spirit. The books only saving grace was some fun quips from the Buffster and a sweet (albeit, paranormal) kiss between Willow and Xander at the very end. I would recommend Coyote Moon and Halloween Rain in a heartbeat over this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather Cliche","review":"The Salem Witch trials for this genre are cliche. While the plot was more complex than the previous 3 books, I think Giles and Xander, especially were written too out of character to maintain my suspension of disbelief. I kept stopping to think to myself: that's not how so and so would act!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST BOOK","review":"I did not like this book at all I thought it was very boring. I read the book once and it took me a couple of weeks to finish then I read it a second time to see if it would be any better, it wasn't. I am a huge Buffy fan and I have liked most of the books I thought this was the worst book of them all. I wouldn't have bought the book if I would have known how bad it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book was Great!","review":"I have seen every episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and this book does a great job of putting the characters in text. In an evil plot to open the Hellmouth, the Master controls the dreams of Buffy and her friends. The dreams take place in Puritain times, during the Salem Witch Hunt. Buffy dreams she is the Slayer, a witch hunter named Samantha Kane, Giles dreams he is her ailing watcher and Xander dreams he is... a witch?! The arrival of several strangers in town leads Giles and Buffy to the conclusion that the events that prevented The Depised One from rising 300 years ago are being repeated to let the master out of his lair.I recommend this book to everyone. It is an imaginative story that puts a twist on the Salem Witch Trials.BUFFY ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets 5 stars for bordom!","review":"Not only is this the most boring buffy book i have ever read its the most moring book i have ever read, it even beats sabrina the teenage witch dogs life. I had to force my self to keep reading. Books like this should not be in the buffy series giving it a bad name. I do not recomend this book for anyone, buffy fans like me will be completly disapointed and this will just push yet to come buffy fans away. If you want a good buffy book try 'Coyote moon' or 'out of the mad house'. Whatever you do just stay away from night of the living rerun."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"The book itself was boring. I kinda wanted to return it to the store after I read the first chapter. Because Angel is basically not even in the book . The coolest thing was when Xander was a woman!It wasn't the best book. save your money for something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for casual Buffy fans","review":"I just finished reading this book and was disappointed by it. The author obviously didn't know the show and the characters well so he chose to write more about characters and events from the past than he did about the characters of Buffy. There were a few interesting parts. The showdown with the Master and the possessed characters wasn't bad although I wouldn't have staged it at a steakhouse. I don't know what that was about. But on the whole, if you are looking for action, you will find it. But if you are truly immersed in Buffyness, I would try another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Slayer at her best","review":"This is one of the most forgettable \\"Buffy\\" books I have read thus far. The plot wasn't one, and when it seemed it was going somewhere, it hit a brick wall with a loud thud. There were these different elements that just didn't fit into one another. I think the only thing I enjoyed, is how the characters from the past matched with those from today, except for Willow, which was revealed at the end. I think the ending was the best part, actually, because of that. It was just very choppy, and the characterization (which I am very big on) was very awkward. Not a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but could of been a lot better","review":"This book was not brutal, but it is probably the worst of all the Buffy novel's so far. Usually I would read one of the Buffy books in two days, but it took me almost two weeks to finish this one. It is so slow, and at the start it seems to be going no where -- not what a good Buffy book should be like. The characters aren't really that good in this either, and the dialogue is really bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product!","review":"This noise maker works great. It can be very loud or you can keep it quieter. The different settings are nice for mixing it up as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine lasted for 2 1/2 years","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this sound machine! I received it just before my son was born and have used it every day of the last 2 1/2 years for his naps and during the night. He responded very well to the Summer Night sounds so that's what it's always set to. Whatever it takes to keep him sleeping so deeply! While it is true that the twist volume knob is faulty (crackles or cuts off completely), I love this machine so much that it doesn't matter that I have to weigh the knob down in order for the machine to stay on. I'm going to buy a replacement now because it's a great investment! Not the greatest quality but it lasted for longer than I expected and the price of a new one is well worth the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"We had 2 of these and both had the same problem; shorting of the volume knob and it stopped working.

Our first one basically stopped working after about 9 months. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it \\"shorts out\\" when you turn the knob and sometimes it wouldn't come on at all. Figuring it was just a bad one, we decided to give it another shot and bought it again. BIG MISTAKE! This one developed the same problem after only about 3 weeks. We've learned our lesson and will not be using a HoMedics product again. Hope they fix this design flaw! Be wary of purchasing this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"I bought this product because the HoMedics model I wanted has been discontinued. The HoMedics SS-2000 Sound Spa broke about 5 weeks after I began using it. Amazon did a great job of sending me a new product with no hassle. The added effects of seagulls on the ocean setting is more annoying than relaxing. My advice, go to a store and try it out the sounds before buying it. If you like the sound settings come back to Amazon and buy here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it, tried it, returned it!","review":"I was so excited to finally get a sound machine, after a coworker of mine had been talking up her own and saying how great it was for restful sleep.This machine has six functions, and after testing out each one, I found that they all seem to be a 30 second sound clip that merely repeats itself over and over and over throughout the night. Something about hearing the same exact seagull squawk in the ocean sound every 30 seconds drove me nuts! I had to turn it off because I just could not get relaxed.You're better off buying $20 of relaxation songs off iTunes and playing them through your iPod than buying this machine. At least then, you can pick what sound you want to listen to, and it'll be much better composed and more random - allowing for better relaxation - than the machine's sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud enough to block noise out","review":"If you're going for a cheap sound machine that is loud enough to block out noise, this is a great option. I bought two (one for each of my kids), and it's really helped them from waking one another up. I've had one of these before, and it didn't last a long time. I don't expect these to last a long time either even though we take good care of them and only use them for nap and night time. I don't think they're designed to last long. But I think this is the best option for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went dead after a short life span, wouldn't buy again","review":"We bought this because our neighbors are loud and I am a light sleeper, and we thought it was a great price. It worked fine for a little while, and the timer feature is nice, but it started to get harder and harder to wiggle it and keep it from shorting out. Now it is completely dead and we have to replace it. I'll be spending a little more to get one that actually works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last a YEAR !","review":"We have now had three of these units fail in less than a year.

Yes it is cheap but spend a little more to get something that will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"Sounds good, but ours died within a year of nightly use (plugged in), as did one purchased by a friend. Feels light and cheap.We replaced with the DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01 and have been very happy for only a few dollars more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but unreliable","review":"We have had several of these over the past several years to block noise. While we have been happy with the sounds, I'm not happy with how unreliable it is. We have had to replace these several times due to shorting. It will be making the sound and then all of a sudden.... silence. Then it will start back up again. After a while it does seem to keep going without the stops, but we've played with it a lot (ie. tried unplugging it versus using the switch to turn it on and off). Anyway. Some last longer than others before the shorting problem starts, but thye ALL seem to eventually develop this problem. I don't usually write reviews, but this is a product I am VERY familiar with. I'm looking again, but think I will look elsewhere this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like it a lot, but it shorts out","review":"Similar to what others have posted, we really like this sound machine. It's inexpensive and the waterfall noise is the white noise that we use, which is great for our baby/toddler. The ONLY problem we have with it, and it's a pretty big problem, is that the volume knob is a point of weakness in the internal circuitry, and this machine has stopped working all together and gone out intermittently. I've actually taken it apart twice to tighten things up in there, which has worked, but only for a few weeks or a month. Disappointing since we otherwise really like it, but it ends up being worse than nothing if the sounds goes off and comes back on while our daughter is sleeping, which makes us very frustrated!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had 2 and both broke in less than 6 months","review":"I got two for my new twins. Both stopped working in the first six months. Those nights were disasters. Poor manufacturing. Time to splurge on a better model since clearly this isn't as good as it used to be. While it was working, we loved it. 5 and 6 months is just not an acceptable lifespan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This machine is great","review":"I bought this machine for someone going through a stressful period. She told me it's helped a lot and she loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Does what it promises. It's about the best you can buy. Offers continuous or timed sound.

I was hesitant because I thought it would be intrusive and keep me awake at night. Now, 2 months later, I think I like it more than she does.

I fully recommend this sound machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased 2 in 2 weeks--same problem","review":"The first one I bought worked fine for a week, then the sounds became distorted and had static. Returned that one and got another one and the static seemed worse--especially at the higher volume. I still use it for my son's room but I am getting ready to buy another product because I can't take the static too much longer.

I would buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks.","review":"This sound machine worked perfectly for 2 months, and now it cuts out and stays off unless I adjust the volume of it.

It had some decent sounds, but we tended to like the ocean sound because it sounded less looped. I don't know what happened. The volume knob just started becoming less reliable, and then pretty soon it just stopped working. We probably owned it for about 3 months.

Each unit lasted only a month or two before shorting out. I was able to return them to Amazon for a replacement each time, but after returning 3 different units with the same issue, I am moving on to another product.

I'd spend a little more on a more reliable one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Junk","review":"This is a cheap piece of junk. It came with some kind of short in it that makes it periodically stop making noise, which wakes our baby. It requires a smack to resume making sound.

I am shopping for a replacement today. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't turned it off since we bought it!","review":"We love our sound machine by HoMedics. In all honesty, we haven't turned it off since we bought it. The rain is my favorite and very relaxing.

However, within 3-4 months the sound would cut out - almost as if there was a temporary loss of power, only there wasn't. We tried unplugging it to reset it, and that helped for awhile. But it gradually got worse. Last night it would run for 1/2 hour and then turn off and stay off. I tried unplugging it, and it started up again but then turned off and stayed off after a 1/2 hour or so. It's officially not working anymore and we are now looking for a new brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Won't Last Long","review":"The only reason I give this 1 star is because it is okay when it works. However, sound quality is poor. We are about to lose our second model in the last 5 months. And let me tell you how much of a pain it is to lose your sound machine when your crying baby needs it to help sooth him/her. For just a little bit more money you can get a sound machine that will last years (like my first child's sound machine).

TERRIBLE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"Like a number of the other reviewers, I would not recommend this product.

We've been using it for our 17 month old and he loves it. As soon as I turn it on, he starts sucking his fingers and gets himself ready to sleep. Yes, you can hear where the sound repeats, it is actually a pretty short snippet that repeats over and over but that doesn't bother my 17 month old. The biggest problem is that the machine constantly shorts out or something. It will be on one minute and off the next. We live across from a school so it frustrates me when it stops working during his nap right around the time that school gets out. We've already been through 2 of these and I'm on Amazon looking for a new, different white noise machine now. I'm hoping that he'll adjust to a new machine since he's so used to this one but I refuse to buy another since they just keep breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% Terrible","review":"My wife and I bought this noise maker shortly after we were married. It worked alright for a few weeks, and then the sound started to die without warning, and with no change in the power/controls. We tried to live with it, but it just continued to get worse. We then returned it to where we bought it (BB&B;) and they very nicely replaced it for us. TRY NUMBER TWO! The same thing happened after about a month. Another trip again to the nice people of BB&B; and a third... Same result. At this point we have it in our baby's room to help him sleep with house noise, but instead he just wakes up when it dies out. VERY angering.So this product is a definite NO. It is cheaply made and will die on you without any reason and without abuse being suffered to the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, cheap piece of junk","review":"I bought one of these, despite the warnings of bad quality, hoping to get a good one. My first one did not work at all. Got nothing out of it. Not a peep with either battery or plug.I'd try a second, but this is the second defective Homedic product I've bought and I'm not wasting time and money on a third.My advice is pay more and get a more reliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The volume thing really is an issue.","review":"This product is nice for the fact that our daughter enjoys it. It took about two weeks for the volume nob to go haywire. When you barely turn it on it is SO loud it makes her and I both jump which doesn't help when we are trying to get her down for a nap. Then when you put it on mid level volume it seems to level out. Makes no since, not very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap materials","review":"I have two of these Homedics sound machines. While I like the variety of sounds and the reasonable price, they aren't built to last long. On both machines, the sound started to cut out as I moved the volume control knob up or down about 12-18 months after I bought them. I usually have to push the knob in one direction to get the sound to stay on.When the sound machines completely stop working, I'll look for another brand to replace them with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I have two of these machines. BOTH of them are having the same kinds of issues as many people described. I bought one at first, was not happy with it. Decided that it was an accident, bought another one--same thing. The problems with disappearing sound randomly started around one month of usage. The get progressivley worse. No, they are not worth $20. Seriously, waist of money. I am looking for new ones for my kids for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got what I paid for....","review":"I didn't buy this from Amazon, but a local store. I bought this machine to replace my Philips machine that worked fabulous, but was over 15 years old. First - the ocean wave sound is not even close to my previous machine. I can tolerate it though. Every time you touch the on/off/volume knob you get static and it cuts out. Mine has an electrical adapter thank goodness. When you set it to a time, it works, but it doesn't turn off. It ends and the unit stays on until you remember the next morning to turn it off. I thought that being HoMedics, it would be fabulous. It does work and the ocean sound isn't great. I got my $17 worth. I'm shopping for another machine and that's why I'm here writing this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but developed a short","review":"This is perfect for my needs - something to drown out noise in my baby's bedroom. But we've only had it about a month and it seems to have developed a short in the on/off knob. If you don't press in down while turning it will randomly turn off - not a good thing for a toddler (he usually wakes up screaming when that happens). I know it is 'cheap' compared to other noise makers, but for $20 I would expect it to last a little longer than it has!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you like strange noises","review":"It makes strange noises that are mixed in with the sounds that it's supposed to make. I can't describe the noises and they are different almost every night. They keep me awake and sometimes are even a little scary. Get a better quality machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"fine, while it works","review":"I have purchased 2 of these, and both are now broke. The product was fine for the money, but you could hear a click when the sound would repeat. Plus, it didn't last long."},{"rating":"2","title":"White sound","review":"I have purchased 4 of the sound spas over the past 5 yrs. One for myself, my husband, and gifts for family members. I would not be able to fall asleep with out it. It is included in my must have list, while staying at hotels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Value","review":"My wife needed this machine to help her sleep due to an inner ear issue; she needed a steady, constant white noise. This machine has provided just what she needed, and at the same time I have never slept better! It's inexpensive, easy to use and the sounds are excellent and fairly realistic. It's a great little machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio stations, anyone???","review":"I returned this item to Amazon because I was able to hear radio stations through all the different noises. I was relieved that there was something legitimately wrong with it, because when I first heard all the noises, they sounded SO fake compared with the Conair we currently have that I regretted buying it immedietly. The waterfall sounds the most like white noise, but it all sounds very canned and not at all peaceful. When I purchase another sound machine, I will spend the extra money for a basic Conair noise machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made, short shelf life","review":"I loved this machine until it started shorting out to the point where i couldn't use it anymore. I would fiddle with it every which way to get it to work but after doing this for a few months, it finally died. I only had it for about a year. It's too bad because it's a nice size and it's not ugly like many other sound machines. I saw another poster had the same issue so this wasn't a one-time problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I use this machine every night. If my neighbors are listening to their radio or tv too loud, I just turn up the volume to the waterfall or what ever noise I have it on and go right to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound shorts out","review":"We purchased 4 of these for the 4 bedrooms that are used in our house and within a year or so the sound has shorted out on all of them. The sound is very finicky and will shut off, yet the unit is still on. Adjusting the volume causes the sound to cut in and out and crackle. Not very high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Advise NOT Purchasing this Sound Machine!","review":"I got this sound machine for my daughter to help her sleep and block out other household sounds. First of all, it isn't very loud, even when the volume is up all the way. I have used other sound machines that go a little louder and have higher quality sound. Second, only months after using this machine, it started turning off randomly, waking my baby up. Then, it became difficult to even get it to turn on. I'd have to jiggle the cord. Needless to say, I am NOT impressed with this machine. I am on the hunt for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable little machine","review":"I've used one of these machines nightly for years, and they generally last for a year or longer. Great for traveling because they're so light, they've been a life-saver in noisy hotels and B&Bs. Don't like some of the sounds, but between the waterfall and the seashore, I have enough variety and often use it in the daytime also when I'm on the phone with clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting repetitive noise loops","review":"The repetitive noise loops can be very distracting to some. My husband requires a sound machine to block out noise during the day since he works 12 hr night shifts. We only use the \\"rain\\", or maybe its called \\"showers\\" option since its the closest to white noise. While trying to fall asleep, you're able to pick up on the continuous clicks and sound repeats and I have found myself staying awake many nights due to focusing on the distraction. Otherwise, my children do not seem to notice when they use it at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low quality","review":"The sounds themselves are great, but the on/off/volume button broke almost immediately on several of these we had purchased for our family. Is actually kind of unbelievable how something so simple as a dial, which cannot cost more than $1 to manufacture, can be of such low quality that it renders the rest of the machine useless. Wild not buy again - manufacturer is cutting corners in the wrong places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality quickly declined starting at 6 months","review":"We have had this sound machine for two years. After about 6 months it started to have issues, and they have only gotten worse over time. It seems like there may be a wiring issue-- sometimes we have to turn the knob up really high before the sound will come on, and then readjust. Other times the sound comes out sounding static-y.It does have some nice features, like the option to use batteries or plug in to the wall, and the timer options. But after two years of only moderate use it is pretty much worthless. We will not be buying it again, especially for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dial goes bad after a few months","review":"I would not waste my money on these again- they will go bad within a few months! I've now owned two of these, purchasing one for each of my children. The first dial on the first one (on/off and volume) went bad after a couple months, and the volume control was shorting out. We threw that one away. The second one had the same thing happen to it, within a few months later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great machine for the first couple months","review":"My wife and I first started using this to drown out the general noise in our apartment. It worked great!! So well that when is started \\"shorting out\\", we didn't even notice we were fiddling with it every night. After about eight months, it just stopped working completely and nothing we did could turn the machine on. We ended up buying a replacement and even a second one for our daughter's room. Even after we bought our house, we still used both machines every night. Unfortunately, they both have started shorting out and are getting harder and harder to get working. For as much as I like the product, I'm faced with either replacing both units or replacing them with something else. I can't justify spending money on something that is only going to last a year at best.I would recommend this product if you were looking for something that will do the job, but only needed it for a couple months. Beyond that, you may or may not be able to get it to work longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but only lasts a short time","review":"We ordered two of these to use for our baby to help him sleep and distract him from loud noises outside (we live in the city). The first one was great and convenient since we were able to travel with it and pack it away when we were taking a trip. But after about 3 months it started to short out so we ordered another one. The new one has started to short out after only a month which is frustrating. I wont be ordering this model again but it was good for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first... until it stops working :(","review":"We adored this thing! For the first month we had it, it worked beautifully. I don't know what happened to it - it just stopped working. A complete waste of money. It worked fine so I got rid of all of our receipts, so I'm guessing this is not returnable at this point. Look elsewhere... I'm back to sleeping with the fan on at night for some white noise... in winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I find this sound machine to be a very good value. It comes with 6 sounds, an optional timer, and optional battery operation. The sound quality is fine for a $20 unit and has a volume knob that can adjust from off to loud. It advertises itself as sound machine, not a white noise machine. Personally I am just looking for white noise machine that I can use batteries in. The water fall sound seems to be the only sound that is a constant, white noise sound (it sounds a lot like a television that is on a non-working channel). The other sounds have varying levels (such as the ocean tide going in and out). The rain forest and ocean sounds have birds chirping at times (which I find distracting). The heart beat sound is a little different, but I believe that it is intended for babies. All in all it seems to be a fair value for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful product","review":"I got two of these and both have failed. Like other reveiwers have said, the cheap turn knob \\"shorts out\\" and it goes on and off a lot. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap price, cheap product","review":"I bought this from amazon in Dec. 2010 and used it maybe 6 times until it broke in May 2011. It just mysteriously stopped working. Amazon will not let me return it anymore and Homedics is demanding that I send it back to them by UPS Ground (which costs 10 of the 17 bucks I paid.) I wish I had just put the money towards a nicer one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well-spent!","review":"Excellent quality for the money. All my friends that stay in my guest room love it, and my massage therapist wants one for her office! I use the plug-in so I don't worry about the battery issue. I love taking mine with me for travel. I like the shape and size of it too! Just an all-around bargain I wouldn't want to be without. I don't care how late my husband or company stays up... I go right to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, Good Sounds","review":"I have used this machine for my son's sleep the last 4 years and I really like the rain sound. However the machine only works for about a year before the power/volume dial becomes finnicky and breaks. The last machine I purchased broke after 2 weeks. I am looking for a different brand to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I bought this for my 13 year old son's room, who insisted on having a humidifier running in his room year round because he couldn't sleep without the noise. Volume control is very good, you can plug it in and put in batteries for outdoor usage etc. Waterfall sounds almost exactly like the water humidifier we have, rainfall is another nice one to fall asleep to. Would really like the ocean waves one if there wasn't seagulls in the background. All in all does the job to a tee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LITTLE ANNOYING","review":"THE SOUNDS ARE MORE NOISY THEN SOOTHING. I BOUGHT THE SOUND MACHINE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO WEAR THE MOTOR ON MY DESKTOP FAN OUT, WHICH HAD MORE OF A RELAXING SOUND THEN ANY OF THE 6 ON THIS DEAL. I COULDN'T GIVE IT A ZERO BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE SIZE AND PORTABILITY WAS AWESOME, BUT THE SOUNDS ARE TOO GENERIC AND ANNOYING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does HoMedics Make Things That Work?","review":"Every HoMedics sound machine we've ever bought--including this one--has lasted less than a year. The quality control on these devices is terrible. The sound cuts out, sometimes you need to rest a heavy book on the knob in order to get it to work, sometimes the volume fluctuates drastically in the middle of the night...you name it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound spa","review":"Love the sound spa and did not want the one with the projecting clock on it. I interchange the different sounds. I like to fall asleep to the waterfall.I found out about this product when I went to the massotherapist. She used it-the bacground cricket sound one time and tropical forest another time. It was very relaxaing. Well worth the money. I use it everyday. It is also helpful when I am reading and want background sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"ditto on shorting out","review":"Pretty disappointed that just after a year's use, the volume started jumping all the time. Same thing other buyers have reported. I ordered a 2nd thinking the problem would've been fixed. Same problem. Thank goodness for Visa's warranty extension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I question all these excellent reviews I see for this product. I wonder if they are plants from the company or seller. This product is annoying at the very least. The speaker is small and the sound is not very good. In addition, every sound has a distinct background sound that loops every 4-5 seconds. After awhile, it becomes hard to focus on the intended sound whether its the rain, waterfall, etc.. Save your money and get a cheap cd player with speakers and environmental sound CD. You will sleep or relax better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Bought this for an elderly client that can't sleep well without sound. Her old one was was not working well anymore. Her daughter had bought her one w/ one sound and was very loud and she didn't like it. This one has good sounds which the volume can be turned way down or way up. She particularly likes the ocean sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you want static","review":"couldn't sleep with this ... static and popping ... send it back.

Save yourself some money and refrain from purchasing it. I bought one for each of my children and within four months, one was spotty and wasn't consistently playing while the other was working fine. Now, less than a year later, there is no sound that comes out of the machine when I turn them on. Let me say again, this product is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I bought this machine becaues of the price. Bad idea. I should have paid attention to the other reviewers who said the machine shorted out after a month. That's exactly what this one did. It only works when the volume is turned all the way up.

Wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great for a few months......AWFUL quality.","review":"At first the sound machine was GREAT.BUT, after a short time ALL THREE of ours stopped working properly.They are poorly made - the sound completely cuts out sometimes.......usually just when our baby is about to fall asleep. ha ha.Sometimes the volume goes super loud and sometimes you can barely hear it - and it changes without even touching the dial! Not very soothing.AWFUL! Will never buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"only lasted 4 months","review":"I bought 2 of these for my 2 boys. Their rooms are right next to each other and I was worried that with the birth of our 2nd son, that they would disturb each other's sleep. When I first got the product, I was pleased with it. Lots of sound options, good sound quality, adjustable volume, and timer. BUT with constant overnight use of both machines, they both petered out within 4 mths of initial use. One of the machines volume doesn't work properly. The other machine doesn't turn on unless I push random buttons. It seems as though both of them has a loose wire somewhere preventing normal function. This product would probably be ok for occasional use, but I don't recommend for regular use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I ordered this sound machine hoping that I'd be happy with this product despite the mixed reviews. No such luck. Worked wonderfully for 2 days and then just stopped making noise. Not even a buzzing noise, complete silence. Seems to be an issue with the volume button. So much for a sound machine. Going directly back to Amazon. Will invest more money into a more quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a crap shoot...","review":"We got 2 of these for my children. The one we got from my son from 2 1/2 years ago still works. We have had to replace my daughter's twice and will no longer be using this one. The sound cuts out and is difficult to turn it on.

Try it. Right now I have 4 strategically placed toothpick stubs and it stays on 'ocean sounds' all night (I have it plugged in).I bought a ConAir sound machine and just don't like it. The sounds are harsh and in particular the 'ocean sound' seems to have just one wave sound and doesn't have sea gulls squawking, which I really miss. Also, the directions tell me I cannot tuck it under my pillow, as I do with the HoMedics.

When I turn it on, it sounds like it's shorting out and doesn't stay on unless I monkey with the knob. Also, I've had one switch to another sound all by itself - from white noise to birds chirping. Very annoying. I wouldn't buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies","review":"I bought this for my daughter who needed some background noise when sleeping. There are several different choices to find \\"the right one.\\" The volume is easily adjustable and the speakers work well.

However, the product is unsatisfactory.- The speaker is small, apparently cheaply made, and sounds \\"tinny\\".- After sampling all choices of sounds, the only selection that was of any interest to me was the \\"gentle rain\\". However after listening for an hour or so, I began to discern where the sound \\"looped\\". Once the recurring pattern of sounds became apparent, it couldn't be ignored.

Other sounds are cute but not too useful and, in fact, distracting.I have found the same defect as other reviewers. The on/off/volume switch is of poor quality. It malfunctioned early on.

It's small, compact, easy to fit into a suitcase for travel, and can run off electricity or batteries. The waterfall sound is slightly higher-pitched than the one from the older model, but not unbearably so, and it only took about a week for me to grow accustomed to the new sound.

They don't sleep well if there's not that background sound so we thought it would be a nice addition to the room, however, the screeching seagulls ruin the peaceful sounds of the crashing surf. While the sound quality is good, I would not recommend this to anyone wanting only surf sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted less than a year","review":"I bought this to use in my baby's room while she slept. The sounds on it are good and it has a decent volume range. However it started shorting out within six months.

Not a good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"true sounding machine","review":"GREAT TO PROMOTE SLEEPING. EASY USE WITH VOLUME CONTROL.MANY CHOICES IN REGARDS TO NATURE SOUNDS.

So this is useless to me.I'm not sure why I'm even giving it 2 stars. It does \\"work\\" in that it makes sound and is easy to control.If you're ok with the repeating, go for it.

KEEP SHOPPING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch broke in less than a month","review":"I bought this for my baby son's room. I was basically looking for something that made basic white noise akin to a fan but without making it cold in his room. The waterfall setting did the trick. You can hear the loop, but that didn't matter for my purposes. I liked that it got pretty loud when you turned it all the way up and that you had the option of using batteries or a plug. The problem is that the on/off and volume nob broke after LESS THAN A MONTH!! This is VERY poorly made. I should have known better given that I had years ago purchased a similar HoMedics Sound Spa and it too broke very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorts out","review":"It's a great little noise machine, but ours have always become faulty - shorted out - required banging on them or tweaking the knob just the right way to make it work...that's a pain.

After less than 6 months it is turning off intermittently for no apparent reason--it's not the cord coming out, it's not our electricity.It's unpredictable when it will turn off and has ruined more than one nap for my twins by turning off just at a crucial time. Driving me crazy and I am so annoyed at the quality. DO NOT BUY. Get another brand--the idea is great but the quality of this machine is just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"We have gone through two of this sound machine in the last 7 months. Both have stopped working within a couple of months. At first we had to fiddle with the dial to get them to work, but they would shut off at different volumes, and finally they both just died. They aren't expensive, but it's such a waste of plastic and other materials to have such a short lifespan on this product. This time we're going to buy something more expensive and hope it lasts longer. We're using it for our baby, so it's pretty frustrating when it won't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto on the bad volume knob","review":"Like all the others, it was great until the volume knob shorted out. Same story ... you have to wiggle it to get it to work. Not sure how long this will even work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice thought, but no staying power.","review":"I bought one of these to drown out my husband's sleep apnea breathing machine. It has 6 different sounds to choose from. I prefer the rainforest or summer night setting. The ocean and waterfall made me want to run to the bathroom too many times during the night, and the heartbeat was downright scary sounding. The reason I gave this item only 2 stars is that, after 3 months, it started malfunctioning. The transformer cord keeps coming loose, so that the machine quits. I had also purchased one of these units for my neighbor, who works nights and sleeps during the day. She said her unit was doing the same thing. So it must be a manufacturing fault. Anyway, I would not recommend this unit if you want a long-term noise solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Sound Spa","review":"I have this product and decided to order 2 more for family members.

Also, wish there were a louder setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this brand!","review":"We are on our second one of these sound machines, wrongly thinking that the first one we had was just a defective model. However, the new one is doing the exact same thing. After using it for a month or so, they both began to \\"short out\\" on us. My baby would be napping and it would just shut off and come back on, which wakes him up every single time. So frustrating!! And now when we go to turn it on, we have to bang on it four or five times to get it to stay on. Not a very effective way to keep your sleeping baby asleep in your arms! We are online looking for a new one, and will NEVER recommend this one to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely LOVE it! best of all options!","review":"I spent WAY too much time research these little machines (as you are probably doing now) to use as white noise for our baby, and this one is perfect. We have had it for about a year and have never had a problem. It is very lightweight, so we throw it in the diaper bag to go to the babysitter's house as well. As for the sounds, there is a loop, but the baby is certainly not going to notice, so I wouldn't worry about it :o) Plus, I usually stick with the waterfall setting, which is just a constant staticy sound, so you don't notice any loop. SOUND QUALITY - it can get very loud if you want it to - I usually run it about 1/2 to 2/3 it's potential. Also, it does run on batteries as well so you can use it even if you can't find an outlet or need it in the car on a long trip. Overall, I say save your money and get this basic little sound machine that works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the money","review":"This one is good for travel--light and reliable.

I figured out how to rig it to work with tape and rubber bands, but that doesn't always work.It's probably not worth the money, especially with the alternatives out there with more favorable reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better sound machines","review":"We already owned a different HoMedics sound machine and it's far better than this one. The volume control doesn't work well at all on this machine; either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static, no matter where we used the machine. The product seemed very flimsy as well.

It also confirms that this is the WORST piece of junk on the market. Got first two as gifts for our babies. Bought a third one for husband and I. ALL THREE have same volume problems noted in other unfavorable reviews. Volume comes in and out and then stops for no reason whatsoever only to come back on at a most startling volume. White noise is supposed to be unobtrusive and of uniform volume - This machine provides noise that is neither. Don't waste your money. How HoMedic can keep this product on the market is an absolute enigma to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ocean sound with birds are annoying","review":"I really bought this for the ocean sound however they had really annoying bird sounds mixed in with it and they were too high pitched.

I returned it. Looking for just an ocean sound without birds. Any ideas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought several, all of them stopped working","review":"I bought two for my house and two for gifts for two other new moms. Both of mine stopped working (sound just cut off, if you tapped on it it would come back on, but got worse and worse). I DO love this sound machine, so affordable and just twist the volume up and you're set! Other sound machines are not loud enough and require tapping of the volume button each time you turn it on (for up and down volume), such as the DEX brand one you see at Babies R Us. It is a great price and a great machine, but now I am on my third and it just broke, too. 60$ later.... I am finally getting around to writing my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Junk","review":"We have gone through two of these in 5 months. A nanny recommended a sound machine for our baby. It is great at getting him to sleep, but this model stopped working. At first it would just magically stop working. I would wiggle the cord and it would turn back on. After awhile it stopped working altogether. We bought a second one (same model because it's the only one we could find in a store) and it did the same thing. We have switched to the Conair version (bought on Amazon.com) and it has not given us any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy MARPAC SOUND SCREEN 980A instead!","review":"Not worth $19.88!

The machine is also very flimsy and doesn't make me feel confident that this is a good quality machine.I ended up returning it and go back on the market for a good noise machine (Homedics used to have a good one, but it's no long available - it has been replaced with this new one definitely not as good)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxation sounds","review":"Not a bad little machine. The sound loop for the 6 sounds is pretty good, if you listen (actually listen) to the loop, you can find where it starts repeating. The only thing I didn't like about this machine is that the lights for the on/off and timer are a bit bright! I solve this by putting a small towel over the area. Also, you have to remember to shut it off, or the batteries will wear out quickly! (I'm in Europe and can't use the AC plug.) Other than this, I would recommend it for people who want to either block out surrounding sounds (from outside mostly) or don't like to fall asleep with total quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"We own two of these, and use them every night (one in toddler's room, one in adults' room). While at first they were effective and dependable, after a few months they stopped working consistently and sound like they are \\"shorting out\\" when you turn them on.

Each unit had the same problem. They each seemed to work fine for about a month or so but after that the unit would only work when I pushed down on the power wheel.

It is very quiet & we have to turn the volume up all the way to effectively block out normal house noises to keep the baby asleep. After about 6 months the sound started to cut in & out and/or stop completely. We have to jiggle or tap the on/off/volume control to get it to work again. Sometimes it is easy to fix, other times I have to hit the knob several times before the sound comes back on. Very disappointing.

It worked pretty well... for about 2 months. I used it for about 4 hours a day but after a couple months it started going out. It would work when turned on but then when I went back in the room it would be off. I was afraid of waking my daughter (she was very colicky so sleep was GOOD!) while trying to fix it I would just let it go.

I ended up buying another one for my mom. The ocean and the rain are my favorites. I hate the night sounds (I live in Alaska, hearing crickets is just a strange and annoying NOISE) The rain had a clicking noise every now and again but after using it for a bit when we tried the rain again the noise was gone so it must have been from sitting. My mom's used it so much already I don't know how it's worn out. There are no problems other customers had. Though I imagine with enough constant use I will have problems with it (as expected from everything from cell phones to bedding, nothing lasts forever) Don't let the complainers scare you away because that's all their reviews are- complaints because things don't last forever. :) I think everyone should buy one or two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We enjoyed this for a few months before the sound started cutting in and out, which obviously defeats the purpose of the machine.

Shrill tinny sound on a 3 second loop. Both machine had absolutely no resembalence to \\"Natural\\" Sound. So I've wasted $35 on 2 pieces of worthless junk.

We had been using a cd player with a white noise cd played on repeat for my son's bedroom. But then we needed the cd player somewhere else so I got on Amazon to see what was out there. After reading the reviews I finally decided to go with this one. So far it has been worth the price and more! This device is so small it takes up very little space on the dresser, yet it is plenty loud enough for sleeping, even at half volume. We use the waterfall setting for the white noise effect. It plays all night with no problems. In fact, sometimes we forget to turn it off in the morning and much later in the day it is still playing strong! We've had it for a little over a month and no issues. Once again, a GREAT product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound machine!","review":"We had been using a fan to create white noise for my toddler. It took up lots of space, so we decided to buy a sound machine. This one works perfectly. The volume goes MUCH louder than a fan on full blast, if you want to truly drown out everything. With his door open and the volume half way up, I can hear the rainfall noise from every other room of our two story home. The sounds are nice. It doesn't have a white noise setting, but I think the waterfall setting sounds like white noise. We keep it plugged in all night, so I can't comment about the timer, although I did think it was nice that it had three time shut off options, unlike most made specifically for cribside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good for the first week, but then goes quiet","review":"We bought this to keep our puppy calm while in her kennel at night.

But it did work great for that first week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this junk!","review":"Someone gave us this as a gift, and in only a couple of months the sound started cutting in and out. It is so annoying to have it doing this just as your're starting to drift off to sleep. Worse than nothing at all!

It has been totally reliable and worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT is going to short out..... just wait!!","review":"For everyone that has written a good review. I would agree, until 6 months or so (maybe shorter) has passed. Then it will short out, it will work periodically, but it turns itself off and on. I have an index card stuck in mine right now to keep it on. The white noise is fine, if only it would stay on. Save some money and download a 99cent white noise file from Amazon Music. Then play it on repeat on your old CD player - this has worked much better and it saves you 19.00!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product while it lasts","review":"We love the sounds as they are pretty realistic and not annoying like some are. But we have only had it about 6 months and the knob is shorting out. We have to wiggle the knob quite a bit just to get it to stay on now, and even then it still shuts off randomly. We have some friends who have the same one and have already gone through 2 of them in the last year for the same problem. We will be purchasing a different sound machine that will last.Update 9/14/11-We kept this machine even though it finally quit on us after about 7 months of use, and my husband decided to try and fix it. If you know how to saulder then it's actually an easy fix. The manufacturing is poor on the wiring of the knob, but if you take it apart and saulder the disconnected wires back together you have a machine that works great and doesn't short out anymore! I still give the product a 2 star b/c it's just poor manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relaxing","review":"I bought another version of this sound machine a few years back and it worked great for a while. Then it started making loud buzzing noises every once in while (when I was trying to sleep). I figured I had worn it out since I used it every night, all night, while I was sleeping. So I decided to buy another one. This one made the same loud buzzing noise the second night I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it a lot, until is stopped working right!","review":"I bought this for my little guy who seemed to wake up to little noises. It worked great for a couple months, we traveled with it and liked the choices of sounds. Then it started to switch to the default sound in the middle of the night (we like the rain or ocean sounds). Now when you try to turn up or down the sound at all, it switches to the default sound as well. It kinda has a mind of it's own. I would return it to the company (I only have had it for 4 months), but it's going to cost at least $10 to ship to them and they want $5 handling. That's almost what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"reliability an issue","review":"This is a fine sound machine. it offers multiple options, from rain to waves. It works well and is unobtrusive. Reliability is an issue, however. After a little more than 1 year of use at night, the knob that turns the unit on and controls the volume has shorted out, causing the machine to cut on an off unpredictibly. This defeats the whole purpose, as when it cuts off then comes back on, the sudden noise wakes my children up.Anyway, it worked fine for a little more than 1 year, then wore out. If you need a short term solution, this would be fine. If you want something more reliable, spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good affordable sound machine","review":"I think Homedics makes the best little sound machine not much money can buy! Unless you want to fork out some serious change for great sound reproduction, this machine works great.

It effectively drowns out other household noises such as TV noises (if the TV is on low) in the other room, or moderately noisy neigbors. However, because it is small it doesn't drown out loud noies. For the price, it is a good buy if you are looking for such a device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad knob, all same volume","review":"After loving my two Conair noise machines (both have lasted over five years!), I had to settle on buying this one for my third child. Worst mistake ever. Returned two to the store after the knob broke within a week on both of them. Now I have one that the knob is broke again AND the volume is shot. No matter where I set it, it is all the same volume: very loud. Very disappointing, stay away and get the Conair instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned","review":"I am returning this. I will pay a little more for something a little better. There was some distracting \\"white noise\\" that could be heard with any of the sounds or even when the volume was all the way down. Also it seems like most of the sounds are about 10 second clips. Not so bad with Rain forest, waterfall and heartbeat, but the other sounds have distinctive parts that you find yourself hearing over and over, not relaxing at all. I rechecked the write up on this and it says nothing about it being used or refurbished, but mine was obviously opened and repacked. That may explain the white noise, but the repeating clips is enough reason to find something a little better IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cheap. Spend the money and get something that works.","review":"This was okay for about a week, then quickly went south. It started making clicking/hissing sounds right when I turned it on. Definitely not soothing to sleep to! This one is pretty cheap, so you get what you pay for. It may work better if you don't use it very often. I like to sleep with a sound machine every night.Also, the sounds are very repetitive. Not a high quality, at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it at first until volume began to short out","review":"I purchased this from a local bed and bath store and loved the sleek, small appearance of it. It blends in nicely sitting on top of my white dresser. It has one of the best rain sounds of all the sound machines out there, and has an easy to use design. Recently, like other posters have mentioned, the volume has begun to crack in and out when I twist the dial to adjust it. It seems to be either too quiet or too loud and cracks out on the in between levels. Other than that, it is wonderfully relaxing! I just hope it doesnt completely short out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud Static Generator","review":"This machine has a bad habit of making random and really (and I mean REALLY) loud static beeps that can jar you awake. It is incredibly annoying and disturbing. Mine is going into the garbage. I will not give it to Goodwill to annoy another unsuspecting buyer. FWIW, this is the 2nd DIFFERENT Homedics model I have tried that had the same problem. There is information on the internet about this issue. Wish I had searched earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sounds - poorly made","review":"I bought this at a big box store on clearance before our baby was born. When she was a few months old we decided it was time we needed to start using it - she was just a light sleeper. The thing sounds great - when it works. From the start it has had a problem with shorting out. I love the sounds and honestly am a little addicted to the ocean... just get past the seagull. We have been searching for another sound machine, but in the mean time have found that by putting a C clamp on the machine's speaker and occasionally dropping or banging it to make it work - it does an ok job - about 50% of the time I will find that it is not on in the morning when left on continuous play and the volume knob can be a bit jenky. I was hoping it was just my clearance machine... after other amazon reviews.. I stand corrected.. back to screen browsing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"My wife loves soundscapes, so much so, we started listening to the soundscape music television station at night. The light from the TV was killing me and frankly there was some weird noise from time to time. So to remedy my situation I invested in this product. A good choice. The rain, waterfall and ocean sounds are great. Although I can pick out the repetitiveness of the ocean. The heartbeat is strange and the rain forrest sound is nice, but it has birds (bird sounds are not relaxing to me). Overall I wish it had more sounds to choose from, but for $20, it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relief from city noise","review":"I gave my other Sound Machine to a friend. When I replaced it by mail,by 2, I was disappointed to see or hear, that there was no \\"train\\" on the machines as there had been on the one that I gave away. That was one of my favorite sounds, it put me right to sleep. Other than this one small thing, I adore the sound machines. I have one in the bedroom and one in my studio. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Typical item made in China. Speaker is so small most sounds sound like an old staticky radio.

Mistake to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MACHINE","review":"This thing is a piece of junk. It completely breaks after a few months. If you stay on top of your receipt, you can continue to return it and get another one provided that it breaks within the time they allow for returns. Don't be fooled, it breaks slowly. One day, the knob will have to be wiggled to keep it on, the next week, you have to apply more pressure; by the end of the month, it doesn't turn on at all. Find a better sound machine. I'm still looking. Brookstone is expensive, but tends to have higher-end products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I bought this sound machine because it was only $19.99. Well, it is not worth it. Unlike one of the reviewers, it is loud (so hers must have had additional problems), but it kept shorting out after a couple of months. My daughter will wake up if it turns off, so we would have to run into her room to move the volume knob until it comes back on. So now I am looking for a new one. I have used it for 16 months, and it just keeps getting worse and worse. Time for a new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This is a waste of money. You only get 6 songs and it breaks so easily. It's better to either buy a relaxing CD or download a ton of relaxing songs, put them on an ipod/mp3 player and hook it up to a small speaker to play repetitiously.I suggest Celtic Twilight, Vol. 4: Celtic Planet. Excellent CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for a while...","review":"I got this machine a couple of years ago for my twins' room. For the first few months it worked rather well and I was happy with it. Then one day I noticed the light was on but there was no sound. I had to keep jiggling the on/off/volume control switch to get anything. Now it's junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrical shortage","review":"We bought this at KMart 2 years ago. After 6 months, you'd have to wiggle the volume knob to make it work, it would automatically shut off, as though there was an electrical short. I had my receipt and considered returning it for a replacement, but that was $4.95 -- just the principal that I had to pay more b/c their product stunk. Anyway, it finally died a few months ago. Now I'm on the hunt for another sound soother. I will avoid Homedics products. This is their 2nd sound soother that's died on me (I had the CD player/sound soother and it also got an electrical short that made it always default to the CD player)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it today!","review":"Just received this yesterday and I am returning it today. Used it last night. The repeating sound loop can be distracting, as you wait for it over and over again. It actually kept me awake for quite a while. I personally feel it's not loud enough either. After reading the reviews about the poor quality of the electronics, I don't want to keep it long enough to have it break down."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"As MANY others stated, this product worked fine while it worked. I bought 2 of these units, one for each of my children. After just a few weeks of use both of them stopped working. I would find them \\"off\\" in the middle of the night etc. We diagnosed it as a short in the volume controls. If you messed with the control a bit you might be able to get it back on but that would only last a few seconds. As I said, I bought 2 of these and the same thing happened with both of them. DO NOT buy this product. I now have an infant and am searching for another sound machine and this time I am going to pay a little extra for a better quality machine...or atleast one that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"wisper machine??","review":"We were looking for a machine that would drown out noise while our baby sleeps...well, this machine does NOT get loud AT ALL!!

He is now 4 years old and we have been using it for our 1 year old. We keep it in his room and use it twice a day for naps and during the night. He sleeps much better (and longer!). Our first one just broke and we ordered our second one because we like it so much. I like that you can plug it in or use batteries. You can keep it on or use the automatic off button (turns off after 15 min, 30 min, or 1 hour). The crickets and heartbeat sounds kind of annoy me, but I like the waterfall, rain, and ocean. The rain forest is okay. I'd definitely recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it was working...","review":"We ordered this for our new baby in August and have been using it every night since - we haven't used the battery option, just the plug in.

I was extremely disappointed, but very pleased with the ease of return process and receipt of my credit from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"still works, but touchy","review":"We've had our HoMedics sound machine for 3 1/2 years or so. It still works. BUT, since it was a couple of weeks or months old it has been picky. When you turn it on, you have to crank the volume knob up and down until it stops cutting out (after a while you get a feel for what you are listening for - it just sounds normal after enough ups/downs). Then it works for the night or works on the timer to shut off. The kids like the waterfall sound.If you don't crank the volume knob up and down, it randomly cuts out. We've tried having it on different surfaces and banging it, both of which offer some sort of placebo effect but never really solve the problem.So, if you buy one, be ready to have to work with it over the long term to keep it going. It isn't particularly hard to crank a knob a few times when you turn it on. I hate it, but somehow it doesn't die and the kids like it so we haven't bought a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience","review":"I actual bought this at Walmart, while on a trip with my 2 year old son. The sound kept turning off. I had to fiddle for a while with the volume knob and the cord to finally get it to stay on through the night. I don't know if it was dropped, although the packaging seemed sturdy, or if it was assembled poorly, but if I had a Walmart near me, I'd return it in a flash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This machine's sound knob breaks incredibly easily.

Bought two - BOTH have failed within 2 months!","review":"One of these machines was in the guestroom of a friend in Atlanta in October. (We're on leave from the UK for 6 months.) It worked great, so I immediately ordered two, one for our bedroom and one for our guestroom.The one in our bedroom failed (began to wake us with loud static noise) after 5 weeks of use. So, I unwrapped the second (new) one, figuring that unit 1 was a fluke. After only FOUR NIGHTS, the second unit began waking us with the same sort of loud static noise, so it was a bigger dud than the first!Now my return window for Amazon.com has expired (on Nov. 29th), so, I'm left with the unlikely possibility of having the manufacturer make its one-year warranty good.

On each one, after 2-3 weeks, the one button (which is also the volume button) starts getting a short circuit that makes the noise cut in and out. a few days after that, no more noise. same problem on each one i have tried, so clearly a design defect, not a one-time problem.

At first it was great, you could turn it on and it stayed on alnight without timing out. But by the middle of the week it would simply stop working ramdomly. To get it working again, all you have to do is pat/hit it a couple of times. I left it at my Mother's house so I would not have to worry about bring a sound machine on future visits. About a year later the sound machine at home fell off a dresser and needed to be replaced. This was the only model I could find. I purchased this model again and hoped for the best. This new sound machine within a week started doing the same thing as the first one.

It successfully blocks unwanted noises, without being too obtrusive. Also, I find its design appealing.With this said, unfortunately, the machine broke only after a couple of weeks. It began generating this siren-like noise occasionally, waking us up in the middle of the night. Since it was still under warranty, I had it replaced. The next machine, too, broke in less than a month. This time, it just won't turn on.So, I suppose you get what you pay for.

We gave one to our daughter as a gift, kept one as a back up or for company, and left one at my parent's house for when we were overnight guests there. The sounds are fair, though you can hear the playback as it starts over the cycle again. My issue is with the quality. My daughter used hers for only 4 months before the volume button quit working, and it would randomly change volume in the middle of the night. Luckily we had one in back up. The one we left at my parent's house, though used very infrequently, also had problems and has had to be scrapped due to the volume button, after about a dozen nights of use, it would randomly decide not to work at all.

The other sounds are looped recordings that only last a couple of seconds, and click at the repeat because they are not \\"tiled\\". They contain unique standouts that repeat so often you can't help but tune into it. It would be great if someone made a machine like this that didn't repeat every 2 or 3 seconds! If you made it 15 minutes before repeats (and start at a random place when initializing) then nobody would notice or care. A few seconds of the rainforest for example sounds like this:-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working...during nap time!!!","review":"This sound machine worked great at first.

It is the only affordable sound machine with a white noise function that was loud enough to soothe our colicky baby, and now that he's older, loud enough to block out the noise that would disturb his light sleeping habits. The problem is, it rarely works well! And we have three that all have the same problem! There seems to be a short somewhere behind the knob, and you have to get it in JUST the right place for it to stay on; but it will still frequently cut out.

It inevitably has to be thrown away because it has a short that develops after some time of use. Truth be told, the only reason we keep coming back to this one is because it is easily available at Target, (for the same amount listed here, btw), and my kids sleep very well with them. However, after seeing what else is available online, I refuse to put up with the poor manufacturing anymore. I'm sure the company realizes this problem exists.

A lot of people recommended having a noise machine for the baby, and I received a Sleep Sheep as a gift. After reading the horrible reviews for that, I returned it and bought this instead. I like it because it supplies white noise and nothing else-no lights or other visual stimulation that can be distracting and can actually make it harder for a baby to fall asleep. We have him in a pack n'play in our bedroom, and both my husband and I are going to miss this when we move the baby to his own room.The sounds are very nice and not at all annoying. My favorites are the rain and the waves. The heartbeat is a little creepy.Overall, it's a great item. I just hope it holds up over time. These machines seem to stop working."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good while it lasts","review":"I have burned through two of these already. I have a little one and need a sound spa to help block out the background noise during her naps and at bedtime. I use this product on a daily basis once or twice a day. After consistent use, the dial no longer works right. When you turn it on, the sound won't always turn on and you either have to push the dial down slightly (repeatedly until you get it right, it's quite picky on how much force you use and it varies every time) for it to make noise, or turn it completely off and try again. Also, it turns off randomly and again you either have to push the dial down until it decides to play, or turn it completely off and try again. It is a great idea and my daughter loves the sound, can't sleep without it, but it wears out way too fast. Like I said, I have already burned through my second one in less than two years.
