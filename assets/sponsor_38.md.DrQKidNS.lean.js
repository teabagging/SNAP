Way too much \\"chatter\\" of little value is included. Petula Clark was great--I saw all of these performances back then--but her entire song is in,as a few others, when the IMPORTANT ones are brief clips, or missing completely. AFTER Petula had performed a mere 2-3 minutes earlier,they announce, \\"The British Are Coming!!!, next\\". This looks like a collection someone who just didn't \\"get\\" that era directed.

It's very esoteric.(To have 25 years of experience in content analysis doesnot entail being able to get the message across.) The book, as a whole, lacks clarity and concision. The definitions, often, contain words more difficult and abstract than the word being defined. The author's definition of content analysis alone has55 words! Berelson's definition, found on the same page, has only19 and it is much clearer.

However, I soon discovered that any picture taken indoors with the flash resulted in round dust orbs or spots appearing in the picture. I had no idea what was causing the problem then, after researching it on internet photogrphy sites, I realized it was a reflection from the flash off of microscopic particles in the air. This made the camera virtually useless indoors. When I contacted Nikon's help number, they acted like they never heard of this problem. Then, a look at their website reveled that they were, in fact, aware of the problem but chose to treat it as an acceptable design flaw - bottom line, the flash is located too close to the lens and results in reflective spots whenever the flash is used. I would definitely not recommend this camera to anyone seeking quality indoor photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Compact Digital Camera","review":"I bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it. it takes GREAT pictures and very easy to learn how to use.

We opted for this one. Maybe i am just cursed, but just after one year on this one and poof- no more pictures. The LCD is black except for the on screen display, and I can view pictures in memory. It seems like everything still works, except there is no picture. I don't expect to keep spending decent money on digital camera only to have them break DAYS after the warranty expires. They should not be disposable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"It's not that the book is so bad, it's just that it's not that good. There are too many things left out. Where are the *real* details of how the product works? Where's the coverage of sql-xml? Where's the code showing how to make the server work for you? I was expecting something along the lines of Richter, but got something that feels like it was not written by a real practitioner. After reading this, I doubt that Kalen has any experience in the trenches as they say. Sorry, but I just can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeats too much of prev version - omits SQL 2000 topics","review":"I have bought every version of this book and am really disappointed with this one.

Security 5. High availability enhancements 6. Transact-SQL enhancements (for example, new trigger types)There's more info in the BOL on each of these than in this book, and that shouldn't be. IMO, these are all core subjects.

Amongst any book on SQL Server, this is the one must have. Kalen explains many items that can not be found anywhere else. The explanations and material are accurate and well explained. Techniques are well explained. Literally, any corporation which has SQL Server should have this on a shelf nearby. Many of the performance related problems, that I find at corporations are answered in this book. So, you can read the book and do it yourself or in many cases pay me to do the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much stuff repeated","review":"This is really the 7.0 book with a pretty adequate find-replace job done on it.

He spends far too much time on things DBAs couldn't care less about and far too little on the real important stuff. The worst part of it is the book is loaded with errors. Lots and lots of them. There are three errors in the discussion of RAID that any practicing DBA worth his money should be able to get right. There are numerous errors in the discussion of the query optimizer. I feel sorry for him that he doesn't know the technology any better than this. On top of all this, this is some of the dullest writing I've ever read. I liked the 6.5 book, but this one bores me to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that bad, but not that good, either","review":"There's just something missing about this book. I have the 6.5 book and really liked it. Maybe it's the fact that Delaney isn't actually on the Sql development team like Soukup was - I don't know. It's just kinda weak, that's all. I wouldn't say it's not useful, but if you don't already know most of this stuff, you really shouldn't be using the product in the first place. Look elsewhere if you want an in-depth exploration of the internals of the product - it ain't here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"We recently moved from Informix to Sql 2K and found this book very useful.

I recognize almost all of it from other sources - TechNet, the v7.0 book, MS whitepapers, etc. I suppose I'd be ok with that if the book did what its title implies - cover SQL 2000. But it doesn't. None of the new features are covered at all. My advice is not to waste your time-money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad","review":"This book is so horrible. It represents the worst in technical books these days. It's dreadfully dry - like put you to sleep dry. It's redundant. Most if not all of the info in this book is also in the Books Online.

Judged on those merits my opinion is that this book is a must-have product."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what's new ?","review":"I thought the first book in the series, for v6.5, was a terrific work. It was comprehensive, very readable, and truly seemed like Inside info. The v7 book was a bit of a step back, but had some little new stuff that it was still not bad. But now this is just getting annoying - this is yet another rehash, but manages to LOSE good information, without adding much of anything of significance. I hope MS Press can convince Ron Soukup to return to do the next version - as his original work was SO much better than this retread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much like the 7.0 book","review":"I liked the 6.5 version of this book. The 7.0 one was pretty useful too. But theproblem with this one is that its too much like the 7.0 book. I feel like I've just paid for the same book twice. Whole chapters are virtually identical. Why put out a 2000 book if you're not going to cover it fully? Not only should XML be there, but so should federated servers, security, and a host of other things. A real letdown..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too inside","review":"If you compare this book to the other Inside books, you'll find that it's hardly Inside. First and foremost, an Inside book should be comprehensive. This book has holes in it big enough to drive a truck through. The first book - the 6.5 edition - was comprehensive. The problem is: the product has expanded a lot since then. Full text search should be covered. XML should be covered. Replication should be covered. Clustering should be covered. Analysis services should be covered. DTS should be covered. English query should be covered. None of these are. If you have the 6.5 or 7.0 edition of this book, save your money until they update this one a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"The book is too long and too full of stuff straight out of the BOL to be really useful. There's also way too much academic stuff in here and not enough practical application of it. While it's interesting that an allocation map page controls 512K of other pages, why do I care? In only really isolated, extreme circustances would that matter to me (or if I was building my own SQL Server) and in those cases I'd already be on the phone to Microsoft.If you cut out all the stuff that's nigh useless to the practitioner, you have very little of a book left. Me, I didn't feel it was worth all the hassle looking through the bad stuff (much of it very dated) to find the good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This book is heavy enough, but repeats so much of the 7.0 book that it's really not as comprehensive as it might appear or that it should be. There are far too many 2000 topics that are completely absent (not just XML, as some have noted, but also high availability, replication, new data types, new database options, and many others). On top of that, the book is boring. It reads like a very long whitepaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks most of the things you would expect","review":"What would you expect in a book titled Inside SQL Server 2000?

The products are very similar - the books should be to. I have the same problem with this version that I had with the last. There's to much stuff left out. IN the 6.5 version, we got everything that was of any consequence about SQL Server, as is the tradition with the Inside books series. In this one, we only get updates of what was covered in the 6.5 version. The problem is, there are lots more new areas of the product. they shoudl be covered to. The book could be so much better and more useful than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeats too much of 7 version","review":"I really get tired of books that just take people's money. This one is just a repeat of the version 7 book. There's nothing new here at all. Some pages are word-for-word with the previous one.

A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside SQL Server 2000 is okay","review":"There's nothing terribly wrong with the book, it's just not what I was expecting. I have some of the other Inside books and this one just doesn't live up to them. It's not the comprehensive reference I was expecting. It doesn't cover about half the topics I was interested in, so now I have to go buy another book. That doesn't make it a bad book, it's just that it really doesn't meet my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Inside, not really","review":"90% of the stuff in this book can be found elsewhere. First of all, most of it is in the online documentation that comes with Sql Server. Second, nearly all the rest can be downloaded from the MS Web site. Third, anything that's left can be found in other books, including the precursor to this one, Inside Sql Server 7.0. Not only does the book not take you inside Sql Server, it doesn't even include info that you can't find elsewhere.

I was expecting a book. Bring back Ron Soukup."},{"rating":"1","title":"A re-run of a mediocre book","review":"The 7.0 version of this book wasn't that good but this one is even worse. Even more core topics are not covered in any depth or not at all: fail-over, clustering, replication, XML, etc., etc. If \\"core\\" meant the same thing as it did in the 6.5 book, all of these would be covered.

I don't feel that way about this one. It really needs to be updated. Many key SQL Server 2000 topics are not covered at all. Others have mentioned XML. While I agree that this is certainly worthly of an Inside book, I'm more disappointed by the lack of coverage of high-availability features.

In previous efforts he defended their right to rock and twist despite the protestations of their disapproving elders.

And who better a standard bearer for women's lib than former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley. All kidding aside as camp this is pretty good. Mobley's rendition of the film's title tune is a hoot. The youthful cast is energetic led by Chris Noel, Nancy Sinatra, and Chad Everett best known as that dreamboat Dr. Joe Gannon on \\"Medical Center\\". The featured acts(The Animals, The Dave Clark Five, The Standells among others) lip synch their songs admirably. Eric Burdon seemed a little stiff on \\"Blue Feeling\\".

I had to send them back. This was rather disappointing because I love Tales from the Crypt and would have loved to own the whole collection.I also recall someone mentioning on here that not all these DVDs have the French subtitles either.I think it is great that HBO and Warner have put subtitles on most of these seasons, but I would love to see them put the full set of captions on ALL the seasons, so I could add them to my collection.Hopefully Season 4 and 5 will be produced on Blu-Ray with English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"WB makes one grave mistake","review":"I am currently watching some of the episodes of this season, but if you watch the entire opening sequence of the DVD before selecting from episodes, play, etc, they give away the twist endings for a few of the episodes.

I can tell you it follows the same line Papyrus always has when it comes to Nascar series, only with better physics, better graphics, better realistic environment, better everything. Graphics: Driving at top speed in sunny weather, looking at sun glares made me half-close my eyes... it was amazing! Pit crew look like lego, but is animated, and gives a different feeling about pit stops. Physics (even if I didn't think it could improve): when I drove the first time, I couldn't accelerate too much because I kept spinning all the time. Crashes looked so real that reminded me the crashes of cops chases on TV. Environment: Two driving ways come with the demo and the tracks are very different when it comes to track marks, colors, dirt, announcer (\\"Gentleman... start your engines!\\"). A word for this game: Attention to detail. Papyrus does it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nascar 2003","review":"The game is AWSOME .. papy has taken things to a whole new level ..

You can race all of the usual \\"Cup\\" tracks or download awesome tracks like Mosport and Le Mans.

As with all games, make sure you system requirements are far beyond the minimum or that is what you will get...the minimum experience. If the requirements say the minimum is a 32m graphics card, then get 128m card. No reason to give this one star because your system components are barely making it. Also make sure you get a wheel, or don't even bother buying this game, as the racing experience will be arcadish with a keyboard. I have a AMD 1800+, 512m of RAM, and a 128m MSI GeForce Ti 4800, and this game simply rocks. With all the mods, car and truck paint schemes, setups, etc...this game will last for some time. Then join an online league and compete from the safety of your own home. Even Dale E. plays this game to practice without the hassle of real wear and tear on a real car.

In races you have to keep turning to the right to keep from spinning out, my best lap in Nascar Racing 2002 Season at daytona was like 199.00 mph but in this game it was like 170.00 mph and that was after a week of practice. My advice is to either get last years one or just wait for Nascar Thunder 2004 that is coming out this fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Waste","review":"I bought this game for [dollar amount] and played it for 30 seconds.

With minimal practice you can play tunes on all four (although you need big hands for the Tenor recorder) and with more practice you can play just about anything.The tones are good, and the tuning well within one's ability to control one's breath - a standard control for playing recorders.I would endorse this set for anyone who wants to take recreational recorder playing to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable disc","review":"These classic performances are just a delight.

I nearly cried when I read of Mr. Walker's death, after I had grown to appreciate him, as I read the \\"Wild Hogs\\" story.George Roof is certainly a master of \\"painting pictures with words\\". His excellent use of details, truly brings these stories to life. I felt like I was right there, seeing, and feeling, the action first hand, as he described situations and events. The suspense in the stories, gained momentum with each page I turned.

Reading its 300 pages is a far better alternative then laboring through Hanna Batatu's 1000+ page Iraqi Bible and is just as rich in content. His last chapter is near prophetic and its cautions were ignored and thus revealed after the invasion of \`03.

As a novice of the Middle East, I tremendously enjoyed this book and found it fascinating (although I was overwhelmed with the many different names in the book from time to time and it took me more than three months to finish).For the last few centuries, Iraq has not evolved much and is still stuck in the past. It is a country built on patronage networks. Those who have been in power constantly persecute and eliminate those opposition who are deemed threatening.It is in stark contrast with Western democratic societies where the freedom of speech is treasured and opposing voices will not be silenced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiny skates book","review":"Necklace was not included with book even though it was shown in photograph.

Would only go back to zero no matter which measurement was selected. Gauge was only 3 months old.This deserves half a star..DON'T WASTE your MONEY BUYING THIS ONE. it will not make a proper seal with the tire valve as the insert piece is NOT deep enough, plus the lighted tip being plastic is Not durable enough to be used next to tire valves. The lighted tip will generally crack during normal wear and tear.Then the unit will stop working.Contacted the company after my experience with this one.. they promised to send me another one.. the one they sent looks like the pistol grip kind it is supposed to read from 5-99psi. It is actually WORSE then the other unit & this unit only has a B/W LED screen & you can not read it in the dark or at night.This is strike two for this company. Think I want my $$$ back, this is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"not moisture proof","review":"Bought this gauge for my wife and her new car. Put it in a tool box in the trunk without even using it. Two months later decided to check the tire pressures with it. Unfortunately a bottle of window cleaner had fallen over in the trunk and leaked. Seems despite the gauge being in a tool box and the window cleaner outside the toolbox, it managed to collect enough moisture to short out the batteries and the device was dead with droplets of water covering the digital display. Never got to use it once. Think mechanical gauges are more robust. Never had a problem with the old stick kind, and they are lot cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable at any price","review":"After using this gauge twice, it wouldn't turn on. So I figured the battery was dead and I took it apart to change it. It wasn't the battery that was bad but the battery/switch contacts. Almost an hour later I finally got them to work properly. The next time I used the gauge, in the space of four tires it went from working perfectly to needing three or four tries to get an accurate reading to not working at all. Needless to say, I'm not a fan of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I received this as a gift from a friend...","review":"... after having to adapt to a more predominantly night-centered lifestyle. I am very happy with the product; The display is adequately luminous, easily read, and calibrated within .5 PSI. Peer reviewed, laboratory tests, notwithstanding, the given PSI reading seems to be rather accurate (based solely upon the precision of the linear trajectory of the vehicle in use). My only concern, or complaint rather, is that the tire gauge must be switched off - and of course, back on again - succeeding, and thereby, proceeding, each intended reading. Perhaps I have failed to thoroughly evaluate the product, but it does not appear to include a \\"Reset\\" switch or intended option. (I have, mind you, not, as of yet, read the instructions.)All in all, this thing rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, minor issues","review":"I've had one of these for several years; picked it up a W-mart. It seems quite accurate (when compared to my other gauges) and consistent. My main complaint, a minor one really, is that it works on a timer. Once you turn it on, you've got a minute or so to take your readings before it turns itself off- no matter what. You must turn it back on to keep going.The lighted display is nice for use at night outside. There is no need to reset it after a reading is taken; just use it again and it reads the new value. Like most of these cheap gauges, it does not have a pressure release valve.A perfect product would have a pressure release valve so you could bleed down to your desired pressure, and would turn itself off a minute or so after the last reading is taken. Easily replaceable battery would be a plus.

At this age kids are more and more curious about death, dying and if ghosts are real or not and this book takes death, ghosts and even bullying too lightly for 6-8 year old learning comprehension of these subjects.

My main speakers are rather small in size but totally efficent and fast. (Totem Mites) The sub was a mismatch. First of all, the sub is too large and massive to compliment the accuracy of the Totems. It simply cannot move in unison with the main speakers. A better match would be a smaller (8\\") sub that has faster response and tone. The Athena will hopefully be better suited to our home theather setup. I bought the Athena because I was taken by the low price compared to the size of the unit. I figured I could dial it down and adjust to my liking. There is simply not enough adjustment to get the system tuned correctly.Bottom line. Poor call for stereo system. If I had it to do over again I would spend twice as much in order to get something that really matched the other components and I would not buy a 12\\" woofer just because it was inexpensive.

And this particular brand makes it MUCH easier to get to that ZONE of horror where the seat bolts onto the bowl - you know the one. Well now you don't have to reach underneath (into unknown territory and spidery crannies) to unscrew those long plastic bolts. You just turn the two attachment things on the TOP a half turn and the entire seat comes off. Then it's zip zip zip with some cleaner, plop the seat back on, half turn to the left, and voila.

This was the book I relied on the most. It's well laid out with dialogues, readings and grammar notes. The emphasis is on natural topics of conversation in Africa, not on travelers' phrases, so you won't learn how to have your luggage carried to your room. Instead you'll learn about farming, fishing and schooling. The lessons progress slowly enough that I was not overwhelmed (a problem with the Teach Yourself series).I have one serious complaint, which is that the book introduces all the noun classes at once in chapter 14 -- which caused me to put the book down for almost a year before giving it another try.Learning a language on your own out of a book is very difficult, but this book is the most useful one I found. As a classroom text I think it would be excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Anything Else","review":"Reading other glowing reviews of this book made me wonder \\"Did I have the same text?\\" This book is a hopeless muddle for a beginning student of the language!

The second hook I purchased was for a 5 pound limit. I followed instructions again and this time the hook and adhesive both came off the door...approximately 15 minutes after it was mounted. The tape backing on the wall side was barely sticky enough to attach to my finger so it was no wonder it wouldn't stay on the door.

I wanted to hear the songs the way I remembered them while cruising back in the '70s. This CD set is OK if you just want the songs and don't mind that they don't sound exactly like the original recordings. If you're looking for a trip down memory lane, forget about it.

Rysanek is not at her best and is clearly vocally exhausted by the finale. Ludwig has some real problems with the tessatura at this point in her career and barely makes it to the end of the performance, ducking the last high C altogether.

Now her mother is gone, and Honey wants to reclaim her old home and her place in New Orleans society. At a masked ball given in her honor, she meets the mystery man, Stephen Turner, who comes from a prominent family of attorneys. They begin dating and soon proclaim their love for one another. However, there is mystery surrounding a beautiful young woman Honey befriends by the name of Jacqueline, who is the daughter of now deceased well-known \\"courtesan\\" Madeline. Though set in current times, many of the terms, mores, and dialogue were geared more for a century ago, or even the early 1800's. The pretensions of the so-called aristocrats seemed forced and false. Mst of the characters were caricatures of themselves. Unfortunately the story just didn't jell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This book focused on the Creole society of New Orleans. Unfortuntely, the characters seemed to be stock characters at best. I could never get a feel of the characters, therefore, I could not get into the story, nor sympathize w/their situations. The problems that they faced were more appropriate for the 1800's than the year 2000. The romance between Honey and Stephen felt forced and stiff. I just did not enjoy this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating romance","review":"I'm so pleased the author refrained from inundating us with that in your face...urban... vulgarity that we see so often in contemporary ethnic romances. The setting takes place in the sultry city of New Orleans. I must say that Courtni Wright superbly captured the essence of New Orleans' Creole society. The intricately well written charachters were very easy to relate to and quite refreshing. No reader need fear being offended by brash sexually explicit scenes. The author is quite delicate and shows a great deal of propiety in dealing with the subject. I recommend this book for anyone of refined taste wishing to settle back and enjoy a lovely and intriguing romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has all the words, and it's free.","review":"I decided to read some of Lindsay's work after reading a piece on Slate about this lost progenitor of the Beat Poets. Heh, progenitor. See what happens when you read poetry? Your vocabulary gets all aggressive.

So I wasn't surprised to see that despite including the actual poems this time, there was no formatting to them.

Lenson is surrounded by dregs","review":"While Desert Storm is being prepared, Lt. Commander Lenson gets his shot at a command billet. A short one preparing the Frigate, USS GADDIS, for delivery to the Pakistan Navy. But a series of verbal commands, and strange reassignments leaves the Lenson and the GADDIS partially manned with a crew of castoffs and no logistical support in the North China Sea attempting to intercept modern day pirates that have bigger guns and better crews. - A bizarre plot line, within a lousy 'environment'. Once again Poyer has portrayed the 'modern Navy' as rife with murderers, mutineers, and incompetantants, including the main character. I don't understand why I keep buying the Dan Lenson books, the writing is good but Poyer's population of Navy personnel is something from a 60's antiwar flower child that thinks all military personnel are the dregs of society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good page turner","review":"This is the first book I have read by David Poyer. I borrowed it from the library so I would have something to read on the plane from JFK to London -- and I thought the cover looked cool.

It moved fast, and had some pretty good unpredictable twists. Overall I would strongly recommend this book.The serial/killer sub-plot kind of mucked things up a bit, but the rest of the story compensates for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done and great find!","review":"This is one of the best navy books I have ever read.

Unit allows you to adjust screen contrast using 5 settings but if you try to change it (more/less contrast), the text on the screen becomes pretty much unreadable/useless.3. Manual fine-tunning for radio stations is difficult.4. No automatic radio tuning! You can get this feature in those cheap $3 miniture/pocket radios.4. Radio reception is very poor.

Somebody in China or at GE needs their eyes examined.-Phone is hard to grasp, especially when you're bleary eyed.-Battery backup does not remember radio tuned locationThe ugly:-The stupid flashing blue light when the alarm (radio or buzzer) goes off.The sad thing is, this was about the best corded unit I could find on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Display Excessively Bright","review":"Even at the lowest setting this unit will light up the room and make it difficult to sleep.

Where to start?First of all, when speaking on the phone, you can here the radio station in your ear. Fortunately, the individual on the other end of the line cannont. This just seems crazy to me.Second, the FM band essentially does not work. It receives the same station for about 50% of the dial range, again, this seems crazy. The AM band works ok but the unit has questionable reception strength.Third, the display light is very bright but now I am just getting picky.I rated this two stars because it essentially technically does what I ask, which is be a clock radio with a phone. Do not expect anything above and beyond these features. This product functions, but on life support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The item would not work.

Duh...they had this new invention...a corded phone that can't be carried off! So I went on a mission to pick out a corded phone that couldn't run away, but discovered there aren't many out there. Also between my alarm clock, lamp, tissue box, glasses, etc there wasn't much room for a phone. Then I found it. A phone/alarm clock all in one! And it even has Caller ID so you don't have to answer annoying calls in the middle of the night. A must have! Every bedroom should have one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I like this product. It does have a few flaws such as the bright light and the crazy high pitched squeaking noise that occurs when you are hanging up the phone. But....I normally just put something infront of the light at night so I can sleep and I wait till the other person has hung up so that they don't go temporarily deaf from the high pitched squeaking noise.I love that it has a dual alarm feature and that the volume can be turned up pretty loud when your favorite song comes on.

The face was too bright at night & I could not dial out on the phone after about a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy (except for radio reception)","review":"Overall, I am very please with this unit. Things I like about it: space saver, multiple brightness settings, dual alarms, good quality phone, the fact that I don't have to reset the alarm everyday. You just hit 'alarm off' and it won't come back on until the next morning. No hassle of having to remember to flip a switch back. The only drawback for me is that it doesn't get the best reception on the radio function. I can't stand waking up to buzzers, I MUCH prefer music, but it is often difficult to lock into a station. I've had mornings where I don't wake up in time because, despite having checked the tuning the night before, when the alarm goes on in the morning, it's tuned to 'dead air' = no noise = oversleep. In all fairness, my station of preference is a college-based, member-supported public radio station, so their transmitters don't have the megawatt power of a more commercial station.

Not really delighted with the radio reception, however. It seems to pull in a weaker station from the university better than some of the powerhouse stations around here in the Buffalo area. But it does what it is supposed to. Bought it for a senior citizen and she likes the big readout.

The on/off for the ringer is located in the back. What a pain, have to pick up and turn around to operate ringer switch. Husband is shift worker so the phone gets turned on and off frequently. Elderly mother, so needs to be on when both parties sleeping. To set the alarms takes two hands, one on each side of the unit, and every time you hit an alarm button or setting buttons, it beeps. Not good for setting alarm in dark while spouse is sleeping. If the wrong button is hit while setting alarm, then have to go thru the whole setting process, Date, time, contrast. Much too difficult to operate, in low lite. Reasonable price but not worth it for the difficulty in setting alarms and ringer. Very low quality, in features. Not at all user frienly.

However, for having so many recipes, I found this book to be rather unimaginative. Many of the recipes involved tacking on ramen noodles to traditional recipes, or substituting ramen for another kind of noodle. More still seemed to be similar with slight variations or even just bland combinations of ramen with different kinds of canned soup. I don't need a recipe book for that!

It is history- and derivation-heavy, but nearly devoid of analysis and ignores \\"the big picture.\\" It was a wonderful reference when I was doing graduate work -- I already had a very solid background in Calculus, dimensional analysis, Quantum Mechanics, and so forth -- but it is not a good textbook if you are learning the material for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be using it again...","review":"I just finished a Modern Physics course using this book and was not happy with it at all.

That was when I stumbled upon a 1981 version of \\"Concepts of Modern Physics\\" by Arthur Beiser. To my dismay, Thornton's text seems to be a cheap knock-off of this much older (and better) text.

Thank God for duct tape as that is the only way I'm able to keep thehose connected to the body as the point of connection in the plastic top simply broke out from standard use.

It is cheaply made and has not held up well. The brush deteriorated within 6 months. The retractable cord rarely does. The bag full indicator hasn't worked since almost the beginning. The plastic hinges have all broken and I now have no suction. It doesn't roll smoothly and bangs into all of the furniture.

I can't seem to get the vacuum to its full suction power. The bag never completely expands. The tools are also a pain to get on and off. I don't even bother with therug power head. I use my upright. I can't stand plugging and unpluggingthis! Overall, stay with Kenmore. Much better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vaccum for the price.","review":"I have owned many Kenmore's at twice the price. This vaccum has better suction and is easier to manuever, because it is lighter.

Well, my \\"worn out\\" canister vacuum is much MUCH better than this \\"new\\" model. The transparent iMac look and the poor performance reminds you of a Fisher-Price toy vacuum rather than a real model. The fancy brush attachment is \\"powered\\" only by suction, so it STOPS spinning/brushing as soon as it comes in contact with whatever surface you are trying to clean. The big powered brush head couldn't vacuum cat hair off a low pile rug.

It has a lot of power and I can easily move from one floor surface to another. It even has a switch that you can use to turn of the motorized brushes as you move between carpeted areas. I also especially like the small powered brush that you can use for stairs. It is just the right size to get dirt and fur from corners. The attachments make it perfect for vacuuming the car and it is easy to move around with two metal \\"wands\\" that can be detached. I do have a very furry dog so I use my vacuum very frequently.

It works on air and when you put it to any material it stops spinning. The upright power tool for carpets also stopped working after about six months. The hard wood floor tool worked fine - and suction was strong enough - but again the plastic pieces break and the attachments don't stay on like they should, so I spend most of my time with the vacuum re-attaching the pieces.I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a vacuum to last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Adequate","review":"It's a good thing this vacuum is cheap because that's what you get - a cheap vacuum. The collection bag is small (get used to replacing it often), the canister doesn't roll freely behind you (get used to tugging it), the return spring for the power cord is barely able to do the job (get used to helping it back in), and the power head wants to jump out of your hand when the brush is spinning (get used to fighting it).On the plus side, the thing is inexpensive and has a good selection of attachments, but it's not enough to overcome the many negatives.

Then the retractable cord broke, so I had to loop the cord up like a rope when I wanted to put the vacuum away. THEN the motor broke and it stopped sucking. Game over.

But that might just be me. Some of the characters in the book are quite commical and as usual the Redferns are involved in the plot. But this book also has something about the witches in it.

When I received the knife there was a problem with the lock-(it was loose and would lock and unlock itself). I just super-glued the lock open since the pocket clip keeps the blade tip down. I have now been carrying this knife everyday for nearly 2 years. It still opens fast and the CNC machined handle is a great design because it can take a lot of abuse and never shows wear; aside from offering excellent grip.

I'd never heard him before, but I immediately heard, not Nick Drake necessarily, but early John Martyn, a close friend of Nick Drake, another Scotsman, and a hell of a singer and guitar player. If you're looking for a similar style to Alexi, check out John Martyn's earlier work. I'd recommend the album \\"Solid Air\\" and earlier work. John's work spanned several decades, and I'm sure was(is) on Alexi's frequent play list. John's album \\"Solid Air\\" is my favorite album of all time, since it first came out in 73, and I've worn out several copies over the years. Thank god for digital.Alexi's work reminds me a lot of the reasons why I found John's work so compelling, and I look forward to hearing more from Alexi in the future.

Quotation books are often subjective in how they are organized and this one is no exception. However, this book of quotes will leave you wondering \\"What were the editors thinking!\\" The organiztion and inclusion of many quotes are questionable at best. Examples could be found on the heading Laziness:'He has a head that is for rent unfurnnished,' anon. Is this laziness or an example of the elevator that does not go to the top floor, a basket two sandwiches shy of a picnic, or essentially an empty headed person?'The lazy man gets round the sun as quickly as the busy one, Wombat, and 'The lazy are always wanting to do something,' Vauvenargues. While these quotes could have use for a reference to laziness, they beg for the punchline that brings home the concept of laziness. They could also be useful under a different catagorization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Two: Life Outside of Four Bee","review":"\\"Drinking Sapphire Wine\\" isn't as good as the first book in this series, basically because the protagonist is stranded in the middle of nowhere with nothing going on except creating a new Garden of Eve while trying to keep out straying desert creatures (similar to the ones in the Unicorn series) and Jang at the same time. I think this sequel really put a damper on the whole storyline. That's mainly why I gave it a 2 / 5 score.I would certainly recommend the first book (\\"Don't Bite the Sun\\") over this one. But if you liked this book, then I would recommend the combined edition of these two novellas: \\"Biting the Sun\\".If you're looking for a really good sci fi novel, though, then I would highly recommend \\"The Silver Metal Lover\\" by the same author, which is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"By a descendant","review":"I'm the gg-grandson of one of these families (Patrick and Mary Smith).

I haven't tried using either of these syrups in baked goods, so I am unable to comment on that particular aspect. However, if you are searching for a product to put in coffee to make your favorite hot or cold drink, I recommend purchasing the sauce not the syrup, it is well worth the difference in cost.

I'm sorry to say this is not a great movie. At most it is a slightly clever, low budget entertainment - sort of on par with a strong student film. I don't mean that with disrespect, just being honest. The high ratings it's gotten here are pretty inflated, imho. The scenario is preposterous, which could accelerate wonderfully into fabulous campiness, but the film never leaves the ground. Acting is a bit uneven and the script isn't strong. Unless you are friends with someone in the film or someone who made it, this probably won't rank high on your list of favorites. Too bad.

Good thing. I would have been disappointed had I actually rented it. The story line has possibilities galore for a good psychological suspense film but it never delivers. The characters are stereotypical and over the top - so plastic that it's hard to identify with any of them. The move from three sisters who can't seem to stand each other, to three who are now 'bonded' by this experience (in less than two days time) is very hard to believe, and the over the top use of the F-word is hard to understand. Quite honestly, if it wasn't for the 5,000 uses of that swear word it would have been a least passable. For most of the movie I thought I was watching an old Richard Pryor routine. Good idea.

Sorry, Peck wrote off this appealing aspect of the afterlife. Suddenly his character lost interest in being able to time travel, and the idea was never revisited. The rest of the book?

This guy probably never even watched this DVD, but since he can't spell or make sense any better than that, what more could you expect? Basically, there is a reason that S.M.A.C.K. is the #1 hip hop DVD magazine in the streets: because it is raw, and always top-quality. As usual for S.M.A.C.K., in Volume 8 you can expect a solid DVD loaded with exclusive interviews, freestyles, uncut music videos and more. And forget these 30 or 40 minute long DVD's all over the place these days, this DVD is over 90 minutes long with nothing but the realest street sh--, no filler.

I purchased a dozen or so 1 and 2-gang covers locally, but couldn't find the 3-gang so I had to place a special order. The 1 and 2-gang covers were packaged on a cardboard backing with a hard plactic cover. This 3-gang was packaged in a thin plastic bag. The product was extremely scratched and still had the excess plastic attached from the molding process. I returned it and ordered a replacement, but the item arrived in the same poor condition. The quality of the 3-gang cover is not the same as the smaller covers. When I complained to Leviton, they suggested that I place an order for a bulk quantity because those are packaged better. Seriously, that was their solution. They did apologize for my inconvenienc, though, and offered me 15% off on my next e-purchase.

With the screwless plates, its new spacing or none.I was ready to purchase over 80 wall plates before I realized I had expensive fan switches, catv, ethernet and phone jacks that these switch plates could not mount to.

Fully produced, it retains the campy contact high of the acid folk genre, with song and vocal structure in some tracks, others purely instrumental, hearty east/west string instruments, atmospheric electric guitar, enveloping noise, and a western drum set giving the sense of journey.

I was surprised that the images really creeped into my mind. I ended up researching the Cowsills - I found them so curious. Diana Ross and the Supremes were surprisingly - not good - and my Mom says that she remembered this was how they started - this was a real reaction, not a hollywood Dreamgirls take.

It is true that the book makes an extensive coverage of this subject ( food and its preparation, cereals, grains... how people dressed, jewelry, family order, houses and villages, etc. ) and with plenty of photographic material (in this the book excels many others ) but nevertheless it doesn't seem sufficient, on almost each of the chapters I was left with the feeling that the book lacked of something, maybe I expected it to be more centered on how life was organized, read the temple and the palace, economy is not really covered either. The style of the writters maybe considered very easy to follow, like if you were reading a tale, this may not necessarily be bad, on the contrary, but you may end wanting it to be more like other scholar works, more \\"dry\\".

The gameplay, story and acting are singularly terrible. There are tons of characters you can't interact with, the dialogue is moronic, and there are cliches everywhere. Sometimes it's impossible to know where you're meant to go, and the interminably dreary to-ing and fro-ing from the apartment to the taxi to the office is life-threateningly boring.

Unfortunately, this second season isn't quite as good as the exceptional first season. Nonetheless, this is a great show, with top-noch animation and voice acting. If you've enjoyed the first season, defnitely pick this up. Batman Beyond is a fantastic show that anyone who likes cartoons and comics will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Series","review":"As a kid I used to watch the regular Batman the animated series. That series was iconic and groundbreaking. Batman Beyond is a great companion series. Excellent stylish art, great stories and cool villians. Basically this takes place 20 years after Batman (Bruce Wayne) retires after no longer being able to fight crime. Terry McGinnis stumbles onto Bruce's secret and they join forces. Bruce is in a Oracle type position giving Terry support and mentoring him into a great Batman.They have a lot of the original voices for characters that have crossed over from the original Batman animated series, like Kevin Conroy as Bruce Wayne."},{"rating":"1","title":"damage goods","review":"First, the art and storyline of Batman Beyond: Season Season, were excellent. Then, why did I gave this edition a two star rating? Disc No. One was damage. I have to obtained another edition of Batman Beyond: Season Season. This time Disc No. One was \\"reasonabley\\" functional. The odd thing about it, the spot where the \\"damage\\" seem to be zeroed in on both discs falls on the episode \\"Lost Soul\\" and continue on to the next two episodes. Second thought occurred: why is the second season edition is sold much more cheaply than the others, since it has much more episodes? Take all the above in consideration, one is forced to wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry going hard","review":"Very entertaining, alot of futuristic settings and technology.

This comes on 3 DVD's and covers a wide range of cooking skills ranging from knife skills and vegetable preparation, to specific cooking techniques.This is really educational and can be a drop boring at some points if you are looking for the Razzle-Dazzle that comes with a Food Network show. The chefs don't have that 'dynamic' power to draw in an audience. But they are smart and are patient to show the audience every step in cooking.Definitely a MUST if you want to increase your knowledge about preparing different foods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"For me, this product was definitely worth the money. I agree that this program isn't \\"flashy\\" - but that's not really what I was looking for. Most cooking shows and DVDs are recipe based, which is fine... unless you lack the fundamentals of cooking. \\"Essentials of Cooking\\" provides just that: the BASICS.The program is extremely thorough, and taught me so many things that I wished I had learned from my Mom. For example, the DVD portion provides step-by-step instructions and video demonstrations for basic knife skills, stove & oven cooking techniques (how to saute, fry, bake, etc), buying and preparation guides for produce, meat, seafood, and poultry. I've already experienced several \\"aha\\" moments during the video demos - and haven't even gotten to the CD-rom resources yet!Bottom line: If you already know the basics, look elsewhere. But if you want to learn (or re-learn) the fundamentals, get this program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly \\"Content Free\\"","review":"No depth at all. Really lame. There are many much better options. For example, get a DVD by Jacques Pepin or Julia Child -- these have 10,000 times more content than this item.

I love Tom Seizemore..and Danny Trejo is simply a modern cult star. It starts out very good with interesting character development and pretty eerie setting. Though the horror aspect of this film is derivative of much better films like the Ring, and the elm street series..it does try to put it's own signature on it. The movie was entertaining enough to keep me interested...however when the credits rolled I was ultimately disappointed as in my opinion poor writing made the flick fall apart and squandered a good opportunity for a good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done Horror","review":"Furnace was a bit of a surprise. It starts out a little slow and then finds its' pace. The story is solid, as is the acting. There are a couple of holes, but it covers its' bases.Pare plays a homicide detective named Turner who, while investigating the apparent suicide of a guard from Blackgate Prison, stumbles onto a rash of suicides and unexplained deaths at the prison. The administration wants to blame it on drugs, but the inmates know something worse is going on. The administration had a sealed section of the prison reopened after it had been closed for over fifty years. The something inside that section is disturbed by the activity and starts hunting. Turner needs to find out the truth behind the section being sealed, and how to stop what is happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon","review":"If you watched the movie, you will see the character, Simon. Simon \\"seems\\" childlike, however, smart as a fox. At the end of the movie, you see Simon mopping and he has a slight grin.

If you watch the last scene, he spelled out the entire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Horror / Mystery Movie","review":"I purchased this movie, and I am glad I did. It is a very good horror movie.

It's nonsensical because the Bible repeatedly shows its accuracy in all manner of ways. Why would then, a person show favor to a limited secular record? Regardless, the author whether she likes it or not, shows how accurate the Bible is, because although she fudges against the Bible taking away or adding a few years here and there, it is only a few years. Now compare how consistant secular scientists' dates for the age of the universe is using different dating methods, and it will differ by millions or billions of years. Clearly the Bible is more reliable then. It's sad that Christine refuses to see that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice tool... poor quality control","review":"Looked like a pretty cool idea, and the screwdriver isn't bad.

Maybe that's why there are none available!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed Fan","review":"I've been a huge Manilow fan for decades, but the 70s CD was a real disappointment. The choice of songs was not good and they certainly weren't songs that go with Barry's voice. He made a total mess of \\"The Way We Were\\" and \\"Sailing.\\" The man who is known for \\"music and passion\\" certainly had no passion for this CD. At best, he manages \\"mediocre\\" on a few cuts. I think Manilow has gotten to the point where the people around him are afraid to tell him the truth. He does have a nice voice, but not for these songs. Buying the CD at full price is a rip-off. Buy a used copy, listen once, and then re-sell it to get your money back. Let's pray he doesn't feel compelled to do an 80s CD!Save your money and go see him in Vegas. He really does rock in person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Karaoke from Clive","review":"The main reason to own this latest collection from the Clive Davis assembly line is the tastefully stripped down and, at moments, breathtaking renditions of Barry's own hit songs from the nakesake decade. It is on these tracks (most notably Copacabana and Even Now) that there is a trace of emotional connection between the singer and the song, and something new to be found in revisiting familiar territory.While it's impossible to dispute the commercial success of the formulaic collections that have become the Davis stock-in-trade, it is none-the-less unfortunate that a talent such as Barry, who has demonstrated an aptitude in the distant past for much more interesting interpretations of classic songs, is now satisfied with turning out such utterly bland and pointless material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so 'great'","review":"For his third entry in his 'retro' series Barry does justice to the songs he's chosen for this CD. I just wish he would've chosen some different songs though. Too many \\"downer\\" songs. The 50's and 60's CDs were more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making the old new again","review":"I didn't think I'd like this CD. I mean, come on--the same old songs of Manilow's again? But wow! What a delight to hear new versions of his greatest hits. And here's the kicker: I have never liked Copacabana, even though I have been a fan of the Barry for...well, forever. This version of Copa with guitars is simply amazing. In fact, I like all of his remade hits better than the songs of other artists. Who'da thunk?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry Manilow-The greatest Songs of the Seventies","review":"I grew up with Barry Manilow, he was always good and he wrote all of these songs. I saw this concert on TV and knew I had to have this sound track. It is great if you like easy listening and Barry Manilow."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Greatest Songs\\" Deserved Better Artist","review":"It's sad to see and hear a performer in decline. Barry Manilow has never been more than a middling talent, although early songs like \\"Mandy\\" and \\"Could It Be Magic\\" were pleasant (of course, the melody to \\"Could It Be Magic\\" wasn't his, nor did he write \\"I Write The Songs\\"). As performers age, some try to evolve and stay relevant (heard the latest from The Eagles?) while others choose to go the nostalgia route, hoping that our fond memories will outweigh weak performances. In this case, most of the songs just aren't strong enough...and the ones that are (\\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" for instance) suffer badly when compared to the original versions. I expect this \\"Greatest Songs\\" collection to be in the cut-out bins by Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under produced.","review":"I went for this album because I bought many of the songs as originals back in the 'old' days.Now don't get me wrong, Barry plays a good piano, but there are almost no other instruments heard on this album. Money? Studio musicians must cost too much these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"ode to manilow","review":"for over 20 years I have been a fan, you were such a talented man, but your looks are gone, your voice is too, you are not the same man who sung \\"THIS ONE'S FOR YOU\\".

If you can no longer make good records on your own, find someone who can, or pack it up and go home"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Barry's Greatest Work","review":"There is one thread that is present throughout this album, the fact that Barry Manilow seems totally uninspired. I am a fanilow and have been listening to his music since I was a fetus but this one was a misstep. I had big expectations for \\"The Way We Were\\" and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" but both were huge disappointments. Clay Aiken's version of \\"Bridge\\" is way more on point in terms of the production and surprisingly the vocals. Manilow even seems bored singing his own songs in an acoustic styling. They were very bland and sound much better on any of his live CD's then they do on this CD. When you tack on all of the songs from the 70's that were left off of this CD this was a lackluster effort at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take me back.....","review":"Only Barry Manilow could do remakes like this. ALL are wonderful! Love this cd, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to listen to","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Some people may not like Manilow, but the music is soothing and relaxing. A terrific trip down memory lane."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THE ALBUM.....BUT WHERE ARE THE OTHER SONGS???","review":"I love Manilow's music. I believe Barry is one of the best singers of the century. I was eagerly anticipating the release of this new album, 70's. Though I already know all the songs included in the c.d. before it was released, I was hoping that Barry had included some more great songs from the 70s. Examples are:1. Leaving on a jet plane or Annies Song - John Denver2. On and On - Stephen Bishop3. Dont Give up on us - David Soul4. I just want to Stop - Gino Vanelli5. I just want to be your everything - Andy Gibb6. Just the way you are - Billy Joel7. Your Smiling Face - James Taylor8. Nobody does it better - Carly Simon9. Im not in love- 10cc10. Hello its me - Todd Rundgren11. If you leave me now - Chicago12. After the Love is gone - EWF13. Easy or Three times a lady - CommodorsAnyway, I think Barry could have included some of the songs above. These 70s songs are great in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry's Best!","review":"Barry is at his best doing wonderful romantic songs and this is one of his best. I would highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Reading","review":"Arp systematically describes observational evidence against the established idea that redshift is always an indicator of distance. These observational results (high-redshift objects interacting with low redshift objects, and much more) themselves reveal an elegant pattern of galaxy evolution which mainstream astronomy has entirely missed. I feel that I've learned something genuinely new about the extragalactic universe than I have in many years! (Note: one of the other reviewers comment that Arp neglects supernova evidence in favor of the redshift/velocity relation is incorrect--Arp's model actually predicts the same time dilation factor for supernova decay as the Big Bang model)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This is probably the most important book on cosmology you will read. Dr. Arp presents case after case of observational evidence that quasar red shifts represent something other than velocity - something fundamentally more important.

Dr. Arp has it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supernova evidence of doppler red shift can't be ignored.","review":"I bought this book because I am a dissident also.

I tried to finish the book, but kept returning to the same old adage: Old wine, old bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dissident book!","review":"This book gives astronomical photographic evidence that totally refutes the Big Bang theory of an expanding universe. In total opposition to mainstream theory, renowned astronomer Halton Arp offers startling evidence that high-redshift quasars emerge from the nuclei of energetic galaxies. The political wars inside the astronomical community are also exposed in great detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT READING! BIG BANG OR BIG MYTH","review":"Though I am not a scientist, I have been reading science for some decades, and this is one of the best books I have ever found on the subject of the Big Bang theory. It presents in great detail a growing list of observations that call into question the most fundamental premises of the Big Bang theory - especially the assumption that the red shift of light from distant objects is the result of their velocity away from us.Arp's thesis is clearly and persuasively argued and even setting aside the question of it's validity, the book is a treasury of information. It is generously supplied with an excellent glossary and with many, many photos and diagrams (which nearly always land on the same page where they are being discussed, making it that much easier to follow Arp's carefully wrought and clearly written arguments).

I started with this book, and quite soon I had to stop: it was just a little bit too much for a real beginner, and sometimes, diagrams were hard to read because the print has some minor flaws.

It comes out crunchy on the crust with a golden brown color on the bottom because of the holes in the pizza pan. If you want crunchy crispy crust on the bottom too, you have to cook on the bare stone itself (with cornmeal underneath) without the pizza pan, or take the cold left over pizza cooked in this pan, put the pieces in a toaster oven on the bare rack itself for 15-18 minutes at 350 degrees.

He has delusions of every kind, including apparently believing that a woman might choose to kill her child after having it for three years. This novel is definitely anti-woman, as all Fundamentalist Christian tracts are.The writing is jumbled and confused, just like his thinking processes...it's impossible to tell whether he thinks this is Science Fiction, in which case he believes (hopes?) it might come true one day; or a fantasy. If it's the later, the suspension of disbelief is way too high for anyone not on acid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pffew!! What a stinker!!!!","review":"This has to be the worst written book I have ever read. Frankly, I was surprised to even find it on amazon as I thought it must have been published through the vanity press to even make it into print. I find it very difficult to believe that the so-called author of this book makes his living through the written and spoken word. His command of the language barely qualifies him as semi-literate. Take these beautiful sentences \\"...information has to be used in such a way that it enhances the advancement of the Social Order...\\" or \\"Golden beams and intense white lights, like fragmented rays of the rainbow, streaked back and forth around the shining figure, who hovered like a holy apparition high above their heads.\\" While the so-called authors gift of gab may impress those who have never read any other books, I was sorely disappointed.

A \\"Must-Read\\" For Anyone Interested In The Future","review":"\\"Seal of Gaia\\" is a riveting, suspensful drama set in the not-too-distant future. It follows the adventures of Steve Weston, international journalist through the formation of the newly-formed government (New Earth Federation), the installion of the new world leader, and the formation of the new religion. I think Mr. Maddoux has done an excellent job in showing us what could be on the horizon in the immediate future. He shows us how evil, disguised as good, is allowed to grow and fester. And Steve is forced to make a very difficult choice, whether he will serve the NEF or whether he will reject it. He has to choose between good and evil, and between God and Satan because that is ultimately where the choice lies. \\"Action-packed\\" doesn't begin to describe the taut, fast-paced dramatization depicted in this novel. So, for those of you who haven't read it yet, take my word for it. It will really be worth your while."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is degrading to the reader's intelligence","review":"I am confused regarding the author's motivation in writing this book, but I am convinced it is degrading to the intelligence of the average reader, not to mention the above-average. Are we to believe that the ecology movement is fueled by the devil? This is apparently what the author believes; it therefore follows that he believes God wants us to destroy the earth through our greed and lack of restraint.Fortunately, I don't believe the devil exists, except perhaps in the mind of the author. I do wonder, however, if he's been taking his medication on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad for a first novel","review":"the book is entertaining and a good way to kill time on a plane. It's not deep nor especially well written - this author has a long way to go before he is a Dean Koontz or a C. S.

Overall it's a good read if you have nothing better handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This is a well written novel that entertains and challenges the reader's thinking at the same time. Not bad for a work of fiction. I found myself becoming totally absorbed in the storyline with each scene flowing into the next. While I may not agree totally with Mr. Maddoux's predictions for the future, I cannot dismiss them out of hand either. I'm sure the book will shake up the thinking of a lot of people. I was particularly captivated by his description of the future world government. With the recent developments in Europe, his description of the rise of a new global power (the New Earth Federation) coming out of a renewed European alliance is almost prophetic. And as a computer tech, I was impressed with his description of the almost god-like super computer \\"The Omega\\" that is housed over a mile below the earth's surface inside the underground city in Switzerland known as \\"The Mountain.\\" That was a trip. The book was a great read and I look forward to his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STARS, OF COURSE","review":"It is obvious that most people who heard this recording agree that it is the finest version available. Katy from Texas seems to need a remedial course on what is going on in Baroque Music these days.

My shoulder strap became loose and ultimately detached completely after only about 4 or 5 months of regular use. If I had paid $29 for it, maybe, but at $100+ it's really unacceptable.

Remember, books always never leave things out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not the Julie Garwood book at all","review":"I bought this movie expecting to see Garwood's book brought to life. I think the only thing the screenwriter read was the back of the book! There was no romance and it was disappointing to watch, expecting (in vain) to see the funny and interesting parts of the book. If you have read the book and loved it, dont watch this movie. If you havent read the book, expect to see an average family drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rose Hill","review":"So sad, so bad! Readers Beware! I was vastly disapointed in this. I was hoping for that \\"Garwood magic\\" and ended up wanting to drop the video off my deck. They totally revamped a wonderful story to garbage. Yes, there was a MaryRose and 4 brothers that went west to Rose Hill and that's where they stop. There is a woman they bring along to cook that never exhisted, there was an indian woman ( I think these 2 were to take Crazy Corey's place). They add a cattle rustler for a love intrest. Cole dies. and there is this Irishman that also didn't exhist.Where Is Maryrose's husband? And MaryRose never goes off to school which is the big part of the story. Where is Mama Rose?? we never get a letter. She is a big part of the story. And Adam marries the Indian woman...Huh? Where'd the story go.. Please don't do a sequel.

What a waste of 90 minutes. There was none of the charm, none of the humor (except for a couple of chuckles), and zero romance!! There was no frustration that came with the Elliot family, no drop dead gorgeous man to sweep Mary Rose off her feet, and couldn't they have found a better Mary Rose? Mary Rose with a short little guy like Fergus?? COME ON! And where was Adam's elegance, and Cole's heart, and Travis's sweetness, and Doug's maturity? As a movie, even without the book, it was terrible. It left alot out and wasn't much better than a summary of the book (an inaccurate summary at that).I have never been more aggravated with a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened To The Story?","review":"I am a HUGE Julie garwood fan and I was very disapointed with this movie. I saw it on the Hallmark Channel not too long ago and I was happy to only catch half of the movie. Who is Fergus? And what happened to Harrison? Oh, yeah, he became her brother in the movie. I lost interest in the movie when Cole was killed. It would have made a great follow-up if Cole's story Come the Spring had been made into a movie. I know that movie adaptations don't always follow the book, but give me a break. They did a complete 360 with this movie. Julie Garwood fans rest assured that the Clayborne family continues with Noah Clayborne in her newer books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As a huge Julie Garwood fan, I was very excited about seeing the book on film. The book and the movie don't have that much in common, except 4 brothers and a sister. There were extra characters that were not in the book. And yes, Mary Rose was not the sweetheart in the movie that she was in the book. Spoiled, selfish and a brat! There is a new storyline introduced that has nothing to do with the book. A sore disappointment for sure! Beware Garwood fans, you will be disappointed!

This book is the third book in a trilogy that started with For the Roses. I was going to buy the movie \\"Rose Hill\\" but after finding out that Cole is killed off in the movie, there's no way I can even fathom seeing the movie, let alone spending money on it, now. Julie Garwood's book are sexy, romantic, full of hope and Cole Clayborne was my favorite character. I looked at all the actors chosen to portray the Clayborne brothers and none of them were who I had pictured as the rough, good-looking, sexy men of Rosehill/Blue Belle, Montana. Hallmark did a great disservice to the author and to the fans of For the Roses/The Clayborne Brides and Come the Spring. Especially Come the Spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the book!","review":"If you've never read the Julie Garwood book on which this is based, you might find the movie just mediocre.

Good thing I prepared myself, because this adaptation is almost nothing like the book, except that it emphasizes the family relationship of Mary Rose and her unconventional brothers (which was my favorite part of the book anyway). I am a big Jennifer Garner fan as well, so I liked seeing her in something pre-Alias. I like this movie, but would not recommend it for fans of the book, as they will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Having read many of Julie Garwood's books, I settled down with bated breath to enjoy what I expected to be a brilliant film.How wrong could I have been?I can only wonder if the screenwriter actually read Julie's book. Other than the use of the characters names, this butchered story bore little resemblance to the original plot.All four brothers are much stronger characters and none of them were lost along the way to death! Where did Fergus spring from? And what happened to the English Lord?Arghh! Don't bother with the film - stick to the book it's a far better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"I am one of the few people who watched the movie before I read the book, but all I know is that after reading the book, which was wonderful by the way, I was deeply dissapointed with the movie.

Sadly this was not to be. The highly forgetable actress who played Rose was overly pouty and did not resemble the strong and capable character of the book. While the cinematography was beautiful, the film was void of the depth of character of the novel. It seemed as though the scriptwriter could not allow Adam, the african-american Claymore to be as vital to the film as he was in the book. The ending, which included a senseless betrayal, the death of Cole and Rose settling for Fergus(none of which were in the book) was a tv movie whimp out. Perhaps, if it had been four hour film presentation there would have been time enough to tell the story in a way that truly honored Julie Garwood's wonderful work. Ditch the moive and READ THE BOOKS, as each brother had there own story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"As I am a huge Julie Garwood fan, I found this movie to be very disappointing. The movie contain none of the depth of For The Roses, it didn't bring the charcters to life at all and ended up being an entirely different story to the book. The only thing that could really link the movie to the book was the fact that the characters names were the same, and that Mary Rose was the missing Lady Victoria. I agree with Angela Middleton's review further down - the screenwriter obviously hadn't read much of the book at all, otherwise the movie would have ended up as wonderful as the book is. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and continue to read it over and over again. I would be very surprised if Julie Garwood wasn't deeply disappointed with the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was in the picture","review":"The product contained packs of The Nightmare Before Christmas collector series I A-F trading cards, which is not what picture was used for the item.

First, it imputs only Midi Type 0 files. I have hundreds of old midi files I've produced, all in Type 1. With all the bells and whistles it has, why couldn't Casio have added the midi type as an option?Second, the input card is in the back of the machine, hard to get to, and not convenient for transferring when dealing with short midi files.

It is the most beautiful book I have ever read. It is written in Hesse's gentle, quiet style, and consists of metaphorical meditations on wandering. The imagery is graceful while the implications resound deep within one. Each sketch moved me deeply. This is Hesse at his best, a spiritual explorer, free of dogma, immersing himself and the reader in simple yet fascinating reflections.

The author clearly is in love with the sound of his own voice and writes as if he were speaking to his students at Oxford. This does not work very well in print. The book is full of run-on sentences and tortured grammar of a kind that would net a sophomore at a middling American college a C- on an English paper. Decent editing just to eliminate verbosity would cut this tome down by a third. Gilbert's perspective is excessively Anglo-centric -- his main source seems to have been microfiche of headlines from the London Times for the years covered. And his strict year-by-year structure means that important themes are diced up and impossible to follow. Interestingly, the one time he breaks from this structure to write thematically -- his coverage of World War I -- the book works quite well. Sadly, these few chapters are not enough to justify the pain imposed by the rest of this doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author in Need of an Editor part two","review":"You would think that someone who was knighted by the Queen and was an English subject to boot would know exactly how long Queen Victoria reigned for....on the first page of year 1901 he writes that she had reigned for \\"sixty-one years\\"...though 1837-1901 does not exactly add up to sixty one years.I really couldn't get past the glaring errors...this is a real shame or sham when there are so many great historians out there who could be publishing and can't because people like Martin Gilbert are pumping out these editorial nightmares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, So far...","review":"So far there have been over ten major publications of histories of the twentieth century, including from broadcast journalists (Peter Jenings).

I would think there's more history to those years then just the Balkans and Russia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowned in Detail without Insight","review":"Despite all the hoopla, this is a bad, bad book, which reads as if two dozen researchers had gathered every scrap of information on the first part of this century and then the most unimaginative of writers had just put them in chronological order and called it a history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author in Need of an Editor","review":"Unfortunately not up to Martin Gilbert's ability. This applies to both volumes. They are sorely in need of an editor. Errors abundant. An example, Gilbert refers to Roosevelt's Depression speech..\\"The only thing you have to fear...\\" as a reference to impending World War II. Very narrow focus on 20th century which begs the titles \\"Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler,\\" \\"Europe 1914-1951\\". Essentially, the book is a \\"clip job\\" that fails to take into account great and near great events, scientific, political, social and engineering that occurred in this century. This effort fell short of expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Along with Sony Bluetooth Wireless Transmitter for iPod, good system.","review":"Bought this along with the Sony Bluetooth Wireless Transmitter for iPod. Connected the receiver to mini-jack input in my Bose Sound Dock (any amplified system with an aux input should work), and transmitter to my iPod Classic 160GB. Sounds good (hard to tell if there is any difference bet. direct docking the ipod and using the bluetooth system). Setup is easy as pie. When iPod battery eventually runs down, simply dock it on the Bose to recharge - and listen while recharging. One gripe though; can't adjust volume using iPod via bluetooth - have to adjust the volume on the sound system for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO SO Solution","review":"Paired well with iPhone and IPad.

I tried it on both my home stereo and outdoor unit, horrible results. Then tried it hoping I could at least push audio out to my BT headphones...same deal, distortion.

We returned it and obtained a replacement unit. That unit did successfully work for pairing transmitter-wise, but the audio had too much delay for our needs since we were attempting to watch TV. Too much delay entered in, and the sound wasn't up to expectations. Our blue-tooth headphones sound great when listening to other devices, but just not when receiving from this transmitter.

When trying to run or work out using this just the movement of my body causes interference and the signal constantly breaks up. Totally unusable no matter whether I wear the radio / transmitter in front or back. I always clip it outside the pocket, but no luck.

The councilmen agree to his price, but when the job is done, they refuse to pay him. The Piper retaliates by taking away what is dearest to them.This film was made for TV in 1957. The dialogue is all in rhyme and the songs are set to the melodies of Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt. Van Johnson is excellent as both the hero Truson and the enigmatic Piper. Claude Rains is delightfully silly as the pompous Mayor, and the very funny Jim Backus steals the show as the King's Emissary.

The author knows how to write to inform without a lot of fluff. Thomas Jefferson was a very complicated man. He lost his wife after only 10 years of marriage, his grief over this lasted 6 months, and then into the political man that we all have learned and loved. Yet, his inner man struggled with equality of each person, especially with the black slaves that he owned. In many memoirs, he expresses this thought-provoking justice, yet he does not free those slaves. In examining Thomas Jefferson, it should allow us to examine ourselves, as the inner-person struggles on the deep pains of the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good extrapolation!

Now although the book is anchored on Hans Moravec's solid knowledge of things computational, most of the text comes across as little more than wild speculation a la Frank Tipler. Moravec's assumes the resolution of so many and so complex social, technological and scientific problems that it is difficult to follow the last two thirds of the book with a different frame of mind than that one would adopt when watching Star Wars. In particular, the pervasive idea of correlating raw computing power with intelligence, with complete disregard to the structure imposed on that computing power, results irksome.

I get that the author felt the need to \\"testify\\" here, but I wish that it had been more accurately labled - maybe \\"A Christian Path of Recovery for Adult Children...\\" or something like that.

Scored a 530 on the GMAT. Verbal 88 percentile (39 scaled) Math 17 percentile (25 scaled). The math questions in this book are structured differently then on the exam. The book relies heavily on the \\"substitution strategy\\", that is substituing given answers in a multiple choice question into the question's equation to find the answer. Well that may have worked before but the questions are now structured in such a way that the substitution method rarely if ever works. Also the explination of some practice questions are vague. For example, an explination will simply state, \\"we know because they are similar triangles\\" or \\"we FOIL the equation\\". These are basic concepts but it's been 10 years and I can't remember them. I didn't expect to remember them, that's why I bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like the real GMAT","review":"The tests are not adaptive like the real GMAT, so the scoring is way off.

I found that this book and its sample questions and practise tests had very little to do with the GMAT test itself. You can see this if you take one of the tests on the accompanying CD and then compare it to the one of the practise tests from GMAC. I was actually very discouraged after doing some of the practise tests on here and thought I was going to do badly on the GMAT. I should have known better. I ended up with a 770 on the exam and a 6.0 on the AWA part. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The Princeton Review GMAT guide seemed to work a lot better for me.

My actual result was 640.The tips for the two essays were useful - thanks to them I got 20 points for them.The book also has 100 tips and formulas for the math questions.

As for the CD, not terribly user-friendly but comes with a passable amount of sample sections. Of course, that brings us to the best part of this 'product'...that it serves to crack all your self-confidence. The questions are unrealistic and the concepts behind many of them in no way related to anything on the GMAT. Actually kept me from signing up for the GMAT because of my poor scores. Do yourself a favor and get the official GMAT guide - tons of sample questions that are a realistic idea of the GMAT and won't kill your confidence...I really regret buying this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best preparation","review":"When preparing for the GMAT, I purchased 4 books. Kaplan's was by far the best as it did the best to challenge me and prepare me for the real thing. Some have complained that the scoring is not accurate. While this is undoubtedly true, the tests are actually harder than the real tests anyway. If you want to prepare yourself for a hard test, there is no better way than to challenge yourself with hard tests. Kaplan was best of the various books in several ways:- Its sections gave the best advice for test taking- More practice questions (except for the official prep)- Harder questions to really challenge your thinkingI would recommend this book to anyone preparing for the GMAT. I would avoid Barron's or the Official GMAT book. Princeton Review's is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"GLARING errors in the practice questions","review":"Buy the Princeton Review book instead. This book is incredibly frustrating to use because of all the errors in the questions. I would say 1 out of 5 questions has an error in it. Questions have key words omitted, words in the wrong order, lots of logical flaws. For example, one question states \\"Students learn better when there is a low faculty/student ratio. Therefore I will enroll in a school with a small student population.\\" If there is a low faculty/student ratio, that means that there are very FEW teachers for very MANY students, not the opposite. But in Kaplan's explanation of how to answer this question, it says \\"The correct answer is choice A, because the initial argument states that there should be fewer students for every teacher.\\" Ummmm, no, the initial argument states the opposite. Clearly they meant to write student/faculty, not faculty/student. Errors like these destroy any usefulness the book may have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"Stay away from Kaplan.

I am pleased this series eventually came to an end, but really recommend that if you needed to choose ONE Justice League DVD then pick the previous Justice League first season DVD set which far surpass this mindless season.

I own a Karcher residential electric model. As said: when they work they are great, BUT you simply are not going to get over 1500 psi for $200-300 from any model, any manufacturer. We use this machine occasionally and based on our experience if you own one, you are going to have to fix it regularly. There is a wealth of sites that sell parts for these things, and offer excellent advice. The incredible availability of parts tells you something. If you have the patience and ability to make the repairs (these machines fairly well designed for this) and don't want to spend close to $1k for a power washer these machines will \\"work\\" for you. They are like espresso machines- you are not going to get trouble free operation with high pressure and plastic parts for under $1k. Good luck, you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK Beware","review":"I purchased one of these, used it about 5 times within a year. Then the hose connections broke, plastic crack or something. Out of warranty, bought another, the hose unit broke, took it apart, same thing broken, cracked plastic.Bottom line is there is some decent pressure that comes out of these when they work, but its that same pressure that breaks the cheap plastic parts that much of the thing is made of. Getting some parts is possible, like a whole new wand, but its funny how it cost more than 50% of the total cost of a new one. So you have to say, just buy a replacement part or a whole new one, knowing how cheap they are made.I am a casual user of a pressure washer, but I will not be buying a third one of these. Yes they are relatively inexpensive, but if you have to buy a new one every few months to a year, what do you have after 3 years?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.

Whether you are a Wireling, a Gen Xer, Gen Yer, or Baby Boomer, you can - and more importantly should - enjoy and appreciate this song and its collaborators. It is disappointing that radio and MTV are not more responsive to this type of music for the soul, but we can give it our vote by purchasing a copy for ourselves and everyone we know.

My low rating applies to my dog's experience with the toy. Dogs who don't immediately think squeaker means KILL ;) might get great enjoyment out of it.

It's hard to write a book with no appealing characters; Burke has come close to succeeding with Heartwood. Even the protagonist is someone you would take pains to stay away from.

He never just says, \\"It was a nice day,\\" he has to take half a page to tell you why it's a nice day. Also I couldn't find anyone in the book to identify with, including Billy Bob.

What an extrordinary gift.On the other hand, his plots reel from one act of gratuitous violence to another. I found my stomach tightening everytime Chub, Cholo, or Jeff got in their cars. Poking out somebody's eye is no big deal. No wonder Temple Carol spends her spare time practicing boxing and perfecting her karate kick. I wondered how anyone ever got any sleep, as it was perfectly possible his front door would be kicked in, his women raped and their children sold into slavery by any one of a number of trios of cro-magnons he might have offended by the color of his tie or the cut of his jib.

He has so many flaws and demons that he deals with, it's hard for him to live with on a day to day basis.I love the super-natural that he in-twines in most of his stories.I found it to be heart-breaking at times.This story, though well told,left me feeling somewhat sad.I did enjoy the book.I think it is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about great but not quite","review":"With a clarity of style and engaging perceptiveness reminiscent of The Triumph and the Glory and Louis L'Amour's best works, Heartwood hits the ground running and never stops.

The descriptions of places were good but there seemed to be to many characters added in to just take up space. All of the jumping around also made it hard to keep interested in the story.

This is a series to look forward to.It is a complex plot, fully resolved containing the atmospheric writing that JLB does as well as any writer. You are transported to Deaf Smith and are made to feel a part of the area.It is peopled with flawed characters, both good and bad. No one is perfect, and you are certain you've known or observed most of them. The players are a rogue's gallery, many of whom are lovable...some forgivable, others unrepentant and unsympathetic. A few have redeeming characteristics beneath a questionable exterior. It's a remarkable cast.It is always a treat to read JLB. He never fails to entertain and brings great emotion to his words.

Mr. Burke, I believe, is trying to create another character with the charisma of Robicheau, who communes with his deceased partner, but he has failed miserably. Without dragging this out too far, I will just say I was sorely disappointed. Mr. Burke kept on writing this book, however, in my humble opinion, never had a plot worthy of being built upon. Also, I don't believe small town lawyers have the time to ride all over the countryside on a horse, and no one but Michael Jackson hangs out with someone else's kids.

And then we're told not once, but maybe a hundred times, that he drives an Avalon. It's \\"my Avalon this,\\" \\"my Avalon that.\\" James Lee Burke apparently thinks the word \\"car\\" is too ordinary for his main man. Or is he getting money from Toyota or what? As with the Robicheaux books, this character has a doppelganger--but it's a more effective touch in Robicheaux's Louisiana, where you expect this kind of superheated spiritualist-medium stuff. One thing the book helps make clear, though: if characters like this do live in Texas, no wonder George W. signed that law saying it's okay to carry guns into churches. Shooting characters like these would be a sacrament.

It will lie on its back and wait for the other dog to rip its belly open while it is piteously whimpering in hopes that its life will be spared.

I do not view the subject of submission the way the author does. It appears that she lets men off of the hook from having to meet their wives halfway on different matters. Men aren't being told to to compromise here; instead, their wives are told to do everything their husbands tell them to do, even if they know that it may not be the best solution at all times.

The Bible has clear instructions on how a husband is supposed to act towards his wife, but the author put the onus of obeying onto the wife's shoulders.

The story (what little of it there is) drags, as almost every chapter (and they are quite short) begins with a long and detailed description of a place or character, like a guide book. And I appreciate that it is billed as a novel, but really, it is a mystery - one that moves quite slowly. Maybe you want to read about the history of the Genoese tower (or some other such thing) every 2nd or 3rd page - but I don't. I've been there, I've seen it. Give me some story, a mystery that moves along more quickly. Do I really have to read all about the ingredients of this dish and that dish?

A eunuch detective -- what? are you kidding? -- is hired to learn why several young members of the military are murdered, one by one, in Istanbul in 1836. The writer loves to weave arcane terms, obscure locations, and bizarre events into a tapestry of the unexplained. And when he realizes something doesn't make sense, he simply leaves it alone, stonewalling it, as if to blame the reader for it. He is a lazy writer and a contemptuous one.

The teenage girl dwells on a boy who is none too bright, and the sexual innuendos in this story just get a bit tiring. The only reason I could possibly think of for reading this book at all is to provide more loose-end tie-ups to the Xanth series as a whole...because most of the later Xanth books refer to things that happen in earlier novels. I am sure this one will come into play in later novels, somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun. Not Gormet...But Fun!","review":"I love this recipe book. If you're dieting, or are a major fan of gormet meals, this may not be for you, but this little book makes me happy. These are your all American, easy to fix, yummy recipes. These are the kinds of meals that you can easily make with your children...hell...even my husband could handle these recipes, and they are good as well. When I first received this from Amazon, I leafed through it and felt like I had a little sliver of the 1950's. These are recipes that I imagine were served up on many nights back then. It adds a cozy feeling to the kitchen just having this on the counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casseroles","review":"A lot of the foods listed in the book were not anything that my family would eat.

I think I would've been better off just with a math review book.AND it is full of typos at critical points.

The online help would not register right and I had to call the help number to set it right because the book I bought had a misprinted key number in the back. The book has many errors that are corrected only on the online site, and the site itself is a bit confusing to use. The book overall has some nice examples of questions to help you get a feel for the test, but you can download a sample test for free from the GRE website that is better than this book. The only useful thing I found from this was a printable sheet of vocabulary words. I would recommend looking elsewhere for GRE prep help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Errors","review":"Supposed to be instucting us toward \\"flawless\\" GRE performance??? How can they charge that much for something with an inexcusable number of errors? I printed the corrections sheet from their website which covered only a few of the many errors in the book. In the section on \\"tricks\\" to doing GRE math problems, I found ways to solve the the practice problems that were missed in the answers section!

I carry this book to every seminar I give -- just in case someone asks for scientific proof. I say to them -- well, which part do you want to know about quirks, solar storms, magnetic fields, birth triggers, Gauquelin sectors, Carl Sagan, Jesus, Gods, Aristotle, Kepler, Corpernicus, the pact between astronomers? Which one?

You can repeat a lyric to make a point, and then you can really just beat it into the ground. Aside from the two or three songs where I skip the last minute, this was a really great album.

You can cook up to a 14 lb. turkey easily in a 22-1/2 inch grill using this rack. I cooked my first turkey in a Weber 21 years ago and have cooked at least two every year since. There is no comparison if you want a moist tasty turkey. My family would mutiny if I tried to cook a turkey any other way and my wife loves to have her oven available to fix the rest of the holiday dinner.

I've never sprayed the rack with non-stick cooking spray, there's no need to. Everything comes off, and it cleans up beautifully in the dishwasher. I like the fact that I can put the chicken on the rack way before I put it on the grill - the rack makes it easy to get the chicken back into the house, too. I typically put the rack and cooked chicken on a cookie sheet, and carve the chicken right on the rack. Well made, tons of uses, yet inexpensive. Does it get any better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor service and rising rates","review":"I have been an ATT/Cingular customer for 4 years, and I have been relatively happy with them until a couple months ago, when ATT started raising rates on text messages multiple times over the course of just a couple months. One of the main reasons I went with ATT instead of Verizon, which has much better service and wider coverage, was that ATT didn't charge for incoming text messages and had a relatively cheap text message rate. Well, when I looked at my bill a couple months ago, lo and behold, they had started charging for incoming text messages. The next month, rates went up for text messages, the month after that, rates changed again. When I called to talk to customer service, I was basically given the brush off and the message that they could do what they like with their text message rates.

There are some very cute, good looking men, but they must of just been picked up from a modeling agency, because they lack in the acting department.The stories are okay, but 30 minutes per story is not enough for you to get really envolved or feel for any of the characters.

On the bad side the flap is bearly scored and when you try to fold it over, it's is easy to get it folded in the wrong place.I'm just looking for a sleeve that is the same quality as what OEMs use for their CDs and DVDs. One of the problems with all these cheapo sleeves is that because they are so flimsy they make it more difficult to insert the CD/DVD.

The rules were changed poorly, and this version is set up to prevent any possibility of expansion...a major flaw in Cosmic Encounters. Even the tokens (ships) though pretty, are bulky and oversized. The artwork was a substantial improvement over the Mayfair version, but for me, a long term Cosmic Encounter fan, its multitude of careless flaws made the game less enjoyable. I do not recommend this version. I imagine only a collector would want this one, or someone who's never played CE before and isn't interested in expansion.

Tulitas's father was a civil architect from San Antonio, Texas, working in Coahuila, Mexico. He moved his wife and five children to Torreon and Tulitas lived there from an early age until several years after she was married, when she moved back to the US due to the continuing civil unrest. In the book she describes a pre-revolutionary Mexico, and also tells the story of what happened when Pancho Villa arrived.

The female lead in particular was hard to watch; I felt embarrassed for her. She combines William Shatner-esque pauses (which I think only serve to give her time to remember her next 3 words) with monotonous delivery. When she isn't speaking, she doesn't react to any other characters' lines or scene action, but rather visibly waits for her turn to talk again. At many points she turns to the actor who is due to speak next many seconds before the next line is delivered and stares expectantly.Some of the other actors aren't as wretched, but none of them seem invested in the movie at all. No wonder the audience is made to feel even less invested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary play on TV styled ghost hunter shows","review":"The film uses the structure and edit that TV's many ghost hunter shows (Paranormal State, Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures) to tell the story of a team of ghost hunters who investigate 3 cases - a demon possession, a poltergeist and in the final thrilling act a series of tunnels haunted by the son of Satan himself, a place used as a sort of supernatural waiting area for souls on their way to hell. Many elements introduced as the film moves along get their payoff there, and it finishes with a twist.

A former INS agent who worked the US border with Mexico, he retired after being shot on duty apparently by one of his fellow agents. Brinker is hired by a local wealthy businessman, Mo Crain, to look into his wife's recent murder. Brinker's investigation takes him into contact with his old border patrol and the man who possibly tried to murder him. Of course, the investigation leads Brinker into danger with, not only his own life at stake but that of the woman he loves.James C. Mitchell has written a competent but highly formulaic PI novel. There are little surprises here. The strength of the book are the characters and the depiction of the locale. The conclusion is predictable and with the obligatory scene of the villain holding the gun on the hero, the plot is very routine.

Adam Pascal, who created the role of Roger in \\"Rent\\", is one of the lucky artists who can put fervor and emotion into every single song on an album. Each song on the album is worth listening to every time you pop it into your player, but some (Undiscovered, Just Here to the Left of You) are better than others (The One that Got Away). If you're a Rent-head, an \\"Aida\\" fan, or generally a fan of rock or eclectic music, you'll definitely enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Adam Pascal Rejoice!","review":"I admit to being slightly nervous when I bought \\"Model Prisoner\\" - I'm not a big fan of heavy metal, but I adore \\"Rent\\". Pascal's voice may have the intensity of hard rock, but the music isn't what I thought that it would be - if anything, it's rather varied in the styles and delieveries. Some of the ideas begin to get a little worn towards the last tracks - the music is still wonderful, the lyrics are still original, but the theme mostly remains the same - but it's a great CD. The lyrics on all of the tracks are \\"quirky\\" in that they're not obvious rhymes, and in most cases, not even rhymes at all, holding the same poetic beauty that \\"One Song Glory\\" brings across. The music will continually haunt you - especially \\"Which Way To Nowhere\\" - long after you've turned off your CD player. This truly has fantastic songs - if you're a fan of \\"Rent\\", you'll probably like \\"Model Prisoner\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Went to see Aida yesterday and it was GREAT!

My personal favorite off the album is \\"Rhymme and Reason.\\" How could you not love a song that includes the lyrics, \\"Love don't need a reson. Love don't need to rhyme.

Most people that love him fell in love when he was Roger Davis in RENT opposite Anthony Rapp (Mark Cohen). My story however, is quite different. I saw the current cast of RENT,so at that time i had no clue who he was. But then when I bought the RENT soundtrack, i was blown away by the raw voice of Adam Pascal. This CD clearly demonstrates what real music is all about and i recommend it to ANYONE with 2 ears. The title of this review \\"More then One Song Glory\\" is fitting because as all of you RENT fans remember, \\"one song glory\\" is one of Roger Davis's solo songs. in this song he dreams about finding one last meaningful song \\"to redeem his empty life\\" and make a mark in this world.

In the descriptions of each bird, it goes into depth describing characteristics, feeding habits, nest, eggs, incubation, other names, albinism and range. It defines all terms related to birds. All are alphabetically listed. I have rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because of my edition's binding. The glue does not hold up well and sections of the book have separated from the binding.

It's nothing like the thermometer that comes standard on any Weber grill, all of which have a short 1.5\\"stem with a round end with a wing nut to secure it to the grill from the inside. This has a 6\\" stem with a sharp point, with no way to secure it to the Grill. I poked mine through the air vent on my one touch gold charcoal grill, and it's so long it reaches the grill surface, hits the meat and pokes back out. It may indeed give you some kind of an air temp inside your grill, but definitely does not look or attach like any thermometer that comes standard with a Weber Grill.

I then decided to check Amazon and found the Weber replacement \\"Dual Thermometer\\". It works just great. What you do is put the thermometer in the smoke hole/vents to see what the temp is while you are cooking.

Now I can see how hot things are that I am roasting, or cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, effective, seems reasonably accurate","review":"I use this with my Weber kettle grill - I keep it stuck through a vent hole when the lid is closed to gauge the temperature inside. It was helpful this Thanksgiving in making sure the grill was hot enough to properly cook a turkey (it was, maybe too much so - with lump charcoal I got temps up to 450 or 500). Only problem: the probe part of the thermostat tended to bump against the large turkey inside, but with careful adjustment, it worked fine. The absence of plastic meant the thermostat held up well to the heat.

It was good enough that I was able to get through it, though in my opinion it could have been much better.

Just as an example, the author provides information on \\"candy rock\\" rhyolite near Truth or Consequences. If you take the directions in the book, you will end up at the end of a torn up road and a wash, with no real clue as to where you should go from there. I took several backroads which required a heavy-duty 4WD, and finally found some rhyolite. This book would be much more useful if the maps and directions were up to date, and if every description of a gem/mineral had a picture of the site you are supposed to be looking for, and a picture of the mineral in question.

I have been smoking for 2 years now, year round, with is smoker and feel I am qualified to share my opinions and thoughts on this smoker.Pros - It is inexpensive, not to hard to use and turns out some very good BBQ. If you don't want to spend a ton of cash and are just cooking for friends and family the Weber is hard to beat.Cons - No Thermometer. Now I know they have finally put them on the other models but this one does not have one and that is ridiculous! Temp is the most important thing in smoking. Next is the fact that it does not have handles on the side for when you have to put more coals in. This would have been very helpful. Lastly is the legs. They suck! Mine folded in about 1 1/2 years. So I rigged my own. No problems since.So over a great little vertical smoker that puts out some great tasting, moist BBQ.P.S. - If you pack that sucker full you can get 40 pounds of Pork Butt in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK this is the way to go","review":"This is a great product.

They were the best ribs I've ever tasted. I had no idea how they would turn out. I was afraid they may be undercooked or overcooked since I had never smoked anything before. They turned out to be super moist and the smoke flavor was unreal. Some restaurants claim to smoke their ribs, but I've never had ribs in a restaurant that tasted as good as these did.I wish they had a temperature gauge that came with the smoker, already installed, but they don't. After my first use, I'm not sure it really matters. I used a cheap, electronic meat thermometer toward the end of the cooking time to make sure the ribs got up to the right temp, but that's it. Maybe I was lucky (and maybe it's because I was smoking ribs?), but I don't think a temp. gauge is extremely critical. The smoking process seems to be pretty forgiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smoker","review":"I have been cooking on a trailer mounted commercial style smoker for several years. I wanted something smaller and easier to use for my patio. This smoker works great and is simple to operate. I have used regular charcoal, lump charcoal and hickory/oak wood. Burns fine, litte mess and clean-up is a breeze. I especially like the 3 adjustable air vents on the bottom and the 1 located on the dome. I have smoked hams, turkey's, beef brisket, chicken and Boston butts. I am proud to say that everything tasted great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weber WSM Price Increase A Rip - Off","review":"This is a decent piece of equipment that can produce very good BBQ. There is a learning curve though and you should not expect too much the first few times you use it. There are BBQ associations all over and you will find many people using Weber WSM's because they are good and easily portable. Go to an event, they are all advertised on the internet, and get some help which is readily available.Value is another issue. I purchased two WSM's last year, one at retail and one on the internet. Paid less than $199 each time. For Weber to increase the price to $249 without any product improvement is a rip off, pure and simple. I can't believe the price of labor in China has gone up that much to justify the increased price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delvery service poor - product good","review":"I received my Weber Smokey Moutain in very poor condition. The box was not damaged but all of the black porcelain covered products had either a dent, flake or other damage. One part was so dented it seemed as a fork life had bent it.

The smoker works very well and I am pleased with it's functionality and performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smoker but no thermometer","review":"I tried my new smoker over the weekend, it worked great, but I had to add my own thermometers.

My only complaint is that the door on the side does not fit as tight as I would like, but it doesn't really effect the smokers performance.

It holds temperature nicely and the user's learning curve is expedited by the Cooker web site: http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/ I have found that I seem to need a bit more airflow (vents more open) than the instructions on the web site say.This is the first smoker I've had that I can confidently leave for a few hours and know it will hold its temperature. I'd give it 5 stars except for a couple things.1. Weber should equip the cooker with a good thermometer and handles on the side of the main cooker body to ease fire maintenance. The web site gives good tips for doing this yourself. Don't know why they don't put a thermometer on there, but the handles were probably nixed by lawyers who don't want customers handling a hot vessel.2.

Although the customer service people promised to send a replacement part; they forgot to mention that the part is on back order. Also, while the lid and the bottom part of the smoker feel solid, the middle section, the front door and the legs on this smoker are flimsy - very flimsy. The front door does not fit too well either. It looks like I'll have to wait quite a bit before I can even try this thing out. This smoker cost about 3 time more then the competitors and I expect better then this.A follow-up:The replacement part came after a week. The procelain is chipped as well, although at a different place.At least Weber seems to stand behind their product. I was told another replacement will be send.

However, the first time I put it together I could tell the middle section was out of round (as other reviewers have warned about). Mine was very minor and I was able to gently shape it so it was a snug fit all around.

I got some idea what a surprise suspect Bundy was (clean cut, law student, no record, etc.) from Ann Rule's \\"The Stranger Beside Me,\\" but Kendall was even more involved in the investigations...and more often ignored. There were so many instances when it seemed that if the police had only taken her more seriously, Bundy would have been stopped much sooner. It's frightening how often and how strongly Kendall and Bundy were drawn back to each other.

For those of us with a special interest in Ted Bundy this book is full of fascinating, intimate details which provide a rare glimpse of Ted's ordinary life. (Where else can you learn what his favorite beer was?) After all, he didn't spend ALL of his time killing or running from the law. This book offers a very unique perspective on an insanely interesting case.

The book contains numerous references to the Quran and other books to support his statements about Islam. I can imagine many readers, especially Muslims being skeptical of Mark's claims, however, it is easy to verify them by finding the Quranic verses and reading them for yourself. There are also plenty of Islamic websites that support his claims. Notwithstanding, I have personally talked to Muslims who have a different view despite the evidence.

Have you ever known threat at your threshold? If so, escape to the ventures of two distant independents, Dawn and Dakota, as freedom is gained through trial and imprisonment.PRISONER OF THE HEART by Annette DeLore is a journey through calamity and personal devastation to releasing the prison of the past. Twisting and suspenseful, the plot of a government agent posing in prison hardly seems suited for rescuing a distant victimized woman. Yet fate crosses the paths and escape is vital for freedom of body, heart, and spirit.DeLore weaves these paths through great schemes led by passion. The constancy of development is a benefit of DeLore's style. Surprise twists will constantly engage the reader until the final moment of resolve. PRISONER OF THE HEART is a great escape for the characters as well as the reader. --- by Stephanie S. Sawyer, author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Exciting Book","review":"Ms. DeLore has a wonderful way with her words making each of her characters come to life.

Through the lectures reprinted in this book she demonstrates many things, including magnificient compassion, intellect, humor, self-awareness and strength; but her contstant claims of intuition (especially with children, who cannot communicate at an adult level even when not dying) do nothing but fulfill her own views of the dying process. And when she is wrong in some way (a patient dies sooner or later than she intuited), there is always an unverifiable emotional or psychological argument for the patient's defiance of her claims. She is not a scientist; or, at least not a very good one, and this book put me off as I struggled to deal with my dying father's situation because of her obsession with proving how clever she was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to Dr Kubler Ross's work","review":"I would like to recommend this book to anyone who is looking start with one of Dr Ross's books.

It's basically a whodunit a la Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None.\\" It's also reminiscent of the underrated \\"Devil's Nightmare\\" aka \\"The Devil Walks at Midnight\\" (1971), albeit not as good.Still, it comes close, and although the werewolf is barely seen I found this a solid low-budget mystery flick with a werewolf. Besides, Elizabeth Shé (Marylou) has an exceptional scene and there's a superb gothic score. But gorehounds who want to see loads of bloody werewolf action should pass (there's a little, but not enough to appease modern gorehounds).GRADE: B-"},{"rating":"1","title":"A questionable band","review":"Please do not buy this album and support this band.

Now then, I love some of her historical romances -River Of Fire,Shattered Rainbows (Fallen Angels), andOne Perfect Rose (Fallen Angels)are among my all time favorites Regencies. But this book was a little too grim for my tastes. The fact that the hero rapes a very young virgin in the opening chapter was a big turn off. The fact that this isn't even the darkest/worst thing in his life was an even bigger turn off.Some of the sex scenes between the hero and heroine were very well done, quite hot, as I would expect from Putney, and I liked the heroine a lot, but I was never able to get over that rape scene (or the even worse thing that happened to the hero that I do not want to spoil).I had a hard time believing this came from the same author who wrote such a sweet love story asOne Perfect Rose (Fallen Angels)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick . . . .","review":"The rape scene of a 15 year old INNOCENT virgin was sick!

No instead when he discovered her little \\"fib\\" he got really mad at her, how dare she seek vengenance upon me and in such a horrible way! Wow, is this guy for real? The really sick and disturbing part is what happened to him at the age of 13!! Really could have done without that!!!! If possible I would give this book 1/2 stars just because the paper was of decent quality!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexually revolting","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but I really wish there had been some sort of warning.

Absolutely revolting. There's no excuse for child rape and I definitely don't want to be reading it.My apologies for spoiling the story for anyone, but again, I sincerely wish I'd known before purchasing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Plot From One of My Favorite Authors","review":"I'm a big fan of Mary Jo Putney and have read nearly everything she's written, from Regencies to contemporaries (although I must admit I like the original Signet versions of her Regencies better than the sexed-up retellings). However, I found the plot in this book difficult and did not think the characters reacted in realistic ways to occurrences. SPOILER: No matter how wonderful and forgiving a person you are, falling in love with and forgiving someone who raped you when you were 14 after a forced wedding and abandoned you, never trying to find out what happened to you afterward, is unlikely. Forgiving and continuing to love someone with whom you're in a relationship as an adult who tries to violently rape you *again* is even more unlikely. Putney tried a similar forgive-the-rapist plot in a contemporary (The Burning Point) and I didn't like that version, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was my 2nd MJP book. After reading The Bargain, I was looking forward to Dearly Beloved but I basically had to force myself to finish this book. I found many of the several plot twists and subplots to be excessive, distasteful and exploitative. Really, is it necessary to incorporate rape, incest, sadism and prostitution (etc.) into one little story? I was very turned off by much of this. That said, I did think that the homosexual subplot was handled with sensitivity. Finally, I just couldn't bring myself to like the two main characters or find their actions and responses to be even remotely realistic. I will probably give MJP another try since I enjoyed The Bargain, but this time I will definitely get her books from the library, not the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did this idea come from?","review":"I generally love everything by this author and was in great anticipation of enjoying this one. She usually takes her tortured heroes through a process where you rot for them in the end. Not so Gervase.He NEVER made me hope for his happiness. He started as a rotter and never improved IMHO. Mary/Diana deserved so much better and I cannot understand why she loved him at all. I can see why she took her place as his wife given she had a child's future to consider but to actually love much less forgive Gervase makes no sense.I like stories where I actually like the characters involved and while the writing is, as always with Ms. Putney, excellent, the main character leaves more than a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt I'll ever pick this one up again or even keep it on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite all-time Putney books","review":"And I'm a huge fan.

I thought the setup of the story was good with the abandoned/raped wife trying to seduce her own husbnad, but somehow I couldn't get through the courting and deception part of the story when the heroine was in London being beautiful and all. I also found it odd that the hero would be so incrediblly upset and resentful of her once he found out who she really was... I didn't get that at all.

Although it seems like an exciting romance novel with detailed descriptions and sexual tensions, I didn't find any humor or fun in this novel at all which is one of my preference in casual reading. It was torture for me to try to get through the courtship between the leading charcaters and I was lost in how I feel for Gervase and Diana. I am sorry to say that I didn't enjoy this book...

I was hoping for some insight as to why our standard of female beauty is to be stick thin, blonde, have very big boobs, and a tiny nose. How did Barbie's real life counterpart Pamela Anderson get to look that way? Boob and nose surgery, peroxide, and starvation. Why would men consider that beautiful? I was puzzled, but didn't get any answers from this book. It was a collection of essays by mostly angry women with very specific situations - like being gay or obese, that I couldn't relate to.

There is a hint of variety - including requisite entries by an exoticized Indian American, a disabled transsexual, and a short woman - but a disproportionate number of essays address the preoccupation with weight and few are particularly well written.

The teleplay was written by Richard Christian Matheson, he's the son of Richard Matheson, a well known and respected veteran writer. And he - R.C. Matheson - seems to be the only writer in this collection who knows how to write a teleplay. All of the other stories are either over written, under written or just simply nonsensical as is the case with ,\\"Umney's Last Case\\", starring William H. Macy. I don't know if Stephen King is to blame for this mess or April Smith, who wrote the teleplay, but it is absolute garbage.

Fast, even burn, and less waste. I bought two more for my friends (including the friend that lent me the home-made one) and they loved it. They are also women that love to camp & bbq.

You just bunch up newspaper in the bottom compartment, pour the charcoal in the top, set it on the grill, light it, and you're pretty much ready to go. No fussing with briquette pyramids, lighter fluid, and relighting temperamental charcoal. This chimney is so reliable that you can ditch the briquettes and go back to using real wood charcoal--your taste buds will thank you.The chimney itself is solidly built and easy to handle. It also has two great benefits: a large capacity and the extra handle on top. This is definitely the chimney to get it you have a larger grill (18\\" or larger), as it holds a lot of charcoal. The extra handle on top makes it easier to maneuver when you are pouring out the coals on the grill.A definite buy for folks with charcoal grills. Who needs a gas grill anyways?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Starts The Charcoal!","review":"I've known about the chimney starter for years but did not believe it would work as well as starter fluid so I never bought one. At an office picnic a friend used one to start the coals and it did a GREAT job! Fast with no kerosene smell. The Weber Chimney Starter is a cut above others on the market because of the insulated handle. It is also a Weber which I trust since their grills are second to none. I recommend this product to anyone who likes to grill with charcoal."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I BBQ without this?","review":"This has got to be the best way to start the charcoal.

Its amazingly easy and you don't get the taste of kerosine/lighter fluid grilled into your carefully marinated whatever. Its a big large to pack for camping trips... but once you use this, you'll never move outside of a 25 foot perimeter from your grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot to handle","review":"I've had numerous chimney starters over the years and they are all pretty much the same, except for this one. Webber for some reason put a plastic handle on it that gets waaaayyyyyy too hot to touch. In the past, they have always had wooden handles, and picking them up to dump them out was not a problem. Now I have to keep a pair of gloves by the grill just for this one issue. Otherwise it's a quality item, that seems to be holding up nicely. I gave it 2 stars just because I think its a pretty serious design flaw, with a very simple solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"wind lighter","review":"i have only used this twice, but both times (by a strange twist of fate) we have had pretty significant wind while i was trying to light the charcoal. the wind made the lighting take longer than what i assume is normal. but i can't imagine how much harder it would have been if i would have tried lighting the charcoal with no chimney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have you been all my life....","review":"I love grilling and I prefer charcoal over gas any day.

We are on our 4th one. If you keep them out of the rain they will last for a long time. I bought one for my dad last christmas. He was the king of starter fluid burgers. He was skeptical at first, until I showed him how to do it. You don't have to wait for the fluid to soak in. You don't have to stack them in a pyramid or a neat pile. You can get started right away. We have a weber grill and it allows you to completely shut off the air. Which saves charcoal when you are done. I load the chimney with the used charcoal and fill it the rest of the way with new. A couple pieces of newspaper and a flame and you are ready, it doesn't take that long to get a flame on top. I would recommend this to anyone. I will continue to buy these."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more gas","review":"I have always loved using charcoal but not the hassle of starting it. This is so easy and fast it is beyond belief.

I will never go back to lighter fluid. Using this starter reduced my charcoal lighting time by half. The handles are well-placed and do not conduct heat. Charcoals are reasonably evenly burned. Emits lots of smoke when starting, so must be careful to keep away from nearby open windows and away from your guests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber Chimney","review":"This is the only way to start coals without lighter fluid. It's very large in case you need a lot of coals."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I've been missing!!","review":"I have been grilling for years, using either charcoal presoaked in lighter fluid, or pre-soaking them myself with liberal amounts of fluid or kerosene. The neighborhood always knew when I was about to cook because of the mushroom cloud rising above my house as I lit the grill! Even after letting the coals burn for a good while, there would still be a faint gasoline taste in the food. Well, no more!The Weber chimney starter is a typical Weber product, functional and very well made. It holds about 8-10 pounds of charcoal and all are ready and raring to cook after 15-20 minutes. This works especially well for the Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker, you can light one chimney full and load the charcoal pan, and then add another chimney full of unlit coals on top. The whole process takes less than thirty minutes and you are ready to cook. The price is excellent and you will save this in lighter fluid costs very quickly.I only wish I had purchased one sooner, I would give it 12 stars!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Start Charcoal fire in minutes no chemicals.","review":"Just put the charcoal into the top, two sheets of newspaper in the bottom, lite a match and you are done.The handle stays cool, when you pour out the hot coals.Fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD BE HAZARDOUS!","review":"YES, THIS ITEM DOES HEAT YOUR CHARCOAL FASTER, BUT IT SEEMS PRETTY DANGEROUS, TOO. I GUESS I ADDED TOO MUCH NEWSPAPER (4 SHEETS) BECAUSE THE ENTIRE PILE OF CHARCOAL WAS ONE HUGE FLAME AND IT WAS BURNING THE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAINER, I COULD SEE SCORCHING. I HAD TO ADD WATER TO DOUSE THE FLAME! THEN, WHEN I POURED THE CHARCOAL INTO THE BBQ, RED-HOT ASHES WERE FLYING EVERYWHERE. I FOUND THAT PRETTY SCARY. THINK I'LL STICK WITH THE OLD FASHIONED WAY TO LIGHT CHARCOAL. BETTER SAFE (AND A LITTLE MORE TIME) THAN SORRY! I LIVE IN SO.

Ingenius and inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product - Bad Handle","review":"Chimney Starters are definitely the way to go, easy starting, contained flame, no flammable liquids, etc. While this chimney starter has a larger volume than most (a plus) combining that with a plastic handle makes for a tricky situation. All that heat melted the handle of mine. The heat also ignited some charcoal, from a previous grilling session, that was surrounding the starter rather than in it and had my Kitchen mitt, which was hanging off the side of the grill, smoldering.I suggest trying a chimney starter with a wooden handle which will work just as well and cost less"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and no yucky lighter fluid","review":"I bought this because I have kids and don't care to invite the kind of accidents that lighter fluid seems to invite. I also read about a family that poisoned themselves because they cooked their meat without letting the ligther fluid burn off completely. Yeesh. This is safer, less toxic, and cheaper in the long run than lighter fluid. It's never been more difficult than just filling with charcoal, crunching up 2 pieces of newspaper and lighting the bottom. When the charcoal is ready, you pour it into your grill. Works like a charm. There are other chimneys out there, but this Weber is a good sturdy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber 87886 Chimney Starter","review":"Very few products our worth buying two of,but this is one such item.

However, I was skeptical that it would work with just a piece of newspaper. Well after about 25 minutes the charcol was burning bright and I was sold. I gave this as a gift and the person did not believe it would work as I told him it would. Well, he is totally sold as well. I think the starters work a little better than newspaper, especially if it is windy. This is a great way to go, forget fluids or starters, the chimney makes perfect coals every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works pretty well! Still easier to buy self lighting charcoal!","review":"I thnk it would be easier to use self lighting charcoal, but then you have to deal with the smell of lighter fluid and making sure all of that is burned off before you cook.

Gets it going much faster and with less mess than mounding the coals up around fire starter.

I will never be without one again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber 87886 chimney starter","review":"This product hastens and simplifies the grill charcoal starter process.However, I would like the product better for my 22 inch grill if it were two inches shorter, which would still provide enough charcoal content and would make it safer to dump the hot charcoals onto the grill. With the length given, one must be careful that no live charcoal falls outside of the grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic!","review":"I will NEVER use lighter fluid again. NEVER. Why should I? Two sheets of newspaper really does it! Also, this chimney is more efficient. In about 20 minutes, the coals are covered in a light gray ash. By the time the coals reach this point, they also look less consumed and seem to last longer for cooking. And believe me--ALL briquettes will be burning well. Dumping the burning briquettes out of the chimney and into the grill is simple too.Don't be without this when using the BBQ pit at home or at the park. I would say that this item would be great for windy days; however, for some reason the directions tell you not to use it on windy days. Go figure. I don't know why not since the entire unit is all metal with exception of the handle.Bottom line is that this is a must-have for the charcoal BBQ'er. You WILL NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best one out there, but wear a glove!","review":"Oh yeah, this baby is tough, it holds a bunch of charcoal, it looks as good now as it did the day I bought it (and I BBQ about twice a week, 52 weeks a year) but beware, friends.

In his prose (if you would like to call it that), Bhabha offers no conclusion, no criticism of other theory, no theory at all for that matter, and no agency. It is poetry- which is great if you like poetry- but not so great if you are expecting to learn anything at all about nationalism or identity. He is well known for being incomprehensible for a good reason and unless you have the time to read and re-read then I also have to agree that you choose another author.

If you read this book with no real timeline (or, rather, if you can re-read and re-read it), you will get a lot from it. BUT the man needs a composition course or two. He is very much of the school of 'if I have a great idea, I must make it look inaccessible for people to think it so' and in the process renders his book rather useless. A great pity, but all in all, you should just read him if your university course requires you to.

Those who think so have obviously not listened widely enough. I suppose its popularity stems from its title, which gives it away as an easy introduction to the period. Multiple preferable CDs exist for each of the areas it surveys: medieval dance (Istanpitta I and II), Cantigas de Santa Maria (multiple releases under that title), Llibre Vermell (the Sarband release; The Black Madonna), Minnesang (Wanderers' Voices), and trouvere/troubadour repertoire (too many). The bottom line: nice intro, but unnecessary if you want to do more than graze the surface of available talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Performances, Bad Becording","review":"This was my first introduction to music of the Middle Ages -- I purchased it to broaden my musical experience. The musicians and singers provide fine performances. However, the sound recording is very poor -- an occaisional pop is heard, as though it was recorded from an LP. Also, the signal level is too low (especially for a supposedly DDD recording). Increasing the volume makes the background noise annoyingly noticable along with a rumbling sound (as though from a turntable).

Look at other choices before buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusting and Dull","review":"The 2 prong skewer is great but these started to rust before the first use. The ends are blunt and tear shrimp and other thin meats.

These are a pain to load because you have to push the delicious cargo on with accurate separation between the tips or the whole thing starts to warp as you add more cargo. Also, meat is difficult to push on which makes maintaining separation even more difficult.The only ones we use out of our pile of skewers are the single flat/wide skewers with nice pointed tips, or wooden ones when cleanup is to be avoided.You can make any type of skewer work, but having used so many different types I can say with confidence there are much better alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skewers great for shish kabobs","review":"Pro: The Webber double skewers we purchased are great for shish kabobs. The double prongs keep the meat and vegetables from rotating while you turn the skewers over to cook the other side. They are long enough to hold a full meal on 2-3 skewers.Con: These are not as heavy as some we have purchased in the past. They are harder to grab when hot as the loop ends are flimsy. They are blunt instead of pointed on the open ends. This makes it harder to feed things like potatoes and meat onto the skewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible!","review":"I purchased this item as auxillary materials for a Job Readiness class I was teaching and because the back of the DVD had subjects I was interested in, I didn't even watch the DVD until I showed it in class.

The guy was boring, he spoke with no inflection, and the DVD looked like something he did in his basement office! The whole thing reeked of low quality and most of my students fell asleep before the DVD was half-way over! For the sake of my class, I had to turn the thing off and I even apologized to them.

I couldn't believe how good they were and I wouldn't have known they were fat free if I didn't make them myself!

I love that I can make a single serving which is perfect if I need a chocolate fix. My 10 year old picky son loves them!

I read the book a few years before I saw this, and I remembered it--it was almost as though I were seeing the words on screen. I know that people generally prefer when books adapted to the screen are close to their source material, but this is ridiculous. I mean, this is taken right from the book down to the caramel corn and homemade pizza discussion! Besides the unoriginal script, the acting was pretty bad, even for a kids' film. The characters (except for maybe the Aunt Clare character) were badly cast, especially the role of Amy and Louann. Louann was described as a big girl, but here she's skinny.

I've seen this movie at the theatre in 1999 and now I own the DVD. Like Muzzy II there is a daring rescue required (Woody being kidnapped when his arm ripped) but it's only sort of like Amanda being kidnapped by Corvax and Thimbo.

Pixar and Disney set a new standard for computer animated movies with the release of the funny and popular Toy Story in 1995. As if to tempt fate, they released Toy Story 2 in 1999, to greater and funnier claim. Now, they have set the standard for DVD releases with their release of the \\"Ultimate Toy Box: Toy Story and Toy Story 2\\".I have spent at least three hours of my weekend browsing through the endless streams of information the folks at Pixar developed for us on this stunning release, and that is just on the supplmental disk. Not to mention the bevy of bonuses found on both movies, this release makes for an enjoyable time all around. With interviews, behind the scene vignettes, special effects, and outtakes, you will spend every minute entirely entertained with Woody and the gang.The cost of the DVD is well worth what you get.

It touched me way down inside in the part of me that has never grown up. Since then it has become one of my all time favorite movies. Toy Story 2 broke the mold of most sequels by surpassing the original. Initially inteded for direct-to-video release, Disney and Pixar realized they had a winner on their hands and enhanced it for the theater. This movie kept me laughing constantly. I had a stomach ache by the end due to constant laughter. These two movies have been on my DVD wish list since I bought my player, and now we get them, plus a full disc of behind the scenese extras!

This pack is by far the most worthwhile collection I have purchased yet by a mile and a half. I have to say that I will find any excuse to watch these films again and again; they bridge generations in that adults and children can immerse themselves with equal enjoyment. The collectors set is the best for extras that has come on any DVD so far, but this should be no surprise as John Lasseter and Co. have been working in the digital medium for way to many years to disappoint on that front, it would be hard to imagine that there will be much to beat this for a while. The films themselves have a cast that is amazing and you have to sometimes remind yourself that the characters are not 'real' (You are a toy, T O Y as Woody informs Buzz) By the way, there is a must see \`Easter egg' on one of these disks...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disc 3 versus your Remote Control","review":"I bought the Ultimate Toy Box 3 DVD set. The 2 movies (contained on the 1st and 2nd disc) are superb and have good supplemental fillers themselves, such as the \\"Making of Toy Story\\" The 3rd disc contains additional supplemental material which is great for people who are heavily into the technical stuff. However, be forewarned: accessing the many features on disc 3 is a remote controller's nightmare. The material is broken into so many brief sub-segments that I was required to constantly click my remote control to access the features. To add to the frustration, there are these huge pauses that occur each time the DVD searches for a chapter. It really diminished my enjoyment of disc 3. In my opinion, it would have made more sense to have included some \\"play all\\" options that would have given the viewer the choice between uninterrupted viewing and single chapter selection. Better have some spare remote control batteries on hand. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Classics!","review":"It is very rare that one can get two quality movies together with one purchase.

To top it off the soundtracks are THX CERTIFIED!The 2 movie discs both contain the movies and few special features (shorts, audio commentary)The best out of the three though is the 3rd supplementary disc.

I've seen them both over and over again, and I still laugh. Great, great movies! Highly recommend them. Had to get new copies the others were actually worn out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Collection...","review":"Toy Story is the movie that pioneered the CG animation phenomenon and has become a classic, worthy of everyone's collection, not just those with children. Although the sequel was a much better film, you can't deny that without Toy Story, many other films would never have been made. Pixar proved it could be done and they continue to impress.Toy Story 2, in my opinion a much better film than the original, deserved its Golden Globe win. It is cemented as one of the greatest animated films of all time. The best movies are those that can be viewed again and again and never get old.

Get one while supplies last, it may prove as valuable as a vintage Woody doll. Pixar really came up with something wonderful in these two stories, both provide such engaging accounts of one's [longing] for toys of the past. My kids treasure these two movies and the dialog is witty enough to draw parents into the stories. Toy Story II builds on the former, introducing a wider range of characters and offering a light-hearted parable on the collection mania in America. One too many out of the frying pan and into the fire situations for my taste, but the action keeps kids enthralled throughout. Hanks and Allen lend great voice to the battling lead characters, and there are many other wonderful voices as well. The only drawback (and it is a mild one) is not mixing Pixar toys with real family members. I think that would have made the stories even more compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pixar is great","review":"What can I say? Pixar is the King in Computer Animation, and this pack proves it, you'll get both Toy Story 1 & 2, besides a third DVD loaded with extras, very, very Interesting. My only complain is that it hasn't Audio in spanish, heck, not even subtitles in spanish! Disney should realize this kind of collector packs don't get proper transfers in México, this one doesn't exist in México, and it's a shame my nephew (8 yrs. old) can't enjoy it fully, because he doesn't understand English, nor can read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movies, Great DVD's","review":"Disney did it again, just like A Bug's Life...

The characters were well rounded, the storyline both funny and touching at the same time. I didn't think that the second film would even come close to the first. How wrong could I have been! The second, much hyped Toy Story came out, I saw it on opening night, with my four year old daughter in tow. It was even better than the first. Not only that, but never had I been in a theatre packed full of children, and it was silent! The children were enthralled, as was I. When Jessie's song came up I was close to tears, and looking around me, so was everyone else. This is a must see movie box set. 5 Stars doesn't come even close to rating this movie ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely five stars","review":"This is a really great achievement in CGI Animation, The guys at Pixar did a really great job.

Its it is a movie they can watch over and over. Plus it is part of history. The first Toy Story was the first 100% computer generated movie.

This happened with some of their cookies sheets as well. The smell is so strong it set off my smoke detectors every time. They obviously made a bad batch. If you can't get rid of the smell after a few times baking (it shouldn't take longer than that, per the manufacturer), return them. You then got part of the bad batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sturdy, but Not Non-Stick","review":"These are really heavy duty cookie sheets, but they aren't really non-stick.

These were no where near the quality of the old pans. As soon as the oven gets to 300 - 350, these \\"oil can\\" terribly. I could understand if I was broiling with these, but not regular baking. These are called \\"jelly roll pans\\".

They ruined every single cookie and buckled in the oven under 300 degree heat.They felt thick, they definitely weren't the cheapest pans, but they did not deliver.

The pans warp even at temperatures as low as 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The food sticks to the non stick surface and after only 5 uses the pans have brown stains all over them that won't come off. I have used cheap 5 dollar pans from walmart that did better than these. Calphalon makes a lot of good products, just stay away from the Jelly Roll pans."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't do it!","review":"Not only did they almost give me a heart attack when it warped in the oven and sounded like an explosion. but also when your picking it up it doesn't give you a very secure feeling especially when you have something heavy on it.

I could hardly get through high school and college classes without having one (where they first started) going out to eat, exercising...they were completely debilitating. I know I should wait until I finish the book to review but even after the first two chapters I feel like I finally have an understanding of the \\"boogeyman\\" that has plagued my life for so many years.

You see how one solution for one amp relates to another solution for another amp and how they are similar. Good reading. Easy reading.

The sound of this CD is varied, no 2 songs sound alike, they are all folk based songs with various backing musicians behind them. All the songs have their own sound and the lyrics are wonderful.

The color is brilliant.

There is no change in the trategies recommended from 1999, even though the test as significantly changed. Further, the CD ROM is absolutely pathetic. When it does work, without crashing the computer many times, after the entire test, it fails to score the test and far worse, does not even recorrd your answers for review. So in essence, you have spen 3 hours for nothing. In the verbal section, the resding comp. questions are distorted. You get three diff. reading comp questions successively and then the same passage is repeated after a few questions.I grade it with a one star, as there does not seem to be a lower number.

The reason is the book doesn't teach the materail correctly.I will gladdly show people where it is flawed. they need to have somebody familiar with fundemental mathematics write the sections on math.I can't say if anything is wrong with the other section, but the math is flawed in at least one provable spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I just finished using the 2002 version of this book and I have to warn potential buyers to stay away.

Porcupine Tree is back with a vengance with this pre-release single from their new album, Deadwing. As with all of PT's music, these songs are well crafted and moving and a perfect follow up from their last album.Larzarus is great and so are the other 2 non-album tracks. In fact, the epic Half-light was intended to close out the Deadwing album, but was later replaced by Glass Arm Shattering.If you are a PT fan, then you must own this. If you are new to the group, try out a few of their albums to get a feel for them. In Abstenia comes closest to this sound. I think you'll fall in love with them and rush to get this single. Worth the price of admission for Half-Light, which you can only otherwise get if you pick up the special edition Deadwing album release or DVD-A version, and So Called Friend, only available here."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite of the series","review":"The Gold Coast: Three Californias (Wild Shore Triptych)This is my least favorite of the three books. In this story the characters, who match up with similar characters in the other two books, seem to be pretty useless since they spend their time partying and doing customized drugs of the day. This book was hard to get into and I never really got to know or like any character. The main character spirals out of control and the book never really goes anywhere. All three books are unsatisfactory but this one more so. This author has other books that I like much better.In each of the three books the individual concept sounds like a good story line. But it's like the author just wants to experiment with placing the same characters in different settings. So each concept seems like back ground for that process. If there was a message about society, in it's variations or anything else, I missed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated vision of the future","review":"The premise of this novel is an interesting one: in the near future, in an overdeveloped Orange County, California, a dissatisfied poet becomes involved with industrial terrorists bent on subverting the war and weapons industry, in which his father is employed. But the writing is stilted and disjointed and interrupted at odd points by rather nonsensical poems. And Robinson's vision of the future doesn't ring true either. Even writing at the end of the 1980s and able to foresee sprawl run amuck and auto-piloted cars on unending freeways, he still completely overlooks the importance of the Internet or digital information in future society. The presence of videotapes and CDs in Robinson's 2027 now makes the novel seem hopelessly dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so.","review":"I found this book to be unremarkable at best.

I just wish there was a product like this when I was learning music theory and composition. It would have been a huge help to me.

For those more accomplished musicians, you can use the midi interface to play your songs in. Transposes keys easily. Issues I found are with coda handling and help. Little control over formatting of coda measures and reformatting of the entire document sometimes results in coda running off the page. There is a lot of help, but relative to things like how to format coda, entry and control of 1st & 2nd endings, etc,. it was limited and not very helpful. I ended up upgrading to the next verion.

We even tried it at a 5, and it missed some stuff. It works at a basic level, which is why I gave it a 2, but the features are very limited!

Other than that, there's nothing bad I can say about it. It's wonderful. I like that you can change the sounds of the instruments so that if I have to use weird instruments because that staff is weird, I don't have to hear it that way (ex. 4 lines of piano music, with 3 treble clefs and only one bass clef, so I used piccolo, flute, oboe, and bassoon, then changed it so it sounds like piano) And it works beautifully with my Mac, no problems at all. :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in some aspects, has some glaring wieaknesses","review":"This program has some very good features, including a feature to convert MIDI into WAV, or printing several stanzas in a score.

The expectation of the medical action beginning from the start of the novel was sadly lacking in this one. There was too much preamble and emotional jargon that took away from the essence. Also the title does accurately describe what the story was reaaly about which was HTSR. The ending was an extreme disappointment. A true end was not clearly stated and I felt as though there wasn't completion. I love the artistry of Robin Cook and I hope that his future novels will not go down this same road."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!!","review":"I was so disappointed in this novel!!

The main characters bicker endlessly, when they are not rolling their eyes at each other. It is apparent early on that Dr. Cook needs plot filler so he goes off in any feasible direction to fill his word quota. Eventually it is entertaining because it is so funny. Basically the plot proceeds due to the ineptitude of all characters, especially the main ones, and while I am supposed to be reading a \\"serious medical thriller\\" I am laughing at the antics of characters who cannot do anything right. All ends appropriately just out of the three stooges. Somehow the seriously little lecture at the end (\\"faction\\") tops things off perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Let-Down","review":"I used to be a huge Robin Cook fan. This novel seemed hastily thrown together and contrived. By the end of the novel I didn't care about ANY of the characters. Even with the so-called 'shocking' ending... the characters didn't seem to care what happened either.But shrowds, mafia hit-men, and Bahamian egg harvesting! (oh my!)This one will make me think twice before I pick up another more recent Robin Cook novel. If you want to really experience Robin Cook, read his earlier novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Robin Cook's writing?","review":"Granted, Robin Cook isn't high-brow literature, but until I read Seizure I enjoyed his writing for what it was: quick-read medical thrillers full of sometimes over-the-top plots and sometimes unbelivable characters but still readable and entertaining.What happened with Seizure? Reading this one I sometimes got the feeling that the entire book was a joke because the plot and dialogue is absolutely laughable in some places.But what I really hated about Seizure was the long, drawn-out and completely unneccesary details that make up about 1/3 of the entire book. A character goes to take a shower and we get to read two pages about their choice of shampoo and soap and a long paragraph about how cold the water was. None of which was at all important to the plot. Very irritating.I gave this one 1 star only because I couldn't give it zero. A very disappointing effort from a writer who has shown the ability to be much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge for Yourself","review":"Seizure, by Robin Cook.Judge this book for yourself.

However, from the very beginning this book was a real letdown.The two lead characters were total losers, the male, Dr. Daniel Lowell was a self described \\"egotistical jerk\\" and his main squeeze, a 20 year younger \\"raven-haired beauty\\" wasn't much more sympathetic. As a reader, if I can't sympathize and identify w/the main characters, or even like them, why do I care about what happens to them? And in this book, I didn't. Made for some pretty dull reading as you can imagine.I struggled thru the entire book, hoping all the way that it would get better, but it doesn't. Won't spoil the ending for you, but it wasn't worth the read.If you want to check out Dr. Cook, try some of his older novels like Coma or Sphinx. At least in those you can stomach the main participants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"This book was not only diappointing, it was boring and anti-climatic.

In \\"Seizure\\" he went to Europe looking for the Shroud of Turin of all things. Unfortunately he found it and mixed it -unsuccesfully- with high tech genetic therapy, mobsters, academia and political maneuvering resulting in an improbable, implausible and weak story. In the past Mr. Cook could be relied upon for a relaxing unsophisticated medical thriller, but not any more.

I fully expected a well studied story line of medical ethics and religiously skewed politics. What a disappointment.Within the first 50 pages the story becomes contrived and cliche'. Throwing a few medical terms around does not make for an intelligent book, and incorporating contrived mafia figures into the mix does not make for intrigue.

It was read well enough, but to stay engaged with a story, I need at least one character to care about. It doesn't have to be Mr/Ms Pure-and-Perfect, but I have to respect or sympathize with that person in some way. This book had no such characters, and the sudden ending that other reviewers complained about was, for me, the only acceptable way to get away from all those horrid people!

Lots of filler material between the beginning and end. Let's not get started on the cliched mob angle.

I have read several of his novels and liked all except this one.

This book is about 400 pages of preamble and then what one would think is a pretty important part of the story, when Butler actually gets the implant, is glossed over in about twenty pages. What was the point? The ending was ridiculous, although not entirely unexpected. The whole mafia angle added no value to the plot whatsoever. And the dialogue....I don't know where this man lives, but people just don't talk like this! Not even super intelligent people! This is the same issue I had with Shock and he is at it again. I don't recall his previous novels reading this way. To me it is the single most annoying thing about the whole book and one more like this one and I am done with Cook for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pure awful.","review":"Robin Cook usually includes a lot of medical, technical information but this was way over the top and that alone made me almost nod off.The senator was a greedy, immoral, manipulative jerk who demonstrated the truly horrid part of political power. The male lead was completely unlikable. He was totally self-centered, had no capacity for love and was every bit as greedy and power hungry as the senator. Did I mention those were his good traits? His lover/partner who was supposed to be so brilliant put up with him treating her like garbage. And what was with the whole Mafia thing?Fortunately for me I'd gotten about 1/3 of the way through the book and seeing only boredom ahead for me decided to \\"skim-read\\" the rest of it because I would have been very upset if I'd wasted all that time on it. Oh, and the ending was completely unsatisfying and just plain stupid. Save your money on this one!Why, oh why didn't I read the reviews on this before I bought it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I'm a reader who likes to whiz through a good book and not have to think much about what I'm reading. I used to be able to do that with Robin Cook novels, and I LOVED them. I am in the medical field and absolutely adored Dr. Cook's early works. His recent novels, though, seem to be harder to follow, and not as focused on the actual medical thriller genre that I love so much. I yearn for something like Coma, Harmful Intent, Outbreak, etc. Earlier Cook works would have me up til the wee hours, sometimes finishing his book in a matter of 1-2 days. I couldn't even get past the first 3 chapters of this one. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"This book is boring!! Don't bother...Also WAY too preachy about medical ethics and Dr. Cook's personal beliefs. I kept reading and hoping but the book never delivers. Too many attempts at an interesting story; the congressman, the researchers, the Italian family -that just don't hold together. Read Cook's MUCH MUCH earlier works (e.g. COMA) if you want a good medical thriller. Or try Michael Palmer's work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord, help me..........","review":"I have read several of Robin Cook's novels and have enjoyed the majority of them. I thought Coma was brilliant. This book ,however, was awful. I could not believe the dialogue. I wish a had a copy next to me to cite specific examples since there are so many. Sorry Robin but men and women, Phds or not, do not speak to each other that way. Did anyone else notice the odd use of exclamation points ? The character development was shoddy at best. I have never reviewed a book this way in the past but this time I just could not help myself. Save yourself the grief and pick up a magazine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish this book","review":"Having picked up this book and started with great expectations after his recent book Shock, I made a big fool of myself by believing that something exciting will throw up soon. But even after crossing 300 pages I could not make out what was going on and ran out of patience. This book reads more like an account of some tourists than a medical thriller. No more Robin Cook books please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seizure","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book. It was not until Tape 10 (it has 11 tapes) that the implant operation even took place. The interaction seemd contrived and convulted.

It was very disappointing after having been an avid Robin Cook reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's too good to be true ........","review":"As the saying goes, if it's too good to be true, it's not true.

The wall border has very poor quality glue. We've never had a problem hanging border before, but the glue on this product is terrible. Yes, we read and followed the directions very carefully! If you purchase this border, use wallpaper glue instead of wetting the border."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will take some time -- but worth it in the end!","review":"This border really was the PERFECT addition to our nursery. We do not know the gender of the baby and we painted the top half the teal color in the wallpaper and the bottom the darker blue. It is amazing how the border just pulls these colors and the room together. Since we read everyone's reviews we used wall paper glue (the kind that rolls on) and didn't even mess with getting this wet. We (like everyone else) had issues with the scallops. We put up the whole border 1st then went back and with a tiny brush put extra glue on the scallops. It took a very long time -- but in the end it looks WONDERFUL. WE LOVE IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment for beginners. Lots of information!","review":"This book is a great reference for beginners in Tae Kwon Do. It will also help intermediate students or anyone who wants to review the basics or get better at the basics. I teach Tae Kwon Do and am often asked to recommend books. This is one I would recommend to anyone, no matter what skill level. Not only does the book explain how to do different techniques (with good photos), it also gives special tips and advice for making the techniques as good as possible.

It's the original recording from the mid-1950s. I used to have the boxed LP set (four thick LPs that I literally wore out). Cage didn't care for records--and I increasingly tend to agree with him--but this is the version he liked (or at least recognized as being his music). It seems to me that they've done a good job remastering the thing, but I would have bought it anyway. In the early 1970s, this record convinced me that \\"modernism\\" could actually have substance--like the work of Schwitters and the early Max Beckmann also did. Anyway, it makes the other recordings of the piece seem prissy (even though M.A. was a woman and all the other CDs are by men!)\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Boys around 1956","review":"I have this book and I think it would only be of interest to Boys who spent time there around 1955-1958.

It is beautiful music. Don't let the Teutonica fool you, this music is not Wagner rather it is Chopin-esqe. Although it was written in 1913, it is definitely a Romantic era piece, albeit a bit more clean and sparse than most 19th century counterparts. Like some of the Naxos CDs, the appeal to this album is partly in finding an overlooked 20th century American composer. It is a hard to judge the performance, as there are no others with which to compare it. Roy Hamlin Johnson's playing is technically proficient and precise, but it would seem the music could benefit by a bit more expressive performance. As I only have this on vinyl, I don't know what the CD sounds like - but on vinyl the recording is warm and clear. All in all - this is wonderful music which does not deserve to be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would review it but...","review":"The english language subtitles do not work on the copy of this dvd I purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Life-changing biography","review":"This gripping life story is a must-read for anyone addicted to drugs or caring about someone who is.

Very entertaining.Somewhat dated now, not so much the macho lady's-man Banacek, but the feel of the program seems old in that it ambles its way slowly, plodding forward actually in some cases. They also dwelled a little too much on the Polish ethnicity of the hero, an aspect that IMO wasn't ever used effectively to establish much in the way of character, more to have him quote some old family sayings now & again.But a fun bit of nostalgia nevertheless. If not all the episodes are here in these two CDs, I'll be disappointed. And perplexed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts your mind to work in solving the mysteries.","review":"These shows are excellent brain teasers. At the end of each episode, Banacek takes you back to certain clues that he saids helped him in solving the mystery of the missing items.

Rarely is so much of a novel devoted to descriptive prose. Normally that would be a turn off for me, especially as McCarthy does not employ language in novel or exceptionally beautiful ways, but he is very effective and powerful in conveying an emotional attachment to the land and horses. McCarthy is also good at dialogue. There is an interesting historical dimension which I verified on the internet as factual. The protagonist is likeable enough, and McCarthy manages to make him credible, which is no small feat given his take on life and honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book I've Never Heard of","review":"My sister is trying to potty train my two year old nephew.

Dads and moms are willing to change their baby's diapers for quite a long time.\\" I don't want my kids to have a negative view of potty training - seeing it as something they need to learn so mommy doesn't have to put up with their diapers.

The Organ Sonata was marginally better. Fortunately it lacked the improvised Guillou-style cadenza he seems to feel necessary in certain performances (i.e. 1st movement, Widor 6).

I spent nearly two hours chatting and talking on the phone to Amazon customer service and since this is sold through a third party, there was nothing they could do refund-wise.

It's a must read for any writer just starting out. But I struggled through this book until I eventually had to stop reading about three-quarters of the way through. It seemed to lack his normal flow. And he relied heavily on other \\"experts\\" for advice (which now are probably quite dated). I got the impression that Bly was trying to capitalize on a hot market without fully knowing the subject matter.

Recently I had seen Edmund Morgan, author of Benjamin Franklin, on television, and bought this book, hoping for something similar to John Adams. Last night, I finally quit reading the book at about the 2/3 point. I found the book to be very dull, and too full of detailed history, while actually telling the reader very little about Franklin himself. I rarely quit reading a book, but this one was a snoozer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!","review":"If you read the preface to decide if you should purchase a book, be sure to read this book's. Read between the lines and you will decipher that the author understands he is not the foremost expert on Franklin. Nor does he intend this book to be a reference for history majors. He also says that he tries to use the quotes from the volumes of letters written by Franklin as the basis for this book. What?! Then why did I read this book? That's my fault.However, I will say that the author delivers on his promise. He clumsily intertwines the quotes. Adds his own inconsistent opinions based on his lack of expert knowledge. And says he respects Franklin, but I'm not sure if he really knows.I couldn't wait to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morgan's Ben Franklin--a disappointing biography","review":"I was sorely disappointed by Edmund Morgan's biography of Benjamin Franklin. Despite having America's most creative, funny, and interesting Founding Father, perhaps second only to George Washington in importance, Ben comes across boring and leaden in Morgan's account. I found little of Ben's humor and warmth in this book. While it covered Franklin's scientific and diplomatic efforts in great detail, it spoke little of how Ben helped make America...indeed, I found little to prove him a Founding Father. I persisted through the interminable treatment of pre-Revolutionary Franklin, hoping for a solid treatment of the Revolutionary War and the Constitutional Convention, only to be completely disappointed. In sum, I feel that I know only marginally more about Ben after reading this book; I hope Issacson's account illuminates Ben better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Biography of Benjamin Franklin","review":"Such a disappointment ... such a fascinating individual and yet you will not find that in this book. It is not a biography of Benjamin Franklin ... instead it is a step by step ... detailed to the point of boredom ... account of the United States' struggle for independence from England.If you a true history buff, you may appreciate this historical account. However, if you are trying to learn more about the man and his life, you will not find it in this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"It is unsettling to find in the first few pages of Benjamin Franklin by Edmund S.

I understand this is a SHORT biography, but I am confused why the author obsesses w/ \\"Franklin the British Imperialist\\", while ignoring \\"Franklin the Legend\\". I got the point about Franklin seeing himself as a good English subject after the first 20 pages. Oh, and as for all of those memorable quotes that have been attributed to Franklin? Not a one in this book. Lastly, who edited this book? There were more typos then I've ever seen in a book of this length.

It couldn't have been easy being a genius living in a time of superstiution, ignorance and enormous intolerance. Franklin not only navigated successfully but was able to quietly effect great change be it starting militias, hospitals, fire departments,and libraries or gently guiding his fellow colonists toward independence.

This book had neither. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, and the so-called hilarity consisted of two jokes (an old woman having sex and spam email) that were dragged out the entire way through the novel. Plus, you can predict everything that's going to happen with every character from page 10.Usually I pass all of my books along to friends when I'm finished, but this one went straight into the trashcan by the pool. I'm a fan of so-called beach reads but in this case, you'd be better off making a sand castle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was so happy to see the great review on these pills that I threw caution aside and purchased a significant quantity of two flavors for personal use.

To my dismay, even with two pills, my coffee was still lack-luster. Neither the chocolate nor the caramel tasted like the real thing, just another ho hum imitation flavor assimilation lacking quality for the taste buds. In my opinion, these pills are not worth buying. This is too bad because such care went into the packaging. If the product had half the class the packaging does,I would purchase their product for my coffee shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something more to fan service!","review":"Yes, that's right. This series is actually an improvement on typical fan service.

I don't dispute that its an engaging page-turner; only that IF the author has ever been to Afghanistan or Pakistan at all, he did so as sponger-offer of other ex-pats' lives and experiences. The author meets all the qualifications on the \\"Walter Mitty Checklist\\": glibness, charisma, feelings of high self-worth, and pathological lying.

Instead, I discovered a book that offered no real new insights into the life of the Celts. Rather, I found a book that mixed a personal pilgrimage with rudimentary insights. Scholarly, the book left this reader longing for something far more than that contained within the covers of the book. For those readers who desire a \\"romantic\\" view of the Celtic people, the book may prove rewarding. However, if one earnestly desires to learn more about the practices and lives of the Celts, I would recommend turning to a different author.

Lizzie Borden is essentially a play to which the composer added atonal underscoring. The entire score is one long recitative, with nary a coherent tone row. If a five year old made random stabs at a piece of sheet music and then put each word of the play to the approximate notes, you'd get this as a final product. There is no musical development, no emotional undertow, not even a poetic book; nothing which is the stuff of great opera (e.g. the works of Verdi, Puccini, etc.) If the performers were singing a capella you would think they were making it up as they went along.

It's hard to see how the composer of the marvelous violin music (recently recorded by Miranda CucksonMusic By Ralph Shapey) could be the same as the composer of this indulgent mess. All of the worst attributes of music of the 60's and 70's are on display here--chaotic jazz riffs, non-existent 'ritual' ceremonies, non-synchrony of events. The level of expression appears to be directly related to the loudness of the orchestra. The effect rapidly becomes tiresome and ever so dated.

Wouldn't buy again honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made and poorly designed.","review":"This was poorly designed and manufactured. It felt like it would fall apart in my hands.I give it 3 stars because it functioned as well as it would (with the design they chose). However I deducted 1 star for how fragile it is.Installed it on a new system build just for fun under an ASUS 560 card. It didn't even drop my idle temp by 1C.This may help if you have a GPU with no fan attached, but don't bother if you have a card that is halfway decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan Broke in Less Than THREE DAYS !","review":"This product is a good idea, poorly executed with worthless Chinese parts and labor. I do not overclock, yet the fan failed on its third day in the computer with screeching bearings signaling its coming demise. It was prestinely clean, with no dust etc causing the failure. Although it has a 30 day warranty, It will cost 50% of the price of the fan to ship back for a replacement. Why would I throw another 50% good money after bad?Fans seem to be the cheapest, first to fail parts in a computer. From now on I am going to pay the extra money and buy only Zalman fans. I don't own any yet, but I bet this is a case where you get what you pay for.Save your money, skip this piece of Chinese crap !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh....*cough*","review":"I was looking at this and i was like...WOW this looks very promising.It doesnt work...I Don't know how to get it to work..but it just doesnt push any air threw.

And in my experience, because my case was small and lack on air flowing, and I put a huge ATI 5850 into my case, the case temperature increased immediately, the video card remains 50 in low runing state, and up to 75'C in the high peformance, which when card fan fulling performed. After that, I was seaching a better fan for my case, and I found out this is actually a possible fan that works for me. I brought it, and I put it into my case, altho the design of molex 4-pin connector is lose and lack, but over all it works incredible great! My ground state video card temperature down to 35'C and fully perform state up to 47~50'C, which is absolutely amazing. 100% recomand to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorted out my computer","review":"The title says it all.

So i decided it was time to step in. I got this fan mainly for the name behind it. I simply put it in the pci slot next to it, rerouted some power to it, and was up and running. My gpu runs at 40c overclocked now. Im extremely happy with this fan. Do note when placed in the pci slot the intake (where you want the gpu) is on the right side. It also is quite poweful, so as long as it can take in air it will keep your gpu much cooler"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until it broke","review":"I purchased this product in June. The product I received did not look like the picture nor did it have Antec listed anywhere on the product. Despite my questions regarding its authenticity I installed it in my PC below the graphics card (which had been overheating during Bad Company 2). It worked great until October. At this time it started making a loud grinding noise when operating. I removed and inspected it and found when I turned the fan by hand it still made the grinding noise. I'm assuming it's an issue with the fan's bearings. Again, I would like to point out that I'm not sure I received the correct fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for quiet fan... NOT!!!!","review":"I bought this fan to cool my videocard! It works decent, it lower my videocard temperature for near 8 Celsius at full load but the problem is the NOISE!!! Is perfectly the same as the Dustbuster you got at home. If you need some fan and don't have any other space to put it than one of the rear slots on your case, you should bought it with this switch Molex 4 Pin On/Off Power Switch 12V DC, that way you can turn it on when you need cooling flow like in videogames, BluRay movies, Photoshop, Autocad, etc.But if you are looking for a quiet fan!!!

Returned it and won't try another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent product but very disappointed","review":"Being in the computer industry since the start of Compaq, I have sold a lot of Antec products. Just recently built a Intel i7 computer and just wanted a decent blower for secondary exhaust and picked up two of these.Works as I expected but I was very disappointed on the 4-pin male Molex connection, poorly fastened and when connecting it to the power supply female Molex connection, the pins was slipping out from the back and was very loose . Had to reinsert and align it to match the female side. That is why I gave this a 2-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"PC Tower Case Cooler Fan","review":"This is my second case cooler fan of this type. This fan works quite well circulating air and keeping my tower case cooler. It is a bit noisy (this slighting 1 star from 5 stars) although not too noticeable along with normal average room sounds. If you're looking for silence, look elsewhere. If you're looking for performance at a low cost, you can't go wrong here. Since this fan is used to circulate a lot of air from within the entire (rather dusty) computer tower, I recommend cleaning it at least once a year for optimal performance and longevity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Does its job , low noise.","review":"Great product, high quality in my eyes, I put it directly under my graphics card slot so that it sucks the heat from the GPU and it def. works great due to the high RPM.

I'm sure some people will find it beneficial, but I want more. I'd save my subscription money and perhaps buy it off the rack if it is relevant on occasion.I will not be renewing because I'm very disappointed in the content and quality of this magazine. It has so much potential, but falls drastically short. The content rarely, if at all, has enough information to be valuable in any category. The articles are short and not in depth enough to make an impact. The advice columns border on irresponsible and tacky.

But there is also plenty of information on the care and feeding of your bird.However, I can't recommend the book because some of the information has become outdated, and also the layout throughout the book is poorly done. There is a feeling of inconsistency that is furthered by the juxtaposition of color photos with black and white, and oddly typeset blocks of text.If you're getting a parakeet for the first time, I would get a more mainstream beginner's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made well","review":"I have the entire Paper Dolls set and love most of it.

Okay, I realize this is just the same story repeated in a new rendition and I have to say some of the art in this is fantastic, BUT there are many flaws I can not see beyond. First, what is going on with the audio track??? The voices are barley audible over the soundtrack that I might as well just turn on the sub-titles, it really drove me nuts! Plus I say the animation is great, but how the hell does someone attract that much glare in the glasses they are wearing? It was ridiculous! I don't know how many reviewers have watched the complete original animation, but the story flow in this one was a complete bore. There is no depth in the characters, the feeling for the Police Girl is completely gone and it seems far too comical. I took this DVD back immediately not even caring that I lost money from it. If you want to waste your time with nothing more than a vampire action disaster, go right ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, Alucard and Seras have a real chance to shine!","review":"I liked the original series, don't get me wrong; but the Hellsing Ultimate Vol. 1 has truly done a great job of trying to catch the spirit of the Manga series! It's as close to perfection as you can get, considering the fact you're trying to make an animated version of a book (books of any sort allow greater information to be made available, while animation gives better visuals); the first real battle Seras gets involved in shows her rising bloodlust is having an effect on her, unlike the original series, which hinted at the mental changes without SHOWING the effects. Father Anderson is more than a tad terrifying in that delightful way seen only in true madmen.I'm waiting with held breath for volume 2 to be announced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy follow-up","review":"HEllsing Ultimate gives the author Kouta Hirano another chance to unleash Hellsing upon the public, and it works. The animation quality is amazing, but the blood is kinda strange looking. The music is ok, but i prefer the music from the origional, and all the same voice actors are here japanese and english (except for the japanese Anderson.)

Ours developed severe problems after a few hours- two large sections of the screen were broken. Of course, no company or product is always 100% perfect, but our attempt to get this repaired or replaced has been immensely frustrating. They're telling me it will be at least a month before we'll have the TV back fixed, and after nearly a half-dozen calls to customer support, they want us to go through a week-long process of bureaucratic paperwork just to get the case escalated.

No plot point was resolved satisfactorily. Why they tried to bring vampires into this, well, in capable hands that might have actually been interesting to mix the genres... but NOT here. We've got zombies, vampires, and the antichrist (who's a young black boy) in this movie, everything except entertainment.

If your idea of a good zombie movie is to hear miserable 'characters' sit around whining about how lame it is to live in a world of zombies then go for it! However if you're looking for kickass zombie mayhem you will be SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED! This wretched flick has the least amount of zombie scenes of any so-called zombie movie I can think of (and I've seen almost all of them)!!! There are 20-25 minute stretches with no zombies ANYWHERE!

A wonderfully fun homage to '80s splatterfests like RE-ANIMATOR and EVIL DEAD II, Kurtzman and company present an ersatz zombie film filled with gore, mutants and Harryhausen-esque monster vultures. The acting from the veteran actors outshines the newcomers, naturally, and star Divoff particularly owns every scene he's in. All this talk about \\"bad CGI\\" - what would you have preferred, picky \\"fans\\"? The vultures transforming into cars? Would that have been better? The effects were as campy as they needed to be and fit in beautifully with the tone of the film. It's a loud, happy, outrageous and bloody party movie that never bores or pretends to be something it's not. It's wonderful to see a horror movie made for and by horror fans, rather than some tired sequel or remake churned out for a quick buck. Pick this up if you want a \\"new\\" '80s-style splatter movie. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing scream fest!!","review":"I am so excited for the release of this film. Robert Kurtzman has done it again! He is the master of horror films, and this film does not disappoint. The Rage is a roller coaster ride from begining to end. Reggie Bannister (Phantasm), Andrew Divoff (Wishmaster), and Erin Brown (Sick Girl) are amazing as always, and newcomer Ryan Hooks is truly a delight. The creatures and fx work are incredible. There is also an appearance by Mushroom Head in the rave scene. This film is soon to be a classic in the genre, and I am proud to add it to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little Splatter film","review":"Fairly well done back story, awesome effects and cool monsters.

Going in I knew that it was done with a limited budget, and it was suppose to be a 'Gore Flick'. I wasn't expecting much more than a fun gore-fest, but The Rage is just sad. The story is non-existent...which might be okay if the special effects weren't so horrible. This was produced by guys from a well established special effects company. So, how could they have made such a weak film. They compare this film to The Re-Animator, but don't buy into that. It is nothing like that movie...more like something you and your neighbors made when you were 12 and slipped out with dad's camcorder. It is the digital effects that truly suck in this film...and the acting...and the story. So, if you like bad acting, no story, and digital effects done by the junior high AV club then this is a movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Angry After ALL!!!","review":"What can I say about this but what a disapointment.

I was not expecting top notch from this B-Movie but come on give something better than this. Like I said if where not for all the effects this movie would had been a total failure.

I've seen alot of horror flicks and quite a few considered \\"A\\" flicks that sucked alot worse then this.This was a wild,fun,crazy ride of a movie! The acting was great from most of the cast ( a little weak from the kids in it )and the production values were suprisingly good. The special effects were over the top excellent for an independent movie and the editing and music was also solid. Overall this was a really good flick and I would recomend it to anyone that gets into independent horror. Some people have said it was only worth one star and all I have to say to that is you better just stick with your big budget duds and leave this for the down and dirty horror buffs.Kurtzman does it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splatter Punk at its Best.","review":"With all of the cheap horror flicks emerging from independant film companies today, it can be quite difficult to seperate the gems from the trash. When I first heard about \\"The Rage\\", I must admit that my expectations for the film were not exactly high. In spite of the fact that emenient soundscape band Midnight Syndicate was composing the soundtrack.Oddly enough, however, there was this nagging thought in my mind that implored me to give the film a chance. And when it finally arrived on dvd, I decided to purchase it.Now, there are very few horror movies that have been able to grab me and never let me go in the past. This film is one of them. \\"The Rage\\" is simply put, one of the grandest and goriest splatter films in the annals of horror cinema.Fans of the macabre who purchase this dvd will not be disappointed. But for those who say otherwise; it would be smart not to upset Dr.V ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Second I Didn't Like...","review":"I loved every second of it...non-stop thrills, chills, blood, guts, gore and more! Raw meat, splatter, head-splitting horror that meets the needs of true hor-gore fans. Where has this gem been hidden? With all of the trash out there, this one rises above 80% of them. It begins with one helluva thrill ride...and never lets go. Great special effects...and the title (Rage) couldn't be more fitting. It's a combination of \\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"The Birds\\", and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\"...all neatly packaged into a no-holds-barred bloodfest. No one is spared...men, women, children and species of terror. It's eye-plucking...leech sucking...body part (apart!)...devouring horror at its best! DON'T MISS IT! This film defines the true meaning of a horror fan. ALL FIVE STARS!

And I don't mean bad in a good way, but bad as in dire, dismal, hopeless and pathetic. I see from other reviews that some people really do like it. Fair enough, each to their own and all that, but everything about this film leaves me bored. Very weak 'story', desperate acting, gormless script, unconvincing gore. I had no interest in the characters and would have happily seen them all nuked after 30 minutes of this dross. Sorry fans, but I think with a bit of effort, planning and a budget of 25 you could do better yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5, not too impressed","review":"Gore is a VERY important factor in making a zombie movie, don't get me wrong, but it's not the only thing that makes the movie. This movie kinda sucked. I was expecting much better and it kind of fell flat. The acting wasn't too good, the plot was stupid, and those birds, WTH??? FAKE as ever! They kind of reminded me of the vulture Eon from that Rudolph's Shiny New Year Special. LOL, claymation at it's best. I guess it had potential but lacked in the ability to go anywhere with it. Again, it delivered on the gore, but that's about it. BOOOOOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Erin, Hate The Rage","review":"This collection of effect opportunities is no movie. Much as I like Erin Brown, she is wasted here. Ironically, the bird effects that some have ripped on are actually very well done. Consider it an early attempt by an aspiring director. If you need lots of grue without the distraction of story, this is your first stop. I can't say I enjoyed watching this at all. It doesn't even rise to the level of weirdly fun badness that some filmmakers manage (Ed Wood, I'm looking at you old man...). Go watch Misty Mundae's Mummy movie if she is what you're interested in. But this? So bad it's bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another typical low-budget slasher film.","review":"I'm generally not too fond of movies like this anyway.

Nevertheless, in this book he promotes the theory that Jews of European descent are not related to other Jews, but are descended from converts of the Khazar tribe. True experts have investigated this theory from every possible angle, and found, for example, that European and Middle Eastern Jews have a common genetic origin, especially on the male side, and that Yiddish (the language spoken by European Jews in the past) shows no sign of Turkic (Khazar) influence.

My acne has never been extremely severe...but it has been quite resistant to most treatments. I was really excited when I bought this book and read the reviews, it sounded like it might really be the cure I'd been searching for all these years. The plan was a lot of work, especially at night with the ice packs, but I was willing to try anything. I followed the plan exactly as stated for 6 full weeks with little to no improvement. That was my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting information, but it didn't work for me","review":"I found the information in this book enlightening, so I went out and bought the required products (vitamin A, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin c ester, oral and topical) and embarked on a low glycemic diet. I used the products for about two weeks and broke out with what amounted to probably 20 small zits around my nose and mouth. As soon as I stopped with the products and went back to my usual benzoyl peroxide regimen my skin cleared back up nicely.To be fair, I think it is hard to follow the routine he recommends and finding the right products is both difficult and expensive, so perhaps I did not do everything exactly right, or get just the right products, but I did not expect my skin to get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book on the topic","review":"This book offers a detailed look at the causes and cures for the acne sufferers. The program he recommended is easy enough to follow on a daily basis. He doesn't recommend any of his products but we have to search for ourselves.I think the author doesn't want any conflict of economical interests to offer his product line but spread the true science of curing the acne itself. It took me a long time to search and locate all the products he recommended in this book, but I have gained more knowledge in the process. I have found the acnerx kit from a company that offers all products this author recommends.I like the author' acne cure program and I highly recommend all acne suffers to buy the book and follow his program. It's a good book. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting stubborn acne out of my life!","review":"The basics of this book is using 3 over the counter topical creams together for 6 weeks to get rid of acne. Salicylic acid, glycolic acid, then benzole peroxide.(all in diluted forms available at any drugstore)It explains why these 3 work together, and why they don't work when not used in conjunction with eachother. I am following this program to a \\"t\\". I am only in my 2nd week, and think I am seeing a difference.If you are desperate to find another way to treat your acne, you may find this information help you understand the complexity of acne, and why it won't go away.

The antibiotics helped make them occur less often, but I didn't like the idea of staying on them forever.By following the program in this book, I've been able to get off the antibiotics and get rid of the breakout almost entirely. After being on the program for 3 years, I have not been able to move to the maintence program without breakouts returning, but the basic program is so easy and inexpensive that I don't mind staying on it. Also, when I do occasionaly get a pimple now, it is not as bad. By following the books advice, I can often avoid the pimple ever actually surfacing, but if it does, it is not as big, and it heals much more quickly.I've recommended this to many friends and will continue using it as long as needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treats the symptom without addressing the root of the problem...","review":"The Clear Skin Diet is a much better book and will work for everyone. Without the \\"24 hour\\" hype, the Clear Skin Diet is based on mountains of evidence that show the real reason you have acne. It's not because you're not using Salicytic Acid, though even in the Clear Skin Diet book that is suggested. Why was acne practically nonexistent in the Japanese 50 years ago? Now the Japanese, now that they have adopted a Westernized diet, have acne at the SAME rate as Americans. The largest study on acne ever conducted was the introduction of the Western diet, with dairy and saturated fats, high sugar and little fish, into the Japanese culture, and watching what happened to their skin in only 20 years. The same thing happened to the Eskimos when they adopted our diet.You've got to see acne for what it is. A chronic inflammation problem.

The program is cheap, easy to follow and makes sense. It can easily save someone with bad skin from years of pain and misery.

It has been two months now since I started on the cure, and although the night treatment was a pain at first, seeing the almost inmediate results was well worth the hassle.

I had resigned looking for an acne cure and was mercifully placing my skin in the hands of my dermatologist - which by the way, wasn't helping). As I began perusing the book, I realized I already had all the recommended products at home, so why not give this regime a try? Just a different way of using them...and adding ice (which by the way make so much sense and is such a relaxing part of my new routine).

My most recent bout some 1.5 months back was really bad..clumpy cystic ones that I couldnt even hide under cosmetics. I bought this book out of desperation, and read it almost in 1 sitting. I was skeptical at first after reading the book as it was mainly based on the merits of salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide...meds which I have already taken a lot of times in the past, and which I deemed to have little or no effect. However, the technique of using both meds, plus a lot of helpful tips were new to me so I went ahead and tried. I am glad I did...it cleared most of my breakout just in 1 week. I am now almost into my 3rd week and I'd say it has cleared about 85% of my breakout...just a handful of small, superficial acne left. I cant wait to be fully clear.

I have had similar results with antibiotics, and unfortunately the spots always came back eventually-so I hoped that the same thing doesn't happen with this. But although Terry Dubrows book seems to hold simple advice, it makes perfect sense,and it really is worth trying.I found the salycylic wash and BP easy to find in UK supermarkets or chemists,the glycolic acid product I could only get online.

It is better off this way, because Slug does not remember her mother, but instead, dwells on the times spent with her grandmother before her death. After she comes to live with Julie, she takes up Harper Tegges as an alternate grandmother. In a way, it seems her biological grandmother did not die in vain.

I am an avid reader of apocalypse fiction and at first I was excited to see a new entry into the genre but then a few warning signs popped up. The book was published by PublishAmerica, a vanity press (they say they are not, but any press that takes almost every book submitted and relies on the author to do their own publicity is one). Another concern is that all of the previous reviews were written by people who have written no other reviews. These items together make it all look a little fishy to me. Having read the first few pages I can say there is an interesting idea there but the dialog and pacing were amateurish. I am afraid that the rest of the novel may continue in this vein. This definitely does not belong on the same level as classics like Earth Abides. Get some legit reviews on here and maybe I will take another look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting new EOW book","review":"I found this novel on Book Crossing and was intrigued by the story line.

I would have liked to see more of the end of world book but I guess I'll have to look for the sequel. Overall the writing was decent and the story and characters got pretty entertaining after the first chapter or two.Along with this book I'd recommend The Stand, Left Behind, Earth Abides, Lucifer's Hammer and Ender's Run.

But why is everybody WHITE?","review":"This book has many strong points. It features a strong and clever female heroine. It makes mathematics fun. The sumptuous illustratations imitate the style of Classical Indian miniatures. But I have a major reservation: all the characters appear Caucasian, with very white skin and very rosy cheeks, even though the book is set in India, and the characters wear Indian clothing. We bought this book for our daughter, whom we adopted from India. I wish that she could see in this book a brave and resourceful heroine who is BROWN like her."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This book starts so well - like you're going on a wonderful trip with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. And then you realize the friend has changed - and worse, that he seems to have become kind of a jerk. I'm not saying Mr. Peterman is a jerk - I'm sure he's a nice man. But he refuses to get down to w-h-y his business failed. He blames a lot of people (and himself a little bit.) Maybe he really doesn't know. But why write a book if you don't have a story to tell.

But if you would like to hear the lovely tunes, look elsewhere because the chordal accompaniment overwhelms the tinkly, distant melody lines.

It was an electrifying evening filled with great energy and sound. This CD manages to capture that. It is an excellent recording that definitely does justice to the material.In addition, the selection of song is varied and allows a lot of the period specific instruments to demonstrate what kind of sound they can make.Also, I always consider it a bonus when the lyrics to the songs are included.

Maris York, an artist, is an androgynous beauty who arouses incinerating passions in the men around her. Sleeping In Flame is a novel populated by a shaman with a fondness for sandwiches, an autistic Adonis, and a tiny man as powerful and ravenously jealous as the God of the Old Testament.\\" (cover blurb, paraphrased)Just when the reader thinks he's in the middle of a slice-of-life romance, this novel takes a sharp left turn and veers into classic Carroll territory -- in other words, deep into the mythic and the folkloric. That jealous old man claims to be Walker's father, and Walker isn't who he thinks he is. Carroll treats us to clear rich prose, and somehow makes even the most fantastic situations seem plausible and perfectly ordinary.Jonathan Carroll remains one of my favorite \\"unknown\\" authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonathan Carroll is one of the best writers of the 20th C.","review":"An amazing writer.

There are a few mistakes in the book, but there is a notice online that alerts you to these mistakes and gives you the correct answers. Also, online there is a comprehensive diagnostic exam that tells you your strengths and weaknesses electronically, a big help.

Think of a Furay-era Poco album without the weaker songs several of those records had. Stellar production, musicianship, Richie's voice in perfect form, tight band, nice harmonies.

Schmit, I mean, this was gonna be great! But aside from Pauls guitar on 'Still of the night'(which sounds suspiciously like 'Heart of the Night'), you can't even tell there are guest musicians on the album. You gotta listen real close to hear Schmit and Stills,and Neils voice is barely audible. He cranks up Jesse Furays voice on every track though, nothing against her, but is she backing or leading? I always liked Richies album 'Dance a little Light' and was hoping this would be even better. It could of been if he had let someone else mix it. Just Hopin' for a little more...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the year!","review":"I am a fan of Buffalo Springfield & Poco, but never heard any of Richie's solo albums till now.

Furay's voice, use of harmonies and his music are stellar!

I didn't realize until I read this book why so many other Chinese history/culture books have not resonated well with me. It's because all the others have tried to tell the Chinese story linearly and chronologically, which is a good way of approaching Western Civilization (The Greek period, the Roman period, the Dark Ages, the Medieval Ages, the Rennaisance, etc) but not at ALL the way to look at Chinese history, where so many ideas have remained timeless from dynasty to dynasty, and progress is not measured from one epoch to the next.

If I didn't mind paper buckling, I wouldn't have specifically purchased \\"fingerpaint paper.\\" It does have a glossy finish (why it has it on both sides is a mystery), so I gave it two stars for that.I am really surprised that some reviewers commented on the strength and durability of this paper.

True it is double-sided, but I couldn't use the otherside because of how thin and cheap the paper is.

They are usually well written and edited, though the indices are usually mediocre. Mr. Jennings' book is, however, a disappointment. The knowledge is certainly there. Unfortunately most of it can be found in the Microsoft Access 2000 Help file. If this volume were better organized and indexed than the Microsoft help file, that would be a benefit of small not inconsiderable importance. Unfortunately, the organization of this book strikes me as worse than the MS Access help file.Important topics are reduced to cryptic index entries - if they are to be found at all. Inter-related information on topics are widely and often illogically separated. Examples are often very sparse and, ultimately, unenlightening.Overall, this volume is a disappointment. The information may very well be contained somewhere in the book, but you can find it faster in other tomes on the subject, in the MS Access help file or the MS KnowledgeBase.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good reference book","review":"I purchased this book hoping to use it as a reference. There are many interdependencies between chapters. As a result, I am unable to jump to different topics without having to go back to some other chapter to create the tables needed for the new topic.

On almost every DVD player in my house, the disc can not be properly read. My PS2 simply can't play it, the DVD player in my TV can't make it past the piracy warning (kinda ironic), my computer can't play it with sound, another one skips wildly between chapters, and one of them plays it perfectly, though the menu is incapable of being shown.It's also worth noting that Mindgame has NOT been licensed for release in Region 1, and the only official release is a 2-disc set in Region 4.So yeah, this is very probably an illegal copy of the film.Don't get me wrong, the movie is absolutely beautiful both visually and otherwise. Studio 4 Degrees C always does amazing work. I want to support them in any way I can, but this is not supporting them. This is piracy.In short: DO NOT SUPPORT PIRACY.

This book is a story about overcoming the obstacles of the past: our mother's struggles, our fears, and the memories that come down to us from generation to generation which keep us from being truly human. This is a parable,teaching us that it is better to live than to give up, that it is possible to overcome the things that kept us down in the past, and that it is necessary to forgive what others have done to us. Only in forgiving and loving can we be free.

She wails and hoots and hollers throughout the whole album totally destroying every song worth your time listening to. The reason this album has 2 stars and not just 1 star is because PragaKhan has some excellent beats before she busts in wailing. If you like regular Lords of Acid, you'd probably really enjoy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, uh, tell her to shut up.","review":"The opening track, a clever spoof involving the abuse of a televangelist, was very promising, but it is not a sign of the vocally marred material to come.

Great for mischievous encounters (not all being a certain kind of mischief). Other than that, prompt arrival, bottle was as advertised and it smells awesome.

The author continually tells the reader to be kind and gentle with children, and then recommends \\"alternatives to spanking\\" that are simply other types of punishments: time out, removal of privileges, and the like. She simply doesn't get it that children are human beings who behave as well as they are treated, and who will behave well when treated with love and respect.

I have DOXA and Fortis watches and I would put this in the same class. Would have preferred this in black PVD or DLC but that was not to be.

Accessible songs that flow from one to the other, alternating and dual vocals, classy lead guitars, pianos and awesome singing that spoke of addiction, love, religion and death made this album truly unforgettable.Eight years after its release this album has stood the test of time and has lost none of its power.

It isn't artful, it isn't contemplative, and it doesn't encourage higher thought. But it's still an important series for a lot of kids from the ages of about 6-13. In literary diets, they fit in the same group as comic books: Goosebumps is nothing more than dessert. However, they encourage kids to read and use their imaginations. Goosebumps is great for escapism. Attack of the Mutants was the very first Goosebumps book I ever owned. For three years after I bought this book ( at a science museum! ) I spent a lot of time reading and collecting the others in the series. I started reading Goosebumps around the same time I started writing as a hobby, and re-reading a lot of my old stuff it shows ( I copied R.L. Stine's style ). These aren't good books for reading.

Some say that she had so many children, she wished her last one was a devil, and her wish came true. Some say that something scared the poor woman so much that she gave birth to a monster.This is a book that examines all aspect of the legend with pictures, carvings, and articles that date back to the first mentions of the demonic beast in the 1800's. It offers many articles, sketches, and photos that are unique to this volume.Perhaps my only complaint is that it's a bit thin.

Too bad, no real insights from real traders. Can you read this book and understand the importance of calculating different hedges; why a speculator should care what hedges are common for different contracts (so one can interpret the news); how to interpret contango for different contracts?

But the more you listen, you realize that even though it's still the same thing they do over and over, they add sufficient dynamics to keep the songs fresh. A movie score-like number sets the ground for this record, and from there the band does their absolute best to mesmerize us with their best songs in years. Pompous, brilliantly orchestrated symphonic battle/black metal with an emphasis on ultra-epic segments causing a maelstrom of majestic moments is what the band gives and without a doubt, they are the absolute masters at it. 4.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece.","review":"The Tchaikovsky Trio is a masterpiece -- one of the most beautiful pieces of chamber music ever written. Tchaikovsky wrote this work in memory of his mentor and friend Nicholas Rubinstein and -- perhaps for this highly-emotional reason -- he pored all of his considerable genius into it. If you are not familiar with this beautiful work please give it a try. You may find that you love it as much as I do. The Arensky Trio is less inspired and accounts for the four-star rating. The performances by the Rembrandt Trio are quite good -- especially in the case of the Tchaikovsky Trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book yet on the far-right","review":"Neiwert's book is the best yet on the fringe of the far right, and focuses on what is probably the most important region for this movement.

However, for any casual student (let alone a serious one) of military history in general, or the Arab-Israeli wars in particular, the book is as useful for in-depth understanding as \\"Johnny Tremain\\" was for the American Revolution.There are much better personal accounts of the heroism involved (\\"The Heights of Courage\\"). And, though the spy story is interesting, Blum omits entirely the mid-war US re-arming of Israel, and the desperate and deadly backdrop of concurrent US-USSR diplomacy. The superpower confrontation shaped the whole conduct of the war; making no mention of it in his reonstruction of top-level Israeli wartime strategic discussions is ludicrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Untold Story About the Eve of Destruction","review":"What this book does well is highlight some of the military strategy in the Yom Kippur War in easy to understand terms.But it is not a good book for learning about what actually happened in the war, wartime diplimatic manuevers, or how or why the war ended.

If you want to learn about those things, you will have to read another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping Tale of Military Myopia","review":"This book is eminently readable and hard to put down.

The articles and tech write ups are top notch minus a few typos.

Over the two CDs, you get to experience some moving performances and speeches by many prominent people of the day. Oscar Levant plays the entire 'Concerto in F'. It is interesting from an historical point of view, and it feels like you are listening to it 'live'. I was slightly disappointed with the performance of 'Rhapsody In Blue', but that's the way it was played on the night, so I can't hold that against the recording. You must remember that this is a radio broadcast, and is subject to the technical quality of the day. If you are looking for definitive performances, then this is not for you, but if you want to feel part of this historical event, then I recommend it. It is a true tribute to the genius that was George Gershwin."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what is expected","review":"The documentary was very boring and not what you expect.

I had it shipped to my mom's house. When I got there, a couple days before Christmas, I was truly disappointed in the product. What I received was a small cardboard book. The picture looks like a large book and claims to come with a tape that has Jerry Garcia and David Grissman doing a song. No tape. No mention of Jerry or Dave on the book. Poor product, poor description, poor presentation of product on the Amazon page. Now I must find something for my niece last minute to go with tiny book."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing 1969 recording of Deep Purple at Montreux","review":"This is truly an amazing find, as well as recording for the Deep Purple fan. It's the \\"classic\\" MK2 lineup just a few months along, being caught on tape (pretty good quality) doing a complete mind blowing set in late '69. The songs performed are Kneel & Pray (early version of Speed King), Hush, Child in Time, Wring That Neck, Paint It Black, Mandrake Root and Kentucky Woman as the encore, very rare indeed. Thus, making Montreux '69 an essential purchase for the Deep Purple fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The atomic clock has only worked once in a great while.

Your choices are limited to only three golf courses and six professional golfers. The only worse golf game than this was Tiger Woods for the N64 platform. The graphics are the only plus for this game and the credit for that should probably be given to Sony. The gameplay is much more advanced than Tiger 99 for PS1, that could be due to the lack of information that is given to the golfer on the lie of the ball or the grossly exagerated grid of the green. I wish I had never bought this game and I would trade it in if I were to get more than $25 from the local store. Save some money and buy either Links or Microsoft Golf for your PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE HYPE","review":"I have been playing EA GOLF since the SEGA GENISIS. EA SPORTS has forgotten that graphics are nice but quickly get old. Game play is what makes a game as fun again and again. Here is a list of the problems. 1. you should have the option of using the buttons instead of the analog stick 2. not enough courses to choose from 3. in general using the analog joysticks doesn't work 4. for whatever reason you chunk pitch shots unless right on the green 5. it won't show you the grid of the green when you are chipping"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking...","review":"What a shame! I had high hopes for PGA 2001. Unfortunately, EA spent a lot of time (and money) motion capturing Tiger and not enough time re-creating courses. Surely, something with the potential that the PS2 has could have handled more than 3 courses, at the very least give me some variety. TPC at Sawgrass anyone? I really did like the use of the analog sticks to swing, that's one of the nice aspects of this game. However, I expected a lot more depth from the company that released Madden 2001, no season, no stats, no MONEY? It's ironic that the much-maligned \\"Swing Away Golf\\" has more detail & depth than a PGA licensed product. Rent it, or buy mine when I take it to the used video game store."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 courses? WHO CARES!!!!","review":"This game has it all. Tour, Tournement, you name it, Tiger Woods PGA Tour has it. How many courses do you need? Pepple Beach, Spyglass, sweet courses. Maybe since it's a Playstation 2 a few more, but I think people are getting too spoiled. Also these graphics are the best ever for a golf game. If you are a true golf maniac, you will want to get this game and ignore all the bad reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good game","review":"The best golf game i ever played. Graphics were good. There just wasn't anyone else for me to play against that made it a challenge. 3 courses and a bunch of different modes kept me busy for a while. My biggest complaint is noise. Not enough. Unless there's someone else in the room talking, it can get errily quiet. The only other thing was i thought it was to easy to control ball flight, and it didn't present much of a challenge. Still worth the money though. Might want to rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, with many features left to be desired","review":"The graphics and gameplay are really great. The load times are surprisingly short. However, there are only 5 golfers and 3 or 4 courses. I also wish there was a \\"create a golfer\\" feature. Even though these features are missing, the game overall is fun to play and the graphics are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Golf Game, period","review":"This is the best golf game of all time. Graphics are perfect. Game play couldn't be better. Not having that stupid C swing meter makes the game more like real golf. I love the fact that you can get in a groove with this swing meter and when you get out of your grove,(just like real golf) it is hard to get back in. The AI in the game also is more like real golf. The better you play it makes it easier to hit good shots. When your off, you have to hit it even more perfect to get back on again. It's brilliant! And don't worry that it only has 3 tracks and 6 pros. That doesn't take away anything and will mean that future versions will be that much better. And even though you can only play 6 different pros, when your playing a tournament, all the real names are still up there. Mike Weir was leading a tourny for gods sake. It couldn't be more accurate then that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphics are TERRIBLE for PS2!!!","review":"Graphics are Actually GREAT, on the back of the CD case.

The game only has 3 coarses!!! Nowif those 3 coarses were highly detailed I could understand, but when aDVD can fit like 4 Gigs of info on them and they put only 3 [cruddy]couses on them that is just stupid. Another dumb thing is the userinterface is [cruddy], I spent about 10 min reading the stupid manualtrying to figure out how to hit, then another 10 trying to figure outhow to play 2 player.

Be able to control the ball flight once in the air with a draw or fade is so cheesy. Also their is no choice for courses(which i am sure they will release later to sucker you in to spending more money). Also there are only 4 or 5 golfers th choose from. the worst is that its keeps no stats on avg drive distance. putts per green, Moniey won etc. If you want a good golf game get links 2001 for the pc"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new love for the slowest game in sports","review":"As an owner of the last Tiger Woods on PS, my love first began then.

None of us has ever picked up a club before but got madd skills when it comes to Tiger Woods PGA Tour.

This book is as charming as the first one, as the residents of tiny Bryson City try to get used to the big city ways of one of its newest practitioners. In the first book of the series, Dr. Larimore discovers that some simple country remedies work just as well or better than the latest medical technology. In this book, he learns that the key to curing patients is not only in the physical realm, but in the mental and spiritual areas as well. He goes into greater detail about his daughter's cerebral palsy, and does not hesitate to tell some funny stories in which he is the butt of the joke. This book and the others in the series make for delightful reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious","review":"I was a fan until this book.

Grosskurth gets all the facts of Havelock Ellis's life in order but fails synthesize them, and thus cannot grasp his essence. My feeling is that she misses the point so badly, and can't connect the dots of information she shares about Havelock Ellis, because she hasn't connected the dots in her own life. And if she'd done so in herself I can't imagine she would have had much interest in devoting YEARS of her life attemping to sort out this Havelock Ellis character, who, sadly, is not the world's most interesting or important creature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Czech music in highest level","review":"I have many CD's with compositioions of Czech masters, but this one is one of the greatest.

I especially enjoyed the discussion of how the victims of thalidomide supported its reinstatement and how they employed various means to educate and warn potential users of its adverse effects.

However, having been in advertising for 10 years, I simply could NOT believe that a junior copywriter at a large agency would be left in charge of an ENTIRE account, especially a new one. There are so many aspects of a large scale campaign that in addition to copywriters, there are art directors, creatives, account executives (whose main job is to talk to the client). A junior copywriter probably wouldn't have had any interaction with the client at all. URG. It was just so unbelievable I couldn't take it.The rest of the book was marginally better. I agree with another reviewer said there were too many subplots... Cyn's two friends and their lives, her brother getting married, her own relationships with her parents and her new boyfriend, her therapy, it was all just TOO much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"I picked up this book for two reasons. First, the main character, Cyn, was in the advertising business. Second, I thought the premise sounded interesting. Cyn takes over another women's identity, who has wronged her in the past. I was pretty disappointed on both fronts. The whole advertising business aspect wasn't very realistic, even for a chick-lit book. As far as the plotline goes, the author tried way too hard to make Cyn likable. I ended up hating her because she was so gosh darn nice.

As Sherry pointed out Greene's keen power of observation produced a cynical and realistic view of life. Burdened by anxieties but guided by his Catholic faith Greene was attracted to the epic struggles of flawed underdogs trying to cope with their transitory lives. Sherry ties all this together neatly. Its a book for leisurely reading. You will never regret its purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I ever wanted to know about GG but did not know to ask.","review":"This is an inspiring, detailed look at a fascinating writer, by an equally fascinating writer. The images of Norman Sherry traipsing through the jungles and Mexico, etc., give one pause and confidence. If his work on Conrad is as detailed and careful, I would suspect he could give the composition of bilge water in the hold of each ship for each trip for each book. If one ever wondered about writers and sources and inspiration and biography and art, start with volume I. You could have no finer introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lest Ye Be Judged","review":"Sherry has certainly done a thorough job of \\"tracking\\" Greene, with the result that one gets a rather full picture of this writer. It's easy to throw around words like \\"great\\" and so on when talking about Greene, especially if you like him, but in the end I see him as a very entertaining writer who never achieved greatness. (Compare him to Joyce or Tolstoy and you'll see what I mean.) Sherry is a bit of a busy-body and gets into some strange \\"politically correct\\" judgments, criticizing Greene for not being properly appreciative of the 'natives' about whom he said many condescending, but possibly accurate things. Sherry seems not to be able to understand why Greene couldn't say nice things about everybody in the same way opportunistic journalists seem able to manage. Well, I don't have the answer to that, except to say that Greene's generation (see Waugh and Orwell) didn't have much patience for propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 6 year old liked this, Guess I should work on her taste","review":"If you have read the books, and (although not quite Potter-class) they are quite good, this movie should be a let down.

I love Tye already and this cd made me love him even more I can't wait to see the DVD of the live show.

Tye keep up the slammin work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Rotation","review":"This CD has been in my CD player since I first brought it in May, it is a great worship album. It differs from his debut,\\"Life\\", because the live music adds an extra energy. The album starts off strong with \\"I Want It All Back\\" and leaves you in a worshipping mood with the live version of \\"Everything\\". Other great songs are \\"Sinking\\", \\"Alright\\" and of course \\"Victory\\". Be prepared to worship and receive \\"Victory\\" Tye Tribbet's second album."},{"rating":"2","title":"nobody touches tye tribbet& g.a.","review":"tye tribbet is my favorite male gospel artist beside john p kee is my second favorite male gospel artist but anyway no body touches tye tribbet he is the best love his music so much i am a really big and huge fan of tye tribbet&g.a. they are the best hands down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overrated","review":"Out of this whole CD, I could only pick about 3 songs that I liked. This CD is very disappointing and some of the songs were down right annoying. The best songs on here are Everything Part I, II/ Bow Before The King and Victory. Past those songs, there is not much because I can't bear to listen to the rest. Those two songs get 1 star each."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victory??? More like a Disaster!!!","review":"Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it! Do not buy this CD! You will be very disappointed. I was on such a high from Tye's first CD that I immediatley reserved my copy of Victory after hearing his title track. Thinking that Tye was going to keep the talent coming to the table I was disappointed when I put the CD in my car. There are only 2 or 3 good songs, and worst of all, he puts the best song towards the end. So I had to torture myself until it got to the good stuff. I agree with the other review that suggested \\"Look Up\\" should be a full song instead of a snippet. To this day, I only pop the CD in to hear \\"Victory\\" or the song that features Kim Burrell. Other than that, the CD is a disaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I, like other reviewers, was really disappointed with this album from Tye Tribbett. I thought it came up short compared to his CD Life. I would fast forward through each song hoping that the next one would be better. With the exception of maybe two songs, it never got better. This was definitely not what I expected from Tye and G.A."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity!","review":"Tye Tribette is definitely out of the box and the diversity of this work is absolutely refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Level. GET THIS CD !!!!","review":"This Cd is a must have. The quality is what we should expect from gospel artist. I have absolutely no idea what other reviews are talking about in their, \\"I expected more\\" statements. This album was done to a new stardard in music. There isn't a secular composer out now that can hold a candle to Tye. He is gifted and that is how is should be. The church should have the best musicians, singers and composers.He couldn't do anymore on this album. If someone tells you they didn't like this cd, I would strongly suggest not taking any advice from them EVER again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for studying digestion and nutrition","review":"This game will help bring home how the digestive system works and how the food you eat affects you. It also has some great activities and experiments to try at home (like eating with chopsticks, napkin folding, drinking upside down, counting peas...).The graphics are pleasing and we didn't run into any programming errors. The game design is simplistic but the kids love it and were able to complete it without aid from us.The age range says 6 and older however kids older than 8 or 9 will not find this game dynamic enough and will become easily put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The narrator in this CD has a British/cockney accent and speaks quite fast. It was difficult for me to understand so it never made it under the tree. For example, the word \\"uvula\\" is pronouced \\"uvuler\\". Other than that, it's difficult to use, and is not as educational as I thought it would be. It's more like a game, and a frustrating one, because some of the links to click on lead to the same \\"action\\", song, or description, which gets quite tedious. I was reluctant to click on a page more than once and there are numerous \\"buttons\\" on each page. The art is interesting for an adult, but too busy for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful warm-hearted Nielsen","review":"This is wonderful stuff. Don't be put off by the extreme pretentiousness of one reviewer: the playing here is top-notch and the conducting at least that good. Far and away the best recording of the great Helios overture on record (bravo horns!). Sound in SACD is fabulous, especially the violin tone, which is gorgeous. A couple of must-have rarities make this essential buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sampling with a Small Standard Deviation","review":"To some extent I have to agree with parts of what the reviewer of 06/08/08 has to say. These are exceptional performances of orchestral music by Carl Nielsen, the majority of it quite unfamiliar to me. However, most of them inhabit more or less not just the same ballpark but the same infield, so that once you've made friends with one you find that the next is a closely related cousin. I don't know that that's necessarily a fault -- the adjectives delightful, engaging and enjoyable can all be applied to each of these pieces, but I'll admit that sometimes I get a desire for something a bit different from Nielsen. Still, I agree with those who hold that this is the nonsymphonic orchestral Nielsen disc nonpareil. The Helios Overture, my favorite non-symphonic work by this composer an in some ways a stylistic odd man out here, is rendered magnificently. Sometimes sameness isn't boring, and upon reflection I suppose that adage applies here. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Principals of Color","review":"The book Principals of Color has not yet arrived at the given address in Brazil.

Seeing the trio play together is unbelievable. The 2 disc cd live show was really good too. I believe that the DVD is the better part of this deal.

Well, it did get reissued while we were looking for it all on parent labels.These nonpareil presentations of three of Mennin's masterworks have been praised to the skies again and again, so my pipsqueaking isn't worth listening to. But the disk is, and I'm relieved that when my LPs go, I can fall back on this CD waiting in the wings in my collection. It doesn't concede very much to the LPs in sound and it perpetuates the memory of a compelling composer that we lost way too early.Add Hanson's Mercury reading of the 5th Symphony to these and you truly have a treasure chest for yourself on just two disks."},{"rating":"2","title":"two American masterpieces","review":"At long last, on one piece of media, two of the best works in 20th Century American music. I have the Symphony #7 paired with Martinon's Symphony #4 (Altitudes) on vinyl as well as the Piano Concerto paired with Yardumian's Passacaglia, Recitatives and Fugue, all on RCA labels. I've played them so many times, I think I can hear the flip side playing backwards. To have these masterpieces together on one CD is remarkable. Kudos.If you've never heard of Peter Mennin, this is the CD to get.I've never heard Mennin's Symphony #3. You can tell the work is an early one in it's harmonies and rhythms and the recording is distant.

By far the worst purchase I've made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a novel of ideas","review":"A wierd and funny, but in the end, profound book. Carey shows us our world through the eyes of a deformed child. The \\"imaginary\\" countries are actually dead-on representations of our own-- America and probably Australia, big fish and minnow, 'culture' producer and 'culture' consumer. The paradox of puritanism and lurid spectacle that is America The Superpower. Tristan obviously comes to us via Oskar from The Tin Drum, but everything else is straight from the impressive imagination of Peter Carey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not Carey's best","review":"Oscar and Lucinda is one of my all-time favourite books. When I picked up this one, I expected a similar style of writing. Maybe it's because the world Carey has created here is too detached from my own familiarity that I could not fully relate to the characters. I must admit, however, that Carey's writing does make the reader feel. I had an eery feeling towards the protagonist throughout, but could never sympathize with him. I see in the reviews from others that perhaps this book is best left to Australians who understand something of where Carey is coming from. Usually, I would say that good writing and a good story can cross any cultural boundaries, but maybe this book IS best left to the Aussies. (Even though it's probably arguable that Canada's relationship to the American cultural \\"superpower\\" is/isn't similar to Australia's relationship to the US.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to understand","review":"I just wanted to read something in English, so last summer I decided to buy this book. What a mistake! For me, poor Italian reader, was impossible to understand: There were too many invented words without a meaning. Nevertheless I read it through, but I did not like it at all. I would like to ask the author if he intends to make it translated in Italian so maybe I could understand something more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another over-rated work by Carey","review":"Peter Carey, since the publication of his first novel, has been constantly over-rated by critics. This novel is the greatest example of his true inability as an author/artist. The story-line is at best lame, with Carey foreshadowing any twists in the plot miles in advance. It is, of course, an attempt at satire, however he over reaches himself yet again. And yet again, because he uses a new language and is supposedly being clever, critics fawn madly over his talent and equate him with Dickens. Please. Carey is perhaps the best \\"first page\\" writer in the world, but unfortunately his novels go for much longer. Avoid this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rocksteady - ROCK ON!!!","review":"Nice collection of Heptones stuff. Some nice covers, typical of this era reggae.

The book provides the basis for understanding the underlying principles for valuing derivatives intstruments. Since the text is academic and theoretical in nature, the book is geared towards graduate business school students and Wall Street professionals (and maybe only those working on trading/research desks). For the day-trading crowd, you will not find any specific discussions about trading strategies that make money. Instead, you will be enriched with a fundamental understanding of derivatives pricing --- from there you can try to earn your riches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"I grew up on the earlier editions of this book. But now it's well past its prime, very old fashioned. The financial world has moved on at lot in recent years. Due to the influx of serious scientists PDEs are increasingly used in practice, and there's very little of this subject in the book. It's still used in univs but less by serious quants."},{"rating":"2","title":"About this book","review":"As the same as other people's opinion, I appreciate this book very much. I am a student majoring in finance, and feel that this book is really a good start point in understanding derivatives. Although I think that some parts of John Hull's description could be better, for example offer more formal and detailed proofs in his work, this is not an importnat drawback at all. If someone want to know more about in this field, of course he or she should not just only read this book. Taking an overview of derivatives from this one and learn more in-depth from other books or papers is a right attitude. About the price, as a student outside US, I feel it is a little expensive, though I can buy international edition of this book. Many textbooks in US are expensive if using the standard of my country, but I know that the authors devote themselves to their works more than those in our country. John Hull must earn much from his book, but his effort is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"expected some kind of adjustment for diff. sizes of wood","review":"I expected some kind of adjustment for diff. thicknesses of wood.When you don't have the settings info from the web, this tool could ruin your wood.The bigger kreg has adjustment lines - why not here?For the rest this is a great wood connector!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful product, good service","review":"This was the same product I'd seen before at Home Depot, so no surprises there.

It wasn't. It is actually a documentary of the 30 days the comics spent on the road. At first I was going to turn it off but after about 20 minutes it started to pull me in. They do show some of the comic's bits and they are pretty funny. My husband and I were snorting with laughter at some points. Each comic gets showcased at some point in DVD and you get to learn about their backgrounds and families. It was actually pretty heartwarming as well as quite funny when they showed the actual bits.Also if you are on the fence about whether or not you like Vince Vaughn you will not be after viewing this DVD.

But, there is a time and place for those kind of things, you don't really want to see emotional things when you sit down and expect to be entertained with laughter, or who they meet on the road etc...The thing is watchable, there is some good laughs, but it really seems like this should be a bonus feature, and the full show should have been the main feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scenes are cut short and incoherent.

More like \\"Ha Ha\\"","review":"Several days ago my roommates went out to rent us a movie to watch, and they brought back \\"Boo\\". Honestly, I laughed when they told me the title, and I hardly stopped for the rest of the film. The acting was horrible, the plot-line is laughable (and they seem to introduce plot lines then not really follow through with them in the end...), and the special effects, while gory and gross, are clearly done on a budget (not necessarily the worst thing ever, but still a minor deterrent). If you're looking for a \\"scary\\" movie that you enables you to laugh off all of the moments that make you jump, which there are quite a few of in this film (hense 2 stars instead of 1), then \\"Boo\\" is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO DVD REVIEW","review":"Even if you are a fan of the low budget horror films, this movie is not for you.

I found nothing creative or imaginative, and I failed to see what was so entertaining about it. What was so spooky about the abandoned hospital?? I didn't see it. I thought the whole plot and script was just plain drab. And yes I yawned a lot throughout the movie wishing it would get better, and it never did. Maybe for those who raved about the movie, they are easily entertained by whatever is put in front of them???? I don't get it. I thought the movie was DULL big time. Nothing scary.It had a lot of loud noises where there was a \\"fright\\" scene such as the appearance of a ghost, but never did frighten me. Not once. Just loud noise.

The \\"scare\\" tactics I found very corny-lots of loud noises (useful to wake you up from the excessive boredom) but absolutely nothing frightening whatsoever.

The movie is executed very poorly and simply fails to elicit any scares in a sophisticated horror movie audience. The name of this movie is stupid and so is the movie itself. If you buy this garbage thinking you're going to see a good scary movie, you are going to be grossly disappointed with this movie's merits as a horror movie. This film failed to generate any laughs in me about how terrible it was, and that is really sad. After viewing this garbage, I just came away thinking this was truly a sad piece of rubbish. There's really no other way to put it.

I was drawn in by the trailer initially, but then you really can't trust trailers nowadays, can you? You can't trust the entire film either. A spooky environment and people covered in blood don't make for a good horror film when the acting is laughable and the script seems to have been thrown together with haste and disregard for quality. If this had comedy deliberately in mind aside from horror, then it acheived its goal. But this is a very ineffectual movie.

There is one classic scene where the idiot teens are trying to escape the hospital and one guy gets pissed, so we come to find out he is actually a ghost, he starts to melt, so another guy shoots him, and the dude blows up and covers a girl.

The pencil does not write (it is only a paper facsimile), there has never been a scent retained for the peppermint candy cane, movable pieces come too easily detached (girl's arm that puts the star on the Christmas tree, the tobaggen) and the the binding is weak.

I have several of Leslie's tapes and these 3 help alleviate boredom. I especially like the 1 Mile Power Walk and the Walk and Jog. The 1 Mile Power Walk is fast paced and good when I don't have much time. The Walk and Jog uses interval training - some walking mixed with 2 minute spurts of jogging. This one reminds me of the 1989 (I think) tape of Leslie's that is almost entirely jogging. The third tape, Walk and Kick, doesn't interest me as much. In that one Leslie combines her regular core moves with boxing exercises. Overall I am glad I bought them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"This series is okay as an add on after a more intense workout. My main complaint is the low intensity. I thought that the walk jog would be a great one to work up a sweat but it really wasn't. I also thought the backround music was very difficult to hear and I personally need to hear that music-it's motivating for me. Leslie's voice however comes through very loud which may be why the music seems so low. The backrounds themselves are kind of cheesey, but I can live with that. I enjoy the express series much more than this one. It is more of an intense workout, large groups of enthusiastic people and you can hear the music, so you can \\"walk to that beat\\" as Leslie likes to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets 4 stars because I like Leslie but not this production....","review":"I have many of Leslie's dvds. They are perfect for my 40 year old thighs! I bought this set because I wanted a more intense workout in the morning...I only have 30 minutes to exercise before work. So far I have done \\"walk jog\\" and \\"walk kick\\" several mornings and I do work up a good sweat. BUT.....these really need to be updated! First problem...The set is so fake and cheesy....like you are in some outdoor terrace. Whats wrong with the usual exercise room/gym??? Second problem...some of the moves are not carpet friendly or the transitions are awkward. Third problem...she has several miscues. There are points in the routine where even the assistants are confused. They are either doing moves different from her or they just stop all together. All of this give the feeling of a cheap, quickie production. I am able to ignore these as I love Leslie and I know I am still benefitting from the exercise. But not my favorite set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I've never tried any Sansone workouts before so I picked these up to give it them a try. The power mile was so low energy that I didn't even feel as though I was exercising. The walk/jog made me break a sweat, albeit a small one, and didn't really get my heartrate into an aerobic range. As stated before, the sets are cheesy and the music is low. Most of all, at the end of the walk/jog workout Sansone says that you've walked 2.5 miles. My pedometer measure just 1 mile - now my pedometer may be off some, but no way is it off by over 50%! I don't know think I'll be trying anymore of the WATP exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok workout if you're not used to working out","review":"I was hoping this would provide an alternative to the aerobic-dance-kick workout DVDs that end up twisting my knees. The Walk series is probably ok if you're not used to working out, but it doesn't get my heart pumping. I have to modify it as a running in place work out to get much from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stuff","review":"This product, used with the Earth Mama Angel Baby Stretch Mark Oil helped my wife throughout the pregnancy with skin itchiness and helped prevent stretch marks from appearing. Please keep in mind that is LARGELY depends on genes and your family history on whether or not you will develop stretch marks, but this definately helped my wife. I did alot of research and found this to smell great and work good. It is safer to use than many of the other over the counter items. She used to put this on in the morning and when she got home from work and then put the oil on right before bed. It helped with her itchy skin and left her skin feeling smooth and very nice to the touch. Men, do your wife a favor and surprise her with this stuff here, especially if she hates the smell of the cocoa butter.

Well I definately received what I was looking for. I love this lotion. It smells like an orangsicle and is not greasy or too heavy. I would definately recommend this product and am so happy there are actually people out there that care enough about our children to make a safe product for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great texture and not too greasy","review":"I bought this because I needed a hand moisturizer that wasn't made with any dangerous ingredients if ingested as I am washing my hands 100 times a day and didn't want my baby getting any parabens or petrolatum products in her mouth. This product has a nice texture, slightly greasy going on but absorbs relatively quickly with little residue. It smells like chewed baby aspirin though, the major negative thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars. I like the recyclable bottle but the pump top stopped working within a couple of pumps, leaving the rest of the full bottle of lotion difficult to retrieve, and the pump top has to be thrown away. It's also not terribly portable for the diaper bag. I've tried all kinds of \\"natural\\" products and this one is near the top of the list if not for the smell and packaging. Would be phenomenal if they changed the smell a bit and packaged in a toothpaste squirt tube instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"I bought this product because I use the baby bottom balm and absolutely love it! It works great on diaper rash. I like the natural ingredients Earth Mama uses. However, this lotion is not really what I expected. It's not as rich and creamy as I hoped. And I'm not thrilled with the way it smells. I read the other reviews and thought they were being too picky. But, it really does smell like cheap, old lady lotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sting like Bubble Gum.","review":"I read reviews and some People said Smell like organic something. but I only can smell Cheap Bubble Gum.The lotions okay just don't like smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross smell","review":"I got this product after being so annoyed with the smell of the Palmer's stretch mark cream. I wanted something with more natural ingredients as well. While it does have that, I expected the smell to be more pleasant. Although it is slightly better than the Palmer's smell, it still is gross to me. I guess just a personal preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love this lotion. I bought both the EMAB stretch oil and this EMAB body butter. I use both on my growing baby belly because I can't decide which one I like better. They don't leave me feeling greasy and I actually like the light scent. I do recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works nicely","review":"Not greasy and doesn't irritate my 4 month old's skin. I use it myself as well.

To paraphrase Arnie \\"BIG MISTAKE!\\" Tried to install it on my system but the software included wouldn't talk to the MC3-no matter how hard I tried. Further, the software installed made my system unstable-reset itself many times. I'm returning this piece of trash at the earliest opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"one fatal flaw!!","review":"First of all, i love this device. Second, and most important, i agree totally with a previous reviewer: Ever since i installed the software, it has rendered my entire computer unstable and i get reset all the time. I can not even view the videos i recorded from this thing on my OWN COPUTER!! this is not good. The device is fun, but the software ruined my computer. i am not joking about this.

It works great, it takes great videos (on best quality 20fps), ok stills, and the mp3 sound quality is very high. Also has presets for rock, voice, pop and some others. The only dissapointment is the reflective dislpay (not backlit), but you can still see it fine, so don't let that stop you from getting it. Connecting to your computer if you have Windows XP to put mp3s on it can be a hassle at first, but all you need to do is download this plugin from kodak.com, and install the realjukebox software on the cd, and there you go. All in All, this is great camera to start you off,or even to keep you at. Also has a video out so you can connect it to your TV. Good Luck!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not for serious use","review":"I bought one of these after they stopped making them (somehow I got a brand new one), and was pleased with the camera. It uses a non-backlit display and this increases battery life dramatically. There are quite a few options for altering sound, so MP3 playback is great. The camera and video recorder both record at surprisingly high quality. This isn't a camera I'd use on a vacation, but something I bought just for on the go and fun daily use. The device can also be used as a webcam, which is fun. If you can find a brand new one (careful, many sell refurbished), then I'd say go ahead and buy it for under $100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice pattern","review":"The colbalt blue stripe and a simple but elegant silver pattern works very well together.

The band is obviously talented, but the only tolerable vocals were the ones in Italian. When they sang (or worse, spoke) in English I could understand how stupid the lyrics were. These guys should concentrate on instrumentals. They would be more enjoyable. Fantasy metal walks a fine line between the artfully fanciful & the absurd, & these guys pole-vaulted over it.

The endings are completly different. When you read this book, the ending will surprise and shock you. This is a book that you might want to read again. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mystery-style horror. If you enjoy this book, also try to read some others by R.L. Stine.

It is particularly nice to hear some more of his songs. (Buy \\"Meaningless\\" if you get a chance.) Though he sounds nothing like him, Jon Brion is quickly becoming his generation's Henry Mancini with his ability to expertly score films and also write top quality pop songs. Like his recent score for \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" the instrumental pieces on this album are expert miniatures that say a lot without taking much time to do so. Anyone who has heard Jon Brion's early demos from the pre-Aimee Mann days (I first heard them in 1990!) will recognize this approach as something he's been developing for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soundtrack that appropriatel reflects the movie","review":"I like both the movie and the sountrack! Jon Brion is a genius who has produced artists with unique sounds. This album has definitely got different melodies to it.I somehow prefer the instrumental ones rather than Brion's own vocals (except \\"Knock Yourself Out\\"; I'm really hooked to that song). The instrumental ones really reflect on what the movie is about; quite whimsical that is happy but also mind-boggling at the same time.I highly recommend this CD...you can just listen to it as one of those background musics when you're working or driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift","review":"Bought this book as a gift for my daughter and she seems to think it was a great read.

This CD plays a lot of the bass part of song and you have to know and create the melody to harmonize along to the music. I knew some of the chorus melodies but not all of the verses to the song---therefore, I was quite disappointed, especially since there is not a vocal strain of the songs to LEARN the melody to the song verses.

It has been my favorite form of food preparation, especially in the summer when I don't want any extra heat produced in the house. The food is wonderfully moist without brining which is especially important in our household now. I can't praise this product enough. And this praise is from a skeptic.

I'm so thrilled that it was reissued on CD. That said... The \\"Knight's Page\\" & \\"Postcards from Italy\\" with Abraham & Cumming are treats for the ear. Very pleasant surprises indeed.

I believe this is a perfect read for a lazy summer afternoon when you do not have to be attentive to every word and are relaxed and forgiving in criticism. Having your own toes in the sand may bring you deeper into the story.Because a potential shipwreck in a shifting sand dune (all clumsy metaphors aside) along with a mid 20th-century murder mystery makes for a great escape. Especially when that shipwreck may rewrite history. The tangle of unrequited love is just that and it does strain the reader to care. However, I enjoyed the overall plot and benefited from parts of the history - both Portuguese exploration and Australian commitments in WW2. And like I say, a solid beach read made even better if you sip a couple of gin and tonics along with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"just bad...","review":"I don't know what's up with the state (or politics) of Australian letters that a book this bad would receive such critical acclaim, but there must be some serious mojo afoot somewhere. Like others, I was waiting to be bowled over. The premise certainly seemed interesting. But nothing here is quite right and most of it is just god-awful. The historical backdrop is confusing and largely unnecessary filler, the twinned relational plotlines are right out of soap opera, the language is portentous when it isn't simply purple- and, then, there are all those homilies- you know, the ones about love and the sands of time drifting thru the hourglass of life, etcetc. It's hard for me to imagine a reader actually consenting to this effort, but there you go. Say \\"pass\\" and save yourself some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read.","review":"I read the reviews on the book's back cover and expected greatness.

It was truly disppointing.The plot is predictable, and the lack of proper quotation punctuation makes it difficult to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"The characters seemed shallow, without depth given to some of their pasts. The plot droned on and on...with me pursuing only to find the ending, which was disappointing. The lack of quotation punctuation was annoying. It felt like a cheap show with gratuitous sex thrown in for appeal. If you like historic mystery try: City of Light instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less a mystery than a soap opera","review":"Billed as a mystery-within-a-mystery, this book has a moderately interesting historical premise with some tantalizing bits from relatively ancient sources. The angst of academics pursuing a probably hopeless cause is overdone, I think. The unraveling of that tale is way too slow, little suspense actually builds, and the ending is a disappointment. The soap opera within a soap opera love story(-ies) just seemed pointless, a lame attempt at titillation, with an ambigous resolution. The gratuitous four-letter words were an annoyance."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL SELECTION SUNG WITH DEVOTION AND HUMBLENESS","review":"That's what I can say about this album sung by the magnificent Emma Kirkby.This music points out why Germany gave us Bach, Handel, Telemann and so many other minors (but beautiful) composers who came after Schütz and Buxtehude.Buxtehude's music is sublime. My beloved cantatas here are \\"Herr, wenn ich nur dich hab\\" and \\"O fröhliche Stunde\\", but the whole selection is well worth the price.The only flaw, once more, has to do with the label, that doesn't provide us with translations, although make them available online.

It includes many bible passages, some clearly printed in the textbook, but many more that you must look up on your own. It becomes a little frustrating to have to continually put the book down to locate 5 or 6 bible verses just to complete one exercise. But what really frustated me was several 'fill in the blank' bible verses where the reader is instructed to look up a particular verse in their own bible and fill in the blanks with the missing words -- the author doesn't state which version he has pulled the quote from -- I looked up 6 different versions of 2Corinthians 5:16-21, and never found the one the author used, in fact never even found one similar enough to be able to complete the exercise! I guess that God is still working on the fruits of the spirit, namely patience, in my life! This is the only thing that detracts from this study. Otherwise, it's truly wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"Experiencing the Heart of Jesus by Max Lucado is an excellent book for anyone who is interested in growing in their knowledge of Christ.

Yes, it provides you with a broad overview of the history of Christianity, but it is scattered and badly organized.

It needs editing for consistency and to clarify run-on sentences and poorly illuminated points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange sense of 'global'","review":"Apparently, the 'global' aspect of this book means the spread of Western Christianity to Africa and Asia in the modern era.

The acting was even worse. I was going to show it to my students, but I can't show them that performance. It was pathetic. Also, there is no closed captioning. If you were thinking about getting this version, I highly recommend that you think again."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing and unbelievable","review":"This production is so bad that no words could do justice in describing it. You would have to be godlike and have a masochistic streak a mile long to get through the entire production."},{"rating":"2","title":"toy battery","review":"battery works fine - only problem one of two ordered arrived damaged. no one answers phone or calls back. one arrived crushed...no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Though this book is not specifically about boxing, per se, it somehow manages to be one of the most incredibly vivid and visceral descriptions of the sport I've ever read. I have been a huge fan of boxing since I was a child and continue to enjoy it to this day, but I will never watch it the same way again. What really makes this book compelling, however, are the emotions and experiences Picket has outside of the ring. For most, it's very easy to forget the combatants are human beings; this gripping memoir doesn't allow you to."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the Point?","review":"What an angry person. The book is a list of complaints, how everybody wants to humiliate her or hurt her. I was a golden gloves finalist and I train at the same gym that Lynn Snowden was at. Also my dad was a boxer. She makes the gym sound like a bad place and she thinks boxing is all evil intentions. No. Boxers work hard. They dont hit on her and no guy is punching hard when he spar a beginner, man or woman. Also why is she the only female at the gym? I read this because it is boxing, but she has nothing new or interesting to say about boxing, she only say how she hates it. So why write a book about something you hate? It is easy to pick on boxing because from the outside it can look bad. But this woman never got on the inside. You can tell from how she talks about it she know nothing about boxing at all. Write about what you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Brutal, and Fun!","review":"What I love about this book is Ms. Snowden Picket's ability to verbalize in such vivid detail her experiences inside the ring. It's always so disappointing to listen to boxers talk about the sport as they seem uwilling or unable to give any kind of visceral description of what fighting is like for them. What's fascinating is that Ms. Snowden Picket comes to their defense in describing why professional fighters cannot afford to reflect on their experiences honestly if they want to keep winning. The necessity for Mike Tyson to have a hypnotist is one of many examples Snowden Picket uses to illustrate this point. What also makes this book so engrossing is that it is not \\"just a boxing book\\", but rather, one woman's experience in an indisputably male dominated world that dramatically changed her. Beyond putting us in her gloves, she also puts the reader squarely in her life. I'm looking forward to her next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snowden punches beast in its belly","review":"Having been seduced by the sweaty glamor of boxing in the abstract (as a spectator) and then experienced the pain and humiliation of real boxing as an amateur, I can identify strongly with Snowden's experience - I just couldn't have described it so engagingly. As a male reader, something about Snowden's motivation seemed elusive at first but by the last page, I'd made as much of a transgendered leap of comprehension as is likely without surgery.My girlfriend loaned this to me but I'm not sure I'm going to give it back. Explaining a black eye and a broken nose at the office just isn't quite as easy as it used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITLEY A GREAT ALBUM!!!","review":"This cd by Sixx A.M. is an amazing album. It is very profound, and beautifully made. Sixx is a genius and James vox are definetlay killer. Dj Ashba brings great riffs to this instant classic rock album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite band","review":"The whole cd is perfect! Not one bad song.Burning a cd from a real mainstream band doesn't feel so bad.But this band isn't a big mainstream band that is played on MTV all the time,etc..So paying for the music is worth it.I don't have a fave song.They are all good.The book is the best book I ever read! The whole band is hot,which is very cool.The production was insanely phenomenal! Very tight arrangements.Theatrical,creative,very unique sound,passinate,dreamy.Lyrics from the heart.Still wish Nikki would allow private messages on his MySpace page since I don't want to share my most personal review to the world on his comment page.But this cd touched my heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe a few more listens will help","review":"First..LOVE THE BOOK!! Bought it and the cd the first day available.I was hoping the cd would be Nikki reading from the book.Those clips are great.But so far, I just dont like the cd.And its not because its not like Motley Crue.Its the singers voice.To me..just bland and very generic rock over dramatic singing.Lots of breathing..reminds me of Trey and Matt of South Park when they sing metal. To each thier own. I will give it a few more spins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroin Diaries","review":"Amazing, that's all that needs to be said about this soundtrack. If anyone has ever been a Nikki Sixx fan you will enjoy the music, great work, great sound, just amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has musical potential, but is lyrically cheesy","review":"The album has potential musically, but man, the lyrics awful and I can't get past them. It's fine when music has an explicit story and message, but it could be conveyed in a much more interesting way. The lyrics here are like the daily news, but good music is more poetic. The Amazon review seems harsh, but dead-on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Piece of Work. Get It Now!!!","review":"I bought the Heroin Diaries soundtrack last night and I listened to the whole CD twice. There was maybe only 1 or 2 songs that I didn't care for, but this is definitely a candidate for rock album of the year. The state of Rock is in trouble but Nikki Sixx, DJ Ashbah, and James Michael have offered up some resurrection. No, it's not Shout At the Devil or Dr. Feelgood, but I think the Motley fans will much enjoy and appreciate this project. The only thing I would say is that I was expecting a few more heavier tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Crue, It's Sixx AM","review":"The editorial review was rather harsh on this release. This is NOT Motle Crue. This is Nikki Sixx's current project. I think the reviewer forgot that. The customer reviews have been far more telling of the quality of the music.The songs are powerful and thoughtful. The lyrics have a way of sticking in your head, and the music has way of making you turn up the volume. And Sixx's voice has a powerful resonating quality that I could listen to all day, and sometimes I have.I would suggest it to any one, not just Crue fans. It's just good rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great solo guitars","review":"I chose this cd 'cause i'm a big fan of DJ and i like this kind of music. The songs are great, DJ's solos are just crazy and i like James's voice. I'm recommending it to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drive and melody","review":"This is the kind of music that is hard to ignore. Sometimes aggressive, sometimes passionate, or both. A great find for anybody who likes the tougher side of rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroin Diaries","review":"this is another great CD from Sixx A.M i love these guys product was in brand new condition and really goes well with the book . over all great experience =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"i cant believe people like this cd! about 3 tracks are good","review":"3 maybe 4 tracks are good, if you liked life is beatiful thats about the only song that sounds like that, most of the songs are slow and whining. dont buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it just for Life is Beautiful","review":"Okay so I know I will get bashed but someone has to say it - this is not a \\"great concept/story CD\\". Now I love the Crue and Sixx just as much as the next gal but come on. If I wanted a spoken word CD I would look up Henry Rollins. This CD has only one viable song to listen to on it's own. Sikki seems to be trying to repeat the works of Queensryche, Rush (2112) or even Savatage with this storyline CD. But unlike the former bands, the only song to stand on it's own is LIB. Sadly I see this talented band being left in the dust when Sixx returns to Crue. I may be a fan of old but this CD is not worth full price. If you are looking to find more awesome tracks like Life is Beautiful - then just download it. I wish I was warned prior to shelling out hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, moving, enjoyable, addictive!","review":"Obviously the Amazon reviewer was hoping for a new MOTLEY CRUE disk.It's not and that's a good thing.The irony of The Heroin Diaries is the fact that it is about addiction and I am now addicted to the disk! Looking forward to the book.Great work, great story, something different (record labels be damned), must listen. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody Gets High, Everybody Gets Low","review":"3 Cheers to Nikki Sixx for doing something outside of the box again! Nikki comes out of his closet with his skeletons and demons and shares an obviously devasting time in his life. Heroin Diaries Soundtrack is an inspirational and very gutsy work of art. It was written from the heart with no stereotypes or intentions of airplay. Kudos to Sixx for 1) Just sharing his life with his fans -- even the dark corners of it. 2) For his work with Running Wild in the Night giving hope to homeless kids. 3) For doing things that other rockstars don't -- Get Real & Be Honest!"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],O={key:0},M={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-97c78f08"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/38.md","filePath":"sponsor/38.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/38.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
