In my area there are no Krav Maga training centers, and so I rely on this great video series before and after my training sessions to keep perfecting my kicks and punches. Because so much of Krav Maga is designed to be instinctive, I can usually tell when my combatives are off, and reviewing the relevant method in this DVD series really helps me work through the flaws in my defenses and keep me on track. I am looking forward to more DVD training from David Kahn, as his teaching method is no-nonsense and concise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krav Maga straightforward: excellent footage","review":"Having read David Kahn's books on Krav Maga I was happy to learn that he would finally be releasing this DVD set covering the essential techniques. And it's just what I have been missing. In addition to the illustrations in the books I find it extremely helpful to be able to follow the full range of motion, especially for the more complex compound techniques like control holds, takedowns and groundwork. David is very clear in his instructions and the techniques are shown from different angles which makes it easy to understand how to position yourself and carry them out correctly. Great and comprehensive footage which rotates heavily in my DVD player as I am on my way to becoming a true Kravist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Simply fantastic. If a picture is worth a thousand words, these dvds are worth millions. Davy teaches Krav Maga with an easy to understand finesse rarely seen in any video on any topic. If you are a student of Krav Maga, these dvds are a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthusiast in Training","review":"I have had the opportunity to spend Monday afternoons with friends breaking down these techniques and putting them into practice. none of us have official training to date (I plan to in the near future) and yet we had very little trouble putting many of these techniques into practice. we struggled in some areas to pick up on certain martial applications, but this is more due to our limited experience and lack of an instructor. many techniques such as bear hug escapes and elbow/knee strikes were very easy to pick up on. This video will not only give you excellent breakdowns of simple and practical self defense methods, it will help you to think like a kravist as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"This is a great set of DVDs. I won't go into reviewing all the discs, etc. but will agree with one other reviewer that this is not a hold your hand instructional series. It is NOT a replacement for having a good instructor. A background in any other martial art is extremely helpful. I have been doing martial arts for a long time, not Krav, and have picked up many items that have made my skills better. BTW, it is recommended that you get the books that complement this series. Both books havs a lot of good material that can be read and digested at a slower pace.Lastly, I have to say the price is EXCELLENT value. There is tons of information that makes it well worth it.Have Fun, be safe,Brad BainSelf Defense Instructor: FusionMBS Martial Arts and Fitness"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"David is a world authority on Krav Maga (the Chief Instructor for the U.S), and is a direct link to true Israeli Krav Maga, as taught by Grandmaster Haim Gidon.Mr.Kahn's DVD is simply excellent. It covers a massive amount of Krav Maga material in a succint, practical and easy to follow fashion.Having spoken to David directly, I can say that he is not only professional and dedicated, but also kind and generous. This reviewer was looking to train through someone with a good heart, and David has just that. You can be assured of being in good, capable hands when you train through this DVD.I cannot recommend this DVD enough - buy it, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD, it is GREAT!!!","review":"I just love Alan's new CD What I do. There isn't a bad song on it. I put it in the CD player the day I got it and it's still in there. I Listen to it over and over, I can't get enough of it. One of my favorites is the talking song repair blues, it always puts a smile on my face. And Monday morning Church, I love that one too. Rainy Day in June. Well, I just love them all!!!!Keep the music coming Alan, We love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, I love Alan Jackson!!!!","review":"I never was a big fan of Alan Jackson until this cd. I always thought that he was playing to the radio stations and pop country listeners before. This cd has changed my mind. My favorite song is \\"Monday Morning Church\\". The first time I listened to this cd, I repeated this song more than a dozen times. I could not believe how good of a song that it was. It brought tears to my eyes then and still does today. Whe a song does that...that's country!!! I could tell you all why I love this cd so much by reiewing every song, but I won't. What I will do is tell you that if you don't absolutely love this latest installment by Mr. Jackson you are not a country music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere Near The Quality Of Drive Or High Mileage","review":"Who wrote the songs on this one? Weird Al Yankovick? \\"If French Fries Were Fat Free?\\"? \\"U.S.A. Today\\"? Really? Maybe he's been spending too much time drinking with Mr. Buffet and this is having a negative impact on his song-writing.My advice to people is to hear this album first before you go out and spend money on it. If you don't have Jackson's \\"Drive\\" or \\"High Mileage\\", get these albums first. \\"Under The Influence\\" is a good album worth buying if you like really traditional country.This one merits 2 stars for the pretty good track \\"To Do What I Do\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No Alan stop fooling yourself","review":"Ever since I saw Alan in the owners box at a NFL game drinking wine and wearing a suit, I knew this was all just an act.This album is so sickly it doesnt deserve to be released. After working his (...)off on Drive, he seems to have decided well I can just about sing about any old rubbish and people will like it. Well the songs could of been written by a amateur, his voice is alright as awful but the slection that he has picked is terrible, save your money and buy hie early stuff instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disingenuous at Best","review":"How could anyone believe that Alan is the most honest country artist ever ? That title would surely have to go to Hank Sr. That aside, the music that is offered on this record comes across as canned and mass manufactured. It is no secret that the blue jean wearing \\"common man\\" has long given over songwriting for singing what comes out of Nashville's songwriting factory. The truth may be hard to face, but Alan is just a singer, employed by a corporate record label, and he follows the orders of his producer so that he can make the money while it is still there. Only songs like \\"Remember When\\" will last for future airplay, and there are none like that on this record. Good Luck in the future Alan, but remember to sing songs that will last, not mass produced hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"It must be an Imposter","review":"Chris Gaines is better than this Eminem is better than this. I am insulted that Alan would do this to his fans. Does he think that little of us that he can do an album of drivel. Sorry Alan I know in the crazy crossover world you do sing country, but this anit good country, its wuzzy country, its some 80 year old radio manager will like it because its got some fiddle in it country. There are albums that defined artist's career for good or bad, this is your worst effort please go back and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks.","review":"Really. I couldn't party to this album very well. Not much of a beat. Kinda sounded like a Truck commercial or something.Party."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What I Do\\" is definitely worth your $20!","review":"Although I wouldn't rate \\"What I Do\\" as the best album I've ever purchased, it's definitely a solid outing for the king of traditional country music. \\"Rainy Day In June\\" and \\"Monday Morning Church\\" are a couple of great slow songs, and Alan kicks it up a bit with \\"If French Fries Were Fat\\" and \\"You Don't Have To Paint Me A Picture\\". My personal favourite is \\"To Do What I Do\\"; it's just a nice little song. Anyway, I think this is a great album to keep in your collection to listen to once in awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album not worthy of his great career","review":"Its been a great couple of years for Alan Jackson, Drive was Brillant, he was nominated for many CMa's and he had a smah duet with Jimmy Buffett.So when his new album was released, I was thrilled, that feeling didn't last to long. There is more to music than just walking into a studio and singing there should be a process, it seems he did no work at all into this album.If your a fan, maybe try some of his early stuff, because this is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"French fries even fat ones are better than this.","review":"Alan Jackson, you are Alan Jackson not Cletus Judd. I have never heard in my life songs that are so simply written and yes in the past thats been your strongest point.But there is a limit, just because your voice sounds amazing as it always doesnt mean you can sing any old thing, you still must have the material to back it up.Ive read other reviews, and it appears most people are thinking the same, your voice deserves better.With this album s Alan has the usual upbeat songs, the sentimental songs and the fun loving country songs we have come to know and love.It appears though, hes resting on his name, because its the lyrics that let this album down, its no use saying in every interview, well Im a simple singer of simple songs and still expect to sell, it may be a great marketing ploy and a image but it sure doesnt add up to a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new from Mr Jackson","review":"Well after Drive, I really thought Alan was going try things on this album. Instead it seems he has put on effort what soever with this attempt. The critics normally love his music, in his own words, hes just a simple singer of simple songs.Well Im sorry Alan that just doesnt cut it. If French Fries were fat free is embrassing, if a Garth Brooks or a George Strait did a song like that, well all the critics will be up in arms.Its okay to sing old style country Strait, Jones do it perfectly, but just to do an album for the sake of doing an album is pure wrong.A very poor effort from an artist that should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Effort","review":"To go from Drive to this effort its amazing. Im not sure if he was under all that much pressure from his label, he just seems to bored with this album.The songs flow nicely just like any good produced album, his voice is always good, what you expect from Mr Jackson, but the song choice is bad, and his writing has gone down hill.I wish I could say there is a single or two to save this album, but there isnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alan called this one in","review":"I have a hard time finding the next single from this CD. Even the current single (Too Much of a Good Thing) is not that strong. I had this CD in my car player for a few days and it hasn't grown on me at all.Alan has shown that he can do much better. Most of the songs here are slow, only one or two up-tempo, and mostly, not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Drive To This","review":"Alan Jackson is the type of the singer, that relies on his fanbase to support everything he does. He has a beautiful singing style and writes songs that fit perfectly for the country crowd. For Alan though this album has no substance, the songs have a typical AJ feel to them and I am sure the pure country crowd will love it, but after 2002's Drive I expected more, hes gone back into the typical mid 90s attitude of well Im not pop country so I must be good. If French fries were fat free has to be the most embrassing song of his career. Please save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad sad sad day for Alan Jackson","review":"This cant be Alan's new album, he wouldnt do an album of such crap, this is not the same work from someone who did Drive, he has gone too far downhill. I have to beg to ask, has he jumped the shark?I hope he doesnt release USA Today because that will kill his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the real MrJackson","review":"Its album like this that gives country a bad name, from the patheic Monday morning church to the embrassing, USA Today to the worst song ever If french fried were fat free, I am sad to be a country fan, when an artist of Alan Jackson's status does an album as poor as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alan Jackson's What I Do cd","review":"This album is nice if you are wanting to listen to something light and slow and if you don't mind feeling like you've already heard this stuff before. Most of the songs sound the same and this is typical Alan Jackson stuff. I didn't feel like I was listening to anything new. There's very little fast tracks on this cd which was a disappointment. Alan has pened some great fast songs. I was looking to hear something that would stand out but never found it. Don't waste your money on a new cd, borrow someone else's if you are still curious to hear the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped for better","review":"When you read the positive reviews for this album its like reading a readers digest story or a press release.It seems the reviwer actually didnt listen to the album and thought, \\"Ah Alan Jackson the famous country singer he just plays his guitar and sings his songs, music the way it should be\\" Well no music shouldn't be like this.Music shouldn't be putting in no effort at all, and resting on the good work you did with a previous album. Every song on this album sounds like, some PR guy said, \\"We have to sell albums to a more country crowd\\" The worst song of all has to be \\"If French fries were fat free\\" no song coming out of Nashville has been this bad, ever. Please Alan dont insult us with this, your better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One or two good songs","review":"Whenever I buy an album and do a review I think to myself how many good songs are on this album, if its half a dozen then its five stars, if its three or four then its three stars, if its only a couple then well its only one star.The thing is, not only will there be no hits from this album, it also contains his first song ever, \\"USA TODAY\\" are any other country fans tried of the same old songs from Mr Jackson, its seems hes just counting the money at this stage of his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Music!","review":"Gladys Knight&The Pips Get Right on this Very Essential Set.Midnight Train to Georgia alone is a Classic Song that is Timeless.Gladys SIngs with So Much EMotion&Soul You feel the Meaning of the song Loud&Clear.On&On Bumps too this day as well.This is What's Missing Now in Contempary Music Real Talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"I heard her on Pandora, and her style is really nice.

Courtenay's antisemitic subtext is so blatant that I, a non-Jew, was completely appalled by the text.

The subsequent tour, from which this album was recorded, was something altogether better. The songs are looser than on Sting's first record, but the playing is still tight and there is an extra energy in all of the songs. For me the highlight is the late Kenny Kirkland's keyboard solo in \`When the World is running down...' his playing leaves me in awe.I like Sting's more recent live release \`All this time', but that is no where near as good as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential","review":"For years now, this set has been among my favorites.

The outcome is usually really great album, which is far better to listen to than any studio album. Live performance has something in it. Sting has excellent sense for music and performing. He is a great singer, plays good bass (although not on all of those tracks, I believe) and he gathered together real pros, that sound even better. They brought on the night, which leaves no mixed emotions behind. Sting has played many years with The Police and alone and has developed his unique style, which is clearly displayed in his work.

It goes through the main character's life, different songs reflecting different times in a person's life and the growth and reflection that comes with maturity. Some songs on this album set me to tears, while others left me feeling empowered and ready to shake things up. Though the music is indeed stunning and is what first caught my attention, it is the lyrics that truly grabbed ahold of me and wouldn't let go. It is then not surprising that the album's one instrumental track is my least favorite. My favorite songs, \\"Soul Cages\\", \\"Jeremiah Blues, Part 1\\", and \\"All This Time\\" are remeniscent of T.S.

Both the music and the tone of the album are scaled down from anything else he has ever done. And you are just faced with his dispair and anger. I always thought that the grammy that 10 Summoners Tales received a year after this one was to make up for the mistake of overlooking this one, because it is apex in this man's career, including some of the fabulous stuff he did with the Police and even his latest album. I wish more people knew about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love to listen to track number 6 and also love to play it","review":"This CD will be a classic. It is great and I love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting was the Police!","review":"Sting makes his strongest solo effort on this album as he expresses his consistent despair about a world persistent on crushing the individual. Sting returns to consistent Police concerns about dark oppressors bent on erasing the human spirit, but gives them urgency by introducing more autobiographical elements than we've seen from him before. This is a man clearly searching for resolution amidst his personal demons. As with all the best Police material, \\"Island of Lost Souls\\" reminds us that we are imprisoned souls, caught in the machinery of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copeful Music For The Soul","review":"Sting is one of the most dynamic and personal songwriters I have ever heard. The Soul Cages displays some sorrowful tunes from a upbeat fashion, to praying lights in the sky. I found this album to be very soothing and relaxing from all the stress in the world. Stress that came from WTC, Columbine, and all other high anxiety levels of life around us. The songs deal with mourning and acceptance with loss. If anybody has lost an loved one from tragedy, this record heals all wounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"the lesser talent of the Police goes overboard","review":"That's right--Sting IS the lesser talent from the Police. If you don't believe it, check out Summers's World Gone Strange or anything by Copeland, and compare it to Soul Cages. Sting is so overrated it's ridiculuous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Test of Time","review":"Re-ripping all my old CDs... This is one that didn't stand the test of time. Gushing reviewers and rich tapestry of music aside, I can't remember for the life of me why I bought this album--one for the revolving filing cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this CD everywhere?","review":"If Sting has ever written a more thoughtfull CD I am not aware of it, and I am a huge fan. Inspired by the death of his father,these meditations are among his best writing and the music is equally inspired. When you put the CD in you will get lost and not emerge untill the CD is over. It is that compelling. This is a must have for any fan of Sting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Sting's Best","review":"_The Soul Cages_ can almost be considered the \\"lost\\" Sting album. His least commercially successful, it only yielded one \\"hit\\" (\\"All This Time\\") and its depressing nature seemed to cause a lot of his fans to look elsewhere...album is divided between slow, moody, atmospheric pieces like \\"The Wild Sea\\" and \\"When the Angels Fall\\" and the brooding rock of \\"Jeremiah Blues\\" and the title track. \\"Jeremiah Blues\\" is excellent - restrained funk with an outro that rocks harder than most of Sting's other solo production...There really are no bad songs on the album ...this is an album that rewards the listener more and more with each listen.If you like the serious side of Sting and hate the more commercial songs he has been penning since the mid 90s, _The Soul Cages_ would be a good album to pick up. If the serious side of Sting turns you off, you may not be able to get into this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting's Best","review":"I'm always amazed at the number of people who confess to liking Sting but never heard this album. As highly as I think of his newest cd this one still is the top of the heap. It's obvious that he was dealing with some very painful issues in these songs and the angst and emotion really shine through in his vocals and lyrics. The depth of the sound is fabulous and the song structures, arrangements and instrumentation are incomparable to anything before or since. It's almost as if he knew if he didn't get these songs out of his system he'd never be able to move on to lighter and more varied fare. His voice on \\"Soul Cages\\" is unforgettable in its menace. \\"Mad about You\\" is as tight a track as he's ever recorded and \\"Why should I cry\\" is an absolute lyrical epiphany. You can't hear it and not be moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unforgettable Sea Voyage","review":"Undoubtedly Sting's best album. \\"Soul Cages\\" showcases Sting's talent as an exceptional musician and superb songwriter. At times, it's unclear where his songwriting ends and sublime poetry begins. His nine songs sail smoothly in synch as one seacape theme. Backing musicians are at their best with excellent percussion and sound. Sting sets a high standard for meaningful pop music. High points: \\"All This Time\\" (a jumpy tune and only calm on a meloncholy landscape), \\"Why Should I Cry For You,\\" \\"The Wild Wild Sea,\\" and \\"When The Angels Fall.\\" A beautiful album that makes me long for the sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best!","review":"It is the essence of the English singer and composer, if you want to listen to the real bases of Sting. It was the first work I heard from him, and I can tell you it impressed me so much that I became an immediate fan of his music. It is a very good buy! In two words, ¡FIVE STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I'm not sure whether this is my favorite Sting CD or \\"Ten Summoners...\\". The intro to \\"Island of Souls\\" is lonely and haunting. This song is almost hypnotic and sets the mood for the rest of the CD. \\"All This Time\\" is just a really great song. Even though it is about the death of Sting's father it is such an upbeat and catchy song, I'm sure it must have been a therapeutic song for Sting. My favorite song on here is \\"Mad About You\\". The lyrics to this song are great. I don't know how to classify this CD because it is so eclectic. It's not really pop and not really rock although the title track has a hard-edge to it. I love the sea theme this CD has and I find it really relaxing to listen to this outside on summer nights while downing some cold brews. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old school","review":"The docking station works quite well. Synching was no problem.

Go to Costco (or other fine retailer) and get KIRKLAND Signature Professional Glossy Inkjet Photo Paper. 125 sheets of 69 lb. 8-1/2 x 11 for only about $19.00. That's just over 15 cents per sheet!

We're moving out in a few months and want to keep as much of our security deposit as possible. We got a puppy while living here who is gated in the kitchen while we're gone. She's messy of course and spent many, many months pooping all over the floor. As much as I would mop, the floor always looked dirty because of the discolored grout. You could see the dramatic difference when you looked at grout in a spot that wasn't traveled over. Anyway, this product did exactly what it said it would do and it didn't require lots of back-breaking labor. I used an old toothbrush to scrub the grout. It also smells pleasant - not like harsh chemicals. I tested a spot and want to do the whole kitchen floor. A+!

What does is too simplistic to really be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another shelfspacer","review":"I'm not sure what the goal with this book was, but it fails to deliver on anything positive. First, the coverage of the language as a whole is really weak. Whole subjects are completely glossed over. Moreover, if you're an advanced coder, you won't find anything you don't already know in this book. it's really for begginner's only, but as I've said, the beginner type coverage is really lacking. Worse yet, many of the examples are incomplete, tediously long (useless comments abound), and impractical.

It took me 2 seconds to figure that out. If you try putting in the day first and it's the 20th, it won't work because there are only 12 months. That problem solved. The only problem I have is that it will not take bills. I tried a bunch of dollar bills thinking maybe they're too wrinkly or something but nothing worked. Also the way they said to set it up to put the bills in, was backwards. I don't remember now but it said to push a selection that wasn't even available on the screen.

So, anytime we pushed the button in, we had to put a key its opening to pop it back out. Also, the bank does not recognize $2 bills.

Also when I would withdraw or depsoit, my account balance wouldn't subtract or add correctly so if I had $10.50 the account balance might say 50. Don't buy this Atm machine. You don't know what you might find. By daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"What a piece of junk! This was such a disappointment. My son was so excited. He went and grabbed his piggy bank but the first coin we deposited didn't registed and then the door would not open. We are returning it today and won't purchase another.

Shop for a new bank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great savings bank","review":"This is a great savings bank. It allows the child to set goals and watch their savings grow. The only drawback is that the bank does not recognize the paper money. You must input the value of the deposit bill by bill. The coin slot sometimes misread the coin value if too much pressure is put on the smaller coins. All in all this is a great toy for children to learn about saving money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bank!","review":"We were really impressed with the speed of shipping the product to us. We procrastinated until the last week before Christmas and did not expect to see the bank until after the holidays especially since we only choose basic delivery. So when the bank showed up 2 days before we were really happy. The bank was a big hit with our daughter. It does everything we expected and will help in keeping track of her savings. It teaches a child the value of keeping up with the ATM card to gain access to the bank and how to make deposits, withdrawels, and checking the balance. It will take some work to keep up with your money because you have to keep track of your withdrawels and deposits. My daughter loves it.

He is learning how to count money and I thought this would be a good learning tool for him and a way to save while learning.

Looking at the product it should be a lot of fun and educational at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to pass the exam","review":"I share all the opinions above. Though the book is rather thin, the content is a real treasure. It covers all one needs not only to pass the NetEss exam but also to get a real knowledge of the subject.

Favorite songs include \\"Without Your Love\\", \\"White City Lights\\", \\"Free Me\\" \\"Just a Dream Away\\" and \\"McVicar\\".

Unfortunately, Radish's complete inability to create likable characters, believable scenarios, and engaging dialogue left me shaking my head and wondering why I didn't just put the book down and find something more pleasurable to do. I could have been paying bills or scrubbing toilets, either of which would have been a far better--and more enjoyable--use of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a flop","review":"This was such a disappointment. It read like a Lifetime movie of the week, only not even as good. The premise of a group of middle-aged women spontaneously leaving home and walking had promise, but the characters were never developed well. It fell into a \\"poor me\\" sympathy-fest, where all men are inconsiderate dolts, and only women can \\"understand\\" anything important or meaningful. I also felt like the author was trying to push lesbianism as the solution to all their problems.Don't waste your money or your time, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Not so elegant gathering of stereotypes","review":"Am I the only reader who thought these women were the most annoying, whining self-centered cariactures (not characters)? I kept waiting for an inciting incident, a conflict that would build plot step by plot step to a climax or turning point. Not so. These are like pages from a writer's sketchbook of ideas rather than a novel with rising and falling action. Radish may be a very good journalist and travel writer--no doubt she can use language well--but in this attempt at fiction, I believe she has failed. Instead of focusing on the eight women, she veers off to incorporate phony news articles and side stories of women who hear about the walkers through the media and suddenly change their lives radically. A novelist's challenge is to create a world where the reader can suspend disbelief or at least care about what happens to the characters. I never got to that place."},{"rating":"1","title":"This gathering goes on too long","review":"I was disappointed in the \\"Elegant Gathering of White Snows\\". The premise of eight women sharing a deep and meaningful friendship seemed initially very promising, but the book read more like a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie. The writing is very cliched and choppy. None of the characters seemed especially sympathetic, even though they had suffered loss and loneliness, because they had all spent years wallowing in self-pity and inertia.The idea that the entire country would be enthralled by these women's \\"walk\\" was pretty far-fetched to me as well. And the author adds nothing to the story by throwing in all the minor characters who are drawn to the walking women. Her time would have been better spent developing the major characters more fully.I lost interest about 3/4 of the way through the book and simply stopped reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"This is one of those books that makes me feel BETRAYED! I found it on a \\"staff recommendation\\" table. I liked the cover, liked the premise, liked that the story took place in Wisconsin . . . It seemed to have all the ingredients for a book I might enjoy. Except for one BIG thing. The writing is awful. I'd like to comment that I didn't have a problem with the large cast of characters and think the author did a fairly good job defining them with brief but telling characteristics in the opening chapter; however, that's the only thing I can praise about the writing. Will someone please tell me how garbage like this not only gets into print, but gets positive reviews, impressive publicity and ends up on a staff recommendation table?Because of this book, I have made a personal vow to no longer buy ANY book before checking the reviews of \\"real\\" readers on Amazon.com. Had I visited this listing first, I would have saved myself eleven bucks. Geez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time! Boring and poorly written","review":"I was hoping for something special--the location was intriguing and all the hype [\\"remarkable journey\\" stuff] regarding its premise snared me... half way through, I decided to check the reviews and found I was not alone. So this one is going to the trash--not worth passing on to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calculated to be an \\"Oprah\\" book","review":"Too bad Oprah dumped her book club, because the author went to a lot of trouble to try to write a book that might have been considered had the execution been better. As it is, this is a slow read about a group of women, most of whom come off as a bunch of self-pitying whiners. Even the name seems to emulate another much more successful book, \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even mentionable","review":"This book became a dread to read. The whole idea of eight woman on miraculous walk is too absurd. There is no way to enjoy the book when it has eight main character and it bounces back and forth to other characters. I also believe that if eight woman started walking, it would not gather national news coverage in only two days. I am barely half way through this book and I can not make myself finish it. I dont really understand how anyone can like this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Women Bonding","review":"Loved this book- really good women bonding- supporting each other and opening up about past trauma- which is really hard to do. Also complaining about a seemingly great life- also hard to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman's book","review":"This book makes you think about what you can do if you put your mind to it and how these women did what they thought was right. The story line moves right along and you feel like you are walking with these women."},{"rating":"1","title":"We aren't saints.","review":"This book was so simplistic that I can hardly believe that the author has the credentials that she does;I actually felt embarassed reading it. The author didn't write about the true complexity of female friendships and instead settled on a stereotypical and shallow portrait in the vein of \\"sisterhood is powerful.\\" I AM a feminist, mind you, and I found this nearly offensive. If seven women actually walked together for several days, we can all imagine just how much bickering, competition, and how many unspoken alliances there would be. Yes, there would be breakthroughs, lots of sharing, laughing, drinking, and swearing, but also lots of conflict because even though women are fabulous, we aren't saints."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elegant Gathering of White Snows","review":"The novel was a book club choice, and that's the only reason I finished reading it. The Elegant Gathering of White Snows possesses no elegance whatsoever and is an embarrassment to women everywhere. It appears that the author thought she was depicting strong women, but the reader is constantly bombarded by immature language and selfishness on a grand scale. I believe that this may be the worst piece of adult fiction that I have ever forced myself to finish reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elegant Gathering of White Snows","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. I will finish the book because it is our book club choice. The characters are shallow and self centered. The writing is middle school quality. Kris Radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water. No poetry and no beauty, I could care less about the women in this book. Who could possibly think life's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine? I treasure my sisters and women friends but I wouldn't want to be a friend to any of these women. I would give it no stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH! So disappointing","review":"I rarely give up on a book but after plodding thru the first third I had to move on to something else. It sounded interesting and I had high hopes when it was chosen for book club but it just had no life to it. I couldn't seem to care about any of the women in the story and that goes against everything this book is supposed to be about. If you must try it, get it from the libary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have changed my rating","review":"I disliked this book so much that I felt I had to write something. In retrospect, my first review was too generous. I gave it two stars on the merit of the idea of the book. Having rethought things, I decided I didn't even like the idea. Picture this story turned around... make it 8 men who get together once a week to gripe and drink too much wine. Then picture these men just up and walking away from their wives and kids... and jobs. Do you think the nation would rise up to salute them? Do you think the sheriff would be praised for sending a cruiser to protect them?! The idea is totally ridiculous. So WHY is it so glorious for these women to do this? Why is their lot so much more painful than a man's? This book simply FELT juvenile, whiny, and pathetic Therefore I decided I had to change my ranking. (I didn't even finish the last two chapters.... I simply couldn't go on"},{"rating":"1","title":"only for those into melodrama","review":"This is not a badly written book, but it is definitely over the top in terms of melodrama. It has that \\"written for the book club\\" feel, and includes just about every terrible and tragic thing that could possibly happen to a woman--yes, there's the abused wife, the rape victim, the wife with the cheating husband, the [...], the tough broad, the depressive etc. etc. Even the supposedly happy characters are so stock--the woman with the incredibly understanding husband, the woman with the blissfully happy marriage. If that's your kind of book, more power to you--you will enjoy it--if it's not, definitely avoid this one at all costs. I cringed through most of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the most unwittingly hilarious and awful book I've ever read","review":"In the history of overwrought, awful, just plain stupid \\"novels,\\" this has to take the cake. It misfires on virtually every level. Beyond purple, the prose is simply inept. Wrong word, image, simile, diction at every turn. The plot is preposterous, the tone treacly with an overlay of sugar. It should come with a warning to diabetics who risk insulin shock from one too many \\"honeys\\" and \\"sweet hearts.\\" That this found a publisher is astonishing. That it didn't find an editor, a small crime. The only solace (I had to read this for my book club)was found in the dramatic readings I did for my husband and son, who literally howled with laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS","review":"I'm 3/4 of the way through this book which I picked up at a Library fundraiser for $2. It was overpriced. I know that I will muddle my way through this, get to the end and think to myself \\"why did I bother\\"? The other reviewers are correct, this is TERRIBLY written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"Do you remember those \\"growth seminars\\" from the 70's and 80's? Shell out some money and in two and a half days, you will learn how to find happiness, success, sexual fulfilment, and piles of money--instant empowerment and the secrets of life in one weekend.I think that same superficiality is the root problem of this inelegant book. We're given snippets of characters' lives, no depth, no deep understanding of any of them; we're given dialogue that shows no wisdom, nor depth of thought or depth of feeling; we're given an absurd plot (women going for a walk and the world halts in wonder); and just as in those seminars, happiness, fulfilment, and new direction and purpose in life comes after a few days of walking away from their lives.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting ideas, but bad writing","review":"I kept notes on my bookmark as I progressed through this book so that I could remember specifically why I disliked it, and report this to my book club which had selected it.

As I read along, I did search for something redeeming. There were definitely some worthwhile ideas here and there. Too bad they were buried and lost in this book.Although I think the author was trying to write a very \\"deep message\\" book, it came off as superficial, trite and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad idea, bad book, bad writing, exploitive - NO STARS","review":"Our reading group chose for this book out of curiousity based on the synopsis. Several of us didn't even bother to finish it. NO ONE liked it. This is the first book we've read in over 4 years that we all universally disliked. There are 8 women in our reading group between the ages of 35 and 70. We determined that the author was exploiting all of the women's issues she could possibly fit into this book (date rape, loss of a child, unwanted pregnancy, lesbianism, depression)just to grab attention to this book. And then she wraps it all up and fixes everything by having these women go on some ridiculous walk for 4 days. I suspect any positive reviews for this book were written by the author herself or her publishers. Do not buy this book. If you want to read some lightweight stuff, read a good mystery or even a romance novel. This is junk. One of the few books I would happily throw in the trash without a second thought!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I had to say something","review":"This is the worst book I have read in recent history. The author needs to take some classes on how to write a readable book; the characters are so poorly presented I felt like I was grading a middle school writing assignment. I would give this effort an \\"F\\". If this is supposed to be empowering to women, I am ashamed to be one. Never have I read a book that made me roll my eyes with each new page of the whining, hollow and self centered characters that I was presented with. If you want empowerment, look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elegant Gathering of White Snows","review":"If you are a lesbian, a manhater, or a voyeur of women's unsolved problems, you may like this book. If not, look elsewhere for a good read.The author insults readers' intelligence with an undeveloped plot, amateurish writing, and redundancy that would make a high school English teacher cringe.So why did I continue reading? I did find the book to have one redeeming value-- it was an excellent remedy for insommnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have to agree with the negative reviews of this book. As one reviewer said, \\"Doesn't she have an editor?\\" Way too many inconsistencies in the details. For example, Mary is a senior in High School in the Spring of 1968. That would make her born in 1950, correct? But in 2002, when the walk is taking place, she looks in the mirror \\"watching myself push toward my 48th year for the 47 years in front of that\\". This is simple math and the kind of detail that drives me nuts. Also, the person that flew into Milwaukee to get to Prairie du Chien. Highly unlikely. The geography doesn't mean anything to someone not from Wisconsin, but if you're going to put it in, have it make sense to those of us that live here. So this is all nit-picky, but the story itself was a drain, and to also agree with another reviewer, seems to take the viewpoint that all of women's problems can be solved by having a lesbian relationship. Okaaaayyyyyy.............Save your time and your money and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Ms. Radish . . . Sorry I paid for this book!","review":"Please save your money and do not purchase this book. It is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read--if I were able to finish the whole thing. I usually end up launching the book across the room when I run into another one of the sappy, superficial, poorly constructed \\"tales of woe.\\" The characters are incomplete, the plot, while interesting enough to draw someone to the book, is about as well constructed as a two year old's house of blocks. I am unwilling to list all the flaws I found--I fear carpal tunnel syndrome. This is a very harsh review and I feel bad for the author, but I feel worse for the editor who let her think this was an example of \\"good\\" writing. I guess they will publish anything. I hope the author made enough money with this book to compensate her for these public criticisms as I would hate to be in her shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fill your spirit!","review":"This book speaks to the hearts of all women. It reminds us of how important and nurturing female friendships can be, and how much we really do need each other in order to grow as individuals. It reminds us that in spite of all of the roles we play, we must remember to check in with our spirits. The women in the story, who embark on this adventure, feel like friends and neighbors. Each morning I awoke to see where they were and what they were learning as they continued on their search for answers and forgiveness. I adored this story, and am hungry for another one like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elegant Gathering of White Snows","review":"It's exaggerated. I found that the story didn't go nowhere.

The descriptiveness alone was so beautiful and the characters developed so that, by the end of the book, you felt you knew each of the women. Their problems, solutions, lives in general, were presented in believable ways and as I said, the descriptions of weather, surroundings, feelings were utterly fascinating. One or two pages describing the \\"whispers around the world\\" gave me chills - what a way to show the influence of one group across the globe.

I predict the remaining pages will dwell on yet another story of a woman feeling sorry for herself for having lived through an unfortunate experience triggered by some male. Blah, Blah, Blah.All adults have lives that are shaped by the actions of other people. Most of us learn from them, grow, and move on. I happen to treasure the relationships I have with my female friends, but would never gain anything from the group in this book. I don't find their friendship convincing at all, in fact the parts of the book that have the women interacting seem to all flat. I think this is just one more male-bashing poorly written novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!!!","review":"From the very beginning of this book I was bored.

Not one of us enjoyed it and half the group couldn't even finish it.The idea for the novel is intriguing, but the author executed it horribly. The characters are flat and difficult to distinguish from one another, and errors in the writing were inexcusable. At one point she wrote something like, \\"she lived alone with four other women.\\" How exactly does that work? Didn't she have an editor? Without better characterization you couldn't appreciate the women's' quest and the prose was so bad it was like listening to fingernails down a chalk board.Pass this one up--it's not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't deliver","review":"This book had promise, but the author did not deliver. I couldn't find sympathy for or even like the characters. The story dragged. But the most off-putting aspect was the writing. Rather than letting the characters convey the story, emotions, etc. Kris Radish TOLD the reader what to think. And the lesbian angle to the book didn't endear me to the book either. I don't recommend this book. And I agree with the other reviewer who commented that this book was tailored to be an Oprah Book club selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing elegant about this","review":"The description on the back cover sounded so good that I couldn't wait to read it. I was turned off right away by a bunch of woman complaining about how badly life and particularly men had treated them. The rest of the book was more of the same - lots of \\"poor me\\" and wallowing in self pity. I did not find any of the characters likeable or endearing even though we were constanly told how wonderful and special they were.I didn't find the writing particularly good and I thought it ridiculous that the whole world would be moved by a bunch of woman abandoning their lives to walk. This is definitely a book to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"NO ONE in my book club liked this book, and we have a variety of readers.

I liked \\"Eternity\\", but Shayne's vampire stuff is awful. The characters continually remind one another that they are vampires. Sample:Vampire 1: \\"Hey it's dark\\"Vampire 2: \\"Don't worry, we are vampires! We can see in the dark!\\"The dialogue continues like this throughout the whole book.Shayne describes the main characer Edge as a bleached blond, thin man with a British accent who looks like Billy Idol. Why didn't she say \\"Hey, it's supposed to be Spike from Buffy, ok?\\"One of the characters becomes pregnant. The baby talks to her in bad colloquial slang while in the womb. It's not supposed to be funny but it's hilarious.I normally wouldn't finish a piece of garbage like this but it was kind of like watching the proverbial car crash. I couldn't believe it was happening and just had to see it through.Save yourself. Don't read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I wasnt expecting this to be so good.I have always liked The Mission,bought most their music.I figured because they dont have a pink floyd budget this would be limited.But this DVD is really well done.It presents the band perfectly.Wayne Hussey is better then ever and I have a feeling some good stuff is on its way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"A waste of money , only a few words and all are the most common and in use if a child signs at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swarovski bracelet","review":"My wife loves it.

Perhaps not every Battletech is up to the same standard, but in 95 % of the cases even those that don't further the core events offer a consistent level of conceptuality. One of the interesting points in the Battletech-universe is that it's sci-fi without aliens, ever ... untill this author (whose other books in other FASA-settings were any good either) tried to cross that line - and delivered a book that may or may not be worth reading (to each his tastes), but should not have been part of this series.

While, as some reviewers have stated, it has relatively decent character development, and has an intriguing premise, it adds very little if anything to the Inner Sphere/Clan Worlds story.As a stand alone it isn't bad, and it does step back and cover a more basic level of human experience in the BattleTech universe. Still, I saw very little that requires this book to be read.

This one is different in that it does not simply regurgitate the standard pat answers to why suffering exists and what to do when it happens (\\"Trials are actually a blessing! They'll make you a better person! Embrace them!\\" -- Give me a break.). Joel Freeman avoids preachy, sanctimonious language and never gets condescending.

I am sure the fan base is a high quality crowd, like the band members, I'm sure they volunteer at the local retirement home, yup. Oh I forgot to mention how the music is, maybe because there is none. I thought I heard a guitar but I'm not sure since all I can seem to hear is a poor recording of what sounds like a large vibrator bumping around in a dresser drawer.

This album has not aged well. Good thing Styx recorded another live CD, one that is more inspired. If you want live Styx, stick with \\"Return To Paradise\\". The band is tighter, better and the song selection (while basically the same as Caught In The Act) contains older hit and 3 new songs. Take note that Caught In The Act is the only chance you'll have to hear John Panozzo live, so this is a must have for a Styx fan, although not as inspired as RTP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Live Music","review":"This is Styx's only live album with all of the 5 classic members of Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw, James Young, Chuck Panozzo, and John Panozzo. It is a very well done 2-disc album. With 7 songs on each disc this is a must have for every hard-core Styx fan. This is better than Return To Paradise and all the other live albums Styx has made with Lawrence Gowan. This was when Styx was at their peak and on the edge of their hiatus from 84 to 90. So seriously buy this album. My personal favorite on this album has to be Blue Collar Man (Long Nights). That song alone is worth the price of admission I mean the price of this album. This is really good music that you won't be able to find on today's music this style of talent + creativity = great music is most definetly gone. So buy this CD because you'll never hear music like this on an album or live ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styx Live has been better.","review":"When this album was released in 1984, I was ecstatic...before I heard it. Styx was my all time favorite band to see live, and still is, because the guitar and vocal harmonies were as fantastic as that achieved in the studio, and Dennis' synth would blare above all signalling that your attention should be focused on stage. I remember when they would sing Lorelei, the harmonies at the end of the song were ALL there. That song, unfortunately, isn't even included on this CD. And it's just as well, because the harmonies don't stack up as well as they could.In fact, some of the vocals are more yelling than singing, such as Tommy's yelling \\"My dog and my friends\\"on \\"Blue Collar Man\\" and some of Dennis' work on \\"Mr. Roboto\\".I think the band picked the wrong show to release live as they are capable of so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styx Live can be so much better.","review":"When I first heard that Styx was coming out with a live album, I was ecstatic. I had been to see Styx live every time they came to town because it was always a fantastic show and the sound was as good as that achieved in the studio. What a disappointment this album is.Styx's harmonies are not as sharp as they can be and their music is not as tight. Every song ends the same (with the exception of Fooling Yourself and Crystal Ball, which show some imagination).The band either got too confident in their abilities and stopped trying or chose the wrong show to record live. I recommend this album only for those who want to complete a collection or who like the live sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styx gets the job done...but that's it!","review":"I am a big fan of Styx, but I have to say that on this live album they simply don't sound any good. No inspiration and no atmosphere. The musicians sounds like they are bored on stage. If I didn't know better I would swear that Dennis is waiting for a call from the hospital where his wife is due to give birth. It sounds as if he just wants to get outta this place (BOC). The only glimpse of a great band comes forward in their performance of \\"Crystal ball\\". Never the less. The \\"Caught in the act\\" album is better than their recent \\"Return to paradise\\". I think that says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read........","review":"I was quite disappointed in this point as I though it was going to go more in depth as to \\"why and how\\" companies are marketing to the masses AND classes. Instead, what I got was a lot of repetition about how each luxury buying group the writer has created chooses to spend their money. This is stated very early on in the book and repeated without any new data several times thoughout, which gets tiresome quickly. There are charts and graphs to back up this same data but even they are repeated multiple times.

The lives and challenges of these women are faithfully described, not only detailing their careers but their personalities as well. These women become more than names mentioned in textbooks, and these accounts of their lives allow them to become inspiring women. The accounts have more science than an average reader would probably like (as a bio major, I loved the detail), but I can guarantee they will find this book interesting all the same. I especially liked the way the author corrected the misconception of Rosalind Franklin as given through Dr. James Watson's account, \\"The Double Helix.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book about women","review":"I have read this book off and on over the past ten years. As an women who has worked in IT for 25 years in a mostly male dominated profession, this is a must read.

I will pass this book to my two girls as they get older, in hopes of inspiring them that they can and should forge ahead no matter what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I purchased Nu-Stock for my Collie who has Demodectic mange. The reviews and the information on the bottle says it should work. Even guarantees it! Guess I should've asked for my money back. I can see how it would work for Sarcoptic mange, but it only makes Demodex worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Get Rid of the Smell!","review":"We purchased this locally as the container claimed it killed mites instantly and was a safe non-toxic cure for all pets & animals. Contents listed were 70% Sulfur and pine oil along with mineral oil. It smelled like Pine Sol when we opened it. That is till we rubbed down some stray pups with it. The sulfur smell is horrible, and is the only thing we can smell for half a mile. And we have seen no improvement in the pups after 5 days even after following treatment recommendations.Update:It took 10 days of treatment for any signs of improvement. During that time this product was transfered to my clothes somehow. The sulfur will stay in your washer and dryer and contaminate everything you wash for weeks or even months. Do not launder any contaminated clothing. It will not come out. Might as well burn the clothing article."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible smelling :-(","review":"I bought this product not knowing how much of a problem it would be after use. I applied the product to my dog and immediately washed my hands afterwords and couldn't get rid of the smell of sulfur (rotten egg smell). My dog jumped on my bed leaving the smell on my sheets and mattress. I had to go out and buy baking soda (arm & hammer) laundry detergent to try and get most of the smell out but ended up throwing my expensive sheets away. This product has been a nightmare!I never write reviews but I hope this helps if your thinking about buying this product/problem..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maed my foster sick","review":"I use the product twice and after the second time my young foster pup developed a horrific cough.

Any mention of occult matters in a book for 2nd-5th graders in WAYYY out of bounds--you can't even lean on the multi-cultural argument. Tarot cards, Ouji boards and reading chicken bones are something (superstitions) our kids shouldn't even be exposed to (and something that was highly unusual in kid's literature just 20 years ago). And the same is true whether your family is Christian, Jewish or Muslim--mentioning the occult and making it part of the plot is just offensive. Because it is a bright, attractive book it IS hard for kids to discern just how wrong it is.My own 8 yo daughter read 2 other Amelia books w/o incident, then got to this one. There won't be anything by Marissa Moss in our household again.

This was it. Most everything else I found on sibling loss was 20 years old or religious. I have given copies to people in their 20s and in their 50s.

He was my best friend and my only sibling. It has been almost three and a half years, and it feels like it was yesterday. I first purchased this book in 2009. After I had read 9 pages, I put the book down and emailed Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, the author. For the first time, SOMEONE understood how I felt! I read this book all the time, just because it's contents comfort me. It is written by someone who knows about loss. I recently purchased a second copy for a dear friend of mine who just lost her sister. By the way, my email to the author? She emailed me back! Beautiful book written by a beautiful person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review Empty Room","review":"This book fills in a lot of empty space in the reporting of sibling loss.

The cover looked funny and entertaining, but all these thoughts were quelled the moment I began to read the book. Nonetheless its sheer stupidity kept me turning the pages.Upon reading this book, I was struck by the ignorance of this author. Not only does this short novel lack any coherent structure, but also is a sour attempt at humor. I can understand that Bush's face looks like a chimp's, but joking about how he has been switched at birth for a \\"hairless chimpanzee\\" is unimaginative and banal. My question is, \\"who cares?\\" If you want to chastise a political leader, why not do so intelligently, citing resources and using facts to back up your claims. Quotes used out of context don't cut it.A very unhappy read. Overall very disappointing and a waste of your time.

Again we see a 'monster' transformed into something other than a blood thirsty demon.

What i would add as a note of caution for family viewers this movie has some very explicit sexual references and one scene at the beginning that would have been better left out. It could been a thoroughly edifying movie, despite some of the dysfunctions involved but unfortunately, because of the R-rated material, it fell short of its potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book when I was first diagnosed.

Both also had some interesting insight and many personal stories of folks dealing with MS. All three books I just hopped around and read the parts that interested me at the moment. I realize that \\"one size fits all\\" advice does not apply with MS. MS patients' symptoms are extremely individualized and often quite different from person to person.

Friedman is one of my favorite authors ever since I picked up IN CONQUEST BORN a few years ago...I almost wish I'd found out about her a few years from now so there'd be more material out there for me to find! (Does that make sense?) Her new book is truly mind-blowing science fiction, especially the dealings between the hackers and the government. The idea of humanity going straight to technological implants for 'Web' access has a real ring of truth to it! It doesn't quite measure up in the final conflict to, say, Stephen Donaldson's GAP series, but it sure is a wonderful read. Ms. Friedman, keep it up...and hurry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I only discovered Ms. Friedman relatively recently (In Conquest Born, which was a great book also), and I found this book an excellent read. I admit the underlying science may be implausible, but come on! I have found very few scifi books that can seriously claim plausibility. Also, there seems to be a whiff of political correctness to the story (all God's mutants have something to contribute...), but I found the concept intriguing nonetheless The story worked for me and I enjoyed the characters immensely. The mystery aspects of the plot made it all the more interesting. Unfortunately, I have read most of the books Ms. Friedman has written, so I have to wait until she writes some more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"This had a element that alot of scifi's been missing. Wonder, and bizarreness. Now, don't get me wrong, but the best part of scifi was the detachment of reality. This could be a very real situation, but it's farfetched. Unlike Military S/F, it focused on charachterization. The story is this. The main character 1, Jamisa, has 'voices' in her head and memory blocks. When the space habitat that she lives in is attacked by a rival company, she goes to the Up-And-Out, a network of stations linked by the ainniq. Guided by a series of programs called 'Dreamscapes' she eventually learns what and who she is. The other main character, Masada, is a computer security person who has been hired to track a virus that's killing pilots and endangering the ainniq. The ending will come as a surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story and book","review":"I have to agree with the other reviews. It's a great book, great story, not so great ending.

It is very easy to follow and the cd-rom worked great for us. It showed us a practical, sensible way to get out of debt...and stay out. I wouldn't let the Mormon or LDS part keep you from trying this book. The financial advice is sound and practical for anyone. I have heard of \\"power payments\\" before but never had it presented in an easy to understand format. The cd-rom is simple to use. I had put off using the book and cd-rom because I thought the theories and the s/w would be too complicated and over my head. I shouldn't have worried about it. Even though I am not an experienced Excel user or even a spreadsheet user, it was no problem.

A DVD player with a built-in digital amplifier with Dolby Digital and DTS decoding, and 5 satellite speakers and a passive subwoofer for this price is just incredible.This system is beautiful, and because of its small size my first thought was that it wouldn't sound as good as it looks. But, man, was I wrong. This system more than fills with sound my bedroom. I was very impressed with the performance with 5.1 surround. The system is very easy to set-up and works fine when you first turn it on. The only thing I found missing was a component video output, but with the s-video is almost the same.This is a great system at an affordable price. You won't have to go to the trouble (and the money) of buying the separate components (DVD player, Receiver/Amplifier with 5.1 surround, 5 speakers and subwoofer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect system for getting into the DVD/home theater world","review":"... I love this system! I am totally impressed with the sound it can produce. I have my system in a large, open space, and it has NO trouble filling the area with powerful sound. The surround sound and DTS 5.1 are terrific; I watched Air Force One as soon as I had it hooked up. Wow -- the movie became so real and even more action packed with this system. If you don't have a home theater system and are looking for a package deal, this is the one. It has a DVD/CD player, tuner, and receiver all together...a great value for such a marvelous system."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DAV S300 is a great deal for DVD newbies","review":"I had never purchased any DVD products or home theater components, so I was not sure would satisify my urge for a good home theater and be simple enough that I could easily connect it and use it. The Sony Dream System, while not the most powerful system available, is certainly capable of producing all of the quality sound (whether Dolby 5.1 or DTS) that I need. The picture is excellent as well. All in all, I had very high expectations for this machine when I bought it and it has exceeded my expectations and been a joy to use. It is true that the system will NOT let you use CD-R's or CD-RW's. So, if you need that feature you should look at another machine. However, that omission does not bother me and I have had nothing but positive experience with this machine.... Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip off","review":"Why would anybody pay $700 (+ shipping) for the DAV-S300 at Amazon if even CircuitCity sells them for $599??????"},{"rating":"2","title":"home theater made easy","review":"The system has a very clean sound , but does lack power. The DAVS 500 offers 40 watts to all and 80 to sub. For the price ,it outshines the competition. There is a out for the woofer if you choose to replace the sub, sony does not recommend changing any components. DTS, 5.1, and various sound fields I prefer a unit which selects the best possible sound and if you want to alter GO ahead. A sub cost what this system cost. The speakers are matched which really brings out the sound, but no chance to upgrade with a 30 watt output.

I eagerly await \\"The House that Jack Built\\" but would have appreciated a warning that \\"Ripping Time\\" is only the first half the story. I hate reading in installments and would have shelved it until the conclusion (I hope?) came out, had I known. So, If you are like me, buy it and wait for the rest of the story.

The characters were pale imitations of the earlier works in the series. They are now motivated by nothing beyond pure revenge, and the graphic violence in the story (not only in describing Jack the Ripper) gives the whole novel a depressing feeling. Had I not enjoyed the first two books so much, I would not even have finished it.Granted, I did begin to feel interested in the outcome, but only in time to find out that the book doesn't end-- it's just to be continued in a future story. But no matter, these characters are all shallow enough that I will completely have forgotten about them by the time the next book comes out. Buy the sequel? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continued and Extremely Graphic","review":"I got suspicious about 100 pages before the end of the book thinking that it would be difficult to tie everything up. Sure enough, another of Linda Evans' books that is continued without warning. I've been waiting for over 2 years for the 2nd part to her \\"Far Edge of Darkness\\" novel and it still hasn't been released. Very irritating.I found the violence to be much more graphic than earlier books in the series; needlessly so. It simply made the book longer so that the authors could make it a 2 parter, and it bogged down what could have been an interesting story line. Don't bother with this one unless you enjoy vivid descriptions of people being cut up. If you do, this book's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Continued?","review":"I would have given this book three stars except for its major flaw.Its one major flaw is that the story stops dead with a \\"to be continued\\". In other words, you've purchased half a book and read half a story with no guarantee that part 2 (and maybe part 3...) will ever be published.Another flaw in this book is that you need to have read earlier books in the series to understand some of the action and many of the references. The earlier books at least had an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelming","review":"This study of the Book of John would fit in a detailed college class, not a Sunday School class to explore who Jesus is. This study is too comprehensive and complicated and requires much homework. Definitely neither inviting nor user friendly. However, the introduction is well-written and points out that it is possible to select questions and focus on particular issues, but the mass of material and options are a turn off. Having the actual scripture passage printed in the book would have been very helpful, but scripture isn't included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great DVD from Eva!!","review":"I love this routine!

I would like my other 11 please.As for the product itself, it isn't very durable. Where ever it ripped I would just tape it, so it wasn't too big of a deal since it sticks to the tape pretty well. It did do well absorbing the paint and not letting it leak through. It was nice to not have to track wet paint around, which is what would have happened if I had gotten a plastic one....But seriously, where are my other 11?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The terminal heads are hollow","review":"I used this inverter on our camping trip and was very disappointed in the materials they used. The terminal head (black) was accidental hit and was bent. I looked closer to find that the terminal black head connection is made of a light metal and was broken half way and was only attached to both ends by a cork screw thread. I managed to get it working by pushing back the bolt end and was able to get a connection. To prevent this from happening again you would need to protect this unit with a padded case. 400 watts power is enough for camera or cell chargers or to pump up an air mattress, don't expect this unit to do much more then that. Because of the terminal heads and how delicate they are, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine!","review":"I purchased this product to blow up an air mattress while out camping at Cook Forest, PA. It worked fine with the two large air mattresses. It does state to not use it to charge devices such as cell phones.

Verse is often set as prose, as in the Kindle stand-alone sonnets of Shakespeare. This edition is much better in that respect, but whenever a verse line is too long to fit on one line, it is set as two lines, both with flush left margins (not the usual practice with verse) or even worse, as three lines, all with flush left margins but the last two very short, one or two words apiece. This is hard to read and unnecessary, an obvious computer glitch. On top of that, the prose passages in this volume, and that includes the very important Falstaff scenes, are set in sets of two alternating lines, one normal length, the other quite short, another obvious computer glitch. ALL KINDLE VERSE BOOKS I'VE SEEN SO FAR HAVE SOME OR ALL OF THESE FAILINGS. The problem is systemic: Kindle can't handle verse yet. The rule would seem to be, don't buy poets on Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy to have found this item","review":"Grandma is off the hook!

A joy.","review":"I really enjoy listening to this album. The variety of styles all working together in various permutations of the 4 talented musicians is really cool. The quality of music, musicianship and recording makes this a worthwhile way to spend an hour. It's what I think they call finger picking style. The audience is kept out of the recordings as well except when the song is done. The snippets should give you a good indication of what you are geting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I was looking for a travel hairdryer to take on a trip to Europe. I chose this one because it has dual voltage, is foldable, and is available through Amazon Prime for quick shipping. It is rather bulky, but I suppose if it were smaller it wouldn't have the power and other nice features like the speed settings and \\"cool\\" button. It performed perfectly on the trip (with the addition of a tiny outlet adapter) and is comfortable to hold. Now I keep it in my gym bag. Overall, I recommend this if you want a somewhat more compact but still powerful dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chet Atkins CD- bought on Amazon","review":"Awesome.

Apply no force to the push stroke, and just keep the saw in contact with the item to be cut during the pull stroke. The sharpness of the saw does the rest. I used it to cut three heavy polymer shutters to length. Each cut was about 36\\" in length and 1.25\\" in depth. It was a joy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overestimated?","review":"It resulted from lectures about the topics and does not cover the topics deep enough. But although the other yogas from Vivekananda are quite interesting, I was somewhat disappointed with this one. This does not mean, that there would be no good statements in this book, but just not enough of them. Both, karma yogis and bhakti yogis would probaly prefer other books. One may still want to read it, to get a better understanding of Vivekanandas idea of the spiritual path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise!","review":"I just bought a used vinyl copy of this incredible music!

If you like John Mayall and jazz, blues, and rock n' roll you'll love this album. It truly is a fusion of music genres and styles. As harmonica player I love how he is able to interact with the saxophone and other instruments on this album and show how versatile a harmonica can be. I imagine he had to change harmonicas if he is using a diatonic harmonica though I just got the CD and haven't had a chance to try playing along."},{"rating":"2","title":"What got me started","review":"JBF was an album I bought because I knew and loved JM. What I didn't know was jazz--and this was a perfect entry for me to what I now consider a life-long passion.

I'll always have this in my collection. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb live British blues","review":"I first heard a cut from this set over AM radio shortly after its 1972 release. I bought it that same day. Frankly, I don't hear a lot of jazz in these songs, even though fairly well-known jazz artists are featured on guitar, trumpet and sax. To me, it is simply the best vehicle ever devised for John Mayall's brand of British blues. Freddie Robinson on guitar cuts to shreds anything Beck or Clapton ever did (although aficianados of the two latter will probably think his amp is not pumping enough distortion.) Mayall, who has never been accused of being a great vocalist, flat makes his harmonica talk. The audio quality of this live recording is excellent. Finally, I nominate this set's version of \\"Good Times Boogie,\\" as John Mayall's finest moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars are not enough -- This is a 10 Star, must have.","review":"One of the best jams ever.

No telling whatever happened to it after numerous moves and room mates. I had quite frankly forgotten about it. I have listened to Turning Point many times, in fact wore out a CD if that's possible. I bought it as an add on with Amazon, to get the free shipping. This is truly a classic and with 23 out of 23 reviews a 5* I guess that says it all.

It is a delight to once again hear the songs I so loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effort, no cigar.","review":"I love Mayall and there's no question that he's put together some amazing bands. Sadly, this album falls into the category of \\"almost made it\\". The band doesn't come together, the solos are weak, especially if you compare these efforts to other jazz efforts of that era.

To this day, he has never let me forget it. This movie is by far the worst space saga ever! It is so bad that I just have to have a DVD copy of it. As others have mentioned, the trailers were cleverly crafted and covertly deceiving. I actually expected something worth watching? I was terribly wrong. Vic Morrow was just a Japanese attempt to attract US movie goers, as they have done in the past, by employing 'out-of-work' American actors like Nick Adams of \\"The Rebel\\" TV show fame (Yes, I'm that old!).

Start with Rohmer's \\"The Green Eyes of Bst\\" or \\"The Golden Scorpion\\" (free for Kindles). Although \\"The Yellow Claw\\" does have some interesting plot ideas, it does drag in spots; however, it makes up for it in the last third of the book. So, read this one (which has Rohmer's French detective, Gaston Max) later. Rohmer is most famous for creating the infamous character of Fu Manchu who later became even more famous in the black and white movies of the 30's. Fu Manchu was portrayed in various films by Boris Karloff in the 1930's. Several of the first Fu Manchu novels are also available for free on the Kindle or search out the actual books in used bookstores - they are worth the time to discover the great, intellectual (and stereotypical) evil genius who is Fu Manchu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only ONE (1) 40 minute class","review":"It never occurred to me that there would only be ONE workout on an entire CD.

This is the second book I've read in the \\"Wicked\\" Woman series and it did not disappoint. Though this book did not have many steamy sex scenes as the other books, the ones that were there were worth it (oh the jail scene...).Stephanie and Jack were hot together. They both want different things in life but their attraction for each other will make them compromise things to be together. I enjoyed how good girl Stephanie turned her \\"wicked\\" side on to torture Jack. I especially enjoyed how Jack didn't give a damn what the town thought of him being around Stephanie.Overall, this was a great yet fast read.

In the end, I believe that this book offers no furthering of knowledge and only reinforces some disproven myths about Gettysburg.For a good general read on Gettysburg, I believe that Glenn Tucker's \\"High Tide at Gettysburg\\" is far, far superior to Woodworth's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color blind","review":"The description states the color is Ivory.The label on the package states Ivory.The product is snow white.Not a good experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheapoooo","review":"I had to send it back.

It detailed the thoughts of women turning 60 who had many advantages in life, in terms of education, family help and encouragement, the luck to connect with the right mentor at the right time. I would have been much more interested in the thoughts of less privileged women, more ordinary women. I couldn't help thinking that it may be easier to have a positive view of aging if you are already a woman of accomplishment by the time you hit your forties. For some, the greatest accomplishement of their lives may be successfully raising a family, completing an advanced education later in life or simply a life devoted to volunteerism.

I can only recommend this to researchers who are able to verify the information within before using this book as a source. Anyone else will have to guess which information is correct and which is false. (Examples: on page 173, Hughes states that the 1.66:1 ratio, which SK adopted for A Clockwork Orange, was subsequently used on Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. This is completely wrong. Barry Lyndon was shot in 1.77:1, and The Shining and Full Metal Jacket were shot in 1.33:1 and projected in 1.85:1-though the DVD and video version of the latter 2 films preserved the original 1.33:1 format. Another mistake is a quote supposedly from The Film Director as Superstar by Michel Ciment. Since Joseph Gelmis was the author of this book, and Ciment the author of another, it will take some detective work to figure out which Hughes means.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The kid CAN sing!","review":"\\"8)If You Were Mine\\" - will be the reason why anyone will purchase this cd but the rest of the cd has to back it up.

It is not written as a primer on church leadership, but rather invites leaders from exemplary churches to share what they have learned about how God is working in and through their churches. It is a diverse bunch of churches and not a one-size fits all prescription.

Second, the transformation of James from hapless loser to what he becomes seemed a stretch. Third, and most important, I disliked Chuck Logan's style. One, I didn't like the herky-jerky, staccato sentence fragments. Two, there was a lot of clunky, unwieldy phraseology (duty \\"thudded through room after empty room\\"). Three, the grammar was odd-commas were omitted, periods were used where there should have been question marks, and commas were used where semicolons belong.

Her writing is crisp and elegant, the characters, believe it or not, are so convincingly drawn, with dialogue that coveys both the scene and individual idiosyncrasies, that the reader can become totally immersed in the \\"reality\\" of her plots.

I buy it for people all of the time, and get raves about it. I think what I love about this book is the characteristic Dr. Laura brutal honesty, but it is tempered with understanding and kindness. After reading this book, I am finally able to be completely honest with myself about what I can expect from my parents, (and others too), so that I stop trying to get a response that I'll never ever get. I'm much happier now that I have stopped trying to get \\"juice from a rock\\", as Dr. Laura says.I didn't have a \\"bad childhood\\", but I very much needed this book. Don't let the title sway you.

I highly recommend this book for anyone who teaches math or science.I help homeschool our three elementary-aged children. We've been working through some of the pages in the book together so they have some idea of what I do while I'm at work. They are really enjoying learning about how to add together sine waves to make different patterns.This book has given me wonderful insight into teaching and into what my kids can learn even in elementary school.

The authors really makes sure you understand everything they talk about(like the addition of sine waves and trigonometric functions etc.). I can't wait to finish the book. I browsed through the 2nd half of the book and saw treatments of e, integration, differentiation and projection and orthogonality. Can't wait to go there!

So I'm going to enlist a friend who sews to make a replacement cover--how hard could it be.

As they grew, though, and maxed out at about 11 pounds each, the fabric wouldn't stay in place; the little nubbies that are supposed to catch the fabric don't (and in some cases, the fabric has ripped) and cause the area the cat sits in to suddenly lower and a gap occurs between the window ledge portion of the frame and the material. The first time it happened, my cat's backside slid right into that gap and she got hung up there. The second time, a few moments ago, the cat managed to jump away, but that's it, it's getting taken down. I'm afraid they're going to get hung. I can see no way of securing that fabric so that it doesn't do this; it can't be tucked under the frame because it then blocks the velcro securing it to the window sill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats love it!","review":"My kitties do love this and I am glad that I bought it. My only complaint is that when they lie on it the cover moves off the frame a little in the front because there is no way to keep it tacked underneath. Besides that it's great. And the velcro attachment is actually strong enough to hold up with two cats jumping on and off it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your cat will love this!","review":"My cat loves his cat napper. He gets to look out the window, is elevated high enough to see most everything that's going on in the house and he looks pretty darn cute in it too. He's gone from trying to balance himself on the back of the couch, to hanging out in style and comfort. I'm just waiting for spring to come so I can put it in a window facing the backyard. The reasone I gave it four stars was because setting it up took a little more time than I thought, but it's not very difficult. The velcro that is used to stick the napper to the window ledge doesn't stick the best, but it's enough.

Come Alive should have been included on Ebbhead and it should have been its own single and video. The lyrics, vocals and drumming on this track are some of the best I have ever heard.

One star for sycophancy.However, the book is indeed Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, and not The Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, and so another star for honesty. These cherry-picked letters etc. are selected to make the Prophet the wholesome hero of Pioneer America, and the original documents are reproduced to show their verisimilitude.

I must admit, all those reviews only peaked my curiosity and they were all right! 'A Serbian Film' is all of the above but I also found the movie to be better than just a shock film (which it does not pretend to be anything else). In my opinion, I thought this was very well made film and the main actor who plays Milos, does a fantastic job! He captures the raw emotions from a loving family man to a drugged up porn actor who goes over the edge of insanity, all the way down to a man whos soul has been completely and totally broken. This film is disturbing to say the least but a good watch to satisfy ones curiosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly original","review":"Had heard about this movie and had a tough time finding a copy to watch.

Not me this film is shocking and has plenty of gut churning moments in it but the end was predictable when he remembers when he walks in the warehouse in the last 15 minutes. Dont get me wrong the film is very good and a great lead performance so I will give it that. To me the most shocking film I have ever viewed is Nekromantic. To me its the most sick and twisted film I have ever seen and I dont think any other film will change my mind. So if your a sick and twisted film fan as I am definetely check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes this one is missing the \\"bad\\" parts.","review":"I saw the original uncut version with no subtiles, this is not that film.Retired Adult movie star is talked in to working on a new \\"Art Film\\" and youknow he needs the cash, so lets get to filming. I have heard a lot of hypeabout this master piece and have been champing at the bit to see it and Imust admit it is well made and the acting is top notch. Sick is the wordthat should be used here and I must say this movie is only for the hard coregore hound, all others should move over to the regular rated R horror films.I may have to set through this movie again with English Subtitles but thislevel of depravity tends to bother my thought process for a few days afterviewing. I did like the movie I am sad to say and I do look forward toSrdjan Spasojevic next movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Disturbing!!!","review":"I watched the uncut version online, and I didn't think it was that bad. Yes, it's incredibly disturbing and deals with graphic depictions of rape, abuse, necrophilia, and pedophilia. I can see why it's so controversial but it was so sick and twisted that I actually liked it. I probably won't watch it again or anytime soon. I can't stress enough that you need a strong stomach and a sick twisted mind like me to watch this film. Milos is a retired porn star who has a wife and a son. He comes across an 'art-maker' named Vukmir that is making a snuff film and wants Milos to star in it. The 'art' only gets worse and more brutal down the road. If you think you're ready, you might enjoy A SERBIAN FILM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depravity driven home...","review":"I've recently watched the director's uncut version on dvd, but am curious to see this unrated, high-definition version, which essentially loses a little over a minute of material. This blu-ray will feature the version currently available on the streaming service, FLIX FLING, and is the most complete American version available. I'll be curious what seconds were found too extreme for US distributors.The film is an atmospheric creepshow that won't dissappoint those looking for the latest, taboo-breaking imagery. It's plays like an extreme horror movie, with highly unlikely plot devices used to maximize the shocks, but succeeds as the best kind of grindhouse, exploitation filmmaking. The villian is played with gusto, and certainly is a phrasemaker, trying desperately to offend viewers at every turn. As far as filmmaker intentions go, it appears that this is a love letter to the Pope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a horror but a sexually sadistic piece of garbage","review":"I was so excited to see the uncut version as I was under the impression this was a top notch horror film. Well its not!! There is no element of horror at all to this film. Its a descent into sexual deviance of the worst kind. There is some gore but nothing of shock value. The only thing shocking to me is the amount of people that enjoyed this film. There are a few scenes which were done purely to appall the audience but backfired as I dont find (SPOILER!!!) sexual acts with children and infants entertainment...just disgusting and without any type of artistic value. This movie had potential but in an effort to create an intense never before seen work of art they chucked out all vision and just went for pure depravity. Doesn't take creativity to think that up,just lack of! Save your money if you're looking for horror. If you're looking for porn, buy porn and if you're perverse in the worst way, well enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cut version is all we need","review":"I bought this hoping it to be fully uncut but alas it's missing more than 90 seconds. The 2 most memorable scenes are heavily cut and especially the second scene doesn't make much sense anymore. I'm giving this one star because I feel cheated and because it just invites people to download the uncut version.There are 3 cut versions now of this movie on dvd and it's totally ridiculous.And on the movie page it says NC-17 while the dvd cover says Unrated. This is what liars do.Anyway I might've known that unrated doesn't mean uncut ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shocking tale, a very rare masterpiece, not so often witnessed on your tv screen!","review":"\\"A Serbian film\\" is what you would proudly term a 'psychological drama'. I feel the first and primary aim of the film is to throw light on the fact that greed can destroy one's world, very well shown from the perspective of 'Milos' played brilliantly by Srdjan Todorovic. Sergej Trifunovic is brilliant as well. Apart from the gore, blood and the terrifying events that take place, the film is a brilliant 'Character study' film and deals with a subject very rare in films. Its a very well done film, you may be disturbed but you will not dislike it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Serbian Film [Blu-ray]","review":"First off this was an awesome movie. I am not for the stuff that was in it but what people need to realize is that this is Art, and theater, if you don't like it you don't have to watch it or talk bad about it. This movie was well shot and the story was awesome. I just wish we could have gotten the original version, instead of people getting there feelings hurt by the topics that are in the movie when stuff like this goes on in our world every day.

This film is just plain gross and unnecessary. I have no one to blame but myself for buying this.

It doesn't show the boys face or body, a blanket is thrown over the body, but still,.. Its one thing when he was doing this to his wife but THIS was the final straw. I am surprised someone hasn't brought the director up on legal charges. Perhaps because it was filmed overseas.

I was expecting something disturbing and Artistic, what I got was a movie that seems to try so damn hard at being the sickest thing you've ever viewed that it just becomes totally void of any sort of provocative Art. A Serbian Film seems to not know if it wants to be Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Salò, 120 Days of Sodom' or Pascal Laugier's 'Martyrs' and in the end it plays out like a wanna be Takashi Miike film that couldn't hold a candle to either of the two masterpieces I just named."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"This was a horrible movie.

Sure it may only be cut by 30+ seconds...but if you're going to release an unrated version of a film, there should be NO CUTS since it did not go through the ratings board. Incredibly disappointing that such a unique film is still censored in a country that touts FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION.Just cancelled my order (thank you to the other users who pointed out the cuts).

Headlines on the 6 O'Clock News are more shocking.This movie takes taboos and basically exploits them for the sake of making a movie about the horrors people are capable of.If you like torture, forced drug addiction, rape, pedophilia, gore, necrophilia, porn and alcoholism, then this movie is for you to watch over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serbian Film","review":"Simply titled A Serbian Film, the movie explores themes of violence and sexual depravity in ways you may never have seen before on film. The story follows a struggling male porn star named Milos who takes on one last gig, a supposed pornographic \\"art film,\\" for a fat paycheck and the chance to break away from the industry completely. Once filming begins, however, Milos gradually realizes it's not quite what he thought, and his life devolves into a hellish and sadistic nightmare for him and his family. A Serbian Film generated much controversy, due to its disturbingly graphic depiction of rape, pedophilia, and necrophilia, earning nationwide bans in countries like Spain, Germany, and Australia, and I was hard-pressed to disagree. I'm reviewing it as a curiosity, primarily because of the media attention it received, but in all honesty, I don't quite know how I'd feel if I recommended it to anyone outright.

It was a boring, tedious story for about the first 30 minutes, then things ramped up a bit and got absurd and confusing with poorly executed sexual fetish shots. It's just dumb simulated snuff-like stuff, I guess you'd call it. Save your money. The The Human Centipede is far more engrossing, interesting and disturbing than this useless film, and THC doesn't really show very much. If you really get off on BDSM, I'm sure you can find more interesting stuff online that's free. Actually, The Whistleblower with Rachel Weisz will probably better satisfy your craving for what you think The Serbian Film is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick Bloody Porno","review":"this movie is all about shock value. the story line is pretty interesting for the most part. its just filled with disturbing sexual scenes that has blood and gore in it. if your disturbing like i am watch it but if not then be warned to see some sick ****."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I didn't buy this product through Amazon.com, instead I downloaded the uncut version through an unliscensed movie download site. I really don't have much to say about the movie, except that it (shockingly!) isn't really shocking, provocative, or groundbreaking in any way. The whole film is just.. well... it's really not very good. It's an odd combination of hard-core porn, \\"torture porn\\", and recovered memory thriller somewhat in the vein of \\"Memento\\". If you want to see lots of fevered thrusting, engorged d***s, and a little bit of family suicide mixed in, go for it. If you're actually in the mood for a provocative film that is unsettlingly violent yet also has a deeper message, go for Martyrs.Martyrs"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS: IT IS THE CENSORED VERSION","review":"Send a message to the spineless distributors that we won't accept censored movies.

The film's main character Milos accepts a film offer which progressively gets more and more disturbing.

Nothing in the plot made since. The hero was this huge chauvinist pig who acted more like Francesca's pimp than her lover, and Francesca, the heroine was a lap dancer trapped in the body of a demure nineteenth century virgin. I can only say I came away feeling very disturbed by the undertones of female subjugation and overwheening male arrogance. The only interesting point in the whole book was the Aryan sub-plot to create a master race, intitiated by Francesca's childhood sweetheart and Aunts.

So, when I saw \\"All I Desire\\" at the library I decided to give it a try. One of the main characters, Reay, was a very weak character impersonating and exotic dancer to protect her cousin. Reay's aunts and favorite cousin were trying to impregnant women to start a new nation. He would perform this one by one in succession. Did they have Viagra in the 1800s? Secondly, there were some mysterious papers that were being searched for, but, Devine never explained what the papers were and their purpose.This book had the potential, in the beginning, to end with a great romance. But the ending was a flop.I will not allow this book to deter me from reading another one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrible!","review":"Each time I thought this book couldn't get worse -- it did! The plot was implausible from the beginning, the hero and heroine never really fall in love (can you believe it!). The prose is so ridiculous that I couldn't decide whether to laugh or just be embarrased for the author. If one more character \\"seized up\\" with desire I thought I would throw the book out. Secondary characters are having raunchy sex even before the main characters. Motivations of characters are withheld from the reader so that we feel no sympathy for them. If you believe a virgin could really impersonate Europe's greatest exotic dancer and courtesan, well, you might enjoy this book. But I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I bought this book after reading several reviews of Thea Devine's other books. The sensuality came through, as promised, but I was disappointed by the complete lack of emotional connection between the two main characters. Love is never mentioned in this book; every encounter of the hero and heroine is driven by lust only. I don't consider the main character a hero; he is a complete control-freak who would rather die than admit to any mistake. The heroine is door mat material who never stands up for herself. At the conclusion of the story, the characters seem to stay together only due to their mutual passion for each other. Also, the whole plot is based on finding some mysterious \\"papers\\" which don't seem to have anything at all to do with the rest of the story. The conclusion is so far out of left field, I still don't know what was going on. I suggest you pass on this one unless you are a BIG Thea Devine fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with all the readers above.","review":"I was disappointed with this book.

It does not have beautiful delicate ivy hinged with purple flowers and sweet purple dragonflys with black numbering. Instead it is a nasty brown cluttered mess, with 3 types of greenery and hideous brown bugeyed dragonflys and brown numbers.

Blood Stain Child may be from Japan, but they do not fit the typical J-Rock/Visual Kei sound. The music is very European Metal-inspired and the lyrics are mostly in English. I'm new to their type of music, so I can't really think of anyone to compare them to... They mix Power Metal / Melodic Metal, and a splash of Trance / Techno. The result is a sound which picks you up and takes you on a sonic journey.

Measurements are a complete misrepresentation, and this misrepresentation is doubly intentional: you short-cut the original material, then you bait and switched when filling the order. The only people who purchase in these sizes and quantities are those working on projects where dimensions matter. I would be concerned about trimming if too much material was provided, and thankful for the opportunity, but what am I supposed to do with too small a piece?

I can still hear the classic lines just fine, and see most of Renee Ammann as she's lying there on the bed asleep (except her nice posterior got chopped off thanks to the lousy framing).The only thing I'll add to the argument about whether or not The Stoned Age is better than Dazed and Confused is this: the only one you'll find any sex or nudity in is The Stoned Age.I think we have our winner.;)And be sure to stay tuned after the end credits for two very special surprise guests.

Anyway we all love stoner movies i stumbled upon this one when the front of the box said \\"better than dazed and confused\\" although i don't think it is, its still a great movie this one does not take itself too serious. It consists of a bunch of guys driving around trying to get drunk stoned and laid. The two main charecters are Joe and Hubbs. There are several supporting charecters including tack who almost steals the movie. But it mostly sticks to the two guys. I think the best thing about this movie is all the lingo and slang terms they use. Like every time someone says who is that? they sa just some dude.

To add to theirs, I was surprised that the author never mentions anything about how to handle pests (woodchucks, chipmunks, deer, etc.) that might eat the food you're trying so hard to grow. The only mention was something about how Native Americans planted 4 seeds for each plant they expected to grow (one rots, one for the crow, ...). What if you can't afford 4x the seed to get a crop? Since he's an experienced gardener I was hoping he'd have some advice about what types of fencing or other deterents work best on a budget. Makes me think of how early colonists had to survive on their crops. They must have been so frustrated to lose any plants to deer or woodchucks or any other animal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not great","review":"First of all, you need a ton of space if you're going to benefit from this book. If you live in the city or suburbs, consider Ruppenthal's Fresh Food From Small Spaces instead. Second of all, the author is quite condescending, as other reviewers have noted. It may be part of his dry humor, but I can't quite tell. If you can get beyond those two criticisms, then there is plenty of good information tucked into these pages. Does not fully deliver on the promise of this title, I would say, but I enjoyed it and learned from it nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"He knows what he's talking about clearly but he really pushes his own agenda on what he likes. That is a drawback because where and how he lives is different than most of us. Most of us don't have acres to plant rows of garden. He is very much against raised beds but in my case, my landlord only let me have a garden if it's setup in a raised bed so it looks a certain way and can't get out of control, in his eyes. So, in that part, it was very lacking for me in information.

My family has started the path to self sufficiency and we were all looking forward to reading the wonderful information touted by some of the reviewers on Amazon.

He constantly treats the reader like he/she is an idiot, not capable of intelligent, independent thought. Perhaps he has some good information. I don't know.

After reading the entire book I felt like I had wasted much time working my way through the heavy material with very little gain.Also there was erroneous information presented which makes me suspect anything else from this book. It highlights growing in drought situations and at the same time recommends adding lime to reduce soil acidity. However, regions with little rainfall generally have problems with too much alkalinity which adding lime will only make worse.There are some bits of useful tidbits like suggesting to give plants more room and growing in mounds for low rainfall areas.

Since the author lives in a very distinct growing area, if I lived in a maritime New Zealand area it would probably be a perfect book. Many of his techniques would only work in his specific climate and for a full time gardener, which I am not. Sigh. The section on growing and storing each individual type of food is excellent if you can adapt it to your own climate. I was not too happy with the preachy, arrogant, \\"Everyone else is an idiot and only I know how to do it right\\" attitude which extends the lenght of the book by quite a bit.

After searching extensively for several months for any remixed version of any of these tracks, I located Mousse T's remixes of Can I Get a Witness and Hold On. It goes without saying that a true lover of music will greatly appreciate the thin bass lines and high vocals so beautifully placed on these remixed versions.

That's why I got the book; to find better ways to communicate with my brother, whom I supervise on the job.Two things about the book bothered me, though.1) The context/information in the book was somewhat scattered. When reading it, at times I felt like she just jotted down notes as she thought of them, or perhaps that someone recorded one of her seminars, and she had it printed into a book.2) I found terms like 'Negative Respect-Robbing Poison Phrases' or 'Vicious venom poison phrases that overpower and maim' to be, at times, too much to handle.

The first cable worked initially, the the creator was universally lauded as a hero and promoted to celebrity status. When the cable stopped working, the universal praise turned to scorn.

Essentially you have PLIERS, WIRE CUTTERS, KNIFE, PHILLIPS, SLOTTED, PUNCH DOWN, WIRE STRIPPER, and FILE.

Their full talents are showcased in this collection. With the ballad \\"I Wonder\\" to the outstanding vocal arrangments of \\"Take A Chance on Me\\" to the hard edge of \\"I'm A Marioneete\\", any one can see why ABBA still is one of the world's largerst selling groups. Very much underrated by American audiences, one should give a good listen to this album. One of the wonders of Abba is that they always worked as a group, and it is demonstrated here with harmonizing of \\"Eagle\\" and \\"The Name of The Game\\". Truely an ageless band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wise Move","review":"Following the pop classic ARRIVAL came The Album, a decidedly more American approach than previous releases. Eagle almost rocks. Its distant ethereal quality is cryptic and hypnotic. The hits Take A Chance On Me and The Name of the Game are here, both less pop and more rock than before. One Man One Woman and Move On are uniquely ABBA and show the band getting better and more relaxed. Frida's beautifully sung I Wonder illustrates yet another side to the band. The Album reflects their shot at American superstardom. It also showcases the band's ability to subtly shift styles. Compare Eagle to Waterloo and then to The Visitors. The evolution is magical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album...but bad re-mastering","review":"I agree with John (from N.Y.), these 24-bit re-masters of the Abba catalogue were a big letdown. In a side by side comparison, the original discs sounded much better than these. The originals were brighter and plenty full; just like the original album sounded.On the other hand, these 24-bit discs sound slightly muddy and the high end (which includes acoustic guitars and cymbals) are flat or dead sounding thanks to the no-noise solution. My advice, is to save your money and keep your old discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"The (evil) mark of disco is scorched into this album and this group.

And this album is one of their best. \\"Take a chance on me\\" is my favourite Abba song. Their wonderful a capella harmonies are second to none. Unfortunately, on these remastered re-issues we don't get any bonus tracks or alternate takes, which would have been nice, and which a lot of remastered albums have. But anyway, what we do have are 7 songs plus 3 scenes from the mini-musical \\"The girl with the Golden Hair\\". One of those 3 songs \\"Thankyou for the music\\" is now regarded as Abba's theme song and is also the title of their terrific 4 cd box set which includes a disc full of previously unreleased stuff....well worth getting. The booklet for this album contains a 3 page essay by John Tobler."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABBA's American \\"Album\\"","review":"\\"The Album\\" followed the Swedish super-group's biggest smash \\"Arrival\\" in 1977, replacing it with a slate of songs that were, if not overall better than on Arrival, at least sporting the production and arrangement that showed a considerable leap forward. Co-inspired by The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac, songs like \\"Eagle\\", \\"One Man, One Woman\\" and the exquisitely charming \\"Move On\\" are refreshingly different from the previous ABBA. Their knack for hooks remained intact, as witnessed by the great hits \\"The Name of the Game\\", \\"Thank You For the Music\\" and \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" (ABBA's bestselling single in the US ever). The latter and \\"Hole in Your Soul\\" are the most typical ABBA songs here and overall the album is excellent. A great addition for any ABBA and pop music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical in the making?","review":"The Album is a fine piece of pop music by one of the true super-acts of all time. It plays out like a musical, which many of Abba's albums do, as if they knew someday these songs would be on Broadway. A well put together of ballads, I Wonder, Thank you For The Music and pure pop gems,Take A Chance on Me, The Name Of the Game. The Album continued a trend that started with Arrival - the two female vocals, Agnetha & Anni-frid (aka Frida), would have some solo parts while also continuing there flawless harmonizing ways like on Eagle.

But, if you are within range the sound is excellent. The headphones are also very comfortable.2. The instructions that came with mine were wrong regarding the recharging of the batteries. The instructions say to turn OFF the transmitter while recharging, but the transmitter must be turned ON to charge the batteries. Radio Shack customer service was very apologetic in pointing this out.For $20 I think they're great, but I would not be satisfied with them at their regular price.

Suzanne Kingsbury's characters are so well-developed and real that I feel like they were my friends from high school. I finished the book a few weeks ago, and I still think about Haley and Fletcher everyday. The poetic last sentence of the novel rings in my mind again and again. I'm sure that The Summer Fletcher Greel Loved Me is a novel I'll never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars","review":"The Summer Fletcher Greel Loved Me depicts the life of Haley Ellyson and her Mr.Greel who together capture the story's unforgettable characters, sultry summer location, and timeless themes. Although many books claim to have unforgettable characters, Suzanne Kingsbury's meet and exceed this expectation. Through Fletcher Greel we see empathy and an uncanny understanding for life; Haley teaches us what it is like to young and on fire. The atmosphere in which the story unfolds also adds to the reality of the novel. The story takes place in a fictional town in the Deep South where scorching temperatures brew up racial conflicts. Haley and Fletcher's summer love, the secrets Haley keeps inside, and the cultural ties of the town's people all present themselves as major themes in the novel. We see these themes unraveling before us to an ultimate and tragic demise. Suzanne Kingsbury's novel pulls as all the heartstrings within us leaving us with a sense of loss and a yearning for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Treatment","review":"When I purchased this title in a used bookstore for two dollars, I was somewhat apprehensive about its scholarly quality, author biography not withstanding. Upon reading, however, I must say that I felt Pipes admirably illumined what is a very complex economic, social, and cultural subject. Specifically, his thesis concerns the manner in which the Russian state, under various formative influences, developed an essentially proprietary attitude towards land and subject alike. In Pipes' view this has been the primary determinant of all Russian history following Mongol domination. I myself make no pretenses to be an authority on the subject, but Pipes' use of evidence generally convinced me of the credibility of his claim. I would recommend this title to anyone interested in a general account of the pre-revolutionary Russian state apparatus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I purchased the battery charger and it is great!

How COULD anyone document the learning process of a more-or-less random group of people, from young children to grandparents?

In particular the section on Michael Kruvant is pure mythology. Kruvant perpetrated an enormous hoax and suckered Harris right in. Kruvant was a schizophrenic man who made up a totally false life, claiming to have multiple university degrees while in reality he was a college drop out, and was treated in several mental hospitals. He lived in a fantasy world but was very charming and quite intelligent and could be quite persuasive. I knew him personally and have followed the fantastic controversies he stirred up with much amusement. I'm sure in his saner moments, he also must have been quite amused at the fuss he had stirred up.

A mish-mash of truncated interviews stirred into a stew pot boiling with biblical mysticism, new age pop, psychological paranoia, mass conspiracy theory, mentalism....am I leaving anything out folks? When we finally get to the ignobly defrocked Uri Geller it was time to ring the bell, close the book, and quench the candle.At $24 for a mere 224 paperback pages it may not play in Peoria, but I'm sure they'll move a few copies in Roswell.

Again we are in front of a book that lacks EVIDENCE of what it actually presents. Unfortunately this is the fundamental problem with UFOlogy. If we can trust in good faith one single person's testimony without any proof then we only need Phil Corso's - to mention one - interviews or statements (and his famous Roswell book) as the final verdict that UFOs exist and are here, but do you really think that this is enough ??

I would recommend this bag to anyone who needs a day-trip/carry-on backpack. The bag was made for our troops but works well for anyone who needs the extra space while traveling. Fits in the carry-on guidelines for most airlines. The 3L capacity is great.

Of course, they soon find trouble. Melissa's irritating suitor and secrets from Jeanie's past keep the rest of the volume going.All in all volume 2 does a nice job of carrying things forward from volume 1. We also get to see a few things that weren't in the anime and thanks to the narrative style of manga we can even get into everyone's head more which leads to some pretty interesting character moments.In short, if you like Rune Soldier this book is certainly worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great, I got a 2nd pair","review":"Sizing review is spot-on.

The first pair I won in a Mudddy Buddy race, and I loved them so much I got a second pair - one for the REALLY muddy, wet days and the other for dusty, drier ones.

Big props to Adidas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoe to hike in any weather","review":"The reviews on the size made me nervous but since at the time the shoe I wanted on sale was only that size...I took the chance. Comments on sizing are accurate as I bought a 9 1/2 and it fits perfect. I usually have to settle for a 10 but a 10 1/2 fits me best.The shoe is both breathable and the gore-tex makes it waterproof. Great shoe to walk in any type of weather. I also really like the appearance. You might want to swap out the thick laces though as they are kinda short which means they might come untied easier.Overall though, very pleased with all elements of this shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an average album by Aztek Trip","review":"I was lucky enough to buy their cd and I have become a fan of their music.

However, they're fine for anyone with bigger hands or longer fingers.I ended up going with some fingerless knit gloves from Target, even though I would have preferred the wool gloves. Its a bit tough to find the simple/solid wool gloves for women as you tend to find either the cheaper-quality knit ones, or the uber expensive-not-made-for-doing-any-task-except-my-nails ones.The person I gave these too really loved these though. So I recommend them to anyone with bigger hands, who wants good quality/utility wool fingerless gloves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scratchy to wear for even a short time!","review":"I really should have believed other reviews, but I frequently wear wool and can deal with it just fine.

The people, the languages, the foods, and the hundreds of weird or hilarious or scary moments that happen daily which make indie travel so exhilirating and frustrating at once. These short stories aren't really related at all (despite what the blurb says), except that most are first-person travel stories. Some are clear narratives, others more experimental, bordering on Dave Eggers-esque postmodern humour. The sum may not be much more than its parts, but it's a more than worthy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"toilet tank flapper","review":"This nice flapper does not fit in my toilet because it is too small and cannot work to flush."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT about the Donner Party","review":"I will echo the other reviews posted here that were disapointed that the author did not spend more time on the actual Donner Party. This book follows the adventures of James Reed, who was exiled from the wagon train about a month before they ended up stranded at Donner Lake. Reed made it across the Sierra Nevada Range and into California and spends the rest of the book roaming the state trying to round up a rescue party.In the meantime, back at the Donner Party there is incredible human drama and tragedy. But this author chose to remain with the less interesting aspect of the story. I was very disapointed but recognize that the book is written with great skill and it was a fast read. So if you are interested in what James Reed was doing while the Donner Party members were resorting to cannibalism, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"This book hooks you from the beginning, drawing you into the characters and their plight. As close to feeling apart of the Donner party as anybody would ever want to come.I couldn't put this book down and would recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, but...","review":"The Donner Party survival story is a powerful icon of westward expansion and California history. Houston's novel is fascinating, but somehow steers away from facing clearly those families marooned in the snow. I read two books on the Donner party. A 1936 history by George R. Stewart, Ordeal by Hunger, is still in print available in paperback at Amazon. Somehow, the straightforward historical story is more vivid than Houston's novel. I felt that he kept the pain of the incident at a distance by concentrating on James Reed and viewing the horror though the long-ago memory of Patty Reed. As a history of the early American settling of California, I found it quite interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Story at Many Levels","review":"While the topic of the Donner Party can sound ghoulish this book is primarily focused on the events leading up to it from the perspective of a single family. The story them moves to follow the journey of the families father who is trying to return and save them from their snowbound issolation.This is the book that Cold Mountain should have been. I can't rate it more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want MORE!...","review":"Oh, were do I begin? I have read the whole collection of these tantalizing vampire books in one month. Miller's writing style is elegant and smooth making the pages flow one after another. In this book, Valerian is seductive, vulnerable, and real. My heart hurt for him as well as sang with his. I did not care for his 20th century love, but all the rest were very believable and the first........wow. I recommended this book to every person looking for a new read. I am a F 31 and never had read a vampire book before. I strongly recommend waiting to read this book until you have read the first book with Adian, talk about yummy! All the men & women are beautiful, regal, and sexy.... in a vampire way. I miss not having another of these books to read. But I will await and pray Miller keeps going in these vampire sagas. You will love Valerian from the beginning! All of Miller's characters have become part of my family.... all with a few secrets and all with more to tell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"I really enjoyed Out of the Shadows, but Miller is even better here. Both if these stories are splendidly done, with warm, likeable characters -- who doesn't adore Valerian anyway -- and just the right amount of suspense. Be sure you read Out of the Shadows ((Forever and the Night & For All Eternity) first for important background. You can enjoy these without doing so, but it will definitely heighten your enjoyment of this duo. This book contains two of the best vampire romances anywhere.

It covers all the basics, the drinking, the family, the childhood, the dives, the music, the movies, etc. It also opens up the fact that Waits seems to be a surprisingly introspective man, who puts his art before anything else. If nothing else, the book is worth reading because the man is such an original thinker and wordsmith. \\"Wild Years\\" seems to capture that originality and truly appreciates the body of work that Waits has put together. This book helps to explain the subtle mystery that is Tom Waits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read For Any Tom Waits Fan!","review":"Based on the other reviews of this book, I thought I'd take a stab at it. I'm not really one for biographies, but I'm a HUGE fan so why not?Well researched, well written, interesting, and informative. Great job by the author. The only thing that disappoints me is that the book only goes to the year 2000, which is by NO means anyone's fault, as the book was published IN 2000.Whether you're a new fan just discovering the unconventional genius behind the music or a hardcore fan from the day, this book will make for a great and interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing book","review":"This book is nothing but boring. It basically tracks Tom's Wait's life going from CD to tour to CD. It gives little about the man who wrote the songs. Not sure maybe Tom Waits is on CD's and tours. Maybe he is a boring guy with nothing really to write about except that he keeps on sueing people and that he seems to have made quiet a bit doing just that. I like Tom Wait's music but this book is too boring I struggeled getting through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bio of a great musician","review":"Tom Waits is one of my favorite musicians, and he is as an interesting as some of the characters he is famous for singing about. The author notes in the beginning of this book that many stories about Waits have been fabricated by Waits in various interviews. For instance, nobody knows where Waits was born, and Waits himself has given several different locations. But the stories, true or not, are great, sometimes really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't regret the purchase...","review":"Even though \\"Eric Clapton/Crossroads 2\\" may seem expensive, wait until you see what you get...you already know the music will thrill you, (the live versions outdo the studio ones) and the packaging makes an awesome gift, complete with a book of fabulous photographs from the 70s to the present and details of song origins.

One of the most helpful sections of the book deals with budgeting for your Honda Civic buildup and how to avoid the pitfalls associated with not having a comprehensive plan. Although Mr. Paradise is the creator of Sport Compact Car magazine, my initial fears that I would be reading one big magazine advertisement were unfounded. While Mr. Paradise spends a great deal of time discussing the different types of upgrades available for your Civic, there is very little mention and promotion of specific brands.

After I assembled the \\"braiding\\" handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself, she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart. Not the handle you snap on, mind you. That was still firmly attatched. The rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it! Fortunately she gets enough use out of Zipzee and Daffidaisy that it wasn't too much of a loss that I had to throw it away only hours after opening the box.

I showed them how to use it CAREFULLY after the first one, and the second one is now on my toolbench awaiting a \\"daddy miracle\\". The design is *very* poor (I'm an engineer) from a durability standpoint. (There's a little \\"screw\\" in the handle that goes into a plastic sheath. Any leverage on the handle will pop it right out and strip the plastic.)When it hasn't broken, it works great and they LOVE it, but that just heightens the disappointment when it inevitably fails.

It's a poor design and Hasbro is not standing behind their product.The twirling mechanism broke on this toy 5 minutes out of the box. The handle popped apart to reveal a small cog, screw and metal spring.Needless to say, my daughter was disappointed since the \\"twirling handle\\" is the main function of the toy.I called Hasbro and they said to \\"box it up\\" and send it to them so they could look at it. So not only did the thing break but we had to deal with the hassle of shipping it to Hasbro. Customer service was not very helpful.

The 141's are equally more comfortable as they're lighter and stay on your head better. They're much more comfortable while lying in bed as well.These 2 headsets are worlds apart as far as sound quality goes. It's actually that noticeable. I just don't use the 150's because of a real difference in quality. In fact, if my 141's ever stop working, I'll buy another set of 141's. I use my headset primarily to listen to talk radio every night before falling asleep. I occasionally listen while watching a movie or listening to music. The 141's really shine then.

They have the look of an over-ear style headphone but the earpeices are too small to fit completely over your ears. They end up pressing your ears flat against your head, which becomes extremely painful when you're wearing these for extended periods of time.-As the battery drains you find yourself having to adjust the frequency to get rid of static.-They do not handle bass well. If your listening to music with alot of bass or watching a movie with explosions and such the sound becomes distorted.-The base has an auto off feature.

The acting is terrible and the story is loosely strung together. This plays like a b movie from the 70's. It's too bad because films from this region can be truly fascinating and give us a safe window into a volatile region. Is female castration horrible? Of course it is.

This hymnal is suitable for family worship and contains a blend of music that all ages will enjoy. It also has a verse of Scripture listed for each of the over 600 hymns which gives an even deeper appreciation of the truths contained in the hymns being sung!

The neck straps are awkward to adjust and kind of ugly, and the dye in the fabric fades significantly upon first washing, and it fades way more than the other pieces in this set, so it all looks very uneven (plus it faded in blotchy patches all over the apron). The stitching on the pocket is already coming undone from me putting my CELL PHONE in there (so nothing big/bulky), and I've only had it about a month or less. And the design isn't that great - the chest bib sort of sit awkwardly and doesn't lie flat, it's designed a bit too narrow if you ask me.

Cain, an everyman from the Upper South, must interact with other squad members, some good, some bad. After a brief interlude in Paris and a visit to the infamous Rue Pigalle, Cain moves up to front. Dead bodies appear. The author's tone is realistic and occasionally gritty as he unfolds this war story through young Cain's eyes. It's well-written and a good read. If you've read Ambrose's D-Day work or seen the film \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", you'll appreciate this tale as a useful sequel about war at the squad level. The author's background as explained on the book cover gives him special insight in developing this fictional memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer stock yuck","review":"Wow, this book is horrible.Lackey is never a particularly challenging read, but at least I can usually finish the book.

The characters are hideous little stereotypes, the Regina character is too Mary Sue to be true, and the plot... ouch. The potentially-interesting political intrigue angle is abandoned for huge stretches of time, and everyone gets dragged out of the Gypsy lifestyle into ACK-TING!Basically, if you have some burning desire to be brought inside the exciting world of community theater, this book will give you a very thorough tour.

The book that really changed my life.","review":"An incredible book. I have to say that after reading this book, everything in the world became clear. Although I certainly don't agree with Sagan on everything, the book gave me reasons why I shouldn't, and why I should be passionate about some things and critical about things for which there is no evidence. This book drove me to read more, to become more political, to become more scientifically literate, to generate discussions, to quest for knowledge, and to understand why people believe in things for which there is no proof. I say that not to look down on others, but to understand them. In a way, this book generated a \\"religious experience\\" in that it totally changed my view of the world in a positive way. Read it. Everyone should read it. To that end, I have purchased three copies to give away to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"I love this book.

TABLOID JOURNALISTS who have NO credability in mainstream thought. Though I agree with practically everything Sagan says in this book, he commits an unforgivable sin of logical presentation. NOT ONCE does he explain WHAT then scientific method is. It is very possible that over 50% of all Americans do not know what the scientific method is. Sagan should have devoted some space to explaining what this thing 'the scientific method' is. Though it sounds grand, it has many limitations. Instead of wasting our time with his rantings, he should have taken some time educating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Carl Sagan!","review":"If you've ever been tempted to buy a book that told you how to have an out-of-body experience, contact the dead, or attract UFOs to your doorstep -- or if you just need some help in sifting through the barrage of New Age b.s. that we're constantly - well - barraged with -- Sagan's book is a great place to start.

It debunks almost all the things that the credulous general population believes in.

Talk about arrogant scientists! The notion of diagnosing an entire community with a mental disorder based on a few ancedotal observations betrays the writer's profound simplemindedness, and reveals a total misunderstanding of science. He or she should look up some statistics on scientists' marriages and then read Dr. Sagan's book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Science?","review":"I find myself perplexed at Sagan's utter lack of consideration for the area thru which matter-science and spirit are interoperative. One example is his comment regarding abduction scenarios and why aliens never are \\"caught\\" by house alarms hooked to cameras and the like. I mean, I thought we were talking about alien phenomena, not the babysitter or neighborhood crook.

Sagan and all the members of the Church of the Scientific Inquisition need to justify every scientific discovery with an affirmative answer to the following: Will knowing this increase human happiness? If the answer is negative (as it clearly is for such things as the ability to manufacture bio-terrorist weapons) then let us bury that scientific discovery and be done with it. Sagan and his other scientism buddies worship science for its own sake. We need to judge everything according to whether it makes us happier or not. Once you make something other than human happiness be the criterion for what is good or bad, you have disengaged yourself from the species and are an enemy of mankind. If science helps-great! If it unleashes tools and weapons that no one can control-to the trash heap it must go!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Jumble of Crap","review":"This book is worthless. It's not even worth reviewing. Carl Sagan doesn't address any particular occurance in detail (maybe a paragraph), he just generalizes things. Essentially this book is a waste of time. Read some Joe Nickell instead.The author talks about aliens and UFOs, but he doesn't review any of the important cases. You won't learn anything after finishing this book. He doesn't even show pictures of the things he calls fake.I'm a skeptic myself, but I think this is the most overrated book of the \\"skeptic genre.\\" This is only for lazy people.

Someday both books may be considered 20th-century phenomena, if only for their astonishing rarity. Centuries from now, assuming humankind survives, Sagan's philosophy will almost certainly be closer to the prevailing worldview than any similar works of our time. So few people today--even writers--seem able to differentiate between reality and superstition, and fewer still manage to do so while maintaining a sense of balance and wonder about the two worlds of science and myth. On the subject of myth only, I believe the late Joseph Campbell came close, but even he could have learned a great deal about that subject from Dr. Sagan. I wish everyone on earth would read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for believers and skeptics alike","review":"I started reading DHW only a few months after I had converted from Christianity to agnostic atheism. I'm glad I did, because Carl Sagan gave voice to a lot of the thoughts that had been stewing about in my mind. It also made me understand how even the most intelligent of us can give in to sentimental appeal, and abandon reason.Perhaps the most important thing that this book did, though, was instill a (rational) sense of wonder. Sagan's fascination with the universe comes through in many portions of DHW. And though some people have suggested that Sagan treats science as a religion, I'd disagree; instead, science is simply the best tool for ascertaining the truth, whether or not you believe in god(s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful argument for reason and logic over superstitious nonsense.","review":"A wonderful tool for recognizing valid and invalid arguments and points out many fallacies in the arguments many people make.

In it, he explains what science is really about and how we have nothing to fear from it as some people might claim. In fact, we owe a lot to science and it is perhaps the only hope we have in the battle against ignorance. Various topics and world affairs are addressed in an eloquent way so as to be within the grasp of anyone. This is not a book on atheism even though the controversial topic of religion does come up now and then. You should not fear it landing in the hands of your 12 year old. I just wish I had read and understood it sooner myself. It is truly a life-changing book for those interested in seeking the truth about our world and universe. It should be made required reading in schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark","review":"The language is accessible to the non-scientist (and the aspiring scientist), and everyone should get something out of it.

It's also an enjoyable read, though the later chapters tend to repeat concepts from earlier ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"I read a lot, and this is my favorite book of all time. This book is nearly perfect. Sagan truly holds science up as a \\"candle in the dark.\\" It is a book that champions substance over spin, reason over rhetoric, data and honest analysis over everything else. It is primarily a manifesto designed to encourage clear and critical thinking.Dr. Sagan brilliantly describes what sets science apart from the pack. In science, people are encouraged to question the orthodox. Scientists win fame and accolades if they successfully challenge a long-held theory. Religious people who challenge the church don't fare as well. This, more than anything else, has led to the spectacular success of science over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very scientific book","review":"I have a background in Science, but I think the argument Mr. Sagan is making is not a very sound one. To rationally argue that science is \\"better\\" for mankind, you have to define an evaluation criteria of what makes human life better. He does not do that and tries to provide examples of how science helps move human life forward on the values that are present today. And then he mixes up many things...its just not great"},{"rating":"1","title":"embittered rear-guard rant, prolonged battle with straw men.","review":"Poor Carl-- he alienates the very people he wishes to reach by LAYING DOWN THE LAW and subverting his own message. I would have felt more empowered if he had given more time to the anti-scientific forces that kept, say, Chiropractry out of mainstream medicine for so long. As it was I felt preached-at and talked-down-to. Ultimately, non-scientists are structurally denied access to the equipment we would need to test any of our hypotheses about the world-- so unless they want to allow free access to the super-conducting super-colider we non-scientists are out of luck. No test, no respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Club Mistake","review":"We try to mix things up in our book club and try different genres as much as we can. This book was out of my comfort zone.

I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book that could possibly change your life","review":"I read this book years ago, probably shortly after it was released, so I was quite young (early 20's), but I credit this book with at least sparking (if not establishing) my current worldview. I, like many young people (and old), had a slant towards gullibility and definitely naivety. I wondered about things like UFOs and the Bermuda triangle; conspiracy theories and other 'mysteries'.

If you have even the remotest interest in science (or pseudo-science for that matter), you will find this fascinating and stimulating reading.Buy a couple of copies for yourself and your friends.

He even acknowledges psychaitry as a pseudo science, which others have not been brave enough to do. This is a beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about science","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Personally I enjoyed his discussion of the paranormal the best. I would love for some of my friends who believe in UFOs, Astrology or psychic ability to read this. He uses pretty sound logic to discredit some of these silly beliefs.

Believe in ghosts? An afterlife? Alien abductions? This book will help you break those superstitions.This book really is a Candle in the Dark, with all the conspiracy theories and such flying around these days.The only small criticism I have is about Sagan's predilection for talking about Alien Abductions and UFO's. Half of the book was a debunking of this topic, which is fine, but by the middle of the book you're like \\"OK! Sagan . . . We get it . . . Alien abductions are hogwash.

It shows through dozens of examples how scientific thinking is superior to magical-thinking. In writing my book about autism, I found it to be common that parents are being caught by pseudo-science and not investigating things for themselves. I would have loved to have interviewed Carl about his comments on this autism phenomena going on right now. He would find it quite interesting, no doubt. It was very clear that Sagan cared very much about our planet(see Cosmos) and that would some readers would see as hate of much of the human race is actually a deep caring that supercedes status-quo humanitarianism.I would recommend this book to the religious right and the radical left.Jeffrey McAndrewradio broadcaster and author of \\"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I don't feel I can add anything that hasn't already been said in the other 409 reviews (at the time I'm writing this), but I just wanted to throw my 2 cents out there to say this was a great, informative, read in typical Carl Sagan style.

However, the middle chapters of this work - which labor the point that ghost, aliens and the occult are improbable explanations for more prosaic events - begin to wear thin after 100 or so pages. I recommend the first and last of the book wholeheartedly, the middle could have used a bit more red ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I think the most relevant comment I've seen is from Cathy Sahu above, \\"Who Are You Talking to, Dr. Sagan?\\"I'll save you 457 pages:Science = goodIf you don't believe in alien abductions the book is nothing more than preaching to the choice. And pretty poor preaching to the choir at that. The book attempts to be encyclopedic and ends up having as much depth as your average encyclopedia article. Sagan ignores evidence contrary to his position. He glosses over difficulties his position brings up in order to offer a more unified-looking front. He loves science but seems uninterested in the science of science, having absolutely nothing to say about the philosophy of science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Hightly predictable apology for science; interesting (and required) maybe for the non-scientist.

Nothing but good things have been said about it. I absolutely loved it and think every person should read it.Sagan advocates critical thinking and skepticism. With great insight and humor, Sagan shows us how people are duped into accepting dubious claims, and how everything comes down to evidence. If the evidence does not support a claim, why believe it?The first part of the book deals with science and why we are supposed to questions all beliefs and ask for evidence. The second part deals with particular claims and why they do not warrant our acceptance of their truth. The end of the book deals with stereotypes, the wonders that science brings to light, and why science is a candle in the dark.\\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" is an invaluable tool for the modern citizen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for the human race as we enter the 21rst century","review":"The scientific method itself is more important than any one of its resulting hypotheses.Humankind should take special care of recognizing questionable claims, since there will be many unscientific and questionable claims being made during the next several years (around the beginning of the 21rst century).This book is a good reminder to think twice before believing anything"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a non-scientist who is interested in science,so...","review":"The Demon Haunted World is quite enjoyable. Carl Sagan believes it is important to take the time to explain, for layman like myself. He is pretenious at times but he doesn't talk down & makes complicated subjects clear. This book is not for people who cannot change their pre-conceptions or do not have a curiosity for worlds they are not trained for. People who cling to pseudo-science, faith healing, channeling, alien abductions etc. are probably not reading Carl Sagan in any case. Dr. Sagan, more than anyone wants to believe in alien visitation but real evidence is not there. He is persuasive in his faith in science over that of a supreme being. However, they are not mutually exclusive. One requires proof, the other, faith. Every time I read or hear something by Sagan, I want more. Unfortunately, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than words can express","review":"Having read all of the reviews above this one, I find that I have little to add to the previous praise. However I would like to say that I find it quite saddening that the kinds of people who would not consider reading this book are EXACTLY the kinds of people who SHOULD be reading this book.

This CD is better than any of the other \\"slow jam\\" compilations, due in no small part to its consistency. You will not need to skip any of these songs. While it does contain songs that are probably already in your collection (Fire and Desire, You Are My Starship), it also incorporates those songs that you've been waiting to appear on Slow Jams, Smooth Grooves, etc. (Kiss and Say Goodbye, Your Body's Here With Me).

I don't like the drawing style itself, but the content of the pictures perplex me. The drawings are somewhat crude to say the least, and I couldn't understand the relationship between the picture and the text. I can understand there being a little cartoon of people in an orgy when the text is talking about Barthes' perception of Sade's literary work.pictures.

In addition to all the great info and recipes for my 2 lb loaf machine, there are others for smaller machines that I will be able to use as a single or double and use my stand mixer.

I called their 800 service number and was told by a service tech that it wasn't powerful enought. I don't use oil based paint only latex. The infomercial never said it wouldn't spray latex and the box doesn't say anything either. In the instructions it mention latex when talking about clean-up...even though you can't use it.

I fully disagree with the High volume Low pressure that the product claims, as the volume it outputs is actually very low and \\"sprinkly\\" rather than a good solid \\"wall of paint\\" like those cheap spray paints in a can.

So, I spent the additional $84 and got the right one from the local store. With this sprayer you need to thin the mix, that is a pain.

Had to thin the enamel (rustoleum) 30-40% before it would spray properly. Yes, this works with thin materials close to the viscosity of water. Good finish, minimal overspray, easy application. Next I tried a latex stain. Even after it was thinned 50-60% it would not spray well. Totally useless for this material. Water clean up required a lot of scrubbing because the paint that gets in the air passages ends up being blow dried. I'm glad I have less than $55 into mine because its not worth the retail price.

For some reason that doesn't scream scary story to me. I found it so difficult to read through boring paragraph after paragraph that I finally said enough is enough and put this book down. I expected so much more from this author as alot of people praise his work. This is the first book of Lee's that I've read and will likely give him one more chance but...I hear his other book Creepers (out of print) is really good.

Definitely not your typical Edward Lee.I gave it two stars because the side bits with the 'necks and other minor characters were rather good. Mutant roaches? Giant eels? Loved it!

However, for me this one fell a bit flat. I am unclear about the order in which his works were released, but in this novel he almost seems to be trying to market it as pornography with a nod to horror, instead of the other way around; many of the scenes are explicit with no real reason for their inclusion, and the overarching plot seems a watered-down version of a long series of better works, with the sex spin added for apparent shock value, not because it actually added anything to the plot. This book was disappointing if you like Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definiately Rated R","review":"I decided to give Edward Lee a chance, I'm not much of a horror reader- I prefer the movies.

Overall the rest of the story was entertaining, there was always something lurking around or something questionable going on, it was hard to put this book down- I read it in two days, it was very suspenseful. I would probably read Edward Lee's next book, but if the rape and sex scenes are even more than they were in this book, it will probably be the last I read from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a sorry sorry hack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"edward lee laughs at YOU as he goes to the bank.dont buy any of his books pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a Monstrosity","review":"This bok was jsut plain BAD. Graphic violence and gore are acceptabel IF the story's good, and it furthers the story. However, the gore and violence in Lee's book does neither. THe plot is threadbare and contrived, and the surprise ending seems to be tacked on - an \\"oh, by the way, here's how this all fits together\\" - There are also gaping logic \\"holes\\" in the story, and macguffins that leave the reader frustrated. I'm willing to suspend disbelief in horror, but not at the expense of how a rational person would or could be expected to react.Lee's writing style is quick and easy to read, and pacing is good - the talent's there, just not the creativity and ability to \\"scare\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and seemed to have been written way too fast","review":"As a fan of extreme horror, I was looking forward to this book after I picked it up and read the jacket blurbs. I was disappointed, alas. There were some genuinely creepy moments, but it didn't hang together, either plotwise or logically. There were so many unbelievable coincidences and inexplicable motivations and cliched characters and situations, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief. The ending was so rushed and predictable, it was hard to care who was killing who. This was the first Edward Lee novel I'd read; he has a good reputation, so I plan to give him a chance and try one more of his works before writing him off as a semi-hack. But based on this one book, I'll take Bentley Little, Graham Masterton, or Stephen King any day of the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge by the cover","review":"The cover makes no sense, there is a silly subplot which is totally unnecessary, sometimes it reads like adolescent fiction. Those are the negatives, for sure. However, this was a fast entertaining read and as long as you don't expect something brilliant you might like it. I loved it, but I really love this author. He is a fun author to read. This is by no means his best book, but for fans of Lee or hardcore horror in general I suggest you read it ( it will only take a few hours). If this is your first Lee book please try some of his other books as well. I guess it is pretty obvious I really like this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the author twelve years old or something?","review":"This is one of those books that I wanted to like based on the hype surrounding it and the author. I regret that I was sorely disapointed. The novel has plenty of poorly written sex and rape scenes that are punctuated by gore that fails to ever be frightening or even establish the slightest bit of suspense. Even the blurb on the inside cover is dull and unconvincing.In the end Ed Lee writes like a twelve year trying to gross out his friends. This would be ok if only characterization and the art of story telling don't get in the way.Sorry Charley"},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of the book says it all","review":"By far one of the worst books that i have ever read.

This is a pretty tame book for the king of sick, the one and only Edward Lee. Monstrosity is more like a B-movie put out by a man that also makes block-buster movies. Monstrosity is much tamer than most of Lee's stuff and a good starting point for the main stream to read Lee. This is a fun read with monsters and mad scientists, sex and some gore (this is Lee after all).

The love story is well done with enough emotion to make it seem realistic.

Finally it has.Both are in top form and the new songs from the upcoming album that they choose to hightlight are in par with this past classics. Always above almost everyone, the songwriting on the new tracks adds depth and brilliance...two things missing from today's music.The interviews featured are great to give you a in-depth look at how they work together and create their magic together.The only drawback of this disc, and the only reason that it didn't get a perfect '5' score is that I wish it had been done in 5.1. The music is great though in it's two channel mix and sounds crisp and the visuals are crisp as well.Pat and Neil prove that they can stand along side and show the newcomers of music what it is all about...and do a better job of it.

The rendering of the story could have been influenced heavily by the style of a communist storyteller, writing a biography of communist saint Breshnew or marshal Shukow.Few facts. Tons of incense. Sprinklings of modern management thought.Not devoid of facts, but these are incoherently interspersed into a rambling storytelling about all and everything.This book did waste my time and continuous factless ramblings made me feel angry at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and time!","review":"Very disappointing. 98% presentation and 2% substance.

There's almost no info on the technical aspect of i-mode, except that it is packet-switching and runs on PDC. The authors attributed the success mainly to the management team. That's where they miss the point. After reading the book, you would still have no clue why i-mode succeeded in Japan, but has yet to dominate in other world regions.I would give it 0 star.

It is not to believe in what the writer states but to test everything against the word of god. It states that men and women will have visions. I have had visions myself especially of the rapture. I have had it 3 times in fact. And the best part of that was it gave me hope and excitement. I have read a few books with the same similarites of what they were shown by God and I believe we are close to his return. It also states in the bible that there will be many false prophets that come in the name of Jesus too. So read and compare with other books listed on amazon and compare that to the bible.

It is pretty obvious that the whole book is full of lies and deceptions that don't need to be spiritually fueled. I guess Choo Thomas did her homework analyzing the bible and believer's mindset.

And surely Choo was believing for her mother's salvation. But, Jesus complimented her on her strong WILL. Not her faith. Wow!

There are several things that made me feel bad, but I think the most troubling was that a lot of the statements could not be backed by the Bible. I will mention one. When she said Jesus dressed up special for his birthday on Dec. 25. I know the real Jesus knows when His birthday is and we all know it is not Dec. 25. This day was chosen by Constantine's mother, who was a pagan worshiper. She knew this was the date that most pagan worshiper use as there god's birthday, Dec. 25th.

He can recite it to us, we've read it so much. It is a cautionary tale, but not in the creepy Hansel & Gretel sort of way. It shows how \\"mommy ducks\\" can get frustrated with \\"little ducks\\" when they don't listen. Daisy is never really in danger... and I think a little anxiety is good! This book has helped my son understand that he needs to listen to Mommy & Daddy because they are always looking out for his safety. When the family is out and about, and my son acts like Daisy (innocently curious, but nevertheless, NOT listening to our cries to stay close), my husband and I say \\"come along Daisy\\" or \\"you must stay close Daisy.\\" This helps my son to remember the importance of listening to Mommy & Daddy. Besides this educational benefit, it is an awesome story! One that the whole family will remember even as my son grows into a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you parent or teach a gifted girl, you need this book!","review":"This book was an eye-opener to me about my daughters and about myself.

I have been surviving on laundry bags for the longest time and it was getting just a bit tedious. But given that I had very limited space for a laundry sorter, and that I desperately needed something to sort my laundry with, I went ahead and ordered it.It's not terribly well made, if you are expecting something solid and well constructed, this is not it. At best the material can only be described as flimsy, and the rods holding the bag open is not exactly the best design. The pocket holding the rod in place should be overlapping, so that the rods do not slide out, causing the entire bag to collapse... BUT for the price, and its functionality, this item gets top marks from me. It fulfils its purpose, takes up minimal space for a 3-bin sorter, and best of all, it folds away for storage when not in use. It has motivated my lazy husband to at least throw in his clothes in the right bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and cheap","review":"I admit I stuff a lot of laundry in my hamper before I wash it all. But the very first time I carried this hamper from my apartment to the building washer/dryer machines... One of the handles broke. The wire frame bent. And the plastic supports popped out. This hamper may be fine using it like the picture shows (half full at most) but fill it up with clothes and the strain is simply too much. The stitching, the assembly, the frame material are all... simply put... cheap. Rather than waste anymore money on these mesh/wire hampers, I'm going to invest in a couple durable cotton ones with seams that won't split so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sorter","review":"This is a pretty good sorter. It's sturdy, but as with all of these types of sorters, they can become a little clumsy because of the rods that have to be inserted in them.

Instead of the great looking home I was hoping for I wound up with a ridiculously cutsey-cutsey family room, dining room and foyer and a huge bill for all of the rentals and props the stager brought in that I thought my realtor was going to pay for!!!

As he lays back in the tatoo artist's chair, he changes personalities with a 10th century homicidal maniac Roman Catholic priest. The 10th century priest thinks that he has died and that the two nude tatoo artists are devils torturing him in hell. The story gets more and more crazy from that point on. Anger toward the anti-abortion movement with the Roman Catholic church seems to be the motivating factor behind this book, but I found that the book was full of odd-ball humor and dark dry wit. If you are a Roman Catholic, you will probably find this book very offensive. This is a shame because Disch actually writes very skillfully. I think he is underestimated as a writer. Underneath all the anger is thoughtful social commentary, bitter irony, and masterful use of the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you may think!","review":"The cover sets-up expectations that may not be met in the movie itself.

In this pilot you have four stories about the passengers of the train. What I learnt here is that a woman can throw a man out of a train! and the man can survive and claim revenge! ha ha.

Gone are the ingenious settings and situations and characters - replaced with boring characters (even more boring since they are duplicated both in Phaze and Proton) and the prurient leerings of a aging, frustrated voyeur.It's sad when a talented author loses the spark.If you are desperate for more Phaze, I advise checking it out from the library.

I don't know how it happens, but it most certainly does. Maybe it's the fact that the lyrics are just abstract enough to engage the listener, but not disillusion or confuse them.

Don't buy any product from Simer, period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this for my elderly parents so they could remove standing water from around their home. Unfortunately, they were never able to use it because it was broken when received. Apparently, it had been returned previously because the styrafoam packing pieces which stabilize the unit in the box were missing. Therefore, the pump just bounced around in the Simer box. Also, whoever packed it for shipping is not the sharpest tack in the box. The small Simer box was dumped into a HUGE box with one piece of brown packing paper and nothing else.The only positive thing I can say is that Amazon was great about giving me my refund. Because it was received damaged, they even paid for the return shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major issue with buying this through Amazon.","review":"I see others have had this problem with Simer pumps as well. Be forewarned. Even though the description states \\"1-year manufacturer's warranty\\" this is bogus. If you call Simer and try to get anything done with this pump in a years time, they will tell you Amazon is not a certified Simer dealer and will not honor the warranty. Mine quit working after the first time I used it. I have no choice but to ship it back to Amazon (at my cost) and hope they give me some sort of a refund. I bought this thing about 6 months ago so I'm not sure what to expect. I will update this review when I find out the outcome.As far as the pump goes. It worked fine that one time. Now when I plug it in, it just hums and draws no water. That one use wasn't worth the $55."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good so far","review":"When the item arrived, there appeared to be oil leaking out of the unit and the inside of the box had a large oil stain.

It took a while but there is only so much volume you can push through a garden hose size opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver","review":"This pump literally saved my heating unit. After torrential rains flooded my basement and rising water level threatened to destroy my new furnace, I called for the pros to pump out my basement, but they were too backlogged with emergency calls to timely respond to my problem. I quickly ordered this unit. It came via overnight shipping and quickly went to work pumping hundreds of gallons of water out of the affected area. It's fast, reliable and easy to operate. This unit also pulls double duty emptying my outdoor fish pond for cleaning. One of the best purchases I have ever made and I will never be without this unit.

Hired by a distraught bridegroom to find his runaway bride, the doggedly persistent Lew Archer soon finds himself investigating a series of murders that spans more than two decades as well as half a continent.This very intriguing \\"whodunit\\" contains smartly written dialogue, many well crafted and evocative descriptive passages, a large number of interesting characters and an unexpected gem of an ending. Moreover, the narrative is fast paced, compelling and emotionally gripping.Definitely one of Macdonald's most unforgettable and jarring efforts. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, not Quite 5 stars..","review":"With spare prose, fine descriptions of South Cal, circa 1960, and some very interesting characters, this is in many ways among the author's best. Very vivid dialogue on occasion gets slightly tiresome, though, and this book almost seems like a theatrical play, though this is very characteristic of this outstanding mystery author. And though the ending was definitely a nifty twist, I was really not convinced that the culprit was capable of the crimes, from a logistics and pyschological angle. The murder of a female professor was not shown as the truly horrid event which it would be in real life. Some of the Greek tragedy inferences indeed provided greater depth to this book, and they may be spotted only after a second reading, which I did after some years. Probably 5 stars for any other mystery writer, but for me, though worthy of a second read, perhaps not quite 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Mysteries of All Time","review":"This was the finest novel Ross MacDonald penned and that means it's the best of the best. After you read the first chapter you can't put it down. When it was published I think the novel lost the Edgar Award for best novel of the year to an Ellis Peters book. That shows how even writers can be hugely mistaken. It's a novel that grips you and doesn't let go until, at the conclusion, the grip squeezes you even tighter.An intricate plot but MacDonald doesn't cheat the reader. All things are explained at the end. Several of MacDonald's other novels are excellent but this was his finest. If anyone ranks the ten best mysteries of the 20th century, this has to be on the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure","review":"Reading Ross MacDonald is a voyage into the past. His work is evocative of bygone eras and landscapes, and even on initial publication there was something decidedly old-fashioned about the attitudes, manners, the morals, the entire approach to detective fiction. Nearly twenty years after his death, a lot of readers are going to find him so dated as to be inaccessible. So, also, are Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammet, Arthur Conan Doyle and yes, Jane Austen, another old-fashioned writer of novels of manners.The Chill isn't an action-packed thriller, it isn't laden with pyrotechnics, it doesn't feature dashing heroes saving the world, and Archer most definitely is not going to get the beautiful girl in the end. So what?Reading this this book is more like savoring fine wine from an old bottle. Enjoy the flavors of the past, the convergence of themes and the complexity to the last drop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading along with beautiful writing.","review":"Don't be fooled by me saying this story is the usual Ross MacDonald.Because the usual Ross MacDonald is a terrifically written and involved plotbonanza every time.i am going to be reading all of his stories..."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best, as good as Chandler","review":"RM is generally not quite up there with Chandler.

Not as good as \\"The Underground Man,\\" another MacDonald book, but similar and still very well done. The writing style is hard-boiled, but literate.

But he said something else in his article that made me laugh, as it was so true.He said that the singular fact of a Ross MacDonald book is that once you've read it and put it down, you can't remember anything about it. That is such a truism; I've read some of his books more than once, not knowing if I've read them before. And if I took one from my collection and began reading, I know I'd think it was the first time. They are all so similar and forgettable.

Admittidly pretty hokey, but the recording was my favorite thing--ballads mostly, sung in a voice so plaintive and full of yearing and sadness. This recently purchased album was such a disappointment that I started skipping to the next tune over and over until the whole dismal business finally ended and I just tossed it into the trash bin with no regret, other than having wasted more than $10..

(3.5 stars)","review":"While the 1979's \\"Voulez-Vous\\" for many people does not make Top 3 of ABBA albums, it's one of the best disco-parties you can ever come across. Some of the songs are really the cream of ABBA, including two ballads \\"I Have a Dream\\" (track 3) and \\"Chiquitita\\" (track 8) that - depending on your opinion - either slow down the party, or come at the right time for dancers to chill. Among the best purely pop songs ever produced by ANYONE are \\"Angeleyes\\", \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" and the bonus track \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!\\", later so well sampled in Madonna's \\"Hung Up\\". The album also includes minor gem \\"If It Wasn't For the Night\\", where the supergroup somehow came close to successfully emulating their signature hit \\"Dancing Queen\\". Cohesive in genre albeit slightly uneven in quality, \\"Voulez-Vous\\" is however not any less intoxicating than any of ABBA longplayers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disco-Inspired, but Still Abba.","review":"Abbas sixth album, \\"Voulez-Vous\\", from 1979 was recorded over a period of one year with the title track is actually recorded in Miami USA. Nevertheless, the album is one of the group's most consistent and most successful.Only a few songs fall into the category of \\"forgettable\\" and besides the big hits \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Voulez-Vous\\", \\"Does Your Mother Know\\", \\"I Have a Dream\\" and \\"Angel Eyes\\" it has the strong \\"As Good as New \\", which really might have been able to make it as big as\\" Chiquitita \\".The album is Abba's most funky and disco-inspired, which characterizes the majority of the songs. Though this is not to the point where the characteristic Abba sound is gone.There are also songs of Abba's well-known musical style, such as \\"I Have a Dream\\" and \\"Chiquitita\\".\\"Does Your Mother Know\\" is Abba rock as its best. All in all, a beautiful and like always a well produced album from the group.The bonus-tracks are great additions; especially \\"Gimme! Gimme\\" Gimme\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme! Gimme!

Gimme!\\", \\"Voulez-Vous\\" and \\"Does Your Mother Know\\", this is ABBA's disco album, with heavy Bee Gees influences present in \\"Summer Night City\\". Other songs that I find enjoyable are the catchy \\"As Good As New\\", \\"Angeleyes\\" and \\"The King Has Lost His Crown\\". The one song that I find annoying is \\"Lovers Live a Little Longer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but OK","review":"I got a bit worried when I heard this album for the first time in 1979. It is more style than content. The magic of the previous albums is barely there. It is, of course, better than most other albums released in 1979, but hardly up to ABBA's incredibly high standards. The beautiful Chiquitita is a classic and some of the other tracks, like Angeleyes and If It Wasn't For The Nights, are excellent. Voulez-Vous and Does Your Mother Know are almost embarrassing but immacculately produced and great fun. ABBA made more convincing disco tracks later on (Gimme Gimme Gimme and Lay All Your Love On Me). And they made the best music of their lives towards the end of their career, notably The Winner Takes It All and the Super Trouper LP in 1980."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album...but poor re-mastering","review":"I agree with John (from N.Y.), these 24-bit re-masters of the Abba catalogue were a big letdown. In a side by side comparison, the original discs sounded much better than these. The originals were brighter and plenty full; just like the original album sounded.On the other hand, these 24-bit discs sound slightly muddy and the high end (which includes acoustic guitars and cymbals) are flat or dead sounding thanks to the no-noise solution. My advice, is to save your money and keep your old discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you want?","review":"I think that's the right translation of \\"Voulez-Vous.\\" In any case, I was surprised to find a couple of reviewers bashing \\"Chiquitita.\\" I admit it was not my favorite ABBA song way back when, but since then I've come to regard it as their masterpiece of 1979. The sad, sympathetic verses and uplifting, anthemic choruses make this a song with great depth and feeling. Bjorn's mature lyrics, Agnetha's moving lead vocal and Benny's almost barrelhouse piano outro make this song one that can't be overlooked as one of ABBA's great achievements. Other than that, I pretty much agree with the other reviewers points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful disco","review":"ABBA's Voulez-Vous is a great example of disco that has character and joy, and is not faceless and spiritless like most of disco albums of those days.

The story revolves around a couple who move to a village and discover people being killed in way that causes them to become badly discolored by a cheap make-up job. Noel Willman plays a wealthy man with an odd daughter that he is trying to confine. This film seems similiar in plot to the Gorgon, only this film is uneven and less convincing in it's plot. The acting is overall decent, but the story is thin and the ending is predictable. The monster is amusing beacuse it is hilariously bad. This is not a terrible film, but the problems in the story causes it to be only average.

Moreover we get another mix of their first hit \\"Daylight in your eyes\\". The \\"Re-supreme remix\\" is less energetic than the original, but it doesn't mean it's a failure. I would call it a \\"chill-out variation\\" :)Definitely good.And for all the fans a little candy in the shape of a \\"What am I supposed to do\\" - not released before, R&B; track.

He fails to even clearly list formulas in the book. He provides mini C-code programs that will quickly become dated and the book totally useless that you can spend time picking through to eventually derive formulas, assuming they are even correct at this point in time. Do yourself a favor, check it out from the library and take a look at it first. Don't get stuck like I did with an overpriced paperweight. A \\"first course in fuzzy logic\\" by Hung Nguyen may be better. I looked through random pages and at least it has the formulas, how and why they are developed. I'm going to check it out of the library first.

Factual errors appear from beginning to end - starting with Audrey's birthname and ending with her burial site (she was born Audrey Kathleen Ruston, not Edda Hepburn, and buried in the cemetery in the Swiss town where she lived, not on her own property there - see son Sean Ferrer's book for accurate facts). The sad facts of Audrey Hepburn's life were also exaggerated in the text, as if her charm and elegance are not interesting enough. By all accounts, people who knew Audrey, however, never had a negative word to speak of her. While the photographs in this book do justice for Audrey Hepburn's beauty, the inaccurate and poorly written text is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of style and grace","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful collection of photos of the most mesmerizing women ever to grace the silver screen. After watching \\"Roman Holiday\\" I found myself wanting to know everything there is to know about the princess whose style and charm could steal any man's heart. I found this to be a great introduction to Hepburn, an excellent overview of her life and movies. The classic photos of \\"Roman Holiday\\" and \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" alone make this a priceless addition to any fan's bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blank Twice","review":"Unfortunately didn't get to hear it.

This is one of the first and best of the \\"ambient dub\\" sub-genre of electronic music -- a beautiful, bass-heavy, laid-back set of electronic soundscapes that sound great when you're chilling at home or too stoned to move.Ambient dub is an offshoot of electronic music that never really dominated the charts anywhere as far as I can tell, but it's a tasty, organic-sounding, and highly agreeable approach to digital music nonetheless. Higher Intelligence Agency piles colourful bloops and bleeps on top of mesmerizing basslines and relaxed beats to excellent effect. This CD is tough to track down, but well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wannabe Lestat?","review":"The problem with this book is that in trying to provide a scientific plausibility for the existence of vampires, it sticks too closely to Anne Rice's model: It almost comes across as a propaganda piece for her Chronicles (she has also authored several other books relating to Rice's works).Ramsland only seems concerned with the Anne Rice literary model of vampire, turning it into something almost like a comic book superhero more suited to the \\"X-Men\\" than any kind of creature with the supernatural trappings that make vampires interesting in the first place.A fairly useless book for vampirological research and one for the Vampire Chronicles completist only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky -- and informative!","review":"I've always been fascinated by the concept of vampirism.

I heard her on NPR's TALK OF THE NATION last week and that's when I went out and bought this book. I recommend the book =--it's very thought-provoking!

First, the acting was pathetic. Absolutely no chemistry between the actors; despite the nearly constant gratuitous sex scene, they didn't quite mesh. Second, and most annoyingly, there were huge numbers of errors, so much in fact that it seemed no one bothered to watch the video before it went final. For example, the movie constantly switches from indoor to outdoor shots. Every indoor shot is clearly done at nighttime; the windows are visible, and always dark. However, magically, every outdoor shot is in the daylight. It just gets annoying. Third, the killer, rather than being a fabled practitioner of black arts, seems much more like a red neck ninja. Overall, its very disjointed, poorly acted, awfully scripted and a waste of time. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Waste of my Time!!!","review":"I love horror movies, but this one sucked!

I enjoyed it very much. I laughed at the aunt, and felt the granddaughter was too much of a brat, the sister was a snob, and Robert Downey Jr. was his usual funny self. The mom and dad were believably accepting of the lifestyles of their children, and that was nice.

Aside from the music, Josie had two of the coolest album covers from the 1980's! Especially her \\"Convertible Music\\". In 1995, she released a dark, gloomy album as Josey Cotton on Roxco Records called \\"Frightened By Nightingales\\". It was produced by Bill Rhea & it's pretty dreadful. If you like her \\"Convertible Music\\"/\\"From The Hip\\" albums, I also recommend both of Tracey Ullman's albums, \\"You Broke My Heart In 17 Places\\" (1983) & \\"You Caught Me Out\\" (1984)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful.","review":"Don't bother wasting your time or money on this.

Ultimately, my solution was far more complex than anything presented in the book, but the book gave me the initial patterns I needed to get started.If you're finding LPs a hard concept to wrap your head around, this would be the book I'd recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizzla is great but he's slackin","review":"I think this album is not very good. After listening to \\"Praise Ye Jah\\" , its sounds really bad. I don't expect it to be as good, but the effort here seems very weak. The music is not as good. His vocals really kill any effort that was made musically. It just doesn't sound that good when Sizzla sings like that. On this album, when he's not singing harder than he should, he sings softer than he should...(like he got kicked in the nads). I prefer the way his vocals used to sound. Overall, this album is weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIZZLA IS DA BEST","review":"The artist Sizzla, is very talented. This particular cd, Ghetto Revolution, I found refreshing and new. The title track Ghetto Revolution is pumping and so is the track, \\"Won't Stop.\\" If you like this album you should check out some of his other albums like Black Woman & Child and Praise Ye Jah to get a better feel for who this artist is. This album, as good as it is, I feel does not fully represent the wonderful talented artist Sizzla is, but it is a great cd to have in your collection none the less.

The lineup isn't bad but they fall short. Surprisingly, the best solo is from Dweezil Zappa on Goodbye to Romance: he captures Randy's solo and adds some taste to it. Mr. Crowley is a disappointment: Y. Malmsteen totally ignores the feel of the song and decides to shred instead, what a shame. Suicide Solution is a dance remix which confuses the hell out of me.

Listen to Ritchie Kotzen butcher \\"Desire\\" and you'll get the point. Brad Gillis did the same when he played with Ozzy after Randy passed away and now misses his chance to redeem himself... I won't even talk about the others (Zappa plays \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" flawlessly though, but that Lisa sounds like she just woke up).

Don't get me wrong it wasn't totally bad, but it may have been better if only of these women actually did something to her. As it is, it seems silly that the title character gets so worked up when nothing has been done to her. Or maybe thats the point, when her copy takes off its clothing, she gets so anxious because this clone of her is actually playing out desires that she is afraid to admit to herself, specifically a need to be an exhibitionist, to be loved by other women, and to feel pleasure. This is the most plausible explanation to why she keeps having these fantasies; sure, you could argue that Miyuki is the victim of this world, but the real reason is that she actually want this. Sadly, the real Miyuki never receives anything but a tease from all these women."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy","review":"Basically its just another story of Alice in Wonderland done in a very CLAMP way.

The kids love wathcing the movies, and tying them to biblical characters, references, and principles heps the youth remember what you are teaching. The only thing I would change is that some of the movies are a little too mature for our group. While they might be fine for high school groups and great for college groups, our groups is younger (grades 3-8), so some of the subjects are too advanced. So I appredciate it even more when they include movies targeted to younger ages - such as Sleeping Beauty in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is a throw off","review":"Don't let the size of the ring in the picture intimidate you it is not really that big and shiny and the sellers are horrible they wont take back the product no matter what they're guarantee really says...The ring is nice if you plan on giving it to a little girl but the size of the diamond is SUPER TINY! not worth the price AT ALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Product - Scratched my paint and broke in 6 weeks","review":"I purchased this and placed it on my new car and within 6 weeks of ownership it has ripped on both sides near the wheelwell as well as scratched the paint from cheap connectors.

It is not, however, a book for the layperson, since it contains much footnoting (and some main text) in untranslated Latin and Italian, and much philological and metrical terminology that only a specialist probably would know. Yet, if the reader is looking for various and influential medieval Italian definitions of tragedy and comedy, it provides a considerable amount. It also contains much discussion and comparison of these varying definitions of tragedy and comedy. Thus, if one is looking for these definitions in order to supplement teaching or provide support for writing an article, dissertation, or book, it is a good resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"London Loves Neil","review":"How could you go wrong?

The biggest let down was \\"Nights in White Satin\\" which anyone that knows there was 2 version released. The one on the CD was the radio play version. The other is the same except before the last refrain thier is a poem down by the lead singer.

While Graeme contributed many intriguing ideas, Ray and Mike were actually very strong songwriters, and they are definitely under represented here.Given that caveat, this is still a fantastic compilation, especially since it includes rare quasi-Moodies classics such as Blue Guitar and Forever Autumn. To me, if they had included Legend Of A Mind, at least one Mike epic and (stretching a bit) One Lonely Room from Justin's 'Songwriter' album, this would have been virtually perfect.As it is, it's pretty darn close.Insane value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody Blues Still Rockin'","review":"I have loved the Moody Blues since I was a young girl in the '60's and their music is timeless.

Hunter's previous work, the excellent Black Death: AIDS in Africa, provided readers with an armful of information about AIDS, WHO, treatment, government policies, etc. The mission of this book was to focus on the feminine perspective, and provide some personal insights from infected people. In that respect, it was helpful. The bulk of the text, however, literally recounts dozens of pages of political and social history of minimal pertinence to either AIDS or other diseases generally, taking \`background' information to an unnecessary extreme. This book would have been far better with these parts edited out, even at the cost of producing a much thinner volume"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont rent just from seeing the cover","review":"I rented this because it had a cool cover and thought it would have some good gore. It starts out good, but it just got dumb middle to the end. The nudity isnt anything special. The gorest parts are when a guy gets shot in the head and blood gets on a white door. The shootout at the end was laughable. They shoot pistols and a shotgun and it takes like 2 seconds to hit something. This reminded me of Rest Stop since that had an awesome cover and had potential, but totally sucked.I just noticed that The Asylum made this, but it looks like a Lionsgate movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually very good","review":"This actually is a very good movie. The acting is well above average and the killing scenes though not overly gory do look very believable. There is a lot of suspence and a pretty good story as well.

So given that, I was expecting a lot. The first two lines of the movie made me realize I had just purchased probably one of the worst low budget movies ever to have been created. The acting was TERRIBLE!! The worst part was the sound quality. No lie, I had to learn how to read lips. I had the volume up full blast and there were times, I could not hear a word that was said. I want to know how this film could be sold! Overall, I would have fell asleep on it, but it was so bad I wanted to see if it could get any worse! Well, it never let me down in that aspect.

This book is restrained in its tone, but Storr's agenda is not neutral -- he clearly objects to what he sees as a social convention that undervalues solitude and overvalues relationship. Another reviewer's insistence here that solitude and \\"loneliness\\" are the same thing only confirms Storr's point. I believe that much of what people call loneliness in this culture is actually alienation, and that alienation is the result of people's deprivation of the alone time that helps nourish the self.

I owned this pillow for over 5 years and it's been through several washes and eventually became flimsy and ripped and all the stuffing was coming out. Again, I got more than my money's worth. I read some reviewers state it was too stiff, but with a few washes and some wear it does soften up. I began using body pillows 16 years ago with my first pregnancy and never stopped.

After only two washings in cold water, and two trips through the dryer on Low, it had shrunk so much that it actually straightened out the pillow when I struggled through putting it on for the third time. I've had to switch to using two king-sized pillowcases, which leaves a lot of loose fabric around the curved end, until I have time to tailor one of the cases to fit the curve.

Cavalli-Sforza puts forward a more factual and convincing identifcaton of the language of Albania being the oldest in Europe.

The lyrics are powerful and she sings it well, it just lost some of its original effect when the song started being played for any and every purpose. The song was originally recorded in reference to Christ for the movie \\"Jesus\\" but the fact that its so vague in its reference that it can also be used as Soap Opera background music makes it a little disappointing.

Now we also have LeAnn dancing on a bar in a soft-porn teen flick! What LeAnn really \\"needs\\" are record sales and fame! LeAnn is very talented and has a etrong voice, but why must she sing to the point of almost screaming as the song gets intense?

I was breezing through the chapters since I already knew C++... and I have to say he did a good job on showing how to set up PHP with Apache. This book also serves as an excellent reference- it shows you several important functions of PHP, as well as an explanation of the usage.The only thing I wish Gilmore had done was explain on how to set up mySQL with Apache. He did a good job explaining how to set up PHP with Apache, but why not show how to set up PHP/Apache with mySQL? It would've been nice if it had been included, but I didn't mind looking it up.

The remastered sound is fantastic. While many remastered CDs often sound too clean, this cd has be able to grasp the spirit of the original recording, so much so at times it feels as if one is standing in the studio with Dylan. To address some criticisms, first, while this is an SACD release, it is a Hybrid which means that it has the capability of playing on a standard CD player. Second, while I'm sure a previous reviewer will disagree...Justin Timberlake will long be forgotten in 40yrs, unlike Bob Dylan; \\"Freewheelin\\" was released over forty years ago and is still great.

'Blowin in the Wind' is a classic Bob Dylan song and rightly, too. The lyrics, beat, and rythm are all top-notch.

I especially like Talkin WWIII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five star album presented in a two star format","review":"Why MFSL opted for the stereo mix is a mystery. Great choice for those who want to listen to this LP with vocals in the center, the guitar way over in the right corner and the harmonica in the left. This isn't a remix either so there are still many instances of the voice whipping over from left to centre at the end of harmonica solos and vice versa. A quick comparison with the far cheaper Hybrid SACD released almost ten years ago shows that the MFSL disc has more compression applied - another example of the CD loudness war. The mono mix - now easily obtainable - is far superior and natural sounding and that was what Dylan and his engineers and producer had in mind when the LP was recorded, stereo mixes were a knocked-out loaded afterthought for 'hi-fi buffs' and would remain so for several more years. One listen to this and it's easy to hear why, best avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best Dylan record sleeve ever?","review":"Sad to say I bought this disc having read Suze Rotolo's book about her time with the maestro, as I really like the cover photograph, not least because of the battered VW van. While they may appear to be very much in love, Joan Baez was waiting in the wings...... Some iconic songs, 'Blowin' In The Wind', 'Hard Rain' and 'Don't Think Twice, It's Alright'- the latter, however, was recorded by Ms Baez for her In Concert Part 2 collection and, in my view, she nailed it.

This album is chalk-full of brilliant songs and amazing poetry. \\"Hard Rain\\" is simply a composition of pure musical genius. \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" is probably his best love song. Although overrated, \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" typifies the beginning of the hippie movement in America that blossomed in the late sixties. \\"Masters of War\\" still remains incredibly relevant since there's always a war being waged somewhere on God's green earth. I could go on and on about this album but let me say this...\\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" belongs in the collection of any serious lover of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart - This item is garbage","review":"After trying to screw this cable into my tv, the screw head detached from the cable and I just had a wire sticking out of the wire.

As a result, I decided to lower my expectations and think of this movie as being introduced to Thunderbirds in a different way. It was definitely worth the matinee price, and I was brave enough to see it twice. I don't think this movie was anything like Spy Kids, like most critics have said about it. I found it very enjoyable, especially the interaction between Jeff (the dad) and Alan (the youngest son) close to the end of the movie.

Buy the DVD when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"imaginative fun for the kid in everyone","review":"Disneyworld, with it's plastic, overtly sickly sweet interpretation of fun is the vacation of choice for families wanting to vacation in a place where dreams become reality. Thunderbirds approches the kid's adventure genre with the same great spirit that embodies Disneyworld as a vacation mecca. Terriffic is the scope of the movie, with it's frenetic pacing and visual energy, any fan of a true action movie will find plenty to cheer about. With a cardboard cutout version of everything a fantasy villlain should be, Ben Kingsley fills his role perfectly. and the rockets and gadgetry will amaze even hardened James Bond Fans. This movie is just plain fun. my only complaint: its too short. The Director (Jonathan Frakes of Star Trek The Next Generation) should have made it a bit longer. 4.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, from start to finish","review":"Frakes, famous for being \\"Number One\\" on Star Trek, directed a film that is definitely Number Two.He had an opportunity to produce a film that would appeal to us 30-somethings and our kids. What he created was a film that is about as related to the Thunderbirds series as \\"I, Robot\\", relates to the Asimov novel.Instead he opted for a teeny-bopper film that can hardly be mistaken for based-on-the-Gerry-Anderson series. If you have never watched the Supermarionation of Anderson, you will probably find the movie annoying, but better than a Hilary Duff film.However, if you did see and love the original cult-TV series, don't bother, it will just disgust you. The passing references to old story lines should have been abandoned when the script was traded for banal drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"THUNDERBIRDS Lacks Wings","review":"Anthony Edwards should have stuck with ER. Although this film is directed toward families, THUNDERBIRDS never seems to get off the ground. Bill Paxton finds himself trapped in space once again, and it's up to his son and two other kids to not just rescue him and his other sons, but to prevent a madman (Ben Kingsley) from robbing banks. The graphics are extremely well done, but the acting is ghastly and the storyline just isn't exciting enough. Although all of the kids and most of the parents declared their satisfaction after the movie ended, I failed to hear the usual banter among the kids on what their favorite scenes were. I got the feeling that they were happy that they got to go to the movie, but they won't be asking for the DVD for Christmas. If you are a parent and are hoping to find a movie that will stimulate both you and your kids, stick with the SPIDER-MAN and SHREK sequels. Leave THUNDERBIRDS at the docking bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel pure and simple drivel","review":"Ok the TV series was totally pathetic ..Davey and Goliath was far more entertaining than this thing and the transition to movie and DVD was no less pathetic..it was cookie cutter predictable and totally one dimentional..whoever gave this thing 5 stars totally neds to have a personality implanted and save themselves the trouble of having to think or feel forthemselves.."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOTTOM 10 MOVIES OF ALL TIME","review":"ACTING: A JOKEDIRECTING: AMATEURISHRESPECT FOR ORIGINAL CONCEPT/ERA: TOTALLY ABSENTWORST ASPECT: LADY PENELOPE'S CLASS IS TRASHEDSUMMATION: A METAPHOR FOR THE TRASHING OF THE HUMAN MIND AND SPIRIT BY 50 YEARS OF FEMINIZING PESTICIDES AND DUMBING-DOWN HEAVY METALS, RENDERING MORONS GETTING PAID AS ACTORS TO VERBALLY AND PHYSICALLY ABUSE EACH OTHER, RESULTING IN THIS TOTAL PIECE OF GARBAGE, DEVOID OF ANY RESEMBLANCE TO THE SPIRIT AND GODLINESS OF THE TRACY FAMILY AND GERRY ANDERSON'S LEGACY.ONE MORE ITEM FOR A LANDFILL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"You have to review this film without reference to the tv series, there is so much different about it and obviously it was aimed at a completely different audience, but there are some basic things you would expect: at least one set piece rescue, the Tracy brothers working as a family, cool or at least surprising technology and some kind of excitement.Instead we get a lot of obnoxious kids running round an island, lots of frantic noise, some very iffy and careless effects, a lot of stars who should have known better.The writers obviously had no new ideas, some of the characters, especially Brains, are rather offensive, and it's boring! At least the Tracys had sense to be stranded in the space station for most of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.......","review":"A horrendous waste of time talent and energy, this has nothing to do with the original Thunderbirds: horrible in every way and a box office flop to boot....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie...","review":"Nice brain candy movie.

Nice, fun and exciting.","review":"I just went and saw this with my ten year old boy. I wasn't a fan of the TV serial since I don't go in for marionettes but this film was very good.The basic story is about the youngest son who wants to join in on the family business of rescuing people. He and his two closest friends get their chance when the Father and 4 older brothers are attacked by a super villain known as 'The Hood' (Ben Kingsley) and need rescuing themselves.I liked this movie. It had a few lessons to teach about earning your way (no shortcuts) and being loyal. The only parts that disappointed me were a couple of \\"man-bashing\\" references during the film that seemed petty and inappropriate. Is anybody else fed up with that kind of stuff?Overall though, I give this a big thumbs up as a family film that had excitement, adventure and even some good laughs.

It is very interesting with a lot of action. There are a lot of mature ideas and content which not everyone might like, but it has a very interesting and twisting plot.

This style of anime is a bit different from which ADV or Manga or Pioneer might produce but still it seems like its going to be a good one. Hope this review is helpful"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent anime series, but not for kids.","review":"I can best compare this series to Record of Lodoss War, but with much more violence and adult themes than Lodoss War had. This series is definately not for children. The story is of a mercenary named Guts and set in a world similar to Lodoss War, but with fewer fantastic creatures and different odd races (most all of the characters are human, with a few exceptions). Do not expect to see a bunch of elves and dwarves and dragons, the non-human characters are few and far between through the first 5 episodes.One hilarious bonus feature on all of the Berserk DVDs is the Outtakes. Basically, it is a series of line reading errors placed over the same scene in the original anime scenes. Watch them after viewing all of the episodes on the DVD so that you understand the context, but they are truly hilarious. It's very different than those \\"outtakes\\" on other animated DVDs, which are actual added scenes.This is an excelent series; any anime fan should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BERSERK-WAR CRY","review":"All I really have to say is this is one of the best anime movies out there.It's a must have for your DVD collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm...where is the hip soundtrack?","review":"I have the DVD of Beserk. I was lured by the upbeat soundtrack of drums and choruses in the background giving that full warriordom atmosphere. It is slightly disappointing.I haven't finished the entire collection because it has just become so less interesting. Yes, there is gore and yes, there is a small guy with a big sword.There is a school of thought that promotes the necessity of a good soundtrack to propel a story foward. Try watching a horror film on mute and see how much heebie jeebies you get. Berserk accomplishes in doing the direct opposite.If you want to be shocked I would recommend Ninja Scroll. If you like a cool soundtrack (at least at the beginning) get Bubblegum Crisis. If you want great character development get Rorouni Kenshin. If you are just in the mood to sate a curious palate, then by all means get Berserk.You have been forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"best anime out there","review":"berserk is definitely one of the best anime you can find. It's just awesome. It has a very complex story with mature elements like love in it. Central themes of berserk are \\"chasing ones dream\\" and \\"the evil coming out of human\\".

This is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Berserk A great Anime Series","review":"I have been watching anime for over 12 years. I have seen many series but this one is probably one of the greatest ever. If you like violent animes this is for you, if you like anime with a great plot and characters this is for you. I mean the main character is incredible, i have seen the entire series and can only say one thing....IT IS INCREDIBLE. I think that if you like anime at all this sereis is a definite must see. This series is not a happy one for all you DBZ and pokemon fans so leae your 4 year old brother in the other room when you watch this one. To sum it up this is a must have for any anime fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible","review":"When I first decided to plop my self down with some buds to watch this I wasn't expecting all too much. It is called Berserk after all-so we figured we'd be letting charadter development and plot sit second string to some high quality mindless violence. Don't misunderstand, there's violence-and plenty of it-but what makes this series so incredible is the intricate relationships between characters and an enveloping story. I can sit and watch all 25 episodes of the series in a row, and then still be completely happy to watch it all over again later. Pick this series up and I think you too will find yourself placing it amongst your favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot missing...","review":"Unfortunately, Berserk starts strong, and gets progressive weaker. The first episode is the actual resolution of events as they stand. Much like the current Star Wars trilogy, you know what's going to happen, so where's the suspense?Although it is beautifully done, it isn't very well done. The story starts with a blast, and events get more and more repetitive until around number 18, when things get turned upside down. Again, with the ending known at the beginning, the suspense is quite minimal.At the end, things take a gruesome turn, and stops just short of the story actually getting interesting.All in all, it really should have been completed before releasing. There would be more to look forward to. It's a good view, but not a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just boring.","review":"I bought this DVD becuase everyone said it was awesome, or at least that it was pretty good.

Maybe if I liked the singer, I could give this 3 stars.... This is a... fine time to be a fan of heavy metal - a lot of talent out there. There used to be only one Bruce Dickinson.

I just didn't like the direction they went on this album, kinda like a riffy-tech metal based around keyboard kinda sound, and the vocals in some areas sounds like Rammstein. It just seemed to me they were trying to go a little more commercial on this one, but in the process they lost some of there balls. On a positive note I did like 'Feast of Burden' and 'Rundown' and DEFINITELY wish they would have gone more in THAT direction but unfortunatly two good songs don't make a five star album. 2 stars definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"still good but not as before","review":"every album of DT is great, that's a truth that no one can deny, even if they have been going through different ways the final sound is always great, i must be honest and say that i love more other older albums as skydancer or the gallery, but the exploration of new ways to create music will always return to their esence, the dark tranquillity... i hope also that DT always continue being one of the best metal bands of the world, please don't change so much. hey niklas, i miss your compositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shining Light","review":"I was standing in a bookshop and this was playing in the background.

The violoence that takes place isn't even all that remarkable or believable. I'm guessing the main reason that this movie was \\"banned in 43 countries\\", was because of the last scene.

The doc seems to have no structure or timeline, and the inclusion of Joe Coleman was just fodder that drags this further with no discernable contribution. Using film footage from future decades was sloppy and rotating the same handful of pictures was boring. No, it wasn't the frankness of the crime, or the gore that was painted (literally), it was the amaturish editing, melodramatic narrative, and slow pace that made me eject this of the way through. I pity anyone who rents this thinking a well-produced documentary with new revelations is in store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-the-top and Boring...","review":"I found the free information about this child-killer over the internet as informative as this incredibly boring, sprawling, repetitive, unprofessionally produced, shoe-string budgeted video. The only two people interviewed in this taped attempt at documentary are a woman who drones on in psycho-bable that carries nothing but the obvious observations we can make ourselves, and the carnival ramblings of a freak show/oddities collector. This guy is about as scary as the subject matter. Viewing this video left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm no cannibal. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Albert Fish","review":"This video was just plain weird. I love learning about the annals of crime but this was justweird and creepy. The Museum curator in the story is one odd person. He is a little disturbed.I found this video a little boring and it tended to ramble on and on about how it was connected tothe bible. I am very tough skinned but this movie is probably not for about 99% of the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"A boring read...the author has not spent a lot of time on creating a cohesive story. Names appear out of nowhere, the storyline shifts abruptly to totally different placea and totally different persons, etc. Why do I need to know about Treynor? Jensen? I bought this book to learn about Fischer Black.There is almost a whole chapter on the Black's family history from the mid 1800's on...at some point I was thinking \\"why am i reading this? why am i spending my time with this book?\\" it was like reading the old testament...I have a huge collection of finance books, being a professional trader. This is one of the less successful buys. This is very disappointing, because it deals with a very interesting person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding scholarship wrapped in a 'John Nash-like' story","review":"The author has done a very good job on two fronts. One, he has dissected a complex area of corporate finance and made it readable to someone with a decent grasp of business. Considering the complexity of CAPM, and how far it stretched conventional wisdom, that alone would be good for 4 stars. However, Fischer Black was an extraordinary person, moving between academia and the practice of devising new financial instruments for Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs with an aplomb few could match.If you enjoyed this book, then I heartily recommend Peter Bernstein's Capital Ideas as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fischer Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Finacce","review":"Poorly proof read and obfuscatingly written, this book had the potential to clarify for the many the importance of Black's contributions. It was a frustrating read due to lack of clarity and lack of simple explanations about the significance of Black's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Storyline","review":"These episodes certainly are not like the Shishio Arc. But really, I cannot say that I wanted a 'shishio type arc' right away because the Shishio Arc took so long to develop all of the various subplots involved. Therefore, these episodes do not have the same kind of emotional battles or dire showdowns the Shishio Arc did, but the developing love story between Sanosuke and Magodalia along with the urgency of the battle between the christians and the government made these episodes very interesting. Basically, you won't know how you feel about these episodes until you watch them...so just form your own opinion, and see them. I came in real pessimist about this arc because I had no idea how they could make it work...but I have been impressed by these episodes, so they just check them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didnt they follow the manga...","review":"What happened to the Kenshin saga?? The kyoto arc ended and in the manga the Jinchuu arc was not complete. So they made fillers. The shimabara arc (if you can even call it an arc since it only lasts a few episodes long) is about another Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu master (ok........) who is christian. Some boring sh** happens and he and kenshin end up dueling it out in the most unexciting final battle ever.I really wish they would have waited for the manga to finish. Even Nobuhiro Watsuki (RK's creator) was wondering why they gave it the Shimabara theme. At anime expo 2002 he was asked what he thought about the filler episodes, and he wondered why they couldnt do something more interesting, like make kenshin go to America. (That would be pretty funny)Dont waste your money on this. download it at the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave says it all.","review":"Thank God the misery is over. This whole story line s*cked.

It works fine for my needs but quality is limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal for the price!","review":"Just received these headphones. The sound is clear and bright with good bass response without sounding boomy, even at high volume. Nice and rich sound. I have a large head and they are moderately comfortable - slightly tight but I expect they will loosen up over time (all my other headphones with similar construction usually do). The audio cable is nice and thick and the plug feels solid when connected to my stereo or an audio extension cable. Good fit around the ears - does not crimp my ears (some models can have cans that are too small and cover part of the ear). Overall - 4 stars!Plan to buy a few more for the family home theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jwin Jhv1008 head phones","review":"I purchased these head phones knowing that they are an inexpensive set and did not expect too much from them. However, now that I have had a chance to use them, I find that they are an excellent buy for what they are. They are a low end headphone that in my opinion out preforms some more expensive headphones that I have owned.The sound response is good and they are light enough that I do not get tired of wearing them after an hour or two. The padding on the ear pieces is comfortable enough and they do not cause me to get too hot while wearing them.The only thing I do not like about these headphones is their obvious low quality plastic construction. I have had no problems with it but they feel like it would not take too much to break them.Over all for the price and quality of these head phones I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for fair sound quality at an affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Pretty Good ...","review":"I like these headphones a lot. I usually use them when I'm listening to my iPod on my computer. What gets me is that the jack doesn't fit right or something. It seems to be loose. I have to keep adjusting it for the sound to come out properly which is very frustrating. But when it is connected and adjusted properly the sound is great ... especially for the price, I think. They are heavy to me and I take them off from time to time so my ears can breathe. Ha. When I have my hair up in a bun they're more comfortable ... that way they're not hanging on my ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound at a great price","review":"I'm very picky about my headphones because I love my music but jWin has always made a good headphone. I bought these to test them for range and to replace my JHP-350's. They aren't the best digital reference headsets I've owned but they are pretty good for the price. They have good bass response and a wide dynamic range. Where they lack a little is in the high end; high frequencies tend to sound a little tinny. Other than the high end, these are great head phones with very low to no discernable distortion and a good quality range. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I am a neophyte at recording, so my opinion may not count for much. My goal was to record with my home computer without spending a lot of money, and it seems I have been able to do that. Headphones are a necessity for multitrack recording, and it's possible to spend huge amounts for headphones, but given my beginner status, I looked for something at a reasonable price. The Jwins were quite affordable, and they work fine and reproduce the recorded tracks accurately enough for my purposes. A time may come when I'll need the $500 phones to do what I need, but for now these suit my purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful trivet","review":"While it is difficult for me to believe that anyone would buy this for $50 as the normal price, at $7, this trivet is well worth it. The workmanship is first rate, and it has three rubber feet to secure it on your counter. For a housewarming or party gift, it would be perfect. I was going to save it for such an occasion, but I like it so much that I'm keeping it myself. It is a larger size so it can support medium casserole dishes by itself.September 12, 2011 update: Over time this trivet has tarnished; getting it shining again is a pain because of the intricate pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"... great return policy.","review":"If you're interested the exercises the author does to stay in shape - this is the book for you.If you're interested in getting into the nuts n' bolts of camping and packing with horses - this is NOT the book for you.

REMO is my favorite brand for tambourines and with the radiant design I figured 'good sound...a little disco...it's a win win.' Not so much. The plastic-like head makes a poor percussion sound that is both tin-like and not professional or quality sounding. The cymbols are almost so over powering its tough to get a smooth groove. I would consider this instrument more for fun than for quality entertainment. This one is going to my young daughter for campfire singing. I would not recommend it for anything more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I bought the first few Ashes books back in the 80s in paperback and remembered them fondly. Recently I downloaded some of the later books for my Kindle and find myself going \\"what the hell\\". D-Day In the Ashes seems like a parody of his earlier works and makes me wonder if somebody else is actually writing the series now. The political characterizations are comical at best and are enjoyed by people that actually think that people like Glenn Beck are serious commentators.

Yes, writing is definitely hard work, completing a project even harder. Congrats to Mr. Lachmann for that. BUT, we are not saying that the book is poorly written - i.e., something that is subjective. We are saying that the book is filled with factual errors! Mr. Lachmann should rather embrace our comments so that he can fix these errors in a new edition, rather than not even address the issue. As for the 'professional' people who gave it such good reviews, it can only be that they didn't do much more than skim over it. If we 'amateurs' saw all these errors, think what the pros would have seen had they actually concentrated on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"This book is one of the few that tries to document the names, dates, and shows of old-time radio. When I first picked the book up I was thrilled to see that their were many bios about radio celebrities and many write-ups about the great radio shows. However, as I read on, I found many glaring inaccuracies. As I continued, I took a pencil and paper and started to write them down. Halfway through the book I had found 2 full pages of mistakes. These mistakes include saying that announcer Russ Hodges was sportscasting well into the 1980s (Hodges in fact died in 1970) and printing the wrong year of birth and death for many other celebrities. Any book on the golden age of radio is difficult to find information for. But at times it seems that the author didn't even bother to research this book. It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy, Sloppy Research","review":"The book is published by Facts on File.

In it, an author is being interviewed about his book, \\"The Complete History of the United States\\". The book has a beautiful binding but tons of glaring inaccuracies.

Yet, I'll try to express myself in this review. It's really very simple. I'm quite sure most people buying this CD are interested in listening to these classic, old school rap songs. Instead, you get Grandmaster Flash basically mixing & scratching every single song at the beginning, and cutting the length of each song from the beginning to the end!! I can't believe that the label who put this out (THUMP) felt the target audience would be interested in hearing a mix sesssion that sounds like it was done by ME in my bedroom when I was 12 years old. People want to hear these songs in an uncut, original capacity, not sounding like they've been transfered from a Saturday night rap-oriented radio mixshow. This is absolutely terrible!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally appropriate mix","review":"handing the mixing duties to grandmaster flash was a perfect idea -- each of these tracks were well chosen, and he handles the mixing duties perfectly.the other folks that have gone on about the mixes trimming the tracks down miss the point of this disc -- it's a dj mix, not a compilation. he does a great job of mixing these tracks as they would have been during the time of their release... it's not crazy remixed a la the skratch piklz, but rather a simple 2 turntable mix that lets the vocals breathe.listening to this makes me feel like i just found an old c60 from back in the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Those Who Love Old School","review":"I am very disappointed in the prior Amazon reviews which gave this album poor ratings. I found the album to be a great compilation of old school rap. I consider myself to be an old school fan with knowledge in the field, and of all the music I have listened to this album is a perfect assembly of the greatest jams from the eighties.

As an adult, I enjoyed it, but there was a little less tension than I would have liked. I gave it four stars because it is a very good choice for a young adult.

A sticker on the cd shouts ' From the people who discovered St. Germain'. That's what I'd call dumb, misplaced marketing. It's like a voice over announcing a movie with 'academy award winner blahblah...' So far the fun is spoiled, because if you compare this album with St. Germain, you'll be dissapointed. You should listen to Llorca simply as a fine jazzdance album. Nothing more, nothing less. The style of music is more like De-Phazz than St. Germain, with 'Indigo blues' , the second track, with the indisputable highest hit-potential. If you already own the albums from De-Phazz and St. Germain, go for Llorca, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love St Germain...you'll love Llorca","review":"My brother bought me New Comer for my birthday last year - and I've loved this cd ever since then.

Llorca is coming to Victoria on June 21st - and I'll be there to see him! Cool grooves - mixing jazz, funk and electronica.

I was unsure about buying this CD initially based on just the one track that I had heard \\"The End\\" but having listened to it I can honestly recommend this to the most discerning listener. Jazzy and groovy. The Jazzy label might put some people off but don't let it as that is just part of the theme to the music.

This movie is quite possibly the worst she ever made. The labyrinthine plot is a 'snoozer' with Stanwyck running a teak plantation in the Burmese jungles. When the animals are more entertaining than the stars, we have to worry. I am Barbara Stanwyck's biggest fan.....she always pulled low class stuff up to her level and she does it with this as well. Unfortunately, the production values do not measure up and I'm sure she would be the first to tell you not to waste your time with this rotten piece of work. Stanwyck is first-rate and it is worth a look just to observe her work with bad material and see what a great actress she was. But don't spend money for this unless you are a bona fide Stanwyck fan who wants a copy of ALL her work in good or bad pictures. This is a great example of a BAD PICTURE."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I mistakenly bought this CD looking for the track \\"Dream\\", which is a lovely soft production.

Evangelion is THE best anime ever. It has a sketchy ending but otherwise it is absolutely enticing. I was saving up my money to buy the dvd's seperate but since I heard about this at such an agreable price, it's an almost definate order. It is basically about beings called \\"angels\\" who attack tokyo-3. It's up to the three 14 year old evangelion pilots to battle the angels. Evangelions are human/robot entities that require teenagers born nine months after the second impact( on sept 13, 2000, an angel called adam crashed into earth wiping out some of the worlds population). These children are Rei, Asuka, and Shinji. I won't tell you any more as not to spoil the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my, this is overrated","review":"I actually took a college level course on Neon Genesis and I have to say it is the most overrated pile of bad anime that is out there.

The animation is poor, the voices are poor, the plot is blah, the ending is horrible.... the whole show is pointless. The characters are so annoying.If this show was just another show on TV I wouldn't even pay it the mind of writing a review, but the fact that there is like this subculture... that acts as though this is japanese cartoon show is the second coming of the bible, I just had to! This show is soooo poor... please watch an episode online or something before buying this.To end this reviw on a note that is not so down...... check out the series Cowboy Bebop, another anime. That is a show that anyone would like, any fan or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"There are those that prasie this series very highly. Well it's time for something different. Haveing watched the series, I can only say I found the characters very unlikeable with very few exceptions. As well as a old and used story premisis of the hero and his giant robo verses the monster of the day with a twist. The monsters are called \\"Angels\\" which is strange when they look nothing like the usuall depiction of an Angel, more demonic look to them really. And the storys atempt to mix Christian sysmbolism with Babylonian mythology doesn't exactly work well here either.If still want to watch it, watch it for what it is, the darker side of being the hero. It's not that great of a series but it's an ok one."},{"rating":"1","title":"its more for the little kitties... to cheesy!","review":"The story is ok(when compared to other great anime like \\"cowboy beebop\\") and so is the little action scenes they do have(which is only 10% of the sereis).

I got into watching anime about 4 years ago, and when I saw this series, it blew me away. Ignore those who put it down because this is a work of geneius and they are just too stupid to see it.Although from the outside it looks like a typical giant-robo anime, after watching the first episode anyone in thier right mind should be able to see that it is not. Evangelion gives an original view of the future, with great city and mecha designs and the even more original forms of the angels.However, the best thing about Evangelion is the characters. They are far more complex and realistic then any other characters I've seen in anything before, with even minor characters being interesting and different.Evangelion is a work of directorial geneius if you buy ANYTHING, buy this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!","review":"I had received some episodes from a friend who downloaded it from a server...

I hope you all love my review. stupid EVA watchers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This set is perfect for the price.

I was a big fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion, and when I found the complete collection, I was estatic!

Trust me once Asuka comes into the series conflicts between her and Shinji make the serious hilarious!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little, too late","review":"This is ADV\`s kick in the face to all the Evangelion supporters. For those die hard fans who bought each DVD as it came out, I feel for you. Even guys like me, who bought the used copys off Amazon got bushwacked here, since the ADV site doesn\`t even mention this product yet. I would gladly have waited for a complete boxed set, especially for such a great price, but it was never promoted. This is \`too little\` money for a great product, that came out \`too late\` for all the real Evangelion fans to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest","review":"If u haven't watch anime in ur life then u should start with this because its one of the best anime ever made u can watch it so many times and u will still learn new things in the series that u didn't know was there, this should definitely be in ur video library and if u are an anime collector u should have this with out a doubtP.S. Movies are coming out soon, go get it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its like a Rollar Coaster...That kills you","review":"im reluctant to even give it a single star. Neon Genesis Evangelion, or EVA as me and my otaku friends call it was terrible. In the begining, we get your overused mecha piolet. Neglected, and reluctant, Shinji Ikari pilots eva 01. His whinning and doubt are easily ignored for most the series which is a lot of buildup. At first i thought this series was phenominal, until i reached the ending. The story just kept getting better, like the first hill of a rollar coaster, getting you ready for the main event, in this case, the ending. But then the ending came. In the las few episodes, eva went from great to the worst anime i've ever seen. Shinji turns gay with the last angel and chaos ensues. This series belongs in the trash. Once you reach the top of the hill of the rollar coaster, you plummet to your death."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One And Only","review":"This is one of the most amazing,confusing,and thought provoking anime series that I have ever seen.It starts to falter near the end of the series though with long pauses of animation(budget problem maybe?),and questions going without answers.I guess thats what the movies are coming out for.Shinji just gets stranger and stranger as the series tends to progress.After about the halfway point it takes a huge turn and gets very serious.After watching this i would recommend getting the movies because they answer the series biggest questions.So if your thinking about buying this,just go ahead, your in for a rollercoaster ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful animation, compelling story.... wacked ending!","review":"I absolutely loved the boxed set. I watched the entire series in one weekend. Seeing one dvd after the other, you really start to like (or dislike) the characters. You make a real connection with them. The only thing that bothered me about the series was the ending. I was incredibly angry that there was not a conclusive ending.... or even one that makes sense. The last two episodes left me wondering, \\"what were they smoking when they made the last two episodes?\\"Overall series outstanding.... ending blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy other collection","review":"The final quality of image and audio aren't the best, and between cuts from frame to frame, are jumps of image.Listen to me, better buy Evangelion Renewal or Platinum, all the serie is remasterized in audio and image, and has the director cut's..."},{"rating":"1","title":"box set neon genesis evangilion","review":"Interesting series of kids being mentally tied to thier robot. But the robot is thier own being too. So when the pilot blacks out the robot takes over at times.The only thing I disliked about the series is the trauma. Father doesn't love me. He would rather work than do anything with me, love me, say anything encouraging to me. It's so full of woe is me stuff.As long as there were enemies to fight. The woe is me stuff wasn't too bad when mixed with hope and understanding. But once all was done and the last 2 dvd's were full of disappointing woe is me stuff. That's what made this box set very disappointing.I was hoping for more of an up beat ending. A new hope. All the angles (enemy creatures) are dead and the boy would take his favorate girl or girls and escape from his father. The father that didn't show that he cared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great up till the end....","review":"To give this series credit, it starts off great with a potentially good story line, good animation and great character developement.

The final episodes were horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a good giant robot anime.","review":"Okay I know I know what about Gundam Wing yeah it was good to. But Evangelion even though hard to pronouce is spectacular a it is beatifully drawn and has a gripping story.

No, \\"excellent is not enough to describe how much I LOVE this series! If I were to go into detail about this series we would be here all day. I loved this series except for the last 60-180 seconds.

All the Neanderthals who give this item four stars or less obviously possess no gray matter; they are individuals merely interested in mindless action and happy endings. Neon Genesis Evangelion is a truly unique experience, one I would recommend to any individual who wishes to experience a true piece of art. Neon Genesis Evangelion is more than anime and manga; it is a rich and intense journey to the very core of the human soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its just right...","review":"Its engulfs you in a story of which no other.

Phew."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"This book is very interesting but not very unique which isn't a bad thing it's just that it's style is similar to other self defence techniques in systems like krav maga and goshinjutsu. It appears to be based of wing chun but it looks very similar to jujutsu or krav maga so while it was a very interesting read to read about the skills that the police in taiwan are trained in I didn't really learn anything new from it.But very good if you do wing chun as it can possibly show you how to use it with weapon defences and restraint and control. Very good book on realistic combat though particularly as it details weapon defences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"OK, two complaints here.First, how can you sell this product and NOT make it clear it IS NOT THE CHAMPIOSHIP GAME??? Arizona and FSU met twice in 1986. In this game and the championship game. To not make it clear that this is NOT the championship game is really misleading.And the DVD skips too."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't recommend","review":"I bought this DVD hoping to learn more about house dance. I was disappointed in the quality of recording, the lack of confidence in the teacher's voice, and the painfully slow instructions. I had hoped to get 10 times what I did for the $25 expense. Not the best purchase in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Here is another book that qualifies for a minus number. Still holding the Russians up as the boogie man. They can't even get a closeure in their own provinces. Their ships and land units are rusting in place. No one wants to serve in the military anymore, and bug out when they can. The author completely ignores our spy satallite abilities. Their transportation capabilities are almost nil. Life expentancy over the past 10 years has dropped, yes dropped, as much as 20 years in some areas. Russia is a 3rd world country, surrounded by 5th world countries. When was the last time anyone heard about Bulgaria..et al. There is nothing to hear about them! This would have been better off printed in the National Rumor Magazine. Do not waste your money or time. By the time that the public realises that nothing remotely written the book has come true, the author will have laughed all the way to the bank. Please don't help him make another payment on the yacht.

The Tommy Good collection is a pleasantsurprise. I really love the first 4 cuts. The background credits are not listed, but I beleive it is the Temtations singing background on\\"Honey\\",Melvin's bass is a very nice touch. The Andantes also blend in very wellon the Mickey Stevenson produced cuts. I really Like \\"No one to love\\" alot. Tommy recorded the original version of the 4 Tops \\"Ask the lonely\\".It is not included here becuase it is beleived to be erased or lost.If I could describe his sound, it's a black version of crooner Jack Jones.The blend of blue eye'd soul and motown is simply marvolous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This book both provides tons of data on earthworms and a few hours of just fun entertainment.

The more I read the more interesting I found it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating subject, appealing presentation","review":"This is a good read! I had no interest in earthworms but saw a good review. The author has researched her subject well and makes it quite accessible to the casual reader. She held my attention with fascinating info (did you know there are different kinds of worms, specialized to deal with different kinds of \\"dirt\\"?) and her talented writing. These little critters are astonishingly important in the great scheme of things. I'm glad I learned a little of that, and I enjoyed the humor and sparkle of the writing too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book.

We definitely need to slow down, become involved in our communities and bring more happiness back into our lives. What I was subjected to in this book, however, was the author's political rants about how Conservatives have ruined this country! I'm an independent and I actually felt sorry for any conservative who might be reading this book - it was harsh. We are ALL a part of the problem, which makes us ALL a part of the solution. She does have some great quotes and some ideas that sound good no matter what your political party may be - hence the two stars. The joy is hidden in the vitriol in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Though it includes some useful summaries of related literature and research, the author's self-aggrandizing and bizarre, long-winded defense of quitting her job (I would have told her she would be fired under the circumstances as well) diminishes her credibility. As well, though I may agree with her, her editorializing on the Right Wing is boring and lacks analysis. I'm actually amazed that she found a publisher and that an editor actually scrutinized this book. Great topic- poorly addressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplicity and community? More like an intolerant rant.","review":"Cecile Andrews has some good ideas and good things to say, but these are very difficult to ferret out, as she appears to be consumed by a hatred of all things right-wing, most particularly George W.

The kids already broke one of the little plastic cups which just leaves a hole in the middle of the table. Also the directions are grouped together with a few steps to do at once. They don't make it clear which steps go first. I found myself undoing a couple of steps. Other than that I really like the table.

It pains me to say this but this one isn't worth the trouble.This album you have you believe the Ventures didn't have a drummer. Every track but one (and it's mediocre for other reasons) is disco drum machine right out of a couple decades or so ago. Over produced and over blown. This sounds like someone told them they needed to make a late-80's dance album. Uhhh.. that's not your thing gents!\\"Journey to the Stars\\" is worth having--barely--but the rest just don't cut it for me. \\"Out of Limits\\" has nothing to do with what you expect--it's a electronic voice overdub monstrosity.I really wish I could say otherwise but I can't.

So, if you want a full body pillow don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pillow, but a little pricey","review":"I ordered this pillow because I'm a side sleeper and wanted to decrease the strain on my hips/knees associated with this. I thought this would be the perfect solution so I wouldn't be battling a regular pillow and one of those dumb little knee pillows. I've been using this pillow for about 4 months now and it really gets the job done! Like other reviewers have stated, mine has lost some of its initial fluffiness, but it's still providing the support I need and is nowhere near flat. The cover that came with it is softer than I expected, however I hate white linens and really wish they sold additional colors. While I do love this pillow, I really don't think it's worth the $70+ that it is being sold at. For that price I'd expect some special foam filler or something. However, I can't complain too much because it is serving it's purpose and it has improved my comfort and sleep noticeably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this remote.","review":"I just received one of these remotes tonight.

For example, the display will showthe time, but one of the numbers may just show a dot. Also, the display issupposed to shut off automatically after about 10 seconds. One time itwouldn't shut off untill I removed and put the batteries back.I want to add that I received this remote as a premium from pointsI accumulated by using a credit card, so I am not blaming Amazonfor this.

Line-up: Mike Sneed - guitar & vocals, Matt Wilson - bass & vocals, Jim Klahr - keyboards and Steve Towery - drums & vocals. In all honesty, not a bad piece of work - I saw noted on some site that a dissatisfied patron commented that 'Witch Burning' was more like a pedestrian progressive wanna-be lp.

When it works, the coffee tastes wonderful. With no hotplate, the coffee is not as hot as I am used to, but for me the fresher flavor is worth it. The machine does have I horrible flaw, however. If the pot is not pushed back COMPLETELY, coffee will not flow into the pot and you will have a complete mess on your hands.

The songs are directed towards the pop market. Popper barely touches his harmonica, and every song sounds like a commercial for Cambell's Soup. However, there is one decent song on the album titled \\"Quite Precarious\\". It's also a very commercially directed song. Stick to the other albums! This one is the classic case of a band trying to follow up a successful album a pop-oriented product. I expected more from such a talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed...Straight On Till Morning!!!","review":"Incredible work from the entire band!! Those that are disappointed or not happy with this CD must be deaf because it is amazing from start to finish. DAMN these guys just never stop...STRAIGHT ON TILL MORNING!! Makes me want to go drive!! If you dig Blues Traveller this is a crucial studio release, I don't care what any of these other reviewers are saying. It takes me on a fantastic rollercoaster of energy and emotion that few bands can. From the hits like Carolina Blues and Last Night I Dreamed to the \\"B\\" sides like Psycho Joe, Yours, The Gunfighter, Make My Way...they're all just fantastic, full of energy, and an absolute joy to listen to.

Also represented are feather pictures, monstrances, classically inspired paintings by artists of the viceregal period (including Baltasar de Echeve Orio and Juan Rodriguez Juarez); 19th-century masterpieces by Obregon and Velasco; and 20th-century favorites including works by Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, Frieda Kahlo, and others.

Tina's \\"Burn\\" is special in my life then I heard this singer revived the immortal classic. Jo Dee destroyed the whole spirituality of the song! It gave her an American #2 all because of Tina! Fine! she's had success with this song but she will never make this her own. She gave no justice at all.

I initially caught on to Jo Dee Messina's talent through her many songs that made it country radio via I'm Alright. This CD was undoubtedly a great follow up. The songs are great, and very relaxing while thought provoking. If you are a fan of country music that is catchy and just a fun time to listen to, you have found it in this CD. Not to mention she has a great voice and a great mix of songs. Angelene and Bring on the Rain are touching ballads that are thoughtful yet not upsetting. On the other hand other songs such as That's the way and Saturday Night are pleasant tunes that don't leave you hungry for more music. This is well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jo Dee never ceases to amaze!","review":"Jo Dee's third record is phenomenal!!!!!! It is full of uptempo, almost pop songs. \\"That's the Way\\", \\"These are the Days\\", and \\"Nothin' I Can Do\\" are among the highlights. Not to be forgotten are the smoldering \\"Burn\\" and the touching, borderline sappy \\"Bring on the Rain\\" with co-producer Tim McGraw. Messina's fans have been waiting two years for this record, hopefully will not have to wait two more for the next one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jo Dee Rocks Out! Some Incredible Songs here...","review":"I heard the premiere of this album last night on the radio. Jo Dee has picked some rocking, upbeat songs. The ones I heard were all good, with the highlights being Closer, Burn, and the duet with Tim McGraw.This album is really exceptional, much better than her last one. Her voice is full and emotive. I thought her last album really didn't showcase her voice as far as material, but this one does. I think she is outstanding on the country rock songs, rather than the ballads. She said that she picked the songs on this album to perform them live, and it shows. I think this album is much more upbeat than her last one, and I really enjoyed what I heard.If you like Jo Dee, then you're gonna love this one! I think her duet with Tim McGraw is going to be number 1, as well as Burn and Closer. Some incredible stuff on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album","review":"With her third album, Jo Dee Messina has changed her style a bit, but hasn't lost the uniqueness of her songs. She still belts out the songs in her unique \\"Jo Dee\\" way - and the songs are even fun. However, there seems to be some maturity in the songs that she's picked. They're still about discovering - but it seems to be more introspective than her previous albums. It's different, but still a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"boringboringboring","review":"Yes, she has a great voice, but this entire CD is so overproduced, so lifeless, so very boring that I had to force myself to listen to the entire thing - searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice. She sounds as bored as I was on every song. I hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD!!","review":"In my opinion, this Cd is a great disappointment! I think her voice sounds rough and rigid. She appears to be trying to sing beyond what her voice will allow. Her voice often sounds strained and pushed. If you want a great country CD? I would recommend Reba McEntire's new Cd \\"So Good Together\\" or Tricia Tearwoods new Cd \\"Real Live Woman\\". As for this Cd (Burn), I would do exactly what the title implies....BURN IT!! Not worth the money!! Sorry JoDee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"This album, in my opinion, is not the highlight of Jo Dee Messina's career. I didn't like most of the songs. The title track, \\"Burn,\\" was pretty good though. Definitely the best in the whole record. Still, the other version of \\"Burn,\\" performed by Australian artist Tina Arena, is much more superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn, Baby, Burn","review":"Coming off the justly successful I'M ALRIGHT, Jo Dee Messina's third album finds her mining the same territory that populated her last two sets, with her only occasionally moving out of her comfort zone. The first is the Tina Arena-penned title track, which showcases probably her best vocal work to date. The second is the album closer 'Bring On The Rain', a gorgeous ballad in which she shows exquisite vocal restraint(and the guest turn from Tim McGraw outclasses anything he's done with usually soulless robo-wife Faith Hill). And while nothing else here quite approaches the thrill of those two cuts, the rest of the album is far from bad, just housed in safer territory. Overall, a pretty strong effort from one of the genre's most underrated talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"She has done it again!","review":"Jo Dee Messina has gone above and beyond what was expected once again with this wonderful, touching, and emotional piece of work. Ms. Messina has always amazed me with every album and every song she has ever sang- but there is something very special about this album. It truely is Jo Dee's best work to date. She is an absolutly amazing entertainer in everyway. This CD is a must must must own for ANY country music fan! Jo Dee is just an amazing entertainer and this album proves it once again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but the best in customer service","review":"I couldn't believe I found this figure for so cheap.

He's not really had a lot of press for his small combo work so I suppose that's why he slipped under the radar. I read good things about this set in Richard Cook's excellent book on the Blue Note label. Cook is spot on when describing Thad's 'big, gorgeous sound'. Listen to his impeccable pacing and note placement on the opener 'April In Paris' and you will be sold on the Jones tone. This track also has very sympathetic support from the incomparable Max Roach using his brushes the way only he can. Not a weak track on this set, good support from Roach, Barry Harris on piano, Percy Heath on bass and the unsung Billy Mitchell on tenor saxophone.Sound quality on my Japanese Toshiba pressing is top notch.

However, Marlon falls way short of anything comparable to the quality of music played by Marsalis. The songs on this CD really aren't all that pleasing to the ear. While Jordan does show some impressive speed while playing, the overall quality of his songs and playing does not appear to be all that good. At times he almost sounds like a good amateur musician. It is understandable that each musician has his own style of playing, especially while performing ad lib solos, but the saxophone player's solos are pretty annoying with the sudden loud low-note bursts. Maybe other Marlon Jordan CD's are very good, but this one isn't worth the time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price","review":"Great Replacement Cable, Received it In less then 2 Business days.

First, he looks ghoulish, with facial details painted wrong like eyebrows, eyes and the worst and most obvious was the hair was not completely painted around the face which looked absolutely terrible.A basic decent paint job would have been nice but for the over $40 bucks you'll shell out, you would be advised to find a loose one for half or less, if you absolutely have to have it.On craftsmanship, the arm broke off at the elbow joint where you unplug it to plug in the secondary cigar arm supplied with the figure. It was a pain to superglue it back on and at this point I'm not going to try to swap out the arms. Not to mention the lacking articulation points which even older 12 inch figures from years past had.

I could not possibly agree any less. Each song flows into the next one seemlessly. When you sit back after listening to both CDs it's like all those songs were meant to be together. Nick must have some divine ability to organize music that way it was intended at the beginning of the universe.As for the tracks, this CD is just so great. It is NOT crazy house or trance that's going to make you go for the nearest glowstick. Rather it's a deeper, darker selection. You find yourself mesmerized with the beats as the music envelopes you.

It's not as strong as his Budapest compilation, but it's good because it's not trying to include any of the lastest cheese trance. Side one is great. Weekend World's \\"The Word\\" is a fantastic beginning, and it carries the spirit at least until track 6, and then there's a bit of a lull after track 7...but then it closes out nicely. Side two never seems to pick up full speed, although the selections are quite good.

You are also taken to the places where it happend. Such as beautiful ASPEN in the winter coverd in snow. And ALBUQUERQUE showing you around all that area. This series deals with STALKING, OBSESSION, HARASSMENT, KIDNAPPINGS, and MURDER. Its chilling. But i reccommend TRUE CRIME SERIES VOLUME ONE.

Think about it: You already have to sit through commercials for 8 of the 30 minutes of your television show. This is on top of the $40-100+ a month you pay for the service.

I adjusted the antennae in every imaginable position, with no luck. Also used the switch to see if that would do anything. The best I got was NBC flashing between a blue screen and a frozen picture with no sound.(2) While adjusting the antennae, my hands were left with a graphite residue that I had to wash off.

So I decided to try again for my house. Fantastic!

I tried the more expensive $35 antenna from RCA with amp, but it didn't change the out come. Also tried the $30 white square antenna from RCA today, and still not as good as this $12 one. The only reason I don't rate it 5 stars is because i can't pick up a NBC station from about 50 miles, but of the antennas I tried have been able too either, might just be a weak signal from the stationNote: I can pick up an ABC station from Birmingham AL (120 miles away) if i put it next to window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reception","review":"I live on the outskirts of Dallas/Fort Worth and thought that this would work for me.

I am writing this review after the second listen of \\"Only.\\" I have been a fan since 1992 with his album \\"Determination\\" and since then he has had a string of albums which are all diverse. This one is his first true solo acoustic effort, and the results are stunning. The production is fantastic, the guitar tones are just beautiful. When he performs pieces such as \\"Questions\\" and \\"Padre\\" they really capture the essence of his live work, which is breathtaking. Tommy is definitely one of the most incredible guitarists in the world and this album is pure art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesnt get any better than this!!!!","review":"When I first heard Tommy it was on a video of him live in concert. I couldnt believe what he was doing because he makes it look so easy. The thing that really got me was his song writing and the emotion involved. This CD just shows what a great musician he is. If you buy this CD you will never get bored of it and you will remember his tunes for a long time.A Masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only needs only one listen","review":"I have listened to Only, only once is all I needed. Only thing is, it is all boring, monatanous, self indulgant, melodically retarded, and unoriginal. It will only take one listen to the incredable Kaki King to realize who will be the future of the acoustic guitar. She was sent to reek havoc on the guitar, and makes Mr. Emmanuel sound like he is sooooo old school.I would only reccomend that you save your money and buy the CDs of Kaki King instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only","review":"This cd is a must for Tommy Emmanuel fans.

I felt the author really sought out the true China and the hidden feelings of the Chineese people. I was particularly interested in the decoding of the Chineese laugh. I'm guessing the author didn't get many sincere laughs with all the proding questions he asked. A brother of a friend of mine is embarking on a three year stay in China through his work. I've recomended this book to him and I'm anxious to here his experiences compared to Mr. Theroux."},{"rating":"1","title":"in the history section, not travel","review":"I read this book before embarking on a five month trip across China. Little in Theroux's book resembles present day China. Plus his personal imprint on what he observes is so annoying that I find little value in recommending this book to anyone except historians."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Theroux adventure of epic proportions . . .","review":"\\"Riding the Iron Rooster\\" is a large scale adventure pursuing the elusive national character of the people and lands of China. Theroux bumps about in assorted steam locomotives, brewing his tea and peering out the window at dramatic landscapes passing by, from molten deserts to majestic lush green agricultural lands. He freezes in seedy northern hotels, which supply no heat, and mulls among desert dwellers shooting pool in the streets in the extreme western part of the country. Theroux convinces the reader that China is not one country, but many cultures forced to coexist in an artificial political arrangement. Vivid Theroux descriptions abound as usual, about the people, their habits, and the rickety, antiquated world they inhabit halfway around the globe. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Theroux imposes his ideals on an unsuspecting population","review":"Mr. Theroux, instead of giving an openminded glimse into an obviously foreign environment, shows the reader that he is nothing but a \\"one trick pony.\\" While he does give an extensively detailed description of his travels and the people he meets, this is all spoiled by an overwhelmingly negative attitude. Instead of taking the country in, he attempts to impose his personal morals on everyone he meets while traveling through China. At every turn, he needles people about their participation in, and impressions of the Cultural Revolution. While I was glad of the historical information, it had gotten old by the third chapter. In the end, I was given nothing but one big bad impression of China: its trains, officials, hotels, and food. The one thing I am sure of after reading this book, is that the author's ego has clouded his ability to give a fair minded impression of a diverse and fascinating country."},{"rating":"1","title":"if only there were fewer of them","review":"Something of a disappointing book that took an age to finish and felt more of a chore than a pleasure. Theroux's writing is solid but the character that comes through is an irritable, perfectionist that makes little of those who do not agree with his world view. It's strange that he took the time to learn Chinese and then view them as such dullards. But hey, I've never been to China so perhaps that's how it is.The train rides in themselves do not allow much adventure - more or less a catalog of food eaten and persons who annoy the writer by sharing his cabin.I've liked Theroux's other writings but he felt jaded with his book and I think he did not find the positive in the Chinese character."},{"rating":"1","title":"One long exercise in China-bashing.","review":"Having read The Great Railway Bazaar and The Old Patagonia Express, I looked forward to Riding the Iron Rooster. And I was greatly disappointed. I felt Theroux went to China expecting to hate it and proved himself right. He was contemptuous of Chinese customs and culture. He looked for things to scorn. His arrogance was displayed on every single page. He was condescending instead of curious. He seemed to want to hold the country to the standards of the United States and was disparaging when rules and regulations dictated something different from what he personally wanted. A major disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to fall asleep, this should do the trick.","review":"I read into... I don't know, two maybe three chapters of this book.

Paul Theroux travels the length and breadth of China by train and this account is a must for railway buffs.The construction and language is simple, but the flavour and nuances are deep and rich. One can literally feel the cold of a poorly heated chinese winter. The eating and spitting habits of Chinese have been repeatedly evoked. Though politically outdated it is a fine exploration of the Chinese psyche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Applicable","review":"This was the first book that I ever read by Paul Theroux. Since then I have taken every possible opportunity to read each of his works. I think that many may be set off by his ego and attitude but in reading other books of his it seems to me that alot of his writing is double-edged. You can follow his life through his marriage and divorce and his times with VS Naipaul. Being a voracious reader of anything to do with China and having lived there on and off, I find his book to be an objective view of CHina. WIth many people writing travel stories about what they think the \\"real\\" China is these days, it is good to see behind the facade most travellers experience when they travel to China. I recommend this book and all of Paul Theroux's travel books."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would Theroux say today, over 20 years later?","review":"I read this book over a week-long period, almost 20 years after he rode the Iron Rooster through China. The many commentaries of country life, the weird customs of the people and the constant yearning to shoot birds for food made me wonder if China today is still like it was 20 years ago. I certainly hope it is not, but Theroux's style and detailed observations of miniscule events make this a very interesting, graphic read. I had the sense of where I was in the country, from the barren desert to the freezing mountains and every track inbetween. I didn't want to get off the train.This was my first Theroux travelogue. I will certainly read many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear & Helpful","review":"This is a superb commentary and the best one I have read in the NIV series.

He was educated well and acquired an expert knowledge of languages, especially the more obscure African dialects, so was hired by the British Secret Service as a top flight interpreter. He is taken to a secret island rendevous to interpret at a meeting between several neighbouring African states and a big international syndicate where they plan a coup which is meant to start a war, therebye enabling the winners to seize control of all the considerable mining rights of these poor countries. Realising that it is all a massive swindle, Bruno attempts to warn the authorities of the upcoming coup but cannot work out just who to trust. His life and that of his girlfriend are at great risk as this naive young man battles with forces way beyond his control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Credulity Incredible","review":"The Mission Song starts gamely enough, with an interesting cast of characters and a juicy conspiracy.

At least justice is served when Salvo ends up a secret prisoner with plenty of time to reflect on his stupidity.Le Carre has long been a master of the clever thriller.

I thought the writing was verbose and uneccesarily convoluted. I often had to repeat paragraphs. I thought the characters weren't developed well enough. The plot was very boring in the middle of the book, the island meeting dragged on and on. I also thought the love affair between Hannah and Salvo was silly, shallow and vacuous. Okay, so you're both from the same country and all the other male characters want to boink her, but could Le Carre not deepen their attraction any further? At times I felt the book was absurd.

Bruno Salavador has a clever sense of humor and believes in both black...and white magic! His linguistic intelligence is a tribute to the success of mixed-race persons and gives additional credence to heterosis/hybrid vigor and the unfairness of racial prejudice. Salvo is subjected to the name calling of being a 'zebra' which is nicer word than half-breed or, in Thai language, 'look krueng' = half-child. Thanks to John LeCarre' for another good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"I never thought I would feel this way about a John LeCarre book, but when I had finished The Mission Song I was sorry I had read it. I have loved his books ever since Spy Who Came in from the Cold and no one ever wrote better or more substantial fiction about the cold war and its real effects on the people involved than he did. But despite having had some success with other titles since the end of the cold war, the Mission Song was a bore. I didn't really care or understand what I was supposed to get from the main character other than the general sense of how the west has screwed the African continent and continues to do so even under the guise of providing relief. The story is flat, the characters uninvolving and in general not worth reading. It's such a shame, but even the great ones don't always hit a homerun in each at bat so we give them some slack and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old","review":"John Le Carre needs to find a new voice. This is the same old reprisal of the usual themes in all his post cold war books - young idealists battling greedy corporations bent on profits above human life and decency.It was amusing in the first book - but this is the fourth or fifth book on the same theme. Find something else Mr Le Carre.The writing is cliched."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow slogging thru the African mud that just ain't worth the time","review":"I am a longtime John LeCarre fan, especially the Smiley books. He obviously tries very hard to do justice to the tragedy of recent decades' Congo/ Rwandan history but the resulting novel was sickeningly sticky slow for me. I gave it 2 stars only because of the great effort in writing and respect for the subject LeCarre obviously shows. But if I hadn't known it was a leCarre creation, I'd have tossed it in the waste basket after 30-50 pages. I did at the end (sorry, I didn't want to submit anyone else to the pain) and felt I needed to balance the good reviews with this one. Sorry John, not a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A continuing sad decline","review":"I have marveled for years at Le Carre's skills, but, as other reviewers have noted, his post-Cold War novels have necessarily changed from the George Smiley books that originally hooked me. The characters have become more predictable (Salvo especially) and, as le Carre has become more overtly political in his writing, he has lost the ability to surprise the reader. His worldview predestines the course of the story, and within a few pages the reader can pretty much predict the direction of the tale, if not the actual ending. That's a sad departure from the early novels, when, without ever resorting to cheap plot twists, le Carre would effortlessly turn the plot on its head in a single phrase, leading the reader on a relentlessly fascinating and utterly unpredictable wild ride. There are still glimmers of the master's brilliance in this work, but the fun is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Par and Almost Unreadable","review":"I have been a big fan of LeCarre novels, and I usually purchase his books as soon as they come out, without bothering to read any reviews. Recently though, I have been gravely disappointed.The Mission Song is a sad departure from his clever and dynamic mystery and spy novels. The characters are bland and uninteresting, the plot is quite obvious, and the lengthy passages describing articles of clothing and surroundings are extremely boring. When certain characters go into page upon page of lengthy political diatribes, you get the sense that you are watching an oratory by a self-serving United Nations or White House demagogue on C-SPAN.Let's not forget the ridiculous, sub-par, love novella sub-plot that should have no place in a thriller by such a high caliber author. Who are we kidding?To sum it up - I've painstakingly labored through half of the book, and am considering throwing it out the window unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mission Song","review":"The main character is weak. This is not up to the standard that Le Carre has set for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The art of good writing","review":"You'll find plenty of reviews that talk about the plot, context, and other such matters. I wanted to leave a note simply to celebrate the quality of the prose. After reading most of Le C's novels - out of sequence - I can't recall any that match the sheer beauty of his writing in this novel. It really seems that he went up another level this time. That's all from me here...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think he's past it","review":"I've been reading, and enjoying, Le Carre's books for 45 years or so and have often marvelled at the way in which he manages to bamboozle the reader with the plot twists. Not so in this book. The end was pretty obvious from about the third or fourth chapter. Of course, you are sceptical that you can have picked the ending, given Le Carre's normal plots but sadly I was correct. Unfortunately, this book was dull, had no, or only obvious, plot turns (no real twists), and the characters were almost comic book in their predictability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Imitation of Graham Greene","review":"Mr. Le Carre's last few books have been so bad that he has attempted, and failed, to emulate the successful novels of Graham Greene (Brighton Rock, The Power and The Glory). Perhaps he thought that there were few readers around who know the writing of Mr. Greene. I am still aorund and Mr. Le Carre is no threat to the past successes of Graham Greene. This book is; pathetically slow in plot development; lacks any sense of coninuity; has very shallow character development, and is quite frankly boring.

Looking at flash cards does nothing for me. But, I got caught up in the solving of the puzzles and forgot that I was studying. I loved the \\"cheat\\" buttons for when I just couldn't figure it out.

Having read a few books on self-improvement, I recognized a lot of important subjects. The author presents these in an easy-going way and really does his best to build the reader up along the way.So why only four stars? The answer lies in the word \\"touches\\" in the title of my review. The book doesn't contain all that much text. The author skims past about 50 subjects, each of which deserver a book in their own right.The again, you want to improve your life, (probably) not get a Ph.D. in psychology. So, if you feel that you could do with some wise and credible words from a man who's been there, go ahead and buy this book. If you, after reading, feel that you're still stuck in a rut, then look further, cause there's a lot more in-depth material out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Inspiring","review":"This book is a must-have if you need a boost of inspiration to get that thing you've always wanted to do done.

If only somebody could grasp only quater as much the writer said, his life would be nothing less than complete. Each chapter turns out to be a beutifully woven lesson of practical attributes and emotional weaknesses that surround our day to day life. The author has given enough space to breathe for the newcomer and has made it fluently simple to understand the necessities and urgencies of life, be it positive or negative. All along our lives we know what is to be done but still wait for something to happen. Jim has definitely edged the readers out of this dilemma helping them take charge of their lives and the direction to which they head."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Get One Shot at Life","review":"Most people go through life and die with their music still within them.

This also contains the 12-inch version of La Flavour's \\"Mandolay\\" and Carol Jiani's \\"Hit and Run Lover\\". It would have been nice if the compilers had gotten the rights to the longer versions of \\"So Many Men, So Little Time\\" or \\"H.A.P.P.Y. Radio\\", but I guess you can't have everything.

It was truely a blessing to us!I actually bought the bible for my husband, but now I want one too.

If you want or have a Basenji, you must have this book","review":"At last! Here's a real useful book on Basenjis! I studied many Basenji books, and only this one gave me what I really, really needed to know about this breed of dog. The information is well presented and the pictures are wonderful. What I liked best were the Tailtips that gave excellent advice, along with the way the book was written (friendly, personable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Basenji Specific","review":"Look, if you're looking for Basenji specific books, this is not one of them. It is informative, but not on Basenjis. This book would work for any breed rescue. I was disappointed because what I wanted was a book with all the pluses and minuses of living with a Basenji. This book contained none of that information. What it did have was great tips on rescuing and living with a rescued dog. The only thing \\"Basenji\\" about it was the title and the photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning not a Men's watch","review":"I ordered this watch and I got a woman's watch.

Luckily Amazon has a great return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woman's Watch","review":"This is not a man's watch. I used to own the larger version and this is NOT it. It is a great watch if you are looking for something with a smallish band and face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Women's T470422","review":"Bought this because I was sick of the plasticky bands on the cheaper \\"Timex\\" watches. The leather band is great, it's soft and just feels good even when I'm hot and working hard. Easy to set, easy to read. Only drawback is the date keeper. It says you can read the date where 6 should appear on the face. I find it way to hard to read...but thinking it was my age, I gave it to my granddaughter to check and she couldn't read it either. So plan on being on time, but if you need the date, you're out of luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Sporty","review":"I just received this watch today, so I can't speak to its endurance, however, it works fine. The date is too small to read but I don't depend on my watch for the date, so that doesn't matter to me. If you want to clearly see the date, this isn't the watch for you. Also, the casing, which appears gray in all the online photos of this watch, is actually black, without a hint of gray! I liked the gray look so initially this bugged me, but not enough to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not last","review":"Initially, I was pleased with the watch - nice clean design, easy to ready, great at night. Just what I was looking for in the way of a casual watch. Unfortunately it stopped working after only 6 months. Battery is fine, but the movement died. Timex watches used to last for years and years; not so anymore. After adding up the costs for the warranty repair fee, shipping, and insurance, I'm thinking I'll just buy a new watch. Only it won't be a Timex this time. The price is right if you don't mind taking a gamble, but you might want to think twice before purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just for women","review":"I am a man who has been looking for quite awhile to find a masculine looking watch that was proportioned for my scrawny wrist. This slightly smaller version of the men's watch of the same name works for me. It's a very sturdy watch with that handy indiglo feature, too. I didn't give it 5 stars because the date is really too small and, for me at least, the light has to be just right to read it. Overall, I'm very happy with it. UPDATE: After 6 months the calendar stopped working so I'm returning it to Timex for warranty which will end up costing me a handling fee. I've had lots of Timex watches and this is the first one to malfunction so quickly. If they'd had it at the time I got this one, I would have bought the T48501 because it has a little magnifier over the calendar."},{"rating":"2","title":"great watch !!!","review":"This watch is a good investment.

Excellent quality and I love the indiglo feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Outdoors-Woman","review":"Finally, a watch for the outdoors-woman! If you are looking for a rugged, functional watch that has some class, and is sized for a woman's wrist, you have just found it. I am a landscape design student, so I am in and out of water, mud, and plant material, but I also needed something that looks appropriate for meetings, classes or everyday wear. I wanted analog movement, with the date, a leather band, and an \\"adventurer\\" style to the face. I also have a small wrist, so size was important. This watch has all of these features, plus an Indiglo light, and is even more attractive than in the photo, as the face is actually a brushed black metal. It holds up well to use, and as another reviewer commented, the face seems to be fairly scratch-resistant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch - No Replacement Band","review":"This is a great watch! (Yes, folks, it IS a WOMAN'S WATCH! I says so right here on the website!) I've had it for a couple of years now it's the best watch I've had in ages. However, the leather band is cracked and the tabs that hold the end down have disintegrated and fallen off, so I can't wear it any more. I haven't been able to find a replacement band like the one that comes with the watch anywhere, either on line or in stores. If anybody knows where I can get one, I'd love to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex is the best!","review":"This watch is a great deal.

This watch was just the right size, not too huge or really tiny, and the look was sporty. I have owned 3 of these now and am disappointed in quality. They genuinely keep good time, but the light that illuminates the time goes within a year of purchase. The band and battery only last a year as well and the band is hard to find to replace. I had a Timex when I was a kid and it lasted years. Quality has gone downhill. This is why I will never buy a Timex again.

Rebbetzein Jungreis is touching on the basics of life without all the outer wrappings. One has to be able to break through all the unimportant and often phony things that hide the real us.

It is a trite and self-serving memoir. While the themes contained in it are worthwhile-- indeed, some of the quotes in the chapter headings are interesting and I wish there had been more discussion of them, rather than lengthy descriptions of the author's accomplishments-- the book it is written in a very condescending and conceited tone. It is not intellectually stimulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Committed Life","review":"After all the praise this book received, I thought it would be \\"meatier\\". However, it is no more than a tiresome (and at times unbeleivable) account of the Rebbetzin changing peoples lives with flowery words. It just doesn't happen that way. I can hardly believe Dr. Laura Schlessinger gave this book a great review. How can she justify, in the chapter on prayer, beseeching the long dead great grandfathers to \\"intercede in front of G-'s holy throne\\" to get God to keep her husband from dying. Praying to anyone other than G-d is,in judaism,idolotry. In addition, asking G-d to interced in our affairs, in essence, to \\"make it all better\\", is self serving and egotistical.G-d can help us to cope with the troubles life puts in our path but it is pure vanity to think G-d will change the world to suit our wants and desires. Is this woman really Jewish?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good representation of Judaism","review":"This book alone was nearly enough to convince me NOT to convert to Judaism. Jungreis sounds almost cultish in her stories of bringing non-practicing Jews to Orthodoxy. Any moral value or even sentimentality of the book is likely to be lost on most readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Old Ladies only","review":"This album is just awful. I expected something good considering this is Richard Carpenter but instead got an album that could put an insomniac to sleep. \\"Lawrence Welk\\" should be stamped in big letters across this album.

Thanks Richard, once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard Without Karen is Empty","review":"There is no doubt that Richard Carpenter is an exceptionally talented pianist, composer, and performer; however, without the pure vocals of sister Karen Carpenter, this collection of instrumental Carpenter songs falls flat. It's like having ice tea without the sugar, or Coca-Cola without the fizz - you know something vital is missing. In this case what is missing is Karen's exceptional voice. As a fan of the Carpenters for over 30 years, I of course knew all the songs on this collection, and they are excellent melodies, but I kept expecting to hear Karen's voice break in, the voice that makes these songs complete.I love the Carpenters, but without Karen's vocals, this collection reminds me of \\"elevator music\\".Die hard Carpenter fans will want this album to compete their collection, but if you are new to Carpenter music, I'd suggest you buy one of their greatest hits collections instead.Jim Konedog Koenig"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing and refreshing","review":"This recording shows what everyone already knows, that Richard Carpenter is an incredibly gifted composer and arranger. It features arrangements, mostly instrumental but some with choral accompaniment, of songs that The Carpenters recorded, as well as a couple of selections that Mr. Carpenter wrote after his sister's untimely death. The latter selections seem to be deeply-felt tributes to Karen Carpenter's memory. The chorus adds a nice touch to tracks such as \\"Sandy.\\" It's refreshing to hear this, along with some other lesser-known numbers, given a new treatment. As always, Mr. Carpenter's music is understated, elegant, and classy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Outdated","review":"14th edition (January 1999) is now 5 years old, so this book is woefully out of date for anyone looking for streets added or changed in the last SIX years (assuming that when a book comes out, it already a year out of date).

Blaze wanted revenge on Chrissy's father and sister and used Chrissy to do it by hiring her. Blaze character was never redeemed, you never really found out what his hidden agenda was. Like, was he attracted to Chrissy when she was younger and what was his reason for hiring Chrissy. The book was one sided only revealing Chrissy's thoughts and her past.

Travis is truly an outstanding live band and this DVD captures everything. The audio mixing is just shy of the actual studio recording and the musicianship is brilliant. Travis dont cut corners like most bands do when they hit the stage. The climax of the DVD would have to be when the band plays \\"Why Does It Always Rain On Me.\\" Fran sings about four lyrics before he stops in awe to listen to the WHOLE croud sing to the song. Everyone in the croud is singing to the song in perfect pitch. It's truly a magical moment in the performance. This would have to be the best recorded concert I have ever seen and heard!

Travis do deliver an amazing live show, and this DVD brings it all and doesn't disappoint. The documentary bits are entertaining, and I like the fact that you can watch them combined with the concert as well as watch the documentary or the concert on it's own. It's also good to be able to pick which album you want to hear from, since all three evoke different moods and feelings. It's a must have for any Travis fan, and it's a great way to introduce people to the band who are not already familiar with Travis."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than us...","review":"I had the pleasure to go to the gig that the band did in my country recently, so I know a little bit how they're in stage, and how does it feel to be there, so I can tell you one thing: This DVD captures the Travis on-stage and if you haven't gone to any gig of this wonderful band I'm sure that if you like this you'll probably love this funny guys (specially Dougie Payne) and their music. You'll find yourself shouting and singing all of the songs so...watch it at your own risk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Concert Souvenir","review":"For those fortunate enough to have caught on to Travis by the time of the Scottish band's \\"Invisible Band,\\" tour and saw them live, this concert DVD is a treat. Travis sounds musically tight and confident here. The band's presentation of its music evokes comparisons with an up and coming U2, with the songs and the band's on-stage delivery captivating the raucous audiences at the filmed concerts. I caught Travis at a small venue in San Diego during October 2001 and it was amazing to see how comfortable the band was playing the larger open air \\"festival\\" which was filmed just a few months prior to my seeing them. The DVD isn't without a minor, but annoying technical flaw. If you want to do the \\"concert only\\" option, the DVD doesn't start precisely at the beginning of the concert and misses about half a second of \\"Sing\\" in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRAVIS is good","review":"this is a really incredible dvd experience. i bought the dvd just because i saw them on letterman once or something and i had the cds but never saw them in concert. well the picture quality, sound quality, length and song choice in the dvd are perfect. fran healy's voice is spot on and many of these tracks sound even better than the recorded versions on the cds! a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"I agree, one of the best DVD I own.

This story with it's flaws and inaccuracies still got my attention and gave me comfort. In fact if you think about it, there are many different versions of the Bible that only differ by one or two small details yet they all provide comfort to millions as this story provided to me and I'm sure many other addicts, the same way that Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob intented when they began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your while","review":"I was actually looking for the autobiography of Bill W. but stumbled upon this in the search. I am pleasantly surprised. It gives a thorough chronological sequence that shaped Bill W.into the man he became and his never ending battle with the bottle. Ms. Cheever also gives good detail to the emotional struggles of those touched by alcolholism. It truly gave me an even deeper appreciation for all that Bill W. went through and accomplished.

I was sold from the first few chords of Guilty and each song thereafter continued to offer up refreshing, exhilerating and insightful songs that were a breath of fresh air in the downtrodden world of teen-pop hell. From the tongue in cheek \\"Disappointed\\" to the mesmerizing \\"Irrelevent\\", this album does not contain a single clunker!

However, Sachar quickly displays her ignorance, racism and how incredibly self-involved she is. She claims that before she started teaching she read up on teaching subjects - yet when she gets in the classroom she is surprised at how inept she is and chooses not to apply any techniques (discipline, etc.). She also claims to be an education reporter, which left me wondering how she knew absolutely nothing about what she was getting into.If I had been a teacher with her, I wouldn't have trusted her either. She wasn't a teacher. She was merely a reporter writing a book. I searched for some kind of sign that she had contributed some of the profits from the book to the school. but no.So at the end of the day, she was just an ignorant, oblivious, opportunistic woman who truly made a difference in people's lives - a negative one. Don't read it - it will just frustrate you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bluesy ballads","review":"Paul has a wonderful gravelly voice. His ballads (I bet he knows; Every little bit hurts; Temporarily forever mine, and my personal favorite Resurrection Day have simple but beautiful lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A humorous and heartfelt stellar freshman effort","review":"Paul Thorn deftly mixes a back country sensibility, genuine Christian faith and a wicked sense of humor on his bluesy/country album Hammer + Nail. The songs are frequently humorous (try 800 Pound Jesus and an unlisted track Joanie, the Jehovah Witness Stripper) and often passionate pleas to the woman who left him behind (Double Wide Paradise, Temporarily Forever Mine and I Bet He Knows). The songs are well crafted with simple melodies, sung with a gravelly voice peppered with fire. If you're into singers like Johnny Lang, or if you're in touch with your trailer park roots, this is an album not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"planet earth as seen from outer space","review":"Anyone blessed with the ability to instantly recognize land shapes from space should find this dvd fascinating.

Those days are gone but this album still remains fresh to me. They are some what like Staind but definately with their own style. This album in my opinion should have been the breakout for this band.

Don't get me wrong, I love Korn,Deftones,Snot,Limp Bizkit,ect., but I thought this cd just plain sucked.

To my surprise, I took the cd home, listened to it, and it's such a good cd that I have been listening to it non-stop for the last 6 months! It's different than everything else in it's genre, and in my opinion, I think Cold even have more talent than such big acts today like KoRn and Limp Bizkit. There is nothing else like them, but the only way you can only hear it for yourself, is to go out and buy the cd! ~Patrick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this album","review":"The was one of the best albums of 1998. It has a totally unique sound which even Ross Robinson can't mess up. It has more aggressive songs like \\"Go Away\\", \\"Give\\" and \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\", but these are balanced out by the slower and more sinister tones of \\"Strip her Down\\" and standout track \\"Insane\\". These guys really deserve more recognition because they're among the most talented metal musicians around at the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A band that has a bright future.","review":"If you haven't heard Cold, than you probably have at least heard about their connection with Fred Durst. Now, just because of that, don't think this is a bad band. Their sound is totally different and much more creative. Songs like \\"Ugly\\" \\"Go Away\\" and \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" have that sense of despair and hopelessness that fans of Staind have become familiar with. If you like this I highly reccomend Staind, Full Devil Jacket, Mudvayne, and even Godsmack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the light-hearted","review":"If you're expecting a CD that you can dance to, or something that seethes with pop bliss, this is not the album for you. This album is great; dark music with dark lyrics. It is raw, emotional turmoil through every track. The first tracks 'Go Away' and 'Give' leave the listener with an impression of a heavy rock album. Then, 'Ugly' drops the mood to almost acoustic while still keeping the same deep feelings. The album continues on like this, taking the listener on a rollercoaster of emotions. Normal nu-metal fans might not be so receptive to this, but true music fans will really enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"My first introduction to Cold was on the radio, \\"No One\\". I then proceeded to get '13 ways to bleed onstage' and I liked it. I then proceeded to read some reviews for THIS cd, Cold's self-titled, and I was reluctant to give it a listen. I'm not one to enjoy dark music, and this is definitely dark music. However, I can't relate to this cd more. It is absolutely incredible. The lyrics are very deep, and that was one thing I didn't like on '13 ways...', the lyrics were too obscure. This cd is very direct lyrically. I've found it tear-jerking at certain points in my life, when I'm in 'certain moods'. You know what I mean. They've achieved being Hard sounding, and at the same time, being soft emotionally. This is an incredible CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"live Bryan","review":"This is one of the best live and unplugged CDs I've ever listened to.

The merit of a book written on a country can be gauged by the interest it generates in its readers for that country. Having lived outside India for a few years and having read many books on India, I can faithfully say that no other book transported my spirit closer to home than \\"India Unveiled\\". Robert Arnett understands that India's wealth lies more in her spiritual knowledge than in her material riches. Breathtaking photographs add great expression to the author's vivid commentary. The book is highly recommended for anyone interested in India's cultural values and also for those who plan on a visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spiritual Legacy of India","review":"If you've ever wondered why India has been able to preserve it's spiritual legacy to the world, this book captures the essence of India's ancient beauty. In spite of poverty and sometimes overwhelming obstacles, you see the incredible devotion and love that are the heart of it's people. I have only been able to spend a month in India myself, but when I look at this book, I am reminded why I want to return. In spite of the hardship and challenges a spoiled westerner experiences when they travel in India, there is no place on earth like it...this land of mystery, beauty, loving people, and spiritual riches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peering into the heart and soul","review":"India Unveiled is a beautiful combination of photography, narrative and philosophy. It focuses on the timeless aspects of India's long culture and history, revealing the basic underpinnings of that country's heritage that have enabled it to survive for millenia and escape the destruction that engulfed other vanished ancient societies. If you want to see through the complexities of modern India in order to discover it's core values, this book is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Portrayal","review":"Having always been fascinated by the ancient civilization personified in India, especially it's rituals and thousand year old habits, I was intrigued to find the answer to many of my questions in this beautiful book. This is an in-debt and thoughtful analysis of what often appears to be chaos and poverty to the westerner. The book's focus is on the spiritual, although much can be gained about every aspect of Indian life from reading the text. Having known many ex pat Indians living in the US, my impression when talking to them, is this book is welcomed for it's simple honesty and presentation of what they consider the most important side of their culture. Thanks to the author for the insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Real India, Not Whole India","review":"I was very disappointed in the otherwise colorful book because it did not address the real India nor it shows the whole India. In fact, without discussing substance, the book has left out the entrire North East India comprising the seven states, namely the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram & Tripura, the so called the Seven Sisters which is physically the most beautiful and culturally most colorful part of India. So I would suggest that when Mr. Robert Arnett visits India next time, he would kindly take the time to visit the Seven Sisters and unveil the beautiful North East India and complete the book showing more real stuff in India."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad!","review":"I am a huge fan of Underworld, Emerson, PVD, many such progressive authors.

I've since read most of his other work and much of it has been excellent. Rumor of War, Acts of Faith, Crossers, Means of Escape. But this one was a real disappointment. A truly disjointed and haphazard work. It was so utterly boring at times I found myself frequently flipping ahead several pages to try to find some reason to stay with it. Initially I thought it felt like a rough draft of something - unfinished - but now I'm struggling to think of any redeeming qualities at all. The main character, Starkmann, is so pathetic - and not just after his tour in Vietnam either. Right from the start the guy is such a hopeless dolt. How Caputo thought he could hang an entire novel around this dullard is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indian Country review","review":"As a VN era vet I was truly disappointed in this book.

I haven't gotten around to complaining to the seller about it, yet, because it upsets me every time I think about it. I'll have to spend at least $150 to replace it with a quality timepiece, but at least I'll have peace of mind.I just noticed, Amazon suggests \\"full metal alchemist\\" as a tag.

Recently the Dymar lab for cancer research has burned down to the ground by animal rights group that seems to not have existed.

Still, it's always great to meet our favorite heros in text."},{"rating":"2","title":"As the 1st reviewer, let me say this was one of the best.","review":"This was an excellent book that should have been (should be?) made into an episode.

However, I think Mr. Anderson was too focused on trying to make it into a conspiracy, when in fact, it was a simple cover-up of new government technology, much like the A-bomb and the tank when they were first developed. I *do* recommend it, if like me, you love the X-Files and science, but if you're a hardcore conspiracy lover, go for *Goblins*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book was one of the best X-Files books I've ever read.

Great arrangement,even overlooking Q's vocal(he ain't Marvin Gaye,but he ain't as bad as A&M's Herb Alpert or Burt Bacharach). Toots Thielmans does some interesting work with guitar,harmonica(even whistling)and later Harry Lookofsky mimics Toots' harmonica solo via a string section. A true all-star lineup-Freddie Hubbard,Hubert Laws,Jerome Richardson,Pete Christlieb,Snooky Young,Milt Jackson,Jim Hall,Grady Tate,Ray Brown,Carol Kaye-even Jimmy smith is a sideman in this group.

There is also a constant low level hiss in the background.I know it is tempting to buy these because of the cheap price, but it really is worth it to spend a little more money on a higher quality set of wireless headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for the $$$","review":"Have wanted to purchase a pair of wireless headphones for quite sometime but when I saw these on sale for the price, it was hard to pass up. I am very satisfied with the product and results. I can now watch TV, listen to music, in bed without disturbing my now asleep wife. I also have a small hearing problem, so I wish I would have know about these for my parents or any older folks who have lost hearing and find it difficult to hear the TV. Rather than turn the volume up sky high others can actually have a conversation without screaming. Good value for the money and would recommend to all. Very easy to set up and get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat OK...","review":"I got these headphones for christmas, and they were great! I'd give it five stars, if it wasn't for the terrible auto-off feature that it has. I meditate alot and I like to listen to new-age streaming radio, but when the signal gets too weak or the music stops for a few seconds, the transmitter turns off, causing a horribly-loud, cacophonous static. I mean, its just horrible. Why is this even implimented? Is it to prevent people from leaving the headphones on after they've finished listening to music by giving them a horrendous screeching sound? :POther than that, they were excellent. Great sound, and the best thing is I can go around the house listening to music on my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal clear, but must know about auto-shutoff","review":"If you're thinking about getting these, you need to know that they automatically shutoff after 30-45 seconds if the input signal is weak.

Just turn up the volume a little (it doesn't take much) on the device you're plugged in to and you won't have a problem.Range is impressive: crystal clear audio up to about 35 feet. Still works at 50 but has a fair amount of static.One review mentioned difficulty getting the battery cover off. I thought the same thing until I found the trick to it. You have to press in on the bottom of the cover and then slide it up (toward the top). It comes off with ease.There's not much head room due to the intermediate strap. Depending on how you're built, you may have a problem getting the ear pieces to rest on your ears comfortably. Not a problem for kids.Well worth it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable strap","review":"I bought these at a local store, but I took them back, because when you wear them, there is a strap that hugs tightly to your head and actually presses down against your head considerably.

Not only did it arrive in less than 2 days, it was well packaged. The mirror itself is quite substaintial in size and weight --- this is not a plastic mirror. I believe it may be some type of ceramic but in any case, it has a bit of heft. With that said, the hanging mechanism on the back has me a bit worried due to the weight of the piece. However, the back is lined with soft foam to prevent scratching your wall - a nice bonus. Color wise, it is gold -- not exactly what I wanted but I think with a little spray paint or Rub-n-Buff, I can get it to a really nice aged bronze color.

The majority of the beach boys backing band are present led by Mr. Billy Hinsche ( long time beach boys keyboard player and LV on sail on sailor) and perform beautifully. The harmonies here are exquisite. Al's voice has aged well (yea! clean living) and the wilson girls are fantastic...Carnie on \\" Darlin'\\" is great and Wendy on \\"Don't worry baby\\" will make you swoon. Matt Jardine handles the majority of lead vocals and does it with the class of his father. I do not have enough good things to say about this great disc. A new favorite.

Once a Beach Boy, he left after the death of Carl Wilson to write his own kind of music with his sons. That didn't seem to work out and so we have this set of Beach Boy mostly played in the same order as they were with the original band...nothing new! Unfortunately the BB group (offical band with one and a half original members) will not take him back after his snubbing and he's paying the price. This sure beats his silly children's book!As to the quality of this cd...recording is good on some levels and not on others...hearing Carnie breath on Darlin is quite distracting and you don't have to listen closely to hear the \\"overdub\\" of an enthusiastic audience...probably from another show with another band! If you like the songs, you'll enjoy this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome rock from some of the best!","review":"The band is in fine form on this night!

He is wrestling with reconciliation following Japan's defeat as evidenced through his relationship to his two adult daughters and his reflections on the past which slowly illuminate his very personal relationship to the events that brought such dramatic change to Japan.This is a beautifully written novel that very gradually reveals how the past can haunt individuals and encroach on the present in very real terms.

I purchased it because I cited often from it directly and truly enjoyed the writing style and spiritual insights viewed through the lens of human development. Loder uses his theoretical perspective to explain the human development stages. For example their are certain spiritual components a grade school child may understand, just as an adolescent may experience a certain level of spiritual understanding. Loder writes almost lyrical at times in expressing spiritual experience at the various life stages, but this is not necessarily a book for the average reading crowd. Some of the theology was beyond my understanding, and some of the theology I did understand, I disagreed with (from my own perspective).

You have to be kidding!

The first score track you hear on the CD intitled ' White Knight ' is probably the best track kicking of with the Gun Barrel sequence which then leads into a very tense and atmospheric piece of music, while this progreses the tention finaly lets go with a super aray of brillient Arnold/Bond action music with snipets from the main title song, Great!Its just a pity that Davids Aronlds talent was not used to make Goldeneye a succes, TND on the other hand is a huge improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good soundtrack !!!","review":"A very good soundtrack in the style of John Barry. \\"White Knight\\" and \\"Backseat Driver\\" are my favourite numbers.

The Sheryl Crow song is all right, I love the White Knight and Backseat driver tracks, and the Paris/Bond love theme is just out of this world, but it all doesn't make up for the rest. Most music on this album is just a bunch of orchestral humbug, and it has nothing to do whatsoever with the John Barry music that worked so great for the Bond films. The worst track by far is the K.D. lang song, it is just awful and another bad Goldfinger imitation.

However, I knew David Arnolds Score for TND was going to be good after I saw the opening to the film and heard the best rendition of the James Bond theme since The Living Daylights (John Barry's last stint as Bond composer).

It was trite, stereotyped and silly. Even as a Physician, I was turned off by so much focus on mentstrual cramps and flow. The characters were not well developed and mostly not evolved.... the degrees of separation between the characters appeared incestuous. It depicted the lesbians as under-developed emotionally and all I wanted was for the book to end (predictably) already. The sex scenes were commonplace, same Kallmaker: against walls, on floors, in the shower and on countertops and of course, the old joke persists: What do lesbians make on the second date? U-haul arrangements.But on the positive side: I now know how books are catalogued in the Dewey system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad book","review":"I didn't like this book at all, it was all past tenseprophecies.

Also the chicken lettuce wraps, which I love at restaurants but never knew how to make; even the sauce (which took a minute to make) was perfect. Jennifer (she's the \\"Kitchen Coach\\") must work full-time and have a family, because her recipes come with tips that save me time and effort. When I made the grilled shrimp, it was too hot outside to fire up the bbq, but I followed her alternate directions to make it in the oven. There are also these short mini-recipes that are cool; it took me a few minutes to turn half a loaf of stale bread (who left the twisty off the bread??)into addictive garlic croutons that I put on the salads I take to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cookbook that every guy can use","review":"If you are only going to have one cookbook, get this one.

If you need to impress a date, open this book, pick any recipie and 30 minutes later you will have her thinking you are a gourmet chef. The list of how to equip your kitchen for basic cooking was a real help--it tells you just what to get so you'll never be running back to the store at the last minure to get the one spice you don't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer's cookbook brings the fun back to the kitchen.","review":"As a mother of two picky under 8-year old boys this cookbook has been a treasure.

They enjoy sandwiches other than pb&j; for lunch (and yes, they are no-trade lunches as the title of the chapter says!) with veggies and a little dipping sauce. Our dinners are not as stressful for me because Jennifer teaches you how to stalk your pantry so you can get home and answer that age-old question \\"What's for dinner?\\" in a matter of minutes by surveying your supplies.

It challenges our thinking, makes us walk in the other persons shoes, and kicks our butts out of the daily rut. It tells us stories that we have to keep thinking about for awhile after the book is finished. Gael Baudino's \\"Shroud of Shadow\\" is such a work. The story takes us back to the days of the Inquisition and the death of magic. It leads us through our own history as the last Elf ...passing among humans as a woman harpist...struggles with a world bereft of beauty, and one almost lost to hope. The writing is beautiful, the experience both chilling and disturbing. Let yourself read this book. Let yourself talk a walk through the past that will raise questions about our present...and future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Explicit Sexual Violence","review":"WARNING TO SEXUAL ABUSE SURVIVORS: This book has quite explicit depictions of sexual abuse and is likely triggering.The author substitutes gratuitously explicit descriptions of torture and sexual abuse for narrative tension, plot advancement, and character development. Not impressed.This is a book of many flaws: in terms of story, in terms of structure, in terms, even, of simple proofreading. It is tedious, it is populated by almost entirely unsympathetic characters, it has nothing particularly insightful to say about human nature nor has any particularly novel or thoughtful way of putting it. Much of the plot is painfully predictable. It is not utterly without merits: the character of Omelda is well drawn and psychologically realistic, if no pleasure to read. But the only reason I slogged all the way through was because I was stuck home with a cold and had already read the backs of the cereal boxes. I can't imagine recommending it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent story.....if you can ignore the authors social views","review":"The idea was a good one.....but the promise of the story was not played out well. I believe the author had an agenda behind writing this book. Perhaps it was the dedication to all women who had been killed by husbands or boyfriends in the state of Colorodo which prefaced the book that tipped me off? The characters in the book, with the exception of the elf Natil, fall into the stereotypical ideas of the abusive male, and the resigned-to-fate female. Most of the action of the book tells of violent acts against women. Several times the author used the phrase, \\"men striking women, women scolding men...\\" to describe the life in a city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moen Air Gap","review":"item arrived as described.

I tried so many things to make this work like changing the disposal orientation but nothing helped. Returning to amazon. I think ultimately I will use 3/4\\" copper pipe for most of the run between the next air gap I buy and the garbage disposal with a couple of small rubber pieces clamped to the copper pipe and air gap/garbage disposal.

Highly recommended book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Although there are pictures scattered throughout the book, they are mainly of small details and accents, rather than a total view of the houses. Also, it seemed that some of the pictures were not even of the design that was being featured. I found it difficult to get any perspective of relative dimensions or the overall feel of the design from simple line drawings and floor plans. Perhaps a better book for someone more familiar with architectural drawings than for someone just starting out and looking for inspiration.

For anyone reading this who hasn't heard it, it has been tailored for the 90s R&B/Rap audience who without noticing followed Puff Daddy's massive career throughout this era. The remix basically involves rap verses from Pras (from The Fugees) followed by a \\"chorus\\" by Sting singing the main parts of the original \\"Roxanne\\", accompanied by extremely \\"Contemporary R&B\\" strings. I personally really enjoyed this remix and think that people take it way too seriously in defending the original song. If you are a modern R&B fan (or like 90s R&B) you are likely to love this as I do. If you are to take any remix of a Police \\"classic\\" seriously to the point when someone can't remix it, please do not buy it!

There's lots of talking but very little action. If you can manage to stay awake until the end, at least you can watch the killer chase a naked blonde around. The plot is just like every other slasher film made during the late 70's/early 80's except that THE DEMON is memorable for one thing -- the killer wears a glove with blades on the fingers (years before Freddy Krueger made it chic!). The worst part of the movie watching experience is that the DVD is presented full-frame (not widescreen) and the print that was used to make the transfer was extremely dark. Watch John Carpenter's highly superior HALLOWEEN instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have enjoyed it more if it were not so dark.","review":"For the amount of money I spent on this film about 3 dollars and 88 cents it wasn't that bad. I enjoy horror films and I'm a sucker for low grade B horror movies. The film kept my interest enough but during each of the murder scenes I couldn't see a darn thing. The transfer of the film was decent during scenes that were filmed during the day and when there was a significant light source. But when it was dark it was almost impossible to watch, and the killer always killed at night and in the dark. This is a problem that seems to happen often with old horror movies from the 70s and 80s that are not transfered well. As far a the film itself goes it was not that horrible I've seen worse. It was a bit boring in the middle and it ends a little abrupt. I wouldn't recommend buying the film for anymore than 5 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"70's slasher film..","review":"briefly: basic slaser low-budget film from the 70's. I agree with several reviewers in that much of the film is too dark. You have a hard time seeing the actors faces or their movements. The lighting of the film could have been better.the plot is serviceable: a psychic with a military background is hired by a couple whose young daughter has disappeared to track down and find their daughter or the killer. Also nearby two grade school teachers who are friends are also being stalked by the same killer.The characters were interesting, but there wasn't much in the script for them to do.if the film were re-mastered and \\"cleaned up\\" digitally, it would earn another star from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY MEDIOCRE SLASHER MOVIE","review":"the demon has a few good moments, but not nearly enough to make it notable. The story (I think), deals with some kind of killer dispatched by evil/satan to murder women. The intro is awesome. the killer runs up to this house, then puts a strangulation bag on a mother then abducts the daughter. the father comes home just in time to save the mother, then runs out into the nearby woods an hollers \\"where are you, you bastard\\" (or something like that). the rest of the movie has cameron mitchell \\"a military psychic\\" on the case. all of the middle part of this movie is really boring, and the murky, dark transfer makes it impossible to see whats going on. The killer appears as a guy with a shadow over his face, in white makeup, and also in a white rubber mask (sometimes, all at the same time) which gives him a nice surrealistic quality, Luckily, I got this cheap on a slasher movie collection, and so should you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one can hear you scream in the dark","review":"I've never seen a movie shot \\"night for night\\" so badly -- this movie is dark and nothing can change that. There are many night scenes where you can barely make out anything at all. The day (or lit) scenes can be surprisingly colorful. The beautiful Zoli Marki is about the only reason to see this train wreck. Cameron Mitchell shows up to utter some stupifyingly bad lines (as some else mentioned: \\"He's less than a man. But more than a man. So much more than a man\\"). Wow -- bad. And despite the fact that the plot makes no sense, the killer/demon's mask appears and then disappears and is not relevant at all, and despite the fact the guy can kill with his bare hands but prefers plastic wrap, and despite the fact he can kind of phase in and out yet at the same time can be held up by doors ... the real sign of a bad movie here is they run out of music during the end credits. Skip it or rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Seller","review":"I have owned Lampe Berger's for several years and have learned that they need to be \\"cleansed\\" with the Neutral scent (which does not have a scent and can also be mixed with other fragrances to tone them down).

I requested a return but learned that because I had opened the product that it could not be returned due to its flammable content. I then requested that they send me another product, and since I already ordered Neutral from another provider (not a part of the Amazon \\"family.\\") that I would like them to send me Patchouli. Once again, they told me that I couldn't return it because of its flammable contents. I've gone round and round on this issue and have not received an acceptable product.Unfortunately, I will never do business with Touch of Europe again.

It more less focuses on all the breeds, rather than a few. It has very nice photographs that make you feel as if the dog was only a few inches away from the graspe of your hand. The photographs cover a large variety of the breed's traits.......some are puppies, some are females, while others being male or long or short haired. The information, on the other hand, was not as detailed as I had expected. The information that was provided was interesting and even in some instances helpful to me, but if you are wanting to learn a great amount of information about one type of dog, I would reccomend not purchasing this book. But, once agian, if you just LOVE dogs and are wanting a great resource of pictures, this book would really suit you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pictures of the dog breeds were fantastic!!","review":"I think that this is the best dog book that I have seen yet.

It's still worth reading because she shares the genuine love and affection many of us feel for John Paul the Great. But she drops the ball in chapter eleven where she tries to deal with the alleged lapses of the pontificate of JPG. She asserts that the liturgy got dumbed down during the watch of JPG--that's clearly wrong: the liturgy was already reeling well before 1978 when JPG became Pope. As to the sex abuse scandals, we get more heat than logic. Fortunately, our current Pope is already applying logical solutions such as the recent document barring homosexuals from ordination. The book is good, but it has its limits. Overlook the limits and enjoy her reminiscences about our common spiritual father. May he rest in peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Paul the Great","review":"Peggy Noonan has writtten a remarkable book about a remarkable person. Amongst the world of giants, John Paul is a Titan.

Peggy Noonan has accomplished that his memory will live to posterity."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book","review":"I picked this up on the spur of the moment (I don't usually invest $25.00 in a brand new hardback!), but, oh, was it worth it! Ms. Noonan's wonderful style makes it feel as though she's speaking to you personally and the thought her passages inspire make it seem as if you've just had a very grown-up and thoughtful conversation with a good friend about faith, religion, and modern life. I just wish it had been longer. Perhaps she'll follow-up with a book on Pope Benedict? One can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Noonan Autobiography","review":"I think this book was one of the most awful biographies I have ever read for the same reasons so many customers think it's wonderful.When I purchased this book, I thought I was getting a biography or portrait of Pope John Paul II. That is what the title suggested. I knew I would get a little personal Peggy Noonan as well. The truth turned out to be just the opposite. This is a spiritual self-portrait of Peggy Noonan and her religious journey. This journey is told in the context of the Pope's life and offers biographical tidbits here and there. But if you want to read about Joun Paul, this book will disappoint you.If you want to read a sugary-sweet, highly emotional and personal portrait of Peggy Noonan that has heavy doses of Roman Catholic apologetics, then this book is for you.If you want an informative yet laudatory account of the Pope's life, I highly recommend Tad Szulc's superior biography instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing, Quick Read","review":"This was the first book I read by Peggy Noonan and it definitely won't be my last. Noonan is very honest with her writing. She speaks what is on her mind and talks about the good and the bad concerning the Church. This book was very refreshing and I had a hard time putting it down because Noonan writes as if she was just having a conversation with you.

I then read all of the reviews on this set and almost everyone else had this problem, i returned it right away.

My husband started watching it with me and we both loved it. It is about 3 sisters who come to the realization that they are witches (the charmed ones). The series comes packaged in a book which contains the DVDs and looks like the Book of Shadows from the series.

Boy was I wrong. My wife was so excited on Christmas morning to receive this set. I was holding my breath as she began watching the 1st season. Didn't make it through the first disc without problems. At least 8 of the disks have visible damage, either by glue or scratches. I'm not sure why, but I requested a replacement from Amazon. Hoping to be able to put a set together before returning orginal set. If that doesn't work, I guess it will be a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Collection!","review":"Charmed: The Complete SeriesA great series in a wonderful package. The Book of Shadows though smaller than what appears in the show holds many hours of magical viewing entertainment(Not only the DVDs but the excellent art work). When I read about some issues with the book's glue for the disc holders I was really not sure if I wanted to purchase or not. However let me just say that I am very glad I did. Out of 49 DVDs only 7 had minor glue spots, which I am told can be cleaned up easily with some CD cleaner(Test soon to come). Only downside I can see is that I will most likely purchase a CD case. Simply because the paper sleeves you slide the discs in will scratch the DVDs with time and multiple use.Respectfully 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was SOOO disappointed","review":"I love the series, loved the idea of the Book of Shadows but like others have said the DVD's were covered with glue.

Product defect I believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Some of the Episodes don't play; some don't play all the way through. I don't know if this was because of the company that produced this product or if the original files were subpar. A few of the episode menus were actually in a different language (it's a region 1 product). And some of the menu titles don't match the actual episodes and the verbiage on the back of the box is misspelled. Is the product successful? Yes- you get to watch almost all of the episodes from eight seasons of the TV show Charmed. Does this product meet the standards of a regular DVD release- NO and not even close to the standards of a \\"Boxed Set\\". As a side note- the CD Sleeves isn't even glued to the binding. The felt covered box is a nice touch though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed Limited Deluxe Edition is AWESOME!","review":"This has got to be the BEST complete series offered. The packaging is so unique and looks like the real Book of Shawdows. The pages are thick and have beautiful pictures from the show and replica pages right out of the Book of Shawdows. The presentation is first rate all the way and worth every single penny! The discs are held firmly in place on very thick and heavy cardboard. I've never seen such quality and I own well over 100 tv seasons of various shows!!I have but one complaint or warning to those of you that haven't purchased this yet. 95% of the discs were scratched. Some lightly, some pretty bad. However, I notified Paramount and they took care of replacing the damaged discs for me. Just be warned of this. It's still worth every single penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I have read a number of complaints about the packaging flaws on this item, yet I was naive enough to believe the issue was likely to be fixed by now. Buyer beware...that was not the case. Not only was the packaging glue stuck all over a number of disks, most of the disks looked like they had been used as toddler toys. Bran new disks should not look like they have been slid across pavement. Some even have chips in the edges! I didn't have much trouble getting the disks to play at first, but at about season 5 I started having all kinds of trouble. I have had to skip about 10 episodes because they simply will not work in any player of any kind. Of course, by the time I got to that point, it was too late for me to contact a seller with a complaint or do anything about it. I have a hard time believing these disks were bran new when the series was recorded on them. I would have to be a fool to think otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of the discs skip","review":"Love this show and love how all the episodes are packaged in the Book of Shadows.

We tried it on our 2 DVD players, the Xbox 360, and the laptop.....she even wanted to try to play it up in the car. I returned it....awesome UPS service and replacement from Amazon. It still won't play. We tried some of the other discs and found that they will play but they skip and usually the 3rd episode on the disc is the one with the issues. I guess I have to bite the bullet and get each individual season. Not as neat as actually having the \\"Book of Shadows\\" but at least we can watch the shows together......Love the show but it seems that this just is not a good buy.

Early Edition and Charmed being two of my favourites. Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is. I also happen to find Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano VERY HOT! Highly recommended. I have always just really liked the entire atmosphere in this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Manufactured","review":"Ended up returning it right away as there were quality issues.

The first disk absolutely refuses to play while the others freexes during various portions.For anyone who is considering to buy this I would siggest that u look for one that has better reviews on it cause this one is not worth the money.And unlike the other customers who had the privilage of returning theirs to get slightly better ones.

Unfortunately, I have become a victim of the GLUE issue that has haunted this set from the beginning. Several discs were marked with glue that cannot be removed, and several were also scratched because of the cardboard sleeves in the packaging! All attempts to remove the glue failed, and in fact only made matters worse! I have to admit that the \\"Book Of Shadows\\" packaging LOOKS very cool, but considering that the manner in which it is packaged DAMAGES THE DISCS, it is not worth it!

Imagine my surprise when my husband bought it for me for Christmas! I've worked in numerous video stores over the years, so my husband was confident that if the discs could be cleaned, I could do it. It's not something we should have to do, but if you want to skip the hassle of sending bad discs back over and over you can try this too. You can clean off the glue with a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol. Use a soft cloth (like one you may use to clean eyeglasses) to wipe the discs down. No, it won't get rid of the scratches, but I've found in my experience, the scratch has to be pretty deep for a disc not to play. Otherwise, some minor scratches won't hurt the playability of the disc. I'm now on the third season and, knock on wood, I haven't had any problems yet. I'll re-review after I finish the series.

Followers of Fay Weldon's tragic/comic chronicles of dour domestic bliss will find the author again coming through with wry.Living in London with her husband, Spicer, and their two children from former marriages, Annette Horrocks appears to have everything any woman could wish - her first novel will soon be published and she is expecting a baby. But, in true Weldonesque fashion, this idyll unravels.Possessing a sharp eye and an equally sharp pen, the author seems to have more of a following among women than men. That should be the case with Trouble, yet Weldon surprises as it isn't only a woman's story.The author of some twenty novels and short story collections, Weldon has the ability to make the banal sharply bright and everyday experiences stand out in bold dramatic relief. She's not a sexist - she skewers the foibles of both men and women with equal aplomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just how stupid is Annette?","review":"Apparently so stupid that she ignores her own health care to the point of tragedy.

My friend Miss Elliott, hates this book because she feels that the boy took everything from the tree to be selfish. She has dubbed it \\"The Taking Boy.\\" I totally disagree with her because the tree was happy to give. When the boy wants money, the tree gave him her apples to sell in the city for a living. When the boy needs a house, the tree gave him her branches to build one with. Although a tree can't live without her branches, a person can't live very easily without a house.

I'm a big fan of most of Silverstein's other work, and I think his heart was probably in the right place with The Giving Tree, but when I have kids, I do not think that this book will be part of their collection. Where The Wild Things Are, now there's a children's classic about unconditional love."},{"rating":"1","title":"I find this one really scary!!!","review":"For me, this book is about being so incredibly selfish that you would kill a friend to get what you want. It also seems to be about giving until you're dead. I fervently disagree with both of these sentiments!! I'm a little worried by all the reviewers who gave this book a \\"10\\". What are we teaching our children by reading this book to them? Thank goodness my two childrens' response to this one was confusion, and then, a dislike for the boy who never says \\"thank you\\". I would not recommend this book to anyone and would go so far as to suggest to parents that they keep it away from their children. I have actually taken to calling spineless, wimpy people \\"trees\\" because of this book. We should be teaching our children respect for themselves and the world around them . . . not blatant disregard and abject selfishness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Childrens Book I've Ever Read","review":"I am mystified as to how anyone could actually like this book, or read it intentionally to their children. It is truly awful. If you're interested in teaching your children life lessons using horrible, depressing examples, this book is for you. A selfish individual abuses and exploits an unselfish individual to death, then relaxes by sitting on her corpse. I would love to hear a psychologists take on the anger, resentment and passive aggression simmering beneath the surface of this ugly tale. There are many positive ways to teach your children about the value of gratitude. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of exploitation","review":"This book reinforces dangerous gender roles - self-effacing, self-deprecating martyrdom of women/mothers and selfish, borderline-abusive behaviour by boys/men.

A Main Selection of the Despoilers' Book Club: NOT printed on recycled paper! Perhaps parents feel that this story conveys how much of themselves they are willing to sacrifice for their children.

As the male takes and takes from the giving female in the story, she remains forever forgiving and accepting that her role is to give without question or limit. She is used, abused, sliced, dismembered, and finally cut down (read: killed), only to powerlessly allow the male in the story to continue to take and abuse. In a final insult, the man sits on the stump and somehow the reader is told that the (dead) tree is \\"happy.\\" This story, may seem like simply a \\"happy\\" tale at first glance to many parents, teachers, and gift givers, but it is a masogynistic metaphor for thoughtless deforestation and violence against women."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of \\"tree\\" are we discussing here?","review":"Christina Anne Roden \\"Amazon music critic\\" (New York, NY) - See all my reviewsA female martyr figure allows herself to be literallty chopped limb from limb by a brutally self-centered male who relentlessly victimizes her, without so much as a \\"thank you\\", from boyhood through old age.

In my opinion, anyone who gives this book to a child -- especially as a purported life lession -- needs to have their heads examined."},{"rating":"1","title":"We need to think more about this book","review":"The Giving Tree, seems like a lovely book and many people are not critical of it because it is tied to fond childhood memories. However, The Giving Tree is far too much about giving up everything for someone else at one's own expense. It is not a good lesson for children that everything they need will be given to them by someone who loves them, even if it means that person must lose part of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treacherous message beneath a pleasant surface","review":"Put me with the vocal minority who had a profound negative reaction to this story. I admire Silverstein's children's poetry, but I don't at all admire this book. The relationship between the boy and the tree is an amazingly accurate metaphor for an abusive relationship. One side is endlessly giving and in the process is destroyed. The other is endlessly taking but never manages reach any kind of satisfaction. I seriously doubt Silverstein intended this parallel, but it speaks clearly to me. It's not an image I'd want in the mind of a son or daughter of mine as he or she grows up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be retitled.","review":"\\"The Codependent's Almanac.\\" That's what the title of this book *should* be.Don't get me wrong - I am a big, big fan of Shel Silverstein. I appreciate his creativity and his willingness to touch on ugly subjects and to question authority. I just can't help but wonder, though, whether he really meant this to be a children's book.Seriously, though, where does the \\"unconditional love\\" thing occur in this book? It's not the kid - he's as selfish and self-serving and materialistic as they come. It's not the tree, either - if she had *really* loved the kid, she wouldn't have let him mooch off of her and would instead helped him to build his character. Who of us would want our daughters to allow herself to be taken advantage of in this way? It's just not healthy, no matter what the relationship is - parent, friend, or otherwise.No, this is not a children's book.

Yeah, I suppose the book could be viewed as an allegory, but I think that's stretching it.This book is about taking advantage of and cruelly neglecting the one thing that sustains you and unconditionally loves you. It isn't a delightful tale, and it sure didn't warm the cockles of my heart. The Giving Tree is depressing and shows a parasitic relationship at its worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"lonely tree","review":"this is an endearing tale of friendship, life and death, and what happens in between. it is truly a heart-warming story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mother's Perspective","review":"I am a student in English Education and I was on campus with my three year old son. I sat on the floor of the bookstore and read this book to him. By the time the boy cut off all of the tree's limbs, I was quietly weeping. Several people were listening and one woman was crying as well. When I was finished and closed the book, one young man thanked me. The simple words and images of this story moved me (and my listeners) beyond what I can describe.To me, Mr. Silverstein's book illustrated some of what it means to be a parent, to give and give and give... gladly, until all is consumed. It is both a guide and a cautionary tale. To give is beautiful, but it can devastate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well of generousity from Silverstein and the tree.","review":"I have loved this book growning up, and continue to be touched by the incrediblegenerosity shown by the tree to the boy.

Not recommended for sensitive children.","review":"I read this book as a child (circa age 6 or 7, maybe 8) and I could not understand WHY the boy was so mean and hurtful to the tree, or WHY the tree apparently didn't mind being killed and used. I just couldn't understand it. The story made me sad, and even angry. As I became older, I could see what the author was (maybe?) getting at - entirely selfless love and selfishness...both are not good paths to take. However, I don't think that pre-teen kids can really get this message, especially sensitive kids. I honestly think this is a book for teens or adults, not kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"This book continues to shape the person that I am. I had it read to me frequently as a child, read it as a child, and have read it as an adult. I look forward to the day that I have children of my own so I can read it to them. I have found that this book is one of the simpler (and more beautiful) ways to understand the cycle of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have given this book as a gift many times.","review":"One of my favorites. This is such a touching little story, one that I'll admit can make even a grown man a little teary. I've read it to several nieces and nephews of various ages, resulting in the most interesting discussions about gratitude, giving, love, etc. There are so many levels to The Giving Tree that it can appeal to adults as well as children.

An awful message for young children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let kids think!","review":"Critics of this book opine that it is hardly fit for a child, with it's ambiguous tale of a tree that serves the demands of a very selfish boy. Treacle stories replete with affirmative messages and happy endings is what we normally expect for younger children. That there is no pat moral explicitly included in The Giving Tree, is to me, it's best feature. Parents needn't worry that there is no lesson to be learned--though it isn't propped up for readers--there is. With a little reasoning, children are usually able to grasp the tragedy in the tree's generosity. This is a different kind of children's book, and parents should be responsive to the reaction it stirs in their little one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh for the simple days!","review":"Favorite childhood book...

The Giving Tree had always loved a boy and the boy had always loved it back. But as the boy grew older, he couldn't or wouldn't play with the tree like he would have before. Although that may have upset the tree, it always gave the boy whatever it could. \\"The Giving Tree\\" is a must read book for everybody. Anyone would love this book because it shows you that sharing and loving are very powerful, and even when you have nothing left to give, you can still make somebody happy. This story was one of the best books I have ever read. I think it deserved more than just five stars.

Most of whom seem to find this an exercise which merely attempts to validate abusive relationships. Why give and give to those who keep taking? Why?We take the other side of the coin: Unconditional love. This is NOT a story about the boy. This is a story about the tree (the mother, the father, the wife, the husband, the whoever who has the strength to wait, to know, that love may not change anything . . . but it may . . . it MAY).But an opinion is just that. To those who found the book a validation for abuse, we sincerely thank you for making us re-examine our own point of view, even though we did not agree.Either way, definitely worth reading yourself . . . and then deciding if it is appropriate for your children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about giving (duh)","review":"This story is great. It almost brings me to tears every time I read it. It makes me laugh that the people who dislike the book think that it is misunderstood. We understand. We know what it is like to love someone so much that you would cut of your \\"branches\\" for them. We know what it is to love someone so much that just being with them makes you happy.

This story would only be tragic if the tree decided not to love fully and unconditionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its A Wonderful Book","review":"I like the Giving Tree it's a wonderful book.

This was the only feeling I had about the book, until as young adults, distanced from our loving giving parents due to our ungrateful natures, a co-worker and I realized we had both hated The Guilting Tree.

A child who eventually takes all that his friend, the giving tree, has to offer. The tree is eventually reduced to a dead and decaying stump that no longer has anything left. Yet, even in its death the man/boy still leans on the tree's corpse. It is a cold prickly disguised in a sticky sweet warm fuzzy. Read it if you must, but do not be fooled.

I had a sickening feeling as I closed the book for it more portrayed an abusive, codependent relationship without proper boundaries than a healthy, mutually respectable one. I feel it is important that we as parents (I am also a mother of three) have good boundaries with our children, because we are teaching them how they must be themselves. If we want them to have proper boundaries with others, we need to show them how it's done by having them ourselves. There are a few other Shel Silverstein books I would recommend, however. The Missing Piece Meets the Big O, in particular, and, a little less so, its prequel, The Missing Piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which one are you?","review":"Some of us are the tree, some of us are the boy, some of us have been both, but most have been something in between.

She cried the first time I read it when the boy cut the tree down.)I was a tree to someone once. I gave and gave and was never fully appreciated. Many years later, there is a deep regret for the both of us. Children may love this story as just that, a story about a boy and a tree. But most adults who have been in relationships will sadly see themselves as one or the other.Regardless of what many people have written here about this book, I think it's beautiful.

It's for young readers, and I think it can really teach the young readers who read the book (or listen to it if someone reads it to them) about morality and loyalty. If you are interested in art, it might also interest you.It is about a boy who loves a tree. They hang out together, and play. Then the boy grows up. I won't tell the end because the \\"review guidlines\\" say I shouldn't, but also because I love reading books, and I get mad when someone tells me the ending of a book.

I understand the part about unconditional love, but it seems to be more about inappropriately using natural resources without regard to the consequences. The boy makes bad decisions throughout his life only to come back to the tree to get them fixed. Sounds more like a tale of a dysfunctional family that should be looked on as a morality tale than a tale of selfless giving.The tree is a parent that never holds their child accountable for their actions and the boy is a self centered dolt who never takes responsibility for his choices in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful story with an equally awful message","review":"This book stinks. It is about a tree who loves a selfish little boy unconditionally. The tree gives and gives until there is nothing left to give.

The message: \\"Give, give, give until nothing is left of you but a shriveled stump. Take, take, take as long as you find a willing giver.\\"I would not recommend this for any child of any age. The fact that it is still around after 40 years is amazing.

I had never heard of it before. It is very sad. I'm not sure what would be a good age for the child to have this book read to them. The parent would have to judge that. One suggestion I would have. The author looks like a mass murderer on the back cover. I would definitely cover that page, as a parent. As the author-have a new photo taken.

She's in college now, a beautiful young woman who is non-judgmental, knows how to give from her heart, and understands my unconditional love for her. Shel Silverstein wrote this on many levels, one of which is spiritual. How often, every day, do we take from a power higher than we are, and find ourselves not satsfied with what was given. This is not only a children's book, but one that needs to be on the bookshelves of many adults. It brought my kids back to nature and the meaning of life.

I loved it when I was little, and it honestly makes me cry now that I read it to my daughter. They even have it in Spanish (I'm not sure that it translates all that well, though)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Simplicity, Taps into the Deeply Human","review":"There's not really a \\"plot\\" in this story in any traditional sense. It is a series of vignettes in the relationship between a boy and a tree. The symbolism is pretty straightforward, the tree representing parental nurturing, but there is nothing trite about it. This illustrations are simple black-and-white line drawings. Somehow this simple book really packs a punch. All I can really say is that I have never once, ever, in dozens of readings, whether alone or to the kids, made it through this book without crying. It's simply...touching.Further Comments: Silverstein was one weird, scary-looking dude. If you're interested in very idiosyncratic people, Google him and you'll be surprised. He has several other children's books with which I'm only vaguely familiar (I remember Where the Sidewalk Ends being on the shelf at my grade school, but I'm not sure if I ever read it. I think it's a collection of poems). I'd love to see some of those reviewed.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giving Tree Revisited","review":"When I first read \\"The Giving Tree,\\" I was a preschool teacher. Even then, I became teary-eyed well before the end of the book.At the time, I wasn't sure why the book stirred such emotion in me. I assumed the message was clear. Back then, I thought Silverstein was talking about unbalanced friendship and typical human nature.When I became a Mommy six years ago, I realized that my initial interpretation was way off base.Now, as my own six-year-old daughter reads the book to me, I choke back the tears.In Silverstein's terms, my daughter is still swinging from my branches and climbing my trunk.However, I cry at the thought that soon, she will be resting in MY shade, selling MY apples and, eventually, chopping down all that is left of ME.And, yes, after every visit she makes to my weary old bark to take whatever I have left to give, I am truly happy :)Silverstein, as always, is a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about using and dependent.

I threw it in the trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only like whats cold or hot,I spit out what is lukewarm...","review":"It is interesting to see the split reviews for a book like THE GIVING TREE. While some condemm the book as ''evil'' and ''depressing'',others describe it as ''haunting'' and ''beautiful''. It is the story of a tree's love for a little boy,and his acceptance and respect of the tree. But as the boy grows older,he demands more from the tree and forgets how to love her. This is seen by many as a symbol of nature and how we abuse it. It is seen by others as as a message not to let those you love take advantage of you. Whatever Silverstein's original intention,the split reviews of this book contiue to come out,and will,for countless years to come.RATING:A"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book","review":"my daughter is only 2 but this is her favorite book. she loves to hear the story and look for little details of the pictures (like finding the boy's feet hanging from the tree branches). it may be unusual for a 2 year old to sit through a book as long as this, but i'm glad that i didn't wait to read it to her until she was 4. she asks to read it every night. i love it, too. it's a beautiful and touching story that brings tears to my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unselfish love","review":"I find the story the Giving Tree to be a tale of unselfish love.

One reason I liked this book is it was really funny when the boy was swinging on the branches.I also liked the book because the tree let the boy cut down her trunk to make a boat.I think my mom and dad would like reading this book. I give this book five apples because it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible message?","review":"Those who say children should not read this book obviously never read it as a child. I was loved the story, as much as I was saddened by it. The goodness of the tree and the selfishness of the boy really touched me.

Even as a preschool child that message went right home to me and I've never forgotten it.

The boy and the tree have a friendship that lasts over a lifetime. The tree gives the boy all that he needs, and she is happy when he is happy.

After I read it, I wanted to throw up. What kind of person would find any redeeming value in such a sadistic tale of unmitigated greed, violence, and destruction?She turned out to be a criminal. I was one of her victims. Not to say that every child who reads this book will grow up to become a felon, but this story certainly appears to encourage people to take advantage of their friends and then destroy them. Fortunately, I managed to stop that parasite in her tracks. She won't be taking anything more from this tree.As I write this, I imagine her sitting in prison somewhere...probably reading THE GIVING TREE aloud to her fellow inmates."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie but a goodie","review":"I was looking for a book for my niece's birthday.

The book arrived in great shape and of course I had to read it before I wrapped it. The words so simple but the message so meaningful no matter what age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, yet gives a lot in the words","review":"This book is about a tree who smiles at the boy's pleasure. When the boy was young, he climbed the tree's trunk, play swing on her branches, and eat apples. But when the time has passed, the boy grew older and spent times out rather than to play with the tree. When the boy came again, he asked for money, a house, and a boat. Tree did her best to make the boy happy, but in the end, the tree was no more than an old stump.In my opinion, I think the giving tree is like your parents. When you were young, they play with you and take care of you. However, when they grew old, they become no more than an old tree stump when you don't visit them. I think this book is short, but has a lot in the words."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing","review":"My 2 cents: I actually remember being disturbed by this book as a child. Hadn't thought about it in a long time, but I actually felt a little upset and a little confused by the story. Seems to me the boy murders his best friend and then after killing it uses the body too. Who is the tree? I don't know, but it is a generous, loving being. The boy takes advantage of it as much as he can. This book doesn't deserve to be read anymore and children are better off not hearing this sad tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving Tree, Rotten Boy","review":"Many people love this book. I remember having a Sunday school teacher read it to us when we were little. Even then I thought 'That boy does not deserve or appreciate that tree's love'.

To me it was a story in which she gave and gave and he took and took until she had nothing left."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book I grew up with","review":"Was so glad to see they are still making this book and I love the new edition. A great story with a great message that works on a couple of levels, depending on which way you want to take it.For the age group, I think it's a good way to teach about unconditional love. Yes, I know there are other interpretations of this book and you may be subconsciously teaching your kids that it's ok to have no boundaries or something, but I think at this age, you can spin it in the way that you want it and work out the finer details later. Focus on the good and leave what you don't like at the door.

It is so sad and that little boy is so selfish that I was totally shocked. It made me cry. Who the heck needs a children's book like that?

Make sure you read this first before you read it to your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Humanity","review":"This book is in no way, shape, or form a children's book. I bought it for my five year old, thinking it sounded like a good book. It depicts a spoiled, rotten, brat who can only think of himself. It shows the worst of humanity and doesn't depict the bad behavior as being wrong. To me it says that the destruction of our enviroment is not only OK but acceptable. I would not reccommend this book for anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly sad & distressing","review":"This book demonstrates so many inappropriate behaviors and attitudes; it is hard to know where to start to criticize it.Teaching little boys they are the center of the universe and all the worlds resources are theirs for the taking is a horrible lesson to teach. There is no sense of consequence; its all about me me me.The tree is female and boy is male & he sure mutilates her and she thanks him the whole way until she is a dead stump. I shudder at this imagery and wonder what little girls get from this on how available to meet others needs they must be. Yuck.Someone mentioned the tree is mother & the relationship with her son is co-dependent. I guess that is one more nail to add to this dated aweful book. It still gives me nightmares.I wouldn't ban it but I'd add a 20 page discussion text after it to see if there could be some redeemable value. Perhaps using it for kids old enough to be able to have complex moral conversations."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star or 5 there is no middle ground","review":"You pick up the Giving Tree. You read it. You are touched. You think to yourself, this is a wonderful book! However, as you are finishing the last sentence, something starts to bother you. What was the moral of the story? What was it? you think to yourself. Is it, that you must give your all to the person you love? Is it that you should sacrifice everything you have to them? This train of thought becomes troublesome, and one of two things happen: 1) You realize that the book teaches a horrible lesson(or leads the reader to it unintentionally) or 2) You squash the bad thoughts and tell yourself that moral doesn't matter, and the story is about love, and don't think about it any more. Then you get on Amazon and write a 5 star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to find any positive message","review":"You can squint, you can stare, you can read it over and over but any positive message in this book will still be hard to find. I usually read the book before reading it to my niece but I didn't do so with this one. I wish I had. I felt like stopping half-way through the story but I hoped it would get better. You can explain it to a child in a certain way but you can't escape the negative undertones of this book. It's sad and depressing. It seems like it's teaching that it's ok to keep asking for more and more and to never be happy with what you have. Adults could understand the meaning but have fun trying to explain it to a child. I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disturbing sexist fable.","review":"This enormously popular book has a boy taking and taking and taking from a tree as he grows up, until he has killed the tree to make his house, and as an old man is reduced to sitting on its stump. And the tree is happy to have him sit on it?If the tree weren't always referred to as female (\\"she\\" \\"her\\"), this would be an upsetting enough book, suggesting that nature is there to take from without giving back. But since the tree is written as a woman, the moral is that it's okay to take and take and take from a woman to the point of destroying her, and she's supposed to be happy if you eventually come back to her when you can't enjoy life's other pleasures.Am I the only one who finds this incredibly disturbing in a children's book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This story is morbid. Many people recommended it and I bought it for my daughter. We read it once and threw it away. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura Reviews: The Giving Tree","review":"The Giving Tree has been on my bookshelf since I was 12.It's a simple story of a boy who visits a tree that is genuinely always there for him. The tree gives him shade when he is tired; as the boy grows older and becomes a man, the tree gives him its branches to build a home. The tree gives him everything it has until the boy becomes a very old man and needs only a stump to rest on. Which is a good thing, because the tree had nothing left but the stump after the boy took everything, so it all worked out in the end.The Giving Tree is about relationships, compromise, and real love for another. Whether a friendship, a romantic relationship or a family, Silverstein offers a lesson to everyone, in less than 150 words, of how when we give to each other from the heart, we get back exactly what we need. Relationships are not complicated; they are simply a two-way street.Check out my other reviews at: http://laurareviews.blogspot.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Depressing, Awful, Cruel","review":"I purchased this book thinking, \\"Hey, I'm a good parent who reads books to her child...I should get this 'classic' that everyone loves so much.\\" Thankfully I read it myself before reading it to my 2 year old.

I almost felt like crying after seeing the way the tree was abused by the self-centered, greedy kid who never showed any gratitude for all the tree gave to him. It disturbingly gave me the idea that this was a metaphor for a married couple where the husband beats and neglects his wife.

Selfish & ungrateful - YES!","review":"I am with the minority of reviewers who thinks the selfishness of this boy to take and take and take without gratitude or returning the favor is appalling!

Because of my background and the number of children that I have, I have been gifted a few copies of this very popular children's book. It makes my skin crawl. This book is on the reading list for my childrens' school. When I read this book with them, I have to stop and lecture my children on what a true friend is. If a friend is willing to hurt you (aka cut off your branches only to later hack off your trunk) to make themselves feel better then you need to cut them out of your life asap.

It is one of the most disturbing and ridiculous books that I have ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my grandkids!","review":"Children don't need to get the impression that unqualified love is about one being sacrificing everything - right down to life itself - for the other's convenience.

The tree keeps giving and giving until it is a stump. Readers talk about that the tree simply wants to receive the happiness of the child/man, but in my eyes it is a one-way street. What does the boy/man give to the tree? I cannot see how this story teaches the lesson of giving and receiving. Being fond of nature I can see how the story illustrates how humans take advantage of nature as a resource (keep taking for one's own advantage). I am aware that people will not like this review since it seems like a lot of readers were brainwashed with this book as a child and perceive it as a fond memory. I can relate to that aspect.

He did much the same for me as a young child being read to by my grandfather, and I hope he will do the same for my children.Oversimplified reviews aside, \\"The Giving Tree\\" doesn't present us with the fairy tale version of generosity we've come to expect, and thus is shocking to an adult audience. I always felt that the lesson in this book was in the great sadness you feel for the tree - a perfect symbol of what people so often abuse and take for granted. Nature gives and gives, asking nothing in return, and then it's all gone. If it saddens you, then you're inspired to give back, and not become the boy in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I got this book for my son, he loves it.

Not only is he always selfish and grasping, the tree is given a female gender, thus teaching boys to devalue women, and girls not to value themselves. It is a dangerous message.

I found absolutely nothing heartfelt or tender about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion as a new mom","review":"I've been reading this book since I was little and now that I'm a new mom this book means more to me. I had to give up many things in my life(art school, internships, being young, the next 18 years of my life to raise my son, etc.) to have my son but I don't regret giving up those things because he means the world to me. The tree has sacrificed herself so the boy would be happy and even though she wasn't happy at times her love for the boy had never changed. All parents sacrifice for their children but their children will never fully understand what their parents have done for them until they become parents themselves. I read this book to my son every night and hope that one day when he's old and has kids of his own he'll read this book and understand that even though I had to give up my life for him, I don't regret a thing and only want him to be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hanging tree","review":"This book was enjoyed by our 5 year old Grandson, but not particularly a good choice his paarent said.

The mother gives all she has, unconditionally for the most part, to her child. We wouldn't call that abuse.We call it Mother Nature and Mother Earth, so wouldn't it be fitting that the tree be gendered as female? And, for the most part, when this was written, it was \\"a man's world.\\"Personally, I think this Shel Silverstein's little social commentary can be quite thought provoking for an adult and open up a dialect with a child about helping others.OR maybe we're over-analyzing. :c)"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Teach a Child to Take\\"","review":"After reading this book and reading a few reviews from customers, I had to respond. This book is not one I would give any child. This is unconditional love? Love without conditions? Giving children permission and approval to take regardless of the outcome of others just to satisfy their own wants and needs is a life we want our children to live? The message is quite clear..\\"you are entitled to whatever you want whenever you want, at any cost to anyone else. Just be happy and take, and make certain there is nothing left of the person giving\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This book should be called the worthless human male. This is a terrible children's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giving Tree","review":"I am quite sure I would have given this book a very favorable review if I had ever received it, but since it has been almost two months since it was ordered and I have yet to get the book or a refund, I'm afraid the review is going to be quite bad. Maybe I should do a review of Amazon and Woody's Books instead of the book The Giving Tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giving Tree that was not gotten","review":"Never got to see the book. I had originally purchased it with a Christmas gift certificate. Never having been on Amazon.com before I joined the special book club thinking I was going to get free shipping for the books I had ordered using the gift certificate. No such luck. They arbitrarily split my order into 3 packages applied free shipping to one and charged for the other two. And then 1 of those shipments got lost in the mail.That was this book \\"The Giving Tree.\\" According to subsequent e-mails from Amazon.com it was later found and re-sent; and then the order was cancelled and a credit was restored for me to re-use my gift certificate (before the expiration date). Oh, wait a minute, this was supposed to be a book review. No book,just bad service."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giving Tree","review":"I think this book is great because it show me how the kids are starting to grow up and they doesn't like the same things that they used to like when they were little. The kids turn to adolecents and they are interest in new things every year.This book also show me how the tree gave the boy all his needsand wants because the tree wanted him to be happy. I relate this with the \\"parents\\" of each kid, because they always give us what we want and what we need to make us feel happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"40 years and alot of wasted trees.....","review":"I too find this book disturbing, even down to the author's photo on the dustjacket which makes him look less friendly and sane than Charles Manson. The story starts out well and then turns into \\"The ungrateful s.o.b. and the co-dependant tree\\".I'd like the story better if the tree was used to make the ingrate a coffin soon after he reached young adulthood in the story.I find the sad tree and the ungrateful boy story to be unsuitable for bedtime reading for my children, and I find the whole story disturbing myself. I don't buy children's stories so I can analyze the deep hidden meanings intended by the author. The book would be better read by a co-dependant horticulturist than children, and I just feel there are better books out there for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzling...","review":"I had never heard of this book until I was a freshman in college, 14 years ago. My literature professor read it aloud to the class. It put a lump in my throat, but it also confused me. If this were a children's book, what message was it trying to convey to a child? Possibly that unconditional love is an amazing thing. Unfortunately, this book seems to teach an exploitation of that love rather than a appreciation and a reciprocation.I don't have children yet, though my husband and I are talking about starting a family. This really isn't a book that I would want to read to my future youngsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful, awful book about selfishness and ingratitude","review":"Let me make this perfectly clear: adults think this is great b/c they identify with the selfless, sacrificing, giving tree. If you know children, you know that they identify with the young boy and not the tree. His role is to take from the tree, and then come back to take and take some more - without gratitude or giving back. Only his \\"taking\\" endures. If you listen to children tell you about this book, you will know I'm right. Please skip this book; Shel Silverstein has so many wonderful others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't give it to a child","review":"If this book is supposed to be ironic (as some critics opine), it's a miserable failure, given the number of readers who take it literally and label it \\"inspiring.\\" If it's not meant as irony, I find it frightening: real love means you give and give and give, even if the person you're giving to is thoroughly self-centered, takes your generosity for granted, never tries to see things from your point of view, and doesn't even bother to say \\"thank you.\\" \\"Love your neighbor as yourself\\" implies that your love of others is grounded in respect for yourself. Neither the tree's behavior nor the boy's is worthy of emulation, and I would never give this book to a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moral?","review":"This is a story about one pathetic tree, and one mind-bogglingly selfish boy. I'm shocked that anyone thinks this is a good book. The only moral I could find in the story was that it's a lesson about what happens to your dignity if you refuse to say \\"no.\\" That tree had no idea when to cut its losses, and there's nothing redeeming about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-analyze THIS!","review":"My son enjoyed this book when he was around 3, but now i just can't bring myself to read it to him anymore.As he has gotten older and we feel it is important to teach him the value of doing for himself, this book teaches all the wrong lessons.I find myself editorializing as a i read it the last fews times, like \\"GET A JOB!\\"Growing up we had a beloved Grandfather that gave to all and loved unconditionaly. I will take that lesson to the end of my days, but as a i got older i also realized he was taken advantage of.Saying \\"no\\" to those you love, is also giving."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dependency Tree","review":"This wasn't a noble giving tree. In giving to the boy-man at every opportunity, the tree thought it was doing right. Instead, it created a dependency relationship in his human friend that lasts his whole life and that leaves both impoverished. This is not a quality one would wish for a friend, and even more so, for one's son or daughter entering into marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Shel Silverstein books ever","review":"This book is terrible. What makes it seem even worse is how good the Poetry books by Mr Silverstein are. My kids hated this book because the basic story is that the tree is willing to die for the kid. The kid is seen by my kids as a spoiled brat who doesn't appreciate the gifts given to him and the tree never learns. ARRRRGGG! We are not tree huggers but the one side \\"love\\" is not a healthy relationship between kid and tree. Skip this book and buy the poetry books. Those are worth owing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be re-named The Selfish Boy","review":"I am the biggest fan of Silverstein, except for this book. The tree gives and gives selflessly and the boy takes and takes. The tree is abused by the boy in a sense, and he just takes it. It's not a message I would want to send to my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Masochistic Co-dependent Tree","review":"I had to add another one-star review. This book makes me angry. I don't think kids have the sophistication to think about the relationship depicted in the book in much depth, at least not without the help of an adult, and I don't think most adults even think of this book beyond thinking generosity and self-sacrifice are good, so what's not to like? True, but blindly throwing oneself under the bus for someone who doesn't deserve it and is only exploiting you is foolish, damaging to yourself, and damaging to that other person. I'd be more inclined to use this book as a tool to teach pre-teens about exploitative relationships and respect for human dignity, both their own and others'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfish, Heartless - Not for kids","review":"This book is about a selfish boy who takes advantage of the kindness of the tree. Needed to do some damage control with my 6 yr. old stepdaughter who was reading this book to make sure she understood what was wrong with the boy's behavior. Glad to report, stepdaughter said she would have brought the tree water and never cut it down. There are so many wonderful children books -- I can't believe this one is still in print. It's heartless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not like the message of this book","review":"I never liked this book as a child - I felt so bad for the tree and thought the boy was very selfish. Now that I am a mom and always looking for good children's books, I have re-read it, and I still feel the same. This is not a book we'll be adding to our child's bookshelf. Not a message we want to share with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"tear jerker","review":"Try reading this for the first time while pregnant and see a psychiatrist if it doesn't bring tears to your eyes. This is a good story to help anyone of any age to better understand life."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift!","review":"This is a wonderful story that I believe every child should hear.

As I read this book, tears came down my cheek that I could not cry until the boy in this book loved the Giving Tree. This little tale had a life story that I needed to hear and feel. I have since given this book to people dear to me who are mourning a loss of a parent. If you don't know what to say, this book will tell a man or a woman of any age, the great tale of unconditional love. I cannot tell you how I love and cherish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorite Stories!","review":"I loved this story as a child and now my daughter loves it too!!Its a great little story about a tree that loves a boy :)I would highly recommend anything written by Shel Silverstein to parents everywhere :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Opportunity to Teach","review":"I've read many of the points that people have made. A child who's been read this book won't suddenly turn into a selfish monster. A simple childs book doesn't have the power to do such things. There will be many other books in your childs future that you won't be able to hide away. Now's the time to teach your child how to analyze and question all things. The first thing my son realized was that the boy just took and took and we were able talk about that. This book could be used as a learning tool to open the doors of thought... or you could just read something more realistic like...Cinderella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Silverstein - Heartwarming Classic","review":"A heartwarming tale of the lifetime relationship between a boy and a tree. Teach important lessons of relationships to people of all ages. This is a must-have. It still touches my heart every time I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Intriguing Book","review":"The first time that I read this book, I was 6 years old. I cried. I am now 63 years old, and I still cry each time I re-read it. It sits in a place of honor on my bookshelf. I have heard all the myriad of interpretations of its meanings - is unconditional self-sacrifice a good or bad thing? what about unconditional love? - but I try not to delve too deeply into any of them. I simply appreciate it as a beautiful story of a lost childhood and forgotten love, simple yet eloquent and heart-rending. Anyone who is not touched when they first read this story is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Children's Book Ever","review":"If I could own just one children's book for my daughter (and I own more than 300), I would choose The Giving Tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading for all ages!!","review":"Not only does this book teach children (and some adults) that to give is better than to receive, it also reminds us of the boundless limits of love. Hats off to Shel Silverstein for creating such a beautiful story. Not only do I read this to my children, I also have given copies to friends and family to read to their children (or themselves)."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOCUS ON LOVE NOT SELFISHNESS","review":"Despite others who seem to believe this book is about a selfish little boy, it is truly about an unselfish tree who loves unconditionally even after it is cut down. The tree as a Christ-figure and the boy as a representation of humanities selfishness? Probably. The point is that we need to love unconditionally, even when we are cut down, and not become bitter and selfish ourselves, but to keep on GIVING AND LOVING."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is a must-have","review":"I think this book is a way of learning about friends and the true meaning of love for someone else. Silverstein has a way of expressing it in a way that al ages can understand in. I enjoyed reading this book. The tree is a good example of a good reliable friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavily overrated.","review":"This book is boring for my children, and they are huge book-lovers. It is geared more for adults. It should not be a children's book. It's an adult's idea of what a children's book should be. The story contains no real substance. My children never ask me to read this book. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Giving Tree","review":"I am VERY disappointed in both Amazon and the supplier for this book.

I actually think that the message is harmful to parents, who seem to think that the more they sacrifice, the better. Can't you do right by your kids and still be a human being?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Message","review":"I suppose I malign \\"The Giving Tree\\" at my own risk, but here goes. The message in the book is not one we can afford to give our children (or adults) anymore. Our environment is suffering such serious degradation from our taking (its \\"giving\\"), and a book like this only reinforces a selfless, limitless idea of nature where the environment can give and give to support not only our basic needs, but our greed and needless desires, without real life consequences. The message is great, but the the vehicle used to convey it is no longer appropriate for a nation and world that needs to wake-up to what's happening on this small planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Story of O\\" for Children","review":"Why any sane person would expose young children to TGT is beyond me. We received it as a gift a few times when my daughter was small. I just threw them all out.As far as I can see, the only thing that can be said for \\"The Giving Tree\\" is that it has been teaching sado-masochism to tots for forty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"selfish and sexist","review":"This is a horrible childrens book. It's about a friendship between a tree and a boy. However, the boy always takes and the tree always gives. At the end the tree is nothing but a stump and yet it still has something to offer the grown and aged boy. This book teaches kids to just take from a friendship. Also, it is a very sexist book. Why is the tree a she? This teaches young girls that they should always give and never receive and that they will still be happy. Is this really what you want your kids to learn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Back Cover","review":"I love the book, I just want to know whos decision it was to put the scariest possible picture of the author on the back cover.

The art style made characters way too cartoony and 'zanny' and attempted to be cool and hip. Yuck. i doesn't work for me.Chuck Dixon keeps a nice brisk pace to the story. The problem i found with story was it centered too much on Superman. John Greystoke did nothing in this story. It's more of a Superman story and I bought it being a Tarzan fan.I just bought this book yesterday and read it in about 15 minutes.

And we will not only get a better version of Silver but his heroic rider as well as Tonto and Scout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, But Not As Good As The Others","review":"Sounds of Blackness is well known for R&B/gospel hits such as \\"Optimistic\\" and \\"The Pressure\\" as well as many Negro spirituals. The group's first 2 CDs were the ones that brought them the most fame. In their third CD, \\"Time for Healing\\", they somewhat stray away from what they usually sing. It is possible to mistake them for a straight-out R&B group. There are great hits like \\"Hold On (Change is Coming)\\" which is my personal favorite. They also do remakes like \\"Love Train\\". I really wish that Ann Nesby was on this CD, but she decided to go solo. Oh well. That's how the music business is, I guess! Even though the group loses many great things that they had from the other CDs, it is still a great one, and I recommend it to any Sounds of Blackness fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through The Wormhole","review":"I could sit for hours just to listen to Morgan Freeman.

(I'm not sure how they get off calling it total body, considering it's a leg-lift video, w/about 24 total pushups and some crunches.) I bought this DVD b/c I wanted an introduction on video to pilates, and based on the other reviews, I expected it to be great. After purchasing this and spending [$$$] on the resist-a-ring, I was expecting a really good workout. Not only were the exercises and the video boring, but the workout could barely be called a workout. This is probably a good video for people who are just beginning to work out, don't belong to a gym, and just want to do very light exercising. I did not even see the majority of the poses and moves that are discussed in The Pilates Body by Brooke Siler. As far as the resist-a-ring, I felt like I was using Suzanne Somer's Thighmaster!

The photos look like Xeroxes, circa 1970. This is the worst book of photographic reproductions I have ever seen and I can't believe the powers that be at Da Capo are so hungry for profit that they would issue this garbage with their name on it.

If the price is the same, I have a preference for Parker Labs--nicer tube, cleaner dispensing, less mess--but only marginally so. Tac Gel does the job just as effectively.

Still, this is a good selection of songs from his early and later career. It hits the spot when you want to hear a range of his stuff without mixing something yourself. The Roxanne remix (by TAFKA Puff Daddy), however, is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE and I have no idea why they bothered with this.Get this album if you can find it at a good price. True fans will need a box set, but this is a good place to start for everyone else.Hope this helps and good luck finding what you're looking for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this...","review":"This is a very very bad best of CD..

The hearing-impaired? Seriously - if you're thinking of buying this, I'm willing to bet that there's probably one song that you reeeally reeeeally want to own. Do yourself a favor... look around and locate either \\"Every Breath You Take - The Singles\\" or \\"Fields of Gold - the Best of Sting\\", and whichever one contains your magic song, buy that instead.

Even though most of these songs are 20-25 years old, they are still works of art.Most of the major songs are on this album. Some are Sting after he disbanded The Police, and others are of the band itself.The majority of Americans have probably heard several of these songs. In case you haven't or if you weren't alive in the 1980s, they are well written and are great for easy listening. The only one on this album that I don't care for is the Puff Daddy remix of Roxanne, as I thought it ruined the song. All the others are awesome. I would list my favorites, but I realized that I liked almost all of them. If I had to choose my top three, it would be nine, ten, and eleven.People of all ages should be exposed to this music.

Two great sets of music on one disc, but no. Despite including the same front man, The Police and Sting are just too different. They produce a completely different mood. When I'm in the mood to listen to The Police, I am not wanting to listen to Sting and vice-versa.

I had to scrub my dishwasher, run vinegar through it twice AND use a dishwashing cleaner before the nasty white residue was MOSTLY removed.

It coated the walls, door,racks, and silverware basket with a caked-on residue, some of which will not come off. Worse though is that it has coated the insides of the spray arms and water intake pipes in the dishwasher and left dried crystals of soap inside the spray arms that results in soap crystals deposits in glasses and on dishes after 2 rinses. I can not use heated dry because that makes the crystals bake on. I've run over a gallon of vinegar through the washer and spent hours spraying vinegar straight into the spray arm holes to try to dissolve the residue with little effect.

So, I'm wasting water and that's not quite ECO-nomical or ECO-friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"As other reviewers have said, I bought this because it is supposedly eco friendly. We usually use a different eco friendly brand. But I saw this at a really great price and decided to buy it. HUGE mistake. It leaves a disgusting white residue all over everything. My 8 yr. old even complained that he could taste soap in the glass he was drinking from. I took a drink and sure enough there was a soapy taste. The directions say to fill all dishwasher cups full for a washing. I barely fill one cup and I'm left with this horrible residue and glasses with soap still in them. Even the inside of my dishwasher is covered in a white film now. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"White residue over everything","review":"Since this product was the same price as a non-eco-friendly detergent, I thought I'd give it a shot.I wish I'd have stuck with the regular stuff. This leaves a white powdery residue over everything! Ceramic dishes, plastic cups and baby bottles, silicone nipples, metal silverware... I tried more detergent, less detergent, but it leaves it every time. So gross. I had to rewash everything by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Class action lawsuit.","review":"Given the disturbing amount of people who have used this product and had the same terrible issues, we should form a class action lawsuit against the company. I don't know what they put into this stuff. But it is damaging to the dishwasher. It completely ruined some fine dishes. Great Value brand soap left some residue but barely. Cascade is still number one. Palmolive is garbage. I took some and squirted it into a pan to try and wash it by hand. This stuff not only did nothing at all for the dirt. But it left an obnoxious odor that wouldn't come out. I took Dawn dish soap and scrubbed with a pad. Rinsed it, and the smell was still there. Normal soap doesn't do this.STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"No film here, but not all clean either","review":"I did not have the issue with film that others reported, but only half of the dishes got clean. Peanut butter does not come off the knives and if there is any food product or grease on the dish, it's still there when the cycle is over. So, the glasses that had juice or water were fine and the dishes that had cereal or toast crumbs rinsed off were clean. The rest had to be re-washed. Which is not very \\"eco.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best detergent","review":"This is the only detergent we've found that rinses clean in our dishwasher while still doing a great job of cleaning the dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product has ruined our 1 year old dishwasher!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This product should be taken off the market as it gums up your dishwasher so bad your dishwasher doesnt work at all with soap scum everywhere. After several rinses with vinegar it still has the soap scum. We have been washing our dishes by hand and may have to buy a new dishwasher!!!!!!!!!Yes I am very upset about this product as we never had any problems using Cascade."},{"rating":"2","title":"No white film here.","review":"I have been using Palmolive ECO for several years and I have not experienced the white film so many talk about. I do wonder if it has something to do with the water in certain areas. I live in the St. Louis area and our water is excellent. In addition we also have a water softener, which we installed a few years ago, but even before the water softener we did not experience the white film.I do LOVE this product. I was having such a terrible time with etching of glassware that I tried any and every \\"green\\" dishwasher detergent out there, but none were good at actually getting my dishes clean. While Palmolive ECO is not completely \\"green\\" it is the only phosphate-free detergent that I have tried that gets my dishes clean, AND I have not had an etched glass since.Again, no white film here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going to go out of my way to never by from Palmolive again.","review":"This product is absolutely terrible. It doesn't sud at all. It smells like bleach not lemon. And yea- like everyone says- it leaves residue everywhere. They must have gone out of their way to make a product this bad. Gives eco a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST THAN AWFUL!!!

I went back to Walmart and got their extra large size Cascade with Dawn & lemon scent dishwasher detergent again which I NEVER had a problem with... ever!!!!!!!!!!!!THREW OUT ALL (3) BOTTLES I PURCHASED HERE!!! BEST TO LIMIT LOSSES! I LITERALLY HAD TO REALLY, REALLY, REALLY AGGRESSIVELY SCRUB OFF THE WHITE FILM LEFT ON MY DISHES, BOWLS, GLASSES, ETC. MANY, MANY, MANY TIMES TO GET THE WHITE SCUM OFF LEFT BY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!PS) I HAVE A WORKING WATER SOFTENER..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I used this product for a while, until i noticed that it was coating certain portinos of my dish washer near the drain hole and the detergent dispenser with a hard white crust that doesn't wipe off. I stopped using it as soon as i noticed, but it's taking forever for this stuff to wear off, and bits of it come loose at times and clog up the dishwasher's drain, which i then have to unglog by hand. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco Friendly yes, product does not perform","review":"I have to agree with the majority of the reviews on here, I purchased this detergent in hopes of doing our small part of saving the environment. However, the product consistently leaves white residue and minimal food stains behind (that other detergents can knock out). I give this product one additional star simply because it is eco friendly. As a dishwashing detergent it is terrible, the question you must ask yourself is doing you want to save the environment or your dishes? The research I conducted about detergents with phosphates states that phosphates increase algae production in fresh water. I was under the impression phosphates were destroying our water systems, thus I should have conducted my research prior to purchasing this product. I will be purchasing a different detergent next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use only if you love white residue!","review":"I had the same experience as all these other people. Palmolive Eco Gel left a white residue all over my dishes, which was very hard to get off. I have never had this experience with any other dishwasher detergent even though in the past I haven't been particularly picky about what I used. Believe the bad reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"S-U-C-K-S","review":"Any and everyone do yourself a favor and listen to all of these reviews. I too thought it was my dishwasher so checked every cycle- no problems, water temperature- no problems, etc., same issue with everyone else with the white filmy residue left on all dishes, silverware and glassware. Palmolive should either take the appropriate steps to make this item efficient or remove it from it's inventory altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaves tough white film on dishes","review":"Suddenly our dishes had this nasty white film on them. I had no idea what was going on, since the BF is the one who does the dishes. Good thing I checked Amazon for reviews so we didn't spend money on fixing our dishwasher! However, now our dishes have this stubborn white film that can't be washed off completely, and forget about the grooves and engravings on the silverware... I think those will be gunked up forever! We can only hope that the 4 times we've used this in the washer haven't actually caused damage to it! I really wanted to move towards \\"eco-friendly\\" products, but not when they don't work! Now I've learned to seek out reviews of these eco products first before I waste my money and potentially ruin appliances! Back to the Cascade, I guess..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do much.","review":"I got this along with Cascade Complete to try in our new E-Dishwasher (uses less water). It really didn't hold up compared to Cascade as it didn't really dissolve any food and you pretty much couldn't have anything on the dishes to get a clean load on the first try. I wouldn't bother with this as it doesn't get any praise from the people I gave it away too as well with thier high water use dishwasher :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Greatest!","review":"This does not clean well at all. It left residue on my dishes and food still stuck to them...and I pre-rinse everything really well before putting in the dishwasher and I still had not so clean dishes. I would not recommend this product. My dishwasher and dishes even starting smelling stale and not so fresh after using this for about a week...it never had with any other product. Never using it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$","review":"This product needs to be taken off the shelf! What a waste of money and time. Don't they test this stuff before selling to consumer? This product leaves a white gritty residue and dishes are not clean. You have to rewash everytime. I switched back to a non \\"eco\\" product and am happy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh god......why.......","review":"My dishwasher is running with this Eco gunk in it as I type this. I randomly looked up reviews for it and now I'm horrified at what I'm reading. I used this stuff a few months back and did indeed notice a very bad white film on ALL MY DISHES AND POTS that WILL NOT COME OFF. I had no idea what it was or if I should be worried. I switched to Cascade and it didn't take the residue off so I had no idea what it was. And stupid me bought this Eco junk again at Walmart not putting 2 and 2 together that THIS is the crap that caused my white nightmare. OH LORD WHY! WHY!!!!!Well, when this cycle is over I am going to do what others suggested with the white vinegar and I'll update this and tell you if it works.UPDATE: Well the vinegar didn't work. NOW WHAT?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Do Not Purchase!!!!!","review":"It claims to be \\"ecologically friendly\\", but how can this be when you have to run your dishwasher 3 EXTRA times to try to remove the white film that it leaves? On top of that, you have to drive (your non eco friendly automobile) back to the grocery store just to buy some real dishwashing liquid. This is exactly what I had to do.I almost never leave product reviews, but this product deserves one. It is a complete waste of money and time. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a one star product....","review":"Stay away from this product! It leaves white buildup on all my dishes, glasses, cups, forks, ect. I wish I could rate this product with 0 stars... Do not waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever!!!!","review":"This is the worst dishwashing detergent I have ever used. It left a thick white chalky substance on both the glass and plastic and plates. I called the company and they did send a refund for the product they suggest that I used it wrong...huh? Then they told me to run white vinegar after to rinse off the chalky stuff, why would I do that I'll just go back to sunlight. I got this one because it is suppose to help the earth. I will look for another brand and also I do NOT have hard water or excessive minerals. Just don't want another busy mom to have to rewash all her dishes by hand in vinegar, life is just to short. They should take this off the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narration flows right along","review":"This author knows how to write. Completely fascinating story, told at a good level of detail, covering 50 years in 400 pages. One weak section, toward the end. Overall, strong.I don't know oil, don't know Arabs or the Muslim world. This book gave a good historical perspective, a sense of how we got to this crazy place we're in now. Saudis cozy with our Texan Prez, Iraq in chaos, Osama hating his country (Saudi Arabia) and the foreigners who (he thinks) corrupted it.The book lacks depth in covering Bedouin society. You get that it's REALLY different, but you don't get a comprehensive picture of how Saudi's are. Aside from that, there's not much wrong. Excellent material, well told. ****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating story, poor account","review":"Brown's book suffers from a lack of good editing; accounts are out of sequence and disjointed, whole paragraphs are repeated and participants confused.

I got this frying pan recently and in 50+ years of cooking have never had a pan do what this one did. Had it on my smooth cooktop, was heating garlic in oil and heard a crackling sound. I thought the bottom was wet. I wiped it off with a paper towel. Also, when it heated it buckled and rocked on the cooktop and again, after extreme \\"cracking\\" noise I picked it up off the heat and found the bottom of the pan had begun to literally crack OFF (you know that ring design you see on the bottom)the pan.

This Sunset Express abridgement is poorly abstracted from the book and read miserably by David Stuart. The abridgement's text focuses on maudlin romantic relationships. The various voices Stuart pretends to interpret are not realistic, and Cole (the protagonist) sounds like a young school boy.

After reading the first 1/4 of it, you'll know 'whodunnit', and basically how they did it. Anything that's not explained by then isn't terribly interesting anyway.

I really like Crais as a writer, I like Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. However, I hate that Elvis has and is involved with Lucy Chenier. In my openion it takes away from the books. It was the same in Voodoo River and now this one. In fact this book was nearly half over before I thought it got down to the business at hand. Cole is hired by a high priced Attorney to find out if Angela Rossi, a detective, planted evidence against his client. Cole not only finds out but proves who did the killing and who actually did fool with the evidence. I liked the character of Angela Rossi and Ray Depente was brought back for a few pages. I hope both of these are in future books but Cole and Lucy together, I can do without. Cole and Pike are compared to Spence and Hawk and I agree but I don't think Hawk would have missed getting the shooter behind the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemingly decent story but basic, simplistic writing","review":"This is my first (and now last) Crais read.

The book's layout is rather confusing, and the information is not laid out in a logical manner. Headings and sub-headings are not apparent and do not follow a natural progression. Seems like the book was put together with a cut-and-paste method! The text is about as dry as a well-done pot roast. Good bedtime reading!The primary purpose of map making is to guide the reader's eye to areas of importance, and to get the information across to the reader in a concise, interesting, and elegant manner.

But as all baseball fans know (as well as major league baseball officials know) as the New York Yankees go Baseball goes. To Try and argue that the Red Sox of 1975 ( a losing team who did not win a world series title) pulled major league baseball out of its dulldrums is a farce. The New York Mets of 1969 did much more for Americas love affair with major league baseball than the Red Sox of 1975 could imagine.

This video is actually several routines on the same DVD. I didn't like any of the routines or the instructors (I wasn't sure if one of the instructors was actually a woman or a man in drag).Overall, I found the quality of this video extremely poor and outdated, especially when compared to the Firm DVDs that I already own.

Although I enjoyed this book very much it seemed to end too soon. In Ms Clare's other two books the plot took a little longer to unfold with much more investigation and back tracking after going in the wrong direction with several different suspects. This story figured out who was the suspect and then the rest of the story was how to nail them. Not a lot of mystery in that. I must say I was happy with the developement of Frank's and Gail's relationship and glad to see Frank's character moving on with her life in the right direction. I look forward to the 4th book and hope we won't have to wait too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant fan of Baxter Clare","review":"I became an instant fan of Baxter Clare and her character Lieutenant Franco from the very first line of the book.

Unfortunately the artwork could best be described as amateurish and worst of all the profiles are anything but accurate. The inclusion of a small number of b&w; photos (all of which have appeared in other, much better books in the past), only serves to highlight the innumerable errors (font of letters, location of markings, etc...).I bought the book on sale (60% off) and still felt ripped off.

But even more ridiculous: the notion of a memoir in which the author \\"made stuff up.\\" Why did she have to do that? Because the truth wasn't interesting enough? In truth, even this exaggerated memoir isn't interesting enough, in large part because Kyle Spencer is too young to be writing a memoir and because she takes herself way too seriously and thinks way too highly of herself. Her delusions of grandeur are embarrassing to read. (\\"I pictured myself leaping onto some carpeted auditorium stage, preparing to accept the third consecutive Pulitzer of my young career.\\") And her writing is just plain bad. (\\"I thanked Susan B.

After analyzing the book, I realized a little movable wheel that turns with a picture matching one of the pages in the book. On this wheel a number was shown.

Any hope of improvement as the film continued was abandoned as the final credits rolled.Do yourself a favor and give \\"Return of the Native\\" a miss. Better yet, check out more faithful and worthy Hardy adaptations by the peerless BBC, such as \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\", and \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\" (a particular favorite) - all amazing films that I can say enough about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very, Very Poor Rendition of Hardy's Story","review":"The director and script destroy both the insightful plot and character development of Hardy's brilliant novel. Where Hardy describes Wildeve as \\"one in whom women find nothing of which to object and in whom men find nothing to admire,\\" Clive Owen's intensity and over-acting destroy the character and characteristic aloofness of Hardy's ambivalent and ordinary Wildeve. And compared to Hardy's complex and nuanced Eustacia, the Eustacia of the movie is revoltingly unprincipled and unsympathetic. It is difficult to imagine that Gold has any understanding of Thomas Hardy or the Late Victorians. Gold would have done better to direct a Harlequin Romance. The only things this film has in common with the novel are its title, character names, and location."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"very disappointed in this production, though it had two of my favorite actresses (joan plowright and celia imrie). the remainder of the cast was very sub-standard, it seemed very low budget and it also looked like catherine zeta-jones wears dentures. sorry, but this was very off-putting and added to my disatisfaction. it in no way captured the haunting writing of thomas hardy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere along the way...,","review":"between making this movie 10+ years ago and getting cast as the co-lead in HBO's current series \\"Rome,\\" Ray Stevenson (Clym Yeobirght) learned to act.

Completely pointless details are emphasised too much (Eustacia supposedly being a witch comes to mind), whereas important plot details are lacking. The woman cast as Thomasin neither resembles the character in Hardy's novel, nor ever truly becomes the suddenly \\"practical woman\\" she is depicted to be as a result of the plot.

The maps are incredibly accurate, even for areas far from city centers. My only complaint is that the interface does not behave the same as it does when looking at the built-in maps of North America. Many cities, for example, do not appear until the map is zoomed-in on the region, and only then does the map for that area load and zooming out is again possible. Before I discovered this trick I was under the impression that very few metropolitan areas were covered. Only after zooming in to the neighborhood level did the right panel load, and it was possible to see the full layout of that country or region.The map also seems very recent. Some streets we did not expect to find were in fact on the map, so there is little to complain in this regard. I was also happy with the price.

So, when I heard that he had released \\"Lock and Load\\", I was excited for the comedy, and also hoping that it wouldn't be too marred by song. Well, all I can say is that it gets rather annoying to sit with my finger on the remote control so I can skip over all of the stupid music and non-stand-up bits. I only grant two stars becuase the actual comedy is pretty funny.

After I read all those reviews where people were saying Leary is the greatest standup comedian ever, how funny and confronting he is, I had to say something. Sorry, but I've got a newsflash: the guy was a blatant thief, a pale imitation of THE greatest standup to have lived, the late Bill Hicks. Bill once said of Leary: \\"I stole his act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did.\\" Leary had the taste to rip off Bill Hicks, but Leary didn't have the grace or talent to be funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I thoroughly enjoy listening to Dennis Leary rant and rave about life.

B. Hicks.","review":"Is there some funny material on this CD? Yes (though it's not as strong as \\"No Cure For Cancer\\"). The problem is that much (if not all) of Leary's material is stolen from other comedians. His main source was, of course, the late, great comic Bill Hicks. For proof, pick up Hicks' CDs... your respect for Denis will plummet instantly. Unfortunately, Bill died many years ago, thereby making it impossible for Leary to steal additional jokes. Perhaps this is the reason for the decline in quality on this title.

Hard to explain how something can have you laughing one minute, and saying \\"Hmm....\\" and sniffling the next... what a roller-coaster ride.

Personally since we all learn differently, I must admit I prefer the language tapes that have a native speaker say a phrase followed by the phrase in English.

That is a totally inadequate way to judge it, however. Well, now, after numerous viewings, I have to admit that if Goodfellas is a 10, Casino is a 9. The plot is suberb and De Niro and Pesci are as perfect in this film as in any other. Interestingly, the hatred one feels for Sharon Stone's character may be the best proof of the diamond (intentional plot reference there) performance she puts forth. Unbelievable. The cast is superb and this is one of Martin Scorsese's finest productions.

Every single movie Robert De Niro has been in, he awlays gives the fans an excellent performance. Sharon Stone, was great, although a little to great in a couple of scenes.

I've contacted Universal and have been told to return the defective disc to them, along with a detailed explanation of my problem. I imagine that the company will send me a replacement, since they did replace two defective discs from my Abbott and Costello collection (took about six weeks to get them).

Being the brains of the operation, the bosses know that Ace must need muscle to protect him and take care of the dirty work. Everything seems to be running perfectly well until beautiful hustler Ginger (Sharon Stone) Walks into Ace's life. This film brought Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci and master director Martin Scorsese back together with famed writer Nicholas Pileggi (Wiseguy, basis for the 1990 mafia hit Goodfellas).

Heck, I almost threw up after seeing his eyeball pop out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must OWN HD DVD!","review":"Though its over 10 years old, the picture of this HD DVD looks as if it was filmed recently in HD! It also includes WBs bookmarking so you can create custom bookmarks and favorite scenes! Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro do a fantastic job displaying Mob activity in 70's Vegas Casinos in all of its HD Glory! Universal has done a stunning job with the HD transfer and 5.1 sound. Start your HD DVD mob collection right with Casino and Goodfellas on HD DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD for a great movie","review":"If you already own the tape, don't bother buying the DVD. The quality is sub par and with all that surrounded this movie you would think that there wouild have been some extras. There is nothing. Hopefully someone will come out with a SE version."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"GoodFellas in Vegas\\"","review":"The first hour of \\"Casino\\" (1995) represents Martin Scorsese at his best - a mini-masterpiece of cinematic bravado depicting the inner workings of a Las Vegas pleasure palace. Unfortunately, once you get past the dazzling semi-documentary introduction, the remaining two hours become a tired self-parody of the director's earlier crime films. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone cannot redeem a disappointingly melodramatic script by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. In the end, the ambitious yet overlong \\"Casino\\" fails to pay off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Video for A Movie This Age","review":"Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.The video was very good, but not excellent compared to new movies on Blu-Ray. I was far from disappointed. The audio was DTS-HD Master Audion 5.1, but most of the movie was dialog. The movie is about 3 hours long, and is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Another Scorsese/Deniro blockbuster.Many actors from the \\"Goodfellas' fame make this film a bloody, sickly humorous and edge of your seat crime drama. If you have \\"Goodfellas\\", you MUST get this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Gangster Film","review":"This is another great gangster film. It follows Ace Rohestein and Nicky Santoro and there rise and eventual fall in Las Vegas. This is a great gangster flick, the first hour plays as sort of a documentary about how the gangs influenced las vegas and the corruption that went on. The next two hours show how Rohestein and Santoro eventually fall. So next time you want to watch a good movie, get casino. Its a sure fire crowd pleaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great mobster movie...4.5 stars","review":"I've been a huge Scorcese/DeNiro fan since 'Taxi Driver', and love all of their movies. My favorite gangster movies of the last 30 years are Godfather I & II, Once Upon A Time in America, Goodfellas and this movie. I put Goodfellas at #1, and Casino at #2.Watching the talents of Scorsese and DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods in this film is a truly enjoyable movie experience. Acting just doesn't get any better than this. In particular, Sharon Stone surprized me by going toe-to-toe with these three acting heavyweights. And she never blinked--she held her own and was outstanding.Before I saw this movie I was worried that it would be an inferior Goodfellas II...it's not. It stands tall on it's own.If you liked 'Goodfellas', then beg, borrow, or rent this movie today!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Casino is a great movie - it really lets you in on 1970's Las Vegas. Also featuring great acting performances by DeNiro, Pesci & Stone, the plot & charactars really come off as believable (this much can not be said of 90% of other movies made in the 90's). The animorphic widescreen transfer is far from perfect - there's lots of dancing pixels - but since it was transferred in 1997, it's excusable (it's not bad by any means). The audio in inexcusable, as they should have called it \\"5.1 channels of MONO.\\" If you're looking for extras, you're not gonna get them; only the trailer & cast bios are present. Poor DVD treatment for one of the best movies of the '90s. This one gets 4 stars for the movie alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, lousy DVD!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this movie! However, the disc simply WILL NOT play when it gets to a certain point. I've become very frustrated with Universal and their crappy DVDs. Like a previous reviwer mentioned, BOYCOTT UNIVERSAL until they can fix this problem!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a picture !","review":"I mean that statement in two ways. First, in my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest. This is better than Goodfellas by a wide margin. All of the regulars give awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't stand!). If you like mafia pictures, this is the BEST one to own. I also mean that it's a great picture due to the fact that it's on HD-DVD. The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television. It's almost 3-D ! The extras are ample, but I'd say adequate. That's the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. There is the obligitory commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes. It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae ! I do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running. This and Batman Begins are the reasons you should own an HD DVD player ! Note: I have the HD DVD drive attached to my Xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Mafia movies of all time","review":"If you like Mafia movies, you'll love Casino. If you don't like Mafia movies, this is still worth seeing just for the stellar acting job of the entire cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic - Viva Las Vegas","review":"Classic Vegas gangster movie. Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci almost guarantees that it'll be great - add an Oscar-worthy performance from Sharon Stone and you have one of the greatest mob flicks of all time. Based on the true story of Sam Rothstein, a great bookie, the story covers his rise and fall in pre-corporate Vegas. Interesting story, great acting and some classic lines - what more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything was perfect! Just perfect!","review":"When I first opened up the package, I saw that everything was just 100% perfect! It had everything, including the booklet, and the disc was completely scratch-less! So just one word for this order: PERFECT!!!!!!!!!! Thanks again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay Scorsese; I forgive you.","review":"It's not Goodfellas. It never had the potential to be Goodfellas. I've read the book and it was long arduous reading, just liek this film is long arduous viewing. Almost identicle team-up from Goodfellas simply makes you wonder if perhaps he was just looking for more praise and/or money. Cut it two hours and it might be tolerable. Note: I don't hate long movies just beacuse there long, I hate them if there long without content. I loved Magnolia and Gone With The Wind so don't even attempt to criticize."},{"rating":"1","title":"just another scorsese flick","review":"dont get me wrong this movie was cool, but it took a long time to actually get started"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie-Cheap Universal Format","review":"I bought this DVD about 3 weeks ago and have returned it for a third time because the format that Universal chose for this cool movie is horrible. I have had problems with Universal products before such as \\"The Abbott and Costello\\" Collection where the DVDs freeze up on my player. It is not the player's fault because each one that I have gotten to replace the defects have had the same problem occur in different parts of the film. I know from a documentary that I saw about ten years ago that Universal Studios was known as the cheapest hollywood studio and it seems that not much has changed. Be warned for those of you that already have this on the older DVD release to just keep it. I did not pick it up until this copy came out so I will have to keep trying until I find one that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever made.","review":"Violent, language...that said, most interesting, engrossing, story and characters.

The layout and features are extremely vanilla. Not since Dracula have I see such a vhs content type dvd. Maybe in the future it will get a proper treatment in a boxset but in its current condition this release shouldn't be purchased to accompany any collection.Also its important to note that this is not the uncut version. So far the only uncut version of this classic to make it to dvd is the Australian release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Scorcese, WHY?","review":"The film itself is great; everyone will agree on that.What bothers me here is the fact the film appears on an abhorable double-sided disc without a commentary.First fans had to suffer through the indignity of the DVDs initial release with a lackluster transfer, zero extras, flimsy case and a price that never dropped in the nine years the film was available on DVD. Now, if the studio wants to bother with a anniversary edition please 1.) pack it to the gills with -real- extras like commentaries, documentaries and maybe some sort of retrospective... not just a couple deleted scenes and a few other forgettable thorw-away scraps on an f'n flipper.But then again, who am I kidding, I'll still buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuity problems hurt \\"'Fellas\\" follow-up","review":"I am a big fan of \\"Goodfellas\\", although I usually watch my tv-edited version, with toned-down violence and language. Who needs that stuff? Because of this, I was eager to see the movie's sequel, \\"Casino\\"; I was full of curiosity to see what had happened to the mobsters since the last movie.My suspicions were immediately raised when I began watching the opening credits: no Ray Liotta. He was such a big part of the last movie, I was surprised he was neither included nor mentioned in this one. I was also surprised to see Joe Pesci included, since it didn't seem like he'd be around for the sequel, if you know what I mean.On the whole, while it feels good to be back with these characters again, the whole thing seems like a cash-in. I think I'll just stick with Goodfellas, and leave Casino to the real fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"to much filth","review":"I will keep this short. If you can't handle the f**k word every 3 minutes then don't buy this. I was amazed at how many times the word was used. It's not a family movie or for anyone in my opinion. The actual movie was okay but i could not handle the language. I grew up in the 60's & that particular word had started to be used in that era not in the 30's, 40's, or 50's. I gave it 1 star & advise anyone from buying this movie. The filth of the language destroys all that the movie creators tried to create....or not create!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Mob Movies Ever Mades","review":"\\"Casino,\\" much like the book by Nicholas Pileggi, depicts the underground world of skimming money, stealing money, and making money. It gives the viewer an incredilbe insight on just how much power the mafia had over Las Vegas in the 1970's. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci play two very well acted characters, based on two real-life mob bosses that knew and grew up together. If you've ever been to Las Vegas, wanted to go to Las Vegas, or heard anything about Las Vegas, you should definately watch this movie. A gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest movie of all time","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time. Yes this movie is even better than Goodfellas.
